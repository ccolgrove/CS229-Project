It is a [[registered charity]] and a member of the [[The Wildlife Trusts|Wildlife Trusts Partnership]].

==History==
Its origins lie in the [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] Naturalists Trust, formed in 1963.  In the 1980s the Trust was renamed the Gwent Trust for Nature Conservation, and then Gwent Wildlife Trust.  [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] was an administrative county between 1974 and 1996, covering a similar but not identical area to the historic county of Monmouthshire.

The Trust's first objective, under the presidency of [[Lord Raglan]], was the conservation of [[Magor, Monmouthshire|Magor]] Marsh, the last remaining area of [[fen|fenland]] on the [[Caldicot and Wentloog Levels|Caldicot Level]]. It was particularly responsible for survey work, training programmes, and increasingly in educational projects and in campaigns against inappropriate development proposals, particularly those affecting the [[Severn estuary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gwt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwentwildlife.org/|title=Gwent Wildlife Trust|publisher=The Wildlife trust|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 it purchased Pentwyn Farm at [[Penallt]], a unique smallholding, including ancient meadows and a collapsing medieval barn, having raised the purchase price of Â£150,000 within six weeks through a public appeal.  In 2001 it bought Springdale Farm near [[Usk]], containing {{convert|40|acres}} of species-rich unimproved grassland, {{convert|60|acres}} of other grassland, and an [[ancient woodland|ancient wood]]. It now manages 32 reserves, and has a membership of some 7,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwt&quot;/&gt;

==Current activities and responsibilities==

The Trust currently manages over {{convert|800|acres}} of wildlife rich habitat including working farms, woodlands and marshes. Projects such as wild flower meadow restoration take place on the reserves.  Its projects also involve reviving traditional countryside skills such as charcoal production  and dry stone walling. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiggive.org.uk/charity.php?charity_id=511%20%20Gwent%20Wildlife%20Trust%20at%20TheBigGive.org.uk|title=Gwent Wildlife Trust|publisher=The Big Give|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust currently designates four &quot;Premier Reserves&quot;:
*'''Magor Marsh''' ({{lang-cy|Cors Magwyr}}).  This is a {{convert|90|acres}} wetland reserve with a rich variety of habitats, including damp hay meadows, sedge fen, reedbed, scrub, wet woodland, a large pond and numerous [[reen]]s. It includes breeding grounds for [[Common Snipe]], [[Common Redshank]], [[Reed Warbler]], [[Grasshopper Warbler]] and [[Cetti's Warbler]].  It is the richest site in Wales for wetland [[beetle]]s and [[Stratiomyidae|soldier-flies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leaflet&quot;&gt;''A guide to the nature reserves of the Gwent Wildlife Trust'', leaflet, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the last remnant of fenland on the [[Caldicot and Wentloog Levels]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gwt&quot;/&gt; and its pattern of drainage ditches and other features has remained unchanged since the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.severnsideforum.co.uk/magor%20marshes.htm|title=Magor Marshes - a summary of ecological information|publisher=Severnside Area Forum|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/reserves/pages/magor.shtml|title=Magor Marsh |date=2008-03-08|work=South East Wales|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Pentwyn Farm'''.  This covers {{convert|30|acres}} high above the [[Wye valley]], with traditional farm buildings, small fields and stone walls.  It contains one of the largest areas of unimproved grassland in the area, and provides a habitat for [[dormice]], [[Ophioglossum|adders-tongue fern]], and many other species.&lt;ref name=&quot;leaflet&quot;/&gt;
*'''Silent Valley Nature Reserve'''.  This covers {{convert|125|acres}}, including Britain's highest area of beech woodland, together with wet woodland and flushes.  The reserve is managed in partnership with [[Blaenau Gwent]] County Borough Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;leaflet&quot;/&gt;
*'''Springdale Farm'''.  This covers {{convert|120|acres}} of working farmland, notable for its hay meadows and woodland flowers.&lt;ref name=&quot;leaflet&quot;/&gt;
