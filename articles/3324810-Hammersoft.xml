*The [[1985 NBA All-Star Game]] was played at [[Hoosier Dome]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], with the West defeating the East 140-129. [[Ralph Sampson]] of the [[Houston Rockets]] wins the game's MVP award. [[Dominique Wilkins]] of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] won the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest|Slam Dunk Contest]].
*[[Michael Jordan]] became the only rookie in NBA history to lead a team in four statistics (points, assists, rebounds, steals).
*The [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] relocated from [[San Diego, California]] to [[Los Angeles, California]]. This created a distinction where two teams of the same host name (the other Los Angeles team are the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]]) are in the same division ([[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific]]), similar to the one in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] where the [[Patrick Division]] (now succeeded by the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]]) had two teams of the same host name which is New York ([[New York Islanders|Islanders]] and [[New York Rangers|Rangers]]). There is also a similar feat that only existed in the [[1976-77 NBA season|1976-77 season]] Where the [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] had [[New York Knicks]] and [[New Jersey Nets|Nets]] (which is now located in New Jersey since [[1977-78 NBA season|1977]]).
*[[Turner Broadcasting]] began a relationship with the NBA that has spanned over 20 years (and still continues today) when [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] signed a 2 year, 20 million dollar deal with the NBA.
*The [[Kansas City Kings|Kings]] played their final game in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and moved their franchise to [[Sacramento, California]] the following season. In one of their final home games, [[New York Knicks]] forward [[Bernard King]], who finished the year as the scoring champion, ruptured his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] in his right knee and was out of action for two years. King would come back in 1987, but would not return to the All-Star Game until [[1991 NBA All-Star Game|1991]].
*This season marked [[Michael Jordan]]'s, [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]'s, [[Charles Barkley]]'s and [[John Stockton]]'s rookie season in the NBA.
*Due to a roof collapse at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], the [[Detroit Pistons|Pistons]] were forced to rent the [[Joe Louis Arena]] for the remainder of the season and into the playoffs.
*At age 38, [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] became the oldest player to ever win the honor of Finals MVP. Kareem's team, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], became the first visiting team to win the NBA title at [[Boston Garden]], beating their archrivals, the [[Boston Celtics]], in six games.
* The Finals adopted the 2-3-2 format still used to this day.
*The [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] returned to the playoffs after a seven-year absence. They were eliminated by the Boston Celtics in four games. They would not make the playoffs again until [[1988 NBA Playoffs|1988]]. The Cavaliers were coached by [[George Karl]], then making his NBA coaching debut.
*At [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]' [[Lakefront Arena]] (where the [[Atlanta Hawks]] played 12 of 41 home games that season), [[Larry Bird]] scored a [[Boston Celtics]] franchise record [[List of National Basketball Association players with 60 or more points in a game|60 points]] in Boston's 126-115 victory over the Hawks on March 12. Bird broke the previous franchise record set by teammate [[Kevin McHale]] (56) nine days earlier at [[Boston Garden]] against the [[Detroit Pistons]].
*The [[Denver Nuggets]] made the conference finals for the first time in their NBA history, losing 4-1 to the Lakers. The series marked the end of [[Dan Issel]]'s playing career, having played 15 professional seasons and averaged 22.6 points and 9.1 rebounds in his career.
