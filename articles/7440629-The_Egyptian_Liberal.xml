The '''Arab Gas Pipeline''' is a [[natural gas]] pipeline in the [[Middle East]].  It exports [[Egypt]]ian natural gas to  [[Jordan]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], with a separate line to [[Israel]]. It has a total length of {{convert|1200|km}} at a cost of [[US$]]1.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=ya-libnan&gt;

==Description==
===ArishâAqaba section===
The first section of pipeline runs from [[Arish]] in Egypt to [[Aqaba]] in Jordan. It has three segments. The first {{convert|250|km|mi}} long overland segment links Al-Arish to [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] on the [[Red Sea]]. It also consists of a compressor station in Arish and a metering station in Taba. The second segment is a {{convert|15|km|mi}} long subsea segment from Taba to Aqaba. The third segment, which includes also a metering station,  is a {{convert|1|km|mi}} long onshore connection to the [[Aqaba Thermal Power Station]].&lt;ref name=yemen&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The Egyptian consortium that developed this section included [[EGAS]], [[ENPPI]], [[PETROGET]] and the [[Egyptian Natural Gas Company|Egyptian Natural Gas Company (GASCO)]].

=== AqabaâEl Rehab section ===
The second section extended the pipeline in Jordan from Aqaba through [[Amman]] to [[El Rehab]], ({{convert|24|km}} from the Syrian border).  The length of this section is {{convert|390|km|mi}} and it cost $300&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=gulf2/&gt;  The second section was commissioned in 2005.

===El RehabâHoms section===
The third section has a total length of {{convert|319|km|mi}} from Jordan to Syria. A {{convert|90|km|mi}} stretch runs from the JordanâSyrian border to the [[Deir Ali]] power station. From there the pipeline runs through [[Damascus]] to the [[Al Rayan]] gas compressor station near [[Homs]]. This sections includes four launching/receiving stations, 12&amp;nbsp;valve stations and a fiscal metering station with a capacity of {{convert|1.1|e9m3|abbr=off}}, and it supplies [[Tishreen]] and Deir Ali power stations. The section was completed in February 2008, and it was built by the [[Syrian Petroleum Company]] and [[Stroytransgaz]], a subsidiary of [[Gazprom]].&lt;ref name=downstream2&gt;

===HomsâTripoli connection===
The HomsâTripoli connection runs from the Al Rayan compressor station to [[Baniyas]] in Syria and then via {{convert|32|km|adj=on}} long stretch to [[Tripoli, Lebanon]].  The agreement to start supplies was signed on 2 September 2009 and test run started on 8 September 2009.&lt;ref name=bmi1/&gt;  Regular gas supplies started on 19 October 2009 and gas is delivered to the [[Deir Ammar power station]].&lt;ref name=downstream201009&gt;

==ArishâAshkelon pipeline==
The Arishâ[[Ashkelon]] pipeline is a {{convert|100|km}} submarine gas pipeline connecting the Arab Gas Pipeline with Israel. Although it is not officially a part of the Arab Gas Pipeline project, it branches off from the same pipeline in Egypt. The pipeline is built and operated by the [[East Mediterranean Gas Company]] (EMG), a joint company of Mediterranean Gas Pipeline Ltd (28%), the Israeli company [[Merhav]] (25%), [[PTT Public Company Limited|PTT]] (25%), EMI-EGI LP (12%), and [[Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation]] (10%).&lt;ref name=ogj071207&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The pipeline became operational in February 2008, at a cost of $180 million â $550 million (the exact figure is disputed).&lt;ref name=&quot;globes-iecbuy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000686557&amp;fid=1725|title=IEC may seek partial ownership of Egyptian pipeline|publisher=[[Globes]]|author=Barkat, Amiram|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Egypt and Israel had agreed to supply through this pipeline {{convert|1.7|e9m3|abbr=off}} of natural gas per year for use by the [[Israel Electric Corporation]].&lt;ref name=upstream&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been raised to {{convert|2.1|e9m3|abbr=off}} per year to be delivered through the year 2028. In addition, by late 2009, EMG had signed contracts to supply through the pipeline additional {{convert|2|e9m3|abbr=off}} per year to private electricity generators and various industrial concerns in Israel and negotiations with other potential buyers were ongoing. In 2010, the pipeline is supplying approximately half of the natural gas consumed in Israel, with the other half being supplied from domestic resources. The total physical capacity of the pipeline is {{convert|9|e9m3|abbr=off}} per year and agreements between the two nations provide a framework for the purchase of up to {{convert|7.5|e9m3|abbr=off}} per year of Egyptian gas by Israeli entities, making Israel one of Egypt's most important natural gas export markets. In 2010 some Egyptian activists appealed for a legal provision against governmental authorities to stop gas flow to Israel according to the obscure contract and very low price compared to the global rates, however the provision was denied by Mubarak regime for unknown reasons. In 2011, after the 25 January Revolution against Mubarak regime, many Egyptians called for stopping the gas project with Israel due to low prices and Israeli violence against Palestinian people.{{cn|date=September 2011}} After a fifth bombing of the pipeline, flow had to be stopped for repair.&lt;ref&gt;

==Future extensions==
===SyriaâTurkey connection===
In March 2006, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, [[Turkey]], Lebanon and [[Romania]] reached an agreement to build the pipeline's extension through Syria to the Turkish border. From there, the pipeline will be connected to the possible [[Nabucco Pipeline]] for the delivery of gas to Europe. Turkey expects to buy up to {{convert|4|e9m3|abbr=off}} of gas per year from the Arab Gas Pipeline.&lt;ref name=alex1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 January 2008, Turkey and Syria signed an agreement to construct a {{convert|63|km|mi}} pipeline between [[Aleppo]] and [[Kilis]] as a first segment of the Syria-Turkey connection of the Arab Gas Pipeline.&lt;ref name=downstream1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This contract was annulled at the beginning of 2009 and it was re-tendered.  The connection is expected to be ready by 2011.  From Kilis, a {{convert|15|km|adj=on}} long pipeline with a diameter of {{convert|12|in|mm}} will connect the pipeline with the Turkish grid.  It allows to supply the Turkish grid via the Syrian grid even before completing the HomsâAllepo segment.

=== Connection with Iraq ===
In September 2004, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon agreed to connect the Arab Gas Pipeline with [[Iraq]]'s gas grid to allow Iraq to export gas to Europe.&lt;ref name=gulf2&gt;

On 4 July 2011, an explosion at the pipeline near [[Nagah]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] halted natural gas supplies to Israel and Jordan.&lt;ref name=aljazeera040711/&gt;  An official said that armed men with machine guns forced guards at the station to leave before planting explosive charge there&lt;ref name=aljazeera040711/&gt;.

An overnight explosion on 26â27 September caused extensive damage to the pipeline at a location 50 kilometers from Egypt's border with Israel. As the pipeline had not been supplying gas to Israel since an earlier explosion in July, it did not affect Israel's natural gas supply. According to Egyptian authorities, local Bedouin Islamists were behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=6th attack on Sinai gas pipeline|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000686395|accessdate=27 September 2011|newspaper=[[Globes]]|date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
