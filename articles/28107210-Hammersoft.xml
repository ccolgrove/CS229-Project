<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="28107210" ns="0" title="Ward (fortification)"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">In [[fortification]]s, a '''bailey''' or '''ward''' refers to a courtyard enclosed by a [[Curtain_wall_(fortification)|curtain wall]]. In particular, an early type of European castle was known as a [[Motte-and-bailey]]. [[Castle]]s can have more than one ward. Their layout depends both on the local topography and the level of fortification technology employed, ranging from simple enclosures to elaborate concentric defences. In addition to the gradual evolution of more complex castle plans,
there are also significant differences in regional traditions of military architecture regarding the subdivision into wards.

==Upper, lower, inner and outer wards or baileys==

Wards can be arranged in sequence along a hill (as in a [[spur castle]]), giving an ''upper ward'' and ''lower ward''. They can also be nested one inside the other, as in a [[concentric castle]], giving an ''outer ward'' and ''inner ward''.&lt;ref&gt;Hull (2008), p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Tower house]]s lack an enclosed ward.

The most important and prestigious buildings, such as the [[great hall]] and the [[keep]] or [[bergfried]], were usually located in the inner ward of the castle.
Nonetheless, there are a few castles where the keep is outside the inner ward, such as [[ChÃ¢teau de Dourdan]] and [[Flint Castle]].
Lower or outer wards often held less important structures, such as [[stable]]s, if there was not enough space in the inner ward.
Outer wards could also be largely defensive in function, without significant buildings. In the concentric castles of the military orders, such as [[Krak des Chevaliers]] or [[Belvoir]], the inner ward resembled a [[cloister]]ed [[monastery]], while the outer ward was little more than a narrow passage between the concentric [[enceinte]]s. In general, wards could have any shape, including irregular or elongated ones, when the walls followed  the [[contour line]]s of the terrain where the castle was sited. Rectangular shapes are very common (as in [[castra]] and [[quadrangular castle]]s).

A particularly complex arrangement of wards can be found at [[ChÃ¢teau Gaillard]]. There is both a lower ward separated from the main castle by a deep ditch, and a concentric arrangement inside the main castle with an inner and middle ward,&lt;ref&gt;Toy (1985), pp116â117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holy Roman Empire==
In the Germanic castles of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there is a distinction between a ''Vorburg'' and a ''Kernburg'' roughly corresponding to lower and upper wards in English castles.&lt;ref&gt;Cathcart King (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In German-speaking countries, many castles had double curtain walls with a narrow ward between them, referred to as a ''Zwinger''. The outer wall was a ''Zwingermauer'' or type of mantlet wall. These were often added at vulnerable points like the gate, but were rarely as fully developed as in the concentric castles in Wales or the Crusader castles.
