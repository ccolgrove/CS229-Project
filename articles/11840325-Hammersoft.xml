The '''[[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Oakland Raiders]]'''  of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) are considered to have one of [[American football|professional football's]] most bitter rivalries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/2005/12/15/gallery.oldrivals/content.8.html|title=Top 10 NFL Rivalries of All Time|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[American Football League]] was established in [[1960 American Football League season|1960]], the Chiefs and Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], the [[AFC West]].

The Chiefs lead the regular season series 55&amp;ndash;47&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football Database&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teamvsteam.html?tm=16&amp;opp=23|title=Kansas City Chiefs vs. Oakland Raiders All Time Results|publisher=The Football Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kansas City Chiefs won the most recent meeting 28&amp;ndash;0 on October 23, 2011 at the [[O.co Coliseum]].

The Chiefs are ahead in [[NFL playoffs|playoff]] match-ups with a record of 2-1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football Database&quot;/&gt; The Chiefs are one of only two teams in the NFL with a winning record against the Raiders (with 10 or more contests).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oakland Raiders' Record by Opponent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/tvt.html?yr=2007&amp;tm=23|title=Oakland Raiders' Record by Opponent|publisher=The Football Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The two teams first met in [[1960 American Football League season|1960]] when the Chiefs were known as the Dallas Texans.  The Texans defeated the Raiders 34-16 in the team's first game at [[Kezar Stadium|Oakland]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Football Database&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1960 Dallas Texans&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/kan1960.htm 1960 Dallas Texans â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1960 Oakland Raiders&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/rai1960.htm 1960 Oakland Raiders â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Raiders defeated the Texans 20-19 at [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Dallas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1960 Dallas Texans&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1960 Oakland Raiders&quot;/&gt;

The rivalry did not become so apparent until the [[Kansas City Athletics]] [[Major League Baseball|baseball]] team moved to [[Oakland, California]] in [[1967 in baseball|1967]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In [[1969 in baseball|1969]], the [[Kansas City Royals]] expansion team was placed in the same division as the Athletics.  The [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966 Chiefs team]] participated in the first [[Super Bowl I|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as the [[Super Bowl]].  The Chiefs and Raiders both had identical 12-2 records in [[1968]] and faced off in a playoff game to decide who would go to face the [[New York Jets]] for the [[AFL Championship]]. The Raiders won 41-6.

The following year, in [[1969 American Football League season|1969]], the Raiders defeated the Chiefs twice in the regular season&lt;ref name=&quot;1969 Kansas City Chiefs&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/kan1969.htm 1969 Kansas City Chiefs â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1969 Oakland Raiders&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/rai1969.htm 1969 Oakland Raiders â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to win the AFL Western Conference title.  The two teams met in the 1969 AFL Championship Game at Oakland and the underdog Chiefs won 17-7.&lt;ref name=&quot;1969 Kansas City Chiefs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1969 Oakland Raiders&quot;/&gt; The Chiefs participated in [[Super Bowl IV]] a week later and defeated the NFL's [[spread betting|heavily favored]] [[Minnesota Vikings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1969 Kansas City Chiefs&quot;/&gt; It was not until [[1976 NFL season|1976]] that Oakland would finally win their [[Super Bowl XI|first Super Bowl championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1976 Oakland Raiders&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/rai1976.htm 1976 Oakland Raiders â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first meeting between the teams during the [[1970 NFL season]]&amp;ndash;both team's first in the newly merged NFL&amp;ndash;the Chiefs held a 17-14 lead late in the fourth quarter and appeared ready to run out the clock. Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson rolled around right end and gained enough yardage for a first down, and as he fell to the ground, Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]] dove into Dawson with his helmet; in retaliation, Davidson was attacked by Chiefs wide receiver Otis Taylor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 10&quot;/&gt; After a bench-clearing brawl, Davidson and Taylor were ejected, and the penalties that were called nullified the first down under the rules at the time. Kansas City was forced to punt, and the Raiders took advantage, as [[George Blanda]] nailed a 48-yard field goal with eight seconds left to secure a 17-17 tie.  The tie proved to be costly for the Chiefs, as Oakland clinched the first AFC West championship with a 20-6 victory in Oakland in Week 13. Due to this incident, the NFL changed the rules so that Davidson's personal foul would have been enforced at the end of the play, and Taylor's penalty would have been assessed only after the Chiefs had been awarded a first down. 

The Chiefs defeated the Raiders by a score of 42-10 in the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]], prompting the Chiefs' live [[horse]] [[mascot]] [[Warpaint (horse)|Warpaint]] to circle the field after each touchdown scored. After the game, Raiders coach [[John Madden (American football)|John Madden]] said &quot;We couldn't beat the Chiefs, but we damn near killed their horse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs cheerleaders&quot;&gt;[http://www.georgeblowfish.com/Chiefspage7.html Chiefs cheerleaders and mascots] Accessed 15 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Raiders would go on to win two more Super Bowl titles in [[1980 NFL season|1980]]&lt;ref name=&quot;1980 Oakland Raiders&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/rai1980.htm 1980 Oakland Raiders â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1983 NFL season|1983]]&lt;ref name=&quot;1983 Oakland Raiders&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/rai1983.htm 1983 Oakland Raiders â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Chiefs were considered to be one of the worst teams in the NFL.  The Raiders won most of the games between the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rivalry&quot;&gt;[http://www.chiefswarpath.com/rivalry/rivalry.htm The Rivalry - Kansas City vs. Oakland] ''ChiefsWarpath.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Following their victory in Super Bowl IV, the Chiefs returned to the playoffs in [[1971 NFL season|1971]], but lost in double overtime to the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the divisional round in the longest game in NFL history, the final game at Municipal Stadium. Following that loss, Kansas City did not return to the playoffs until 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;1986 Kansas City Chiefs&quot;&gt;[http://profootballreference.com/teams/kan1986.htm 1986 Kansas City Chiefs â Pro Football Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final game of the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]], the Chiefs and Raiders faced off at [[Arrowhead Stadium]].  A win for the Chiefs would put them in the playoffs.  A game plagued by special teams mistakes for the Chiefs, including three attempted kickoffs that ended up out of bounds by kickoff specialist Jon Baker, helped keep the Raiders in the game and stop the Chiefs from sealing the victory.  The game went into overtime and, helped by favorable field position after the third and final kickoff out of bounds, former Chief [[Rich Gannon]] drove the Raiders into Chiefs territory, setting up the game-winning field goal and knocking the Chiefs out of the playoffs, their first win at Arrowhead since 1988. &lt;ref name=&quot;Heartbreaker&quot;&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/examiner/archive/2000/01/03/SPORTS3589.dtl Raiders die with their boots on] ''SFGate.com'', 3 January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2007, the Chiefs defeated the Raiders for a record ninth straight victory.  On November 25, 2007, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs in Arrowhead for Oakland's first victory over Kansas City since December 23, 2002. 

On September 14, 2008, the Raiders would defeat the Chiefs, 23-8, for the second consecutive time in Arrowhead Stadium.  Rookie Darren McFadden would compile 210 rushing yards and a touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=280914012&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 30, 2008, the Chiefs would defeat the Raiders for the sixth consecutive time in Oakland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson's 2-yard&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Johnson's 2-yard plunge lifts Chiefs over woeful Raiders | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281130013 | author=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN | date=2008-11-30 | accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On September 20, 2009, the Raiders defeated the Chiefs, 13-10, in Arrowhead Stadium for the third consecutive time.  The Chiefs became one of the few teams to lose to quarterback JaMarcus Russell.&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=290920012&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 15, 2009, the Chiefs defeated the Raiders, 16-10, in the Oakland Coliseum for the Chiefs' seventh consecutive victory in Oakland.

On November 7, 2010, the Raiders would defeat the Chiefs in overtime, 20-23, in a match-up that rekindled the relevance of the rivalry between the Raiders and Chiefs.  It marked the 99th time these teams have met in the regular season and 102nd overall.  On January 2, 2011, the Raiders would also defeat the Chiefs in Arrowhead Stadium for the fourth consecutive time, 31-10, to finish a sweep of the AFC West.

On October 3, 2011, a fan of the Oakland Raiders filed a lawsuit against the Kansas City Chiefs and two unidentified Chiefs fans, because the plaintiff claims that security did nothing as he was beaten during a brawl at Arrowhead Stadium in 2009.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20111003/NEWS05/111009987&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, 13 of the last 15 games between them have been decided by 7 points or fewer.

== Connections between the two teams ==
* Quarterback [[Rich Gannon]], whom was the [[Kansas City Chiefs quarterbacks|Chiefs' starting quarterback]] in the late 1990s signed with the Raiders for the [[1999 NFL season|1999 season]] and two years later was named [[NFL MVP]].
* Wide receiver [[Andre Rison]] played for the Chiefs before getting cut prior to the [[2000 NFL season]].  He signed with Oakland later that year.
* Running back [[Marcus Allen]] played for the Raiders in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and led the Raiders to victory in [[Super Bowl XVIII]].  Allen signed with the Chiefs for the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]] after a feud with Raider Managing General Partner [[Al Davis]] became public.  Allen later reportedly asked to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of the Chiefs, even though unlike the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], the Pro Football Hall of Fame doesn't induct players on a certain team.
* Backup quarterback [[Tom Flores]] won a Super Bowl championship with the Chiefs in 1969, but never started in Kansas City.  Flores went on to become head coach of the Raiders ten years later and led the team to two Super Bowl titles.
* Former Chiefs head coach and defensive coordinator [[Gunther Cunningham]] spent four years with the Los Angeles Raiders (1991-1994) as the team's defensive coordinator. He joined the Chiefs in 1995.
* Cornerback [[Albert Lewis (American football)|Albert Lewis]] and Running Back Harvey Williams started their careers in Kansas City but were both traded to the Raiders in 1994.
*Quarterback [[JaMarcus Russell]] and wide receiver [[Dwayne Bowe]] hold many records while attending [[Louisiana State University|LSU]]. In the [[2007 NFL Draft]], Russell would be drafted to the Raiders (No.1 overall) and Bowe would be drafted to the Chiefs (No.23 overall). Also, during the following draft ([[2008 NFL Draft]]), LSU's defensive tackle [[Glenn Dorsey]] would also be drafted to the Chiefs (No.5 overall). Even in 2009 , LSU's defensive end [[Tyson Jackson]] would be drafted by the Chiefs in the first round.
*[[Defensive tackle]] [[Terdell Sands]] was drafted by the Chiefs in 2001. After a few seasons, Sands would sign with the Raiders to become their starter on the defensive line.
*Raiders running back [[Bo Jackson]] spent most of his [[Major League Baseball]] career with the [[Kansas City Royals]].
*In 1962, the Chiefs traded their original quarterback [[Cotton Davidson]] to the Oakland Raiders for the first overall selection in the 1963 American Football League Draft, which was used by the Chiefs to select future Hall of Famer [[Buck Buchanan]].

{{quote|Those were my favorite games...I always likened them to a heavyweight fight. You knew you were going to get beat up, but it was fun. We needed the Chiefs. We wouldn't have been as good without them.|[[Ben Davidson]], former Raiders [[defensive end]].}}
{{quote|It's something special. It's not just media hype...You can sense it with coaches and players. Then you get out into the community, and you realize what a huge game this is for both cities.|[[Will Shields]], former Chiefs [[offensive guard]].}}
{{quote|In Oakland...the games you always really wanted to come see were the [[San Francisco 49ers|Niners]] and the Chiefs. You grew up hating red...It goes deep. It's not just the teams. It's the organizations, you know, which organization is better? These are two teams that played in the old AFL against each other. Most of the history goes back to it. They've been AFC West rivals for a very, very long time.
