The '''[[2007 NFL season|2007]] [[St. Louis Rams]] season''' was the 70th season for the team in the [[National Football League]]  and their 13th in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].

==Offseason==
[[Head coach]] [[Scott Linehan]] made several coaching changes. Al Roberts replaced [[Bob Ligashesky]] as the special teams coach.

{{main|2007 NFL Draft}}
The [[2007 NFL Draft]] began on April 28, 2007 and with the thirteenth pick overall, the Rams selected [[Defensive End]] [[Adam Carriker]] from [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]]. The Rams have said that Carriker would be moved to the [[Defensive Tackle]] position to help with the run defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stlouisrams.com/article/61147/|title= Linehan Gets his Man, DE Carriker|accessdate=2007-04-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070430012557/http://www.stlouisrams.com/article/61147/  |archivedate = 2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Rams second round pick they selected [[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]] [[Brian Leonard]] out of [[Rutgers]]. His style of play is similar to that of [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]].

On the second day of the draft the Rams selected [[Cornerback]] [[Jonathan Wade]] from [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] in the third round. With a 4.4&amp;nbsp;second 40-yard dash, Wade will add some speed at the cornerback position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stlouisrams.com/article/61159/|title= Rams Add Leonard, Wade in NFL Draft|accessdate=2007-04-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070501031431/http://www.stlouisrams.com/article/61159/  |archivedate = 2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth round the Rams selected [[Center (American football)|Center]] [[Dustin Fry]] out of [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. With [[Andy McCollum]] and [[Brett Romberg]] competing for the starting position at Center, Fry will likely be the third stringer at that position.&lt;ref name=DayTwo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stlouisrams.com/article/61163/|title= Rams Fill More Needs on Day Two|accessdate=2007-04-29 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070501032616/http://www.stlouisrams.com/article/61163/  |archivedate = 2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the fifth round the Rams selected [[Defensive Tackle]] [[Clifton Ryan]] from [[Michigan State]]. The Rams stated that he will be used as a Nose Tackle.&lt;ref name=DayTwo/&gt; In the sixth round the Rams selected [[Offensive Tackle]] [[Ken Shackleford]] from [[University of Georgia|Georgia]]. Coach Linehan commented that he could develop into a starter over the next couple of years.&lt;ref name=DayTwo/&gt; The Rams had two compensatory picks and selected [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]] Defensive Tackle [[Keith Jackson (defensive tackle)|Keith Jackson]], son of former NFL [[Pro Bowl]] [[tight end]] [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]], and [[University of WisconsinâWhitewater|WisconsinâWhitewater]] [[Wide Receiver]] [[Derek Stanley]].&lt;ref name=DayTwo/&gt;

The Rams traded their fourth-round selection (117th overall) for the [[Detroit Lions]] two of their three fifth-round selections (139th and 154th overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | coauthors = Scouts, Inc. | title = NFL draft trade tracker 2007 | publisher = ESPN.com | date = 2007-04-29 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/draft07/news/story?id=2850327 | accessdate = 2007-04-29 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqqbl5ml | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rams traded their seventh-round selection (225th overall) to the [[Miami Dolphins]] in exchange for signing [[restricted free agent]] [[Donnie Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dolphins won't match Jones' offer sheet from Rams | agency = Associated Press | date = 2007-04-18 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2842147 | accessdate = 2007-04-20 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqqeOW1u | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rams received two seventh-round picks (248th and 249th overall) as compensatory selections.
