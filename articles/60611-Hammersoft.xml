{{Main|History of the University of Florida}}

[[File:Dsg UF Century Tower 20050507.jpg|left|275px|thumbnail|[[Century Tower (University of Florida)|Century Tower]], begun in 1953, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of university and as a tribute to the alumni who perished in both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].]]

The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the [[East Florida Seminary]], the oldest of the University of Florida's four predecessor institutions, was founded in [[Ocala, Florida]].

On January 6, 1853, [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Thomas Brown (Florida politician)|Thomas Brown]] signed a bill that provided public support for [[higher education]] in the state of [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufl.edu/history/1853.html Governor Thomas Brown signs Higher Education bill]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]].  The East Florida Seminary was the first state-supported institution of higher learning in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/pkyonge/kingsbury.htm/ &quot;Kingsbury Papers&quot;], Smathers Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  James Henry Roper, an educator from [[North Carolina]] and a [[Florida Senate|state senator]] from [[Alachua County]], built a school, the [[History of the University of Florida|Gainesville Academy]], around the same time.  In 1866, after East Florida Seminary had closed during the [[American Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufl.edu/history/1853.html/ &quot;UF Early History&quot;], University of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the relocation of [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]] to Gainesville.&lt;ref&gt;The present university campus incorporates much of the former seminary and academy campuses.  [[Epworth Hall (Gainesville, Florida)|Epworth Hall]], one of the main building of the [[History of the University of Florida|East Florida Seminary]], still stands in downtown Gainesville, but is not within the boundaries of the university's campus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the [[Florida Agricultural College]], established at [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]] by Jordan Probst in 1884.  Florida Agricultural College became the state's first [[land-grant college]] under the [[Morrill Act]].  In 1903, the [[Florida Legislature]], desiring to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins, changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the &quot;University of Florida,&quot; a name that the school would hold for only two years.&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida, [http://www.ufl.edu/150/htmltimeline/1853_1905.html/ UF Timeline].  The name, the &quot;University of Florida,&quot; has been held by three separate schools: the [[West Florida Seminary]] was renamed the &quot;University of Florida&quot; by the legislature, and held the name from 1883 to 1902; Florida Agricultural College was renamed in 1902 and held the name until 1905; and the name of the new University of the State of Florida was simplified to the University of Florida in 1909.  The West Florida Seminary was a predecessor to the modern [[Florida State University]] in Tallahassee.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &quot;University of the State of Florida&quot; ===
In 1905, the [[Henry Holland Buckman|Buckman Act]] consolidated the colleges of the state.  The member of the [[Florida Legislature]] who wrote the act, [[Henry Holland Buckman]], is the namesake of [[Buckman Hall]], one of the university's oldest buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housing.ufl.edu/housing/Facilities_TourPages/buckman.htm/ &quot;Buckman Hall Quick Facts.&quot;] Department of Housing, University of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buckman Act reorganized the [[State University System of Florida]] and created the [[Florida Board of Control]] to govern the system.  The Act abolished the pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education, and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new &quot;[[History of the University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]]&quot;: the '''University of Florida at Lake City''' (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]], the '''East Florida Seminary''' in Gainesville, the '''St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School''' in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], and the '''South Florida Military College''' in [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capolicycenter.org/florida/florida5.html About the Buckman Act consolidation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and sexâthe University of the State of Florida for white men, the Florida Female College for white women, and the State Normal School for Colored Students for African-American men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Library and Archives of Florida - The Florida Memory Project Timeline (see 1905)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridamemory.com/Timeline |title=State Library and Archives of Florida - The Florida Memory Project Timeline (see 1905) |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Gainesville, led by its Mayor [[William Reuben Thomas]], campaigned to be home to the new university.&lt;ref&gt;Hildreth, Charles and Merlin Cox, History of Gainesville, Florida 1854-1979, Alachua County Historical Society (Gainesville, 1981) at 102.&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 6, 1905, the Board of Control selected [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] for the new university campus.  [[Andrew Sledd]], president of the pre-existing [[History of the University of Florida|University of Florida at Lake City]], was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida.  The 1905-1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new University of the State of Florida was legally created, but operated on the campus of the old University of Florida in Lake City until the buildings on the new campus in Gainesville were completed.  Architect William A. Edwards designed the first official campus buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Collegiate Gothic]] style.  Classes began on new Gainesville campus on September 26, 1906 with 102 students.

In 1909, the name of the school was officially simplified from the &quot;University of the State of Florida&quot; to the &quot;University of Florida.&quot;

The [[alligator]] was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911, after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants with an alligator imprinted on them.  The school colors, orange and blue, are believed to be derived from the blue and white school colors of the University of Florida at Lake City and the orange and black colors of the East Florida Seminary at Gainesville.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html &quot;University of Florida History 1906-1927.&quot;]  ''University of Florida.''  August 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MurphreeStatue.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of [[Albert Murphree]], the second president of the university.]]

=== College reorganization ===

In 1909, [[Albert Murphree]] was appointed the second president of the university, and organized several of the colleges of the university, increased enrollment from under 200 to over 2,000, and he was instrumental in the founding of the [[Florida Blue Key]] leadership society.  Murphree is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on the campus.

[[File:Historic Layout University of Florida.jpg|left|thumb|The University of Florida campus in 1916, looking southwest.]]

In 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated that women of a &quot;mature age&quot; (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a &quot;reputable educational institution&quot; would be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women.  Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/aspring/All%20courses/UF%20courses/Women%20UF/Holbrook%20et%20al.doc University of Florida: College of Liberal Arts and Sciences-Notable Women at UF]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lassie Goodbread-Black]] from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufl.edu/history/1906.html University of Florida website: History-1925 Â» First Woman Enrolls]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John J. Tigert]] became the third university president in 1928.  Disgusted by the under-the-table payments being made by universities to athletes, Tigert established the grant-in-aid [[athletic scholarship]] program in the early 1930s, which was the genesis of the modern athletic scholarship plan that is currently used by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_video/NCAANewsArchive/1970/19701215.pdf &quot;The NCAA News&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post World War II ===

Beginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning World War II veterans who could attend college under the [[GI Bill of Rights]] (Servicemen's Readjustment Act).  Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the '''Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida''' on the campus of Florida State College for Women in [[Tallahassee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsu.edu/about/history.html |title=About Florida State - History |publisher=Office of University Communications |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the 1946&amp;ndash;1947 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch.  The following semester, the [[Florida Legislature]] returned the Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and renamed it [[Florida State University]].  This sequence of events also opened up all of the colleges that comprise the University of Florida to female students.  African-American students were allowed to enroll starting in 1958.  [[Shands at the University of Florida|Shands Hospital]] first opened in 1958 along with the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]] to join the already established [[University of Florida College of Pharmacy|College of Pharmacy]].  Rapid campus expansion began in the 1950s and continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufl.edu/history/1948.html About the post-war expansion]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and international prominence ===

In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to become a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU), an organization composed of now sixty-three academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada.  Florida is one of only seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU.  In 2009, President [[Bernie Machen]] and the [[University of Florida Board of Trustees]] announced a major policy transition for the university.  The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090221/ARTICLES/902211015/1002/NEWS01?Title=UF-looks-to-transform-itself UF looking to transform itself]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Florida has continued to rise in the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' [[college and university rankings]].  In 2001, Florida was labeled a [[Public Ivy]] and was second in [[Kiplinger]]'s 2009 &quot;Best Buys of Education&quot; (behind the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.kiplinger.com/tools/colleges/pubcollege.php?sortby=INRANK04&amp;orderby=flip&amp;states%5B%5D=ALL&amp;myschool%5B%5D=none&amp;outputby=table 2009 Kiplinger Ranking]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''U.S. News'' currently ranks the university as the forty-seventh best national university; the state policy-makers, university administrators and Florida alumni are actively working to advance the university as a top-10 public university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/education/20colleges.html?ex=1324270800&amp;en=16bd9a2c85e3f6a3&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss/ &quot;Public Universities Chase Excellence, at Price.&quot;] ''New York Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Partnership with Moffitt Center ====
[[File:Moffitt Cancer Center viewed from east.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute|Moffitt Cancer Center]]]]
In January 2008 the University of Florida, [[H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute]], and [[Shands at the University of Florida]] formed a partnership to develop world-class programs in cancer care, research and prevention. The partnership, will extend Moffitt's innovative model of comprehensive patient care to UF and Shands cancer programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ufl.edu/2008/01/23/moffitt-cancer-center/ UF, Moffitt, and Shands partnership]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Participation in the Large Hadron Collider ====
A team of UF physicists has a leading role in one of the two major experiments planned for the [[Large Hadron Collider]], a {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=on}}-long, $5 billion, super-cooled underground tunnel outside Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ufl.edu/publications/explore/current/extracts/extracts02.html UF involvement with the Large Hadron Collider]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 UF physicists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students and now undergraduates are involved in the collider's [[Compact Muon Solenoid]] (CMS) experiment, one of its two major experiments. About 10 are stationed in Geneva. The group is the largest from any university in the U.S. to participate in the CMS experiment. The UF team designed and oversaw development of a major detector within the CMS. The detector, the Muon system, is intended to capture subatomic particles called muons, which are heavier cousins of electrons. Among other efforts, UF scientists analyzed about 100 of the 400 detector chambers placed within the Muon system to be sure they were functioning properly. The bulk of the UF research was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ufl.edu/2008/09/09/uf-collider/ UF physicists to take part in worldâs most ambitious science experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Student government ===
[[File:UFSG.png|thumb|180px|left|Seal for the UF Student Government]]
The '''University of Florida [[Student Government]]''' is the governing body of students who attend the University of Florida, representing the university's more than 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students.  The university's student government currently operates on a yearly $16.7 million dollar budget, one of the largest student government budgets in the United States, and is decided by a Legislative Senate Budget Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gainesvillesun.com/article/20070924/NEWS/709240306] ''Student Government Budget''&lt;/ref&gt;

The student government was established in 1909 and consists of executive, judicial and unicameral legislative branches.  The executive branch includes the student government president, vice president and treasurer elected by the student body during the spring semester, as well as nine agencies and forty-one cabinet members.

The student senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 100 senators who serve one-year terms.  The student body elects fifty senators during each spring semester and the remaining fifty during the fall semester.  The senators elect a senate president and senate President pro tempore twice a year, after each semester's elections, to lead the student senate.  During student government elections students may also vote on referendums, such as the renewable energy referendum,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gators for a Sustainable Campus&quot;&gt;[http://sustainablegators.org/] June 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; which was approved by 78% of voting students in the spring of 2007.  This referendum proposed a fifty-cents-per-credit-hour increase to student activity fees to fund renewable energy and efficiency on campus.

The student government judicial branch has three major components: the student supreme court (headed by a chief justice), the student honor court (headed by the honor court chancellor elected each spring), and the student traffic court (headed by a chief justice).  The supreme court consists of five second or third-year law students nominated by the student government president and confirmed by the student senate.  Each justice serves a &quot;life-time&quot; term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government.  The chief justice may appoint a marshal and clerk.  The election commission, which listens and adjudicates all student government election complaints, is also part of the judicial branch.  The commission includes 6 members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.
