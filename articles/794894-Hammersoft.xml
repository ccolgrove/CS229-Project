'''WFNX''' is a [[New England]] commercial [[alternative rock]] [[radio broadcasting|radio station]]. The station began broadcasting on Monday, April 11, 1983. It was one of the first American commercial stations to play [[alternative rock]] and has become a leading radio station for breaking new alternative music.

WFNX broadcasts on 101.7 [[Hertz|MHz]] from atop One Financial Center in downtown Boston, and is [[simulcast]] on another New England radio station, '''WFEX''' in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]] (serving [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester, NH]]), at 92.1 MHz. Simulcasting on another 92.1 MHz station, [[WXEX-FM|WPHX-FM]] in Sanford, Maine, ended in August 2011.

WFNX is owned by the [[Phoenix Media/Communications Group]] and promoted as the broadcast cousin of the ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]]'', the Boston area's long-running [[alternative media]] newspaper.

==History==
101.7 FM began as the FM outfit of [[WLYN]] in November 1947.  '''WLYN-FM''' for years simulcast WLYN during the day and had its own programming after the AM signed off at sunset.

By the late 1970s, WLYN-FM had begun broadcasting ethnic programming in the midday hours, with drive times still simulcast with the AM. In 1981, WLYN-FM began broadcasting a nighttime block of [[new Wave music|new wave music]] which eventually became a [[24/7]] alternative music format in 1982, known as '''Y102'''.  The midday ethnic programs were moved to the AM where they continue to air to the present day. 

In the spring of 1983, WLYN-FM was sold to the Phoenix Media/Communications Group and became '''WFNX''', retaining for the most part the format that had been launched by the previous owners.

The station sponsored a free Green Day concert at the [[Hatch Memorial Shell]] in Boston, MA on September 9, 1994.

WFNX has a long history of breaking{{clarify|date=October 2011}} new bands and being the first in the country to play artists such as Nirvana, The Killers, Franz Ferdinand, Florence and the Machine, Foster the People, Mumford and Sons, and many more. Since day one, WFNX has been all about new underground music, whether itâs local or national, and tries to balance them both and help the music community.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

==Simulcasts==
WFNX broadcasts are simulcast in New Hampshire.

===WFEX===
In December 1999, 92.1 [[WFEX]] of [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]] began simulcasting 101.7 WFNX. Previously WFEX was WNHQ, simulcasting 105.5 [[WJYY]] of [[Concord, New Hampshire]].

===WPHX===

{{Main|WXEX-FM}}
On July 21, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonradio.org/nerw/nerw-990730.html |title=North East RadioWatch July 30, 1999 |work=Scott Fybush |accessdate=2009-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 92.1 [[WXEX-FM|WPHX-FM]] of [[Sanford, Maine]] began simulcasting of 101.7 WFNX. Previous to the simulcast, WPHX-FM was WCDQ, playing [[classic rock]] as Mount Rialto Radio. The WFNX simulcast on WPHX-FM ended in August 2011, when WPHX-FM switched to a simulcast of [[WXEX]] 1540 AM, Exeter, NH.

==Signal upgrade and ratings growth==
On March 30, 2006, WFNX doubled its power after receiving permission from the FCC to begin broadcasting from its new antenna located atop [[One Financial Center]] in downtown Boston.  To promote its signal upgrade in downtown Boston, WFNX sold all of its commercial ad time to beverage maker [[Snapple]] from [[Memorial Day]], May 29 through [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 2006 (both are [[Holiday|national holidays]] in the United States). The unique deal allowed the station to eliminate traditional commercial breaks for that time.

The combination of WFNX's signal upgrade and the departure of Howard Stern from WBCN resulted in a significant ratings change in the core rock 18-34 demographic in Boston starting in 2006.  Arbitron Ratings four ratings books in 2007 (Fa06, Wi07, Sp07, Su07) showed that WFNX's weekday 18-34 audience share had increased by 43% over 2005, while WBCN's 18-34 share decreased by 39% from 2005.

==Trivia==
[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s 1993 ''[[Nevermind It's an Interview]]'' limited-edition promotional release on Geffen Records was produced and engineered at the station by [[Kurt St. Thomas]]  and Troy Smith. The original interview sessions were recorded by St. Thomas the night of Nirvana's first appearance on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1992.
