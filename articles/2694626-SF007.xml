'''SUSE Linux Enterprise Server''' ('''SLES''') is a [[Linux distribution]] supplied by [[SUSE]] and targeted at the business market. It is targeted for [[server (computing)|server]]s, [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]]s, and [[workstation]]s but can be installed on [[desktop computer]]s for testing as well. New major versions are released at an interval of 3-4 years, while minor versions (called service packs) are released about every 18 months. SUSE Linux Enterprise products, including SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, receive much more intense testing than the [[openSUSE]] community product, with the intention that only mature, stable versions of the included components will make it through to the released enterprise product.

The current version is SLES 11 SP1, released May 19, 2010, which is developed from a common codebase with [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop]] and other SUSE Linux Enterprise products.

==History==
SLES has been developed based on SUSE Linux by a small team led by Marcus Kraft and Bernhard Kaindl as principal developer who was supported by Joachim SchrÃ¶der. It was first released on 31 October 2000 as a version for [[IBM]] [[S/390]] mainframe machines.&lt;ref&gt;SuSE: [http://web.archive.org/web/20010605154144/www.suse.de/en/produkte/susesoft/s390/S390release.html &quot;SuSE Linux for S/390 available today&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2000, the first enterprise client ([[TeliaSonera|Telia]]) was made public.&lt;ref&gt;silicon.com: [http://hardware.silicon.com/desktops/0,39024645,11021413,00.htm &quot;Linux mainframe ousts Sun servers at Telia&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2001, the first SLES for [[x86]] was released.

'''SLES version 9''' was released in August 2004. Service Pack 4 was released in December 2007. It is supported by the major hardware vendorsâ[[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Dell, Inc.|Dell]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Lenovo]], and [[Fujitsu Siemens Computers]].

SLES 9 is installed on [[NASA]]'s [[supercomputer]] ''[[Columbia (supercomputer)|Columbia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Resources/Systems/columbia.html NAS Computing Resources - Columbia Supercomputer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10''' was released in July 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/news/press/item.jsp?id=1031 &quot;Novell Delivers Next-Generation Platform for the Open Enterprise&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, and is also supported by the major hardware vendors. Service pack 4 was released in April 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/news/press/2011/4/novell-offers-industrys-longest-enterprise-linux-support-program-.html Novell Offers Industry's Longest Enterprise Linux Support Program]&lt;/ref&gt;SLES 10 shares a common codebase with [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop|SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10]]âNovell's desktop distribution for business useâand other SUSE Linux Enterprise products.

The front node of [[JUGENE]], a petaflops supercomputer at the [[JÃ¼lich Research Centre]] in [[Germany]], uses SLES 10 as its operating system.
