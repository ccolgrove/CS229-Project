'''Launchpad''' is a [[web application]] and [[website]] that allow users to develop and maintain software, particularly [[free software]]. Launchpad is developed and maintained by [[Canonical Ltd]].

On July 21, 2009 the [[source code]] was released publicly under the [[AGPL|GNU Affero General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuntu.com/news/canonical-open-sources-launchpad|title=Canonical releases source code for Launchpad|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of|2011|7}}, the launchpad repository hosts more than 23,500 projects. The domain ''launchpad.net'' attracted 1 million visitors by August 2009 according to a [[Compete.com]] survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteanalytics.compete.com/launchpad.net?metric=uv|title=launchpad attracts 1m visitors yearly|publisher=Compete.com. |accessdate=2009-08-01 l}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
It has several parts:
* '''Answers''': a community support site and knowledge base.
* '''Blueprints''': a system for tracking [[Specification (technical standard)|Specification]]s and new features.
* '''Bugs''': a [[Bug tracking system|bug tracker]] that allows bugs to be tracked in multiple contexts (e.g. in an Ubuntu package, as an upstream, or in remote bug trackers).
* '''Code''': source code hosting using the [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]] version control system.
* '''Translations''': a site for localising applications into different human languages.

A significant but less visible component is '''Soyuz''', &quot;the distribution management portion of Launchpad.&quot; Launchpad is currently primarily used in the development of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], an [[operating system]]. Launchpad uses the [[FOSS]] ([[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]]) [[Zope 3]] application server.

==Users==
Several of Canonical Ltd.'s own projects use Launchpad for development including [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and Bazaar. Development of Launchpad is itself managed in Launchpad.

Other prominent projects using Launchpad for various aspects of managing their development include:
* [[Drizzle (database server)|Drizzle]]
* [[GNOME Do]]
* [[Inkscape]] (bug tracking, code hosting)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transition to Free Software==
Launchpad was initially criticized by the Jem Report and other members of the free software community for not being available under a free license, such as the [[GNU GPL]], despite its aims. In response, the developers stated that they aimed to eventually release it under a free software license, but that it could potentially take years.&lt;ref name=&quot;developers-open-sourcing&quot;&gt;{{

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9 July 2007, [[Canonical Ltd.]] released &quot;[https://storm.canonical.com Storm]&quot;, the first Launchpad component made available under a free software license.&lt;ref name=&quot;storm-open-source&quot;&gt;{{

|title=Canonical Releases Storm as Open Source
|date=2007-07-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founder [[Mark Shuttleworth]]'s response to this criticism was that Launchpad needed paid-programmers to continue the development of the Launchpad platform, and that there would be no point in developing multiple versions of Launchpad due to the probable incompatibility of the [[Fork (software development)|forks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mark&quot;&gt;{{

|title=Launchpad should be free software (free as in freedom)
|date=2007-04-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this still left some members of the open-source movement dissatisfied.&lt;ref name=&quot;jem-report&quot;&gt;{{

|title=Ubuntu is built with proprietary software
|date=2007-07-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2008 Mark Shuttleworth announced at [[O'Reilly Open Source Convention|OSCON]] that the complete source code would be released within the next twelve months.&lt;ref name=&quot;open-source-announcement&quot;&gt;{{

|date=2008-07-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2008, [[Canonical Ltd.]] released the Launchpad component &quot;lazr.config&quot; and &quot;lazr.delegates&quot; under version 3 of the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU LGPL]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazr.delegates lazr.delegates 1.0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lazr.config lazr.config 1.0]&lt;/ref&gt;

An open [[API]] is currently{{When|date=February 2011}} in beta testing, which will allow programs to interact with the website. Calls for an open API to be released were aided by projects like Leonov that resorted to [[Data scraping#Screen_scraping|screen scraping]] to get data from Launchpad.

In December 2008, Canonical announced that the source code to the Launchpad website would be released under a free software license by 21 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=oRa0fZTu-ms Youtube - UDS Jaunty - Graham Binns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;opensourcing launchpad&quot;&gt;[https://dev.launchpad.net/OpenSourcing Dev.launchpad.net], OpenSourcing&lt;/ref&gt; It was also announced that two large components of Launchpad, Soyuz (which is responsible for the build system, package management and Ubuntu package publishing) and Codehosting, would not be released under a free software license.&lt;ref name=&quot;blog-how&quot;&gt;[http://blog.launchpad.net/general/how-we-are-open-sourcing-launchpad Blog.launchpad.net], &quot;How we are open sourcing launchpad&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the specific date was changed to a more general timeframe of July/August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.launchpad.net/OpenSourcing|title=Open Sourcing Launchpad|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|accessdate=2009-07-04|quote=The process should be completed in July / August 2009.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuntu.com/news/canonical-open-sources-launchpad|title=Canonical releases source code for Launchpad|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|accessdate=2009-07-21|quote=Canonical, the founder of the Ubuntu project, announced today that it has open-sourced the code that runs Launchpad, the software development and collaboration platform used by tens of thousands of developers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 21 July 2009, the software was released under the [[AGPL|AGPLv3]] (a fully free license specifically for web services),&lt;ref&gt;[https://dev.launchpad.net/LaunchpadLicense Launchpad License]&lt;/ref&gt; including the two components (Codehosting and Soyuz) that were initially planned to remain proprietary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.launchpad.net/general/launchpad-is-now-open-source Launchpad is now open source.]&lt;/ref&gt;
