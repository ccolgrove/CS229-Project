== History ==
===1980s===
[[File:Horizon f27.jpg|thumb|left|A Horizon Air [[Fairchild Hiller FH-227|Fairchild F27]] at [[Spokane International Airport]]. (1993)]]
Horizon Air was formed in May 1981 by Milt Kuolt, and started operations on September 1, 1981 with three [[Fairchild F-27]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott 2001, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The airline was formed as a merger of Horizon Airlines and [[Air Oregon]] in 1982. Its headquarters were in an area that is now within [[SeaTac, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;World Airline Directory.&quot; ''[[Flight International]]''. March 31, 1984. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1984/1984%20-%200560.html?search=%22Horizon%20Air%22 844].&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizon Air's first route was from [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] to [[Seattle]], and one week later, [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]] to Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott 2001, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; The general offices of Horizon Air were operated out of an old house behind Sea-Tac airport. Horizon acquired [[Air Oregon]] on June 17, 1982, after both airlines were losing hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly, in order to consolidate and reduce their operating deficit.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott 2001, pg. 119-125&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon agreed to purchase [[Transwestern Airlines]] of Utah in September 1983, once again to try to reduce operating deficit of the airline.&lt;ref name=&quot;transwestern bought&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?idf=Ma8SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cvkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2623,1012698&amp;dq=transwestern+airlines|title=Horizon buys Utah airline|last=[[Associated Press]]|date=1983-09-13|work=[[Spokane Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Google News Archives]]|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single [[Fokker F28]] was the first jet owned by Horizon Air, purchased from a carrier in Africa, in July 1984, however their first jet was a [[wet lease]]d [[Douglas DC-9]].&lt;ref&gt;Endicott 2001, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dc9 pasco jet&quot; /&gt;

An [[initial public offering]] occurred in 1984 to secure operating capital, which after only one profitable year since founding, was needed to keep the airline afloat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9WoVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k-EDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5504,7628871&amp;dq=horizon-air+stock|title=Horizon Air says it plans to issue stock|last=AP|date=1995-05-30|work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]]|publisher=Google News Archives|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 1985 Horizon signed an agreement with [[de Havilland Canada]] to begin purchasing the airline's first brand new aircraft, the [[Bombardier Dash 8|de Haviland Dash 8]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annual report 851&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Annual Report, 1985|publisher=Horizon Air|page=1|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dash8 first ones&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JLcSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pPkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2580,569222&amp;dq=horizon-air|title=Horizon Air orders 10 planes|date=1985-09-04|work=Spokane Chronicle|publisher=Google News Archives|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1985, Horizon entered into its first [[codeshare agreement]] with [[United Airlines]],&lt;ref&gt;Endicott 2001, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; which attracted the attention of [[Alaska Airlines]] who finally purchased Horizon in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Endicott 2001, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1985 Horizon entered into an agreement to purchase their chief competitor in Washington, [[Cascade Airways]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cascade bought&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U7YSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r_kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6012,206560&amp;dq=horizon-air|title=Horizon buying Cascade|last=Associated Press|date=1985-08-01|work=Spokane Chronicle|publisher=Google News Archives|accessdate=2009-09-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by early 1986 were released from the agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;release cascade&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QP8RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Pe8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3593,4835890&amp;dq=horizon-air|title=Horizon released from agreement to buy Cascade|last=Bartel|first=Frank|work=[[Spokane Spokesman-Review]]|publisher=Google News Archives|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988 Horizon signed a codeshare agreement with [[Northwest Airlines]].  In 1989, Horizon became an international carrier when it began service to [[Vancouver, BC]] and [[Victoria, BC]] in May of that year using both Dash-8-100s and [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner]].

===1990s===

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}

Horizon was the launch customer for the [[Dornier 328]] turboprop, intending to replace the Fairchild Metroliners with this new aircraft which promised jetliner speed and comfort.{{citation needed|date+=April 2011|date=April 2011}} Prototype#2 was painted in Horizon colors.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Twelve were delivered between November 1993 and November 1995, but they were quickly phased out in 1997 in favor of fleet standardization around the Dash-8.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===2000s===
{{expand section|more information of events in the early 2000s.|date=September 2009}}
In the spring of 2007, Horizon launched service from Los Angeles and Seattle to Santa Rosa, California to take advantage of the burgeoning wine and tourism industry. This was a significant coup {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} for the Sonoma County region which had not had regularly scheduled air service in almost six years. The new routes proved so popular that in the fall of 2007, Horizon commenced non stop service from Portland, OR to Santa Rosa, and expanded the schedule for non stop flights between Los Angeles and Santa Rosa. It is wholly owned by the Alaska Air Group and has 4,040 employees (at March 2007).&lt;ref name=&quot;FI&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title= Directory: World Airlines | work= [[Flight International]] | page= 91 | date= 2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon Air has been featured in several films, including the 1983  motion picture ''[[WarGames]]'' and 1995 motion picture ''[[Georgia (1995 film)]]''.

===2010s===
[[File:Horizon Q400 LAX N423QX.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Bombardier Q400]] in Alaska/Horizon livery, reflecting the retirement of the Horizon Air brand]]
On August 23, 2010, it was announced that Horizon's business model was to change to having all decisions about route choices and marketing services being made by Alaska Airlines by the beginning of 2011. The business model Alaska Air Group Inc. is adapting is called the &quot;Capacity Purchase Agreement.&quot;  The change would mean that all ticket revenue would go to Alaska Airlines, and Horizon's operating costs would be covered by Alaska Airlines. Before the change, limited amounts of Horizon routes had been operated as such, but more had been run entirely by Horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Horizon Air Changes Business Model|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aviationdaily&amp;id=news/avd/2010/08/23/08.xml&amp;headline=Horizon%20Air%20Changes%20Business%20Model|publisher=Aviation Week|accessdate=26 August 2010|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2011, Alaska Airlines announced{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} that it will be retiring the Horizon Air brand. All Horizon planes will be repainted in the trademarked eskimo Alaska livery, but the service and extras Horizon is known for{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} will stay the same.

==Management==
Glenn Johnson was appointed President of Horizon Air in June 2010, replacing the retiring CEO and President Jeff Pinneo. Johnson joined Alaska Airlines in 1982 as a staff auditor and was promoted to Director of Revenue Accounting. In 1991, he joined Horizon as Vice President of Finance and Treasurer, and was then promoted to Senior Vice President of Customer Services. In 2003, Johnson returned to Alaska to serve as Vice President of Finance and Treasurer for Alaska Air Group and Alaska Airlines, and he was subsequently promoted to Executive Vice President and CFO.

All Horizon Air aircraft are operated in a single class configuration. Each row has two seats on either side of the aisle. As such, there are no middle seats on Horizon, only window or aisle. Horizon Air features all leather seating.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaska-fleet&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskaair.com/content/travel-info/fleet/q400.aspx|title=Bombardier Q400 Aircraft Information|accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[SkyWest Airlines]] would begin operating six of Alaska Airlines' West Coast routes using five Bombardier CRJ-700s purchased from Horizon Air.  SkyWest owns, operates and maintains the aircraft, while Alaska Airlines schedules, prices and markets the flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;crj700s sold to SkyWest&quot;&gt;http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/story/2011/02/Alaska-Airlines-signs-flying-deal-with-SkyWest/44166418/1 Alaska Airlines signs flying deal with SkyWest&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Livery ===
At the start of the carrier, Horizon had a painted sunset with a small beach with capitalized words saying &quot;Horizon&quot;.  Until recently, the current Horizon Air livery was very similar to its parent, Alaska Airlines, except for a dark red (rather than blue) [[Aircraft livery#Cheatline|cheatline]], and the tail includes a stylized sun and sunset logo, rather than an [[Eskimo]]. Eleven Q400s are currently painted in special liveries. Some Dash 8-200's (no longer in service with Horizon Air) had names of Horizon destinations printed near the front left door. 

On January 25, 2011 Horizon Air announced it was retiring its public brand and adopted the trademark Eskimo of its sister company, Alaska Airlines, on its fleet.  As part of the brand change, Horizon's Bombardier Q400 fleet will be repainted with a new paint scheme prominently featuring &quot;Alaska&quot; across the fuselage and the Eskimo on the tail. The plane will continue to include the Horizon logo on the sides of the aircraft, which will now appear in Alaska's dark blue color.

=== Special liveries ===
[[File:Horizon Air Dash 8 Q-400.jpg|thumb|right|The Horizon Air [[Bombardier Dash 8|Bombardier Q400]] in Horizon Air ''&quot;25th Anniversary&quot;'' theme.]]
Eleven Q400s are painted in special liveries: 
* N425QX is a 25th anniversary theme, featuring bright colors and confetti painted along the entire plane.  Casually referred to as either &quot;The Party Plane&quot; or &quot;Skittles.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}
* Two aircraft are painted in the &quot;Comfortably Greener&quot; scheme to highlight the fuel-saving attributes of the Q400 over regional jets. One is N439QX, and N438QX was later painted in the same scheme;&lt;ref name=&quot;Q400-CG&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alaskasworld.com/Newsroom/QXNews/QXstories/QX_20091117_081506.asp|title=Horizon Air Unveils 'Comfortably Greener' Q400 Livery|date=2009-11-17|publisher=Horizon Air|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; together, these two planes are casually referred to as &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Fiona.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}
Many of the airline's special liveries feature the colors and logos of universities located in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2010/10/04/daily5.html Horizon Air to add more college logos to planes] ''Puget Sound Business Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:
