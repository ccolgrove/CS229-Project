{{2006 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''2006 Northwestern Wildcats football team''' represented [[Northwestern University]] in the [[Big Ten Conference]] during the [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season]]. Head coach [[Randy Walker (football coach)|Randy Walker]] died unexpectedly on June 29, 2006 of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 52.  [[Pat Fitzgerald]], seen by many before the tragedy as Walker's eventual successor, was promoted from linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator to head coach on July 7.  The Wildcats also had to replace their offensive coordinator, offensive line coach, and [[Brett Basanez]], the team's former four-year starter at quarterback and holder of dozens of school records.  Not surprisingly, the 2006 season was not as successful as previous years.

Northwestern began their season with a win at [[2006 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami]], Walker's alma mater, in an emotional game that featured several tributes to the late coach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAF_20060831_NW@MIAOH Miami (Ohio) RedHawks, NCAA Football, Northwestern Wildcats - CBSSports.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the season went downhill from there.  The second game was a blowout loss to I-AA [[New Hampshire Wildcats|New Hampshire]].  The low point of the season came on October 21 with a home loss to [[2006 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] in which the Spartans staged the largest [[Michigan State vs. Northwestern, 2006|comeback]] in Division I-A history.  A win against [[2006 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] in the final game gave the Wildcats a 4-8 record for the year and saved them from finishing last in the Big Ten.  The high point of the season, despite coming in defeat, was Northwestern's surprisingly close and competitive play against undefeated and #3 ranked [[2006 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]].  Despite being held to -13 rushing yards, the Wildcats came with-on one-possession of tying the game early in the third quarter and prevented the Wolverines from scoring in the fourth quarter en route to a 17-3 final.
