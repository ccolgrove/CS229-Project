===''Little Monk''===
USA Network ordered ten webisodes that would deal with the Monk brothers' childhood.  The first premiered on August 21, 2009.  The series starred Aaron Linker as [[Adrian Monk|Little Monk]] and Chris Lizardi as [[Ambrose Monk|Little Ambrose]], and featured [[Bella Thorne]] as Wendy, one of the Monks' classmates.  The series was directed by Randall Zisk, with Hy Conrad, Andy Breckman, Kevin Albright, and Justin Brenneman serving as writers. Aaron Linker had a chance of stardom on the actual show, where he appeared in a flashback once again as Little Monk.  The webisodes are available only on the &quot;Best of Monk&quot; DVD.
