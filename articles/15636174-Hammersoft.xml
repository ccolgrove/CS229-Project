This is a character list of the Taiwanese series ''[[The X-Family]]'', which was aired between August 8 and October 23, 2007.

==The Xia Lan Xing De Family (å¤è­èå¾· å®¶æ)==
===Xia Xiong (å¤é)===
'''Full name:''' Xia Lan Xing De Xiong (å¤è­èå¾·â§é).&lt;br&gt;'''Blood status:''' Pure-blood.&lt;br&gt;'''Age:''' 43 years old.&lt;br&gt;'''Aura:''' Red.&lt;br&gt;'''Position in the family:''' Mother of [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Yu (å¤å®) / Gui Feng (é¬¼é³³)|Xia Yu]] (å¤å®), [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] (å¤å¤©), and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)|Xia Mei]] (å¤ç¾).&lt;br&gt;'''Status:''' Alive.&lt;br&gt;'''Actress:''' [[Pauline Lan]] (èå¿æ¹).

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;As the sole bread winner in the family and owner of a truck company, she takes on the roles that traditionally belong to fathers and sons.

*''Wanting a normal life'':
Despite her tough exterior, she desires the closeness and comfort of a normal family life.

She wants her children to lead normal lives, so she sealed Xia Tian and Xia Mei's powers with a pair of &quot;Feng Long Tie&quot; (å°é¾è²¼ / ''Seal Dragon Patch'') since they were young. Of all her children, she worries about Xia Tian the most. His closeness with his father upsets her because she does not want her son to follow his father's footsteps in becoming a musician. But he eventually convinces her to let him pursue his dream when he sings her favourite song while kneeling outside their house to beg for her permission.

*''Hobbies'':
She loves to cook, but most people are repulsed by her cooking because she makes the worst food and would do anything to avoid eating it. The only people who enjoy her cooking are [[List of The X-Family characters#Demon Hunter (æ¬é­çµå£«)|Demon Hunter]], [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Wu (ç¸è)|Jiu Wu]] and herself, which explains why she doesn't stop making food even though everybody else protests.

*''Love life'':
She divorced [[List of The X-Family characters#Ye Si Ren (èæä»)|Ye Si Ren]] because he was irresponsible as a father and unfaithful as a husband. But though her marriage fell apart years ago, she still loves Ye Si Ren and desires his company. When Ye Si Ren reveals his identity as a member of the evil [[The X-Family#Yi Neng Families|Ye He Na La Family]], she finally expresses her true feelings and the two of them become closer than before. But obstacles don't stop coming in-between them from there; First, they learn that [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han]] (Xia Tian's girlfriend) is Ye Si Ren's long lost daughter, thus ruins their plan to reconcile their marriage. Secondly, Ye Si Ren's father uses her ex-husband and her son Xia Tian as pawns to take over the world and she is forced to fight back the constant obstacles coming for them. And finally, Xia Xiong gets trapped in &quot;Shi Kong Jia Feng&quot; (æç©ºå¤¾ç¸« / ''separate-dimensional wall'') and her loved ones almost forgot about her in the process. But after going through these obstacles, the two finally end up together.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;Because of her manly personality, people usually refer to her as &quot;Xiong Ge&quot; (éå¥ / ''Big Brother Xiong''). People including her father [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Liu (å¤æµ)|Xia Liu]], her ex-husband Ye Si Ren, and her eldest son Xia Yu.

Aside from her average nickname, she also has three other nicknames; Xia Mei calls her &quot;Lao Mu Da Ling&quot; (èæ¯éä»¤ / ''Mummy Darling''), and Xia Tian calls her &quot;Lao Ma&quot; (èåª½ / ''Mom'') and finally [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]] calls her &quot;Fu Ren&quot; (å¤«äºº - ''Madam''), a title she is highly amused of.

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;In the initial episodes, she wears a metal glove called &quot;Qilin Shou&quot;  (éºéºæ / ''[[Qilin]] Glove'') to cast a family spell called &quot;Qi Lin Mai Chong Guang Tao Can&quot; (éºéºèè¡åå¥é¤).

Later, she uses a gun named &quot;Wu Feng&quot; (çé¢¨ / ''[[Zaocys]]''), which was given to her by [[List of The X-Family characters#The Great Traveler (ç¥è¡è) / The God of Guns (æ§éç)|the God of Guns]] years ago. It is powerful enough to kill any evil entity and to temporarily transfer the combined power of 99 spirits trapped in the gun to a person who is completely pure in heart and mind with the help of [[List of The X-Family characters#The Great Traveler (ç¥è¡è) / The God of Guns (æ§éç)|the Great Traveler]]. While the God of Guns can access the gun's full potential, she can only access 30 percent of its powers.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

===Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)===
'''Full name:''' Xia Lan Xing De Tian (å¤è­èå¾·â§å¤©).&lt;br&gt;'''Blood status:''' Half-blood (Pure &amp; Dark).&lt;br&gt;'''Age:''' 18 years old.&lt;br&gt;'''Aura:''' Green.&lt;br&gt;'''Position in the family:''' The middle child of the three siblings.&lt;br&gt;'''Status:''' Alive.&lt;br&gt;'''Actor:''' [[Jiro Wang]] (æ±ªæ±å) - ''[[Fahrenheit (Taiwanese band)|Fahrenheit]] (é£è¼ªæµ·) / [[Dong Cheng Wei]] (æ±åè¡)''.

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Xia Tian (''Summer'' in translation) is a sweet kid with a good heart, but he often gets taken advantage of due to his naivety. Though he is born with powerful abilities, he dislikes using them.

*''Dreams'':
He dreams to follow his fatherâs footsteps and become a musician, an idea his mother strongly opposes to initially. But he convinces her to allow him to follow his dream, and then becomes the lead singer of [[Dong Cheng Wei]] (æ±åè¡).

*''Destined for greatness'':
Since he made little effort in controlling his powerful but unstable abilities, a &quot;Feng Long Tie&quot; (å°é¾è²¼) was placed on his neck making him no different from a &quot;Ma Gua&quot; (éº»ç / ''Muggle''). [[List of The X-Family characters#Xiu (è©)|Xiu]] believes Xia Tian has the potential to become a &quot;Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren&quot; (çµæ¥µéµåäºº/ ''Ultimate Iron Man''), a savior of worlds, so he taught Xia Tian to play guitar and control Gui Long (é¬¼é¾ / ''Ghostly Dragon'') - his evil half with greater power, who on several occasions, attempts to destroy Xia Tian in order to become the dominant personality. But although they are enemies, they have once come together to fight against [[List of The X-Family characters#Zack|Zack]], their evil counterpart from the Bronze Dimension. Despite Xia Tianâs inability to control Gui Long, his mother made him the guardian of the Xia family heirloom, the &quot;Feng Long Ka&quot; (å°é¾å¡ / ''Seal Dragon Card''), a mini disk containing everything about &quot;power-users&quot; (ç°è½è¡è). In order for Xia Tian to become Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren, he must find the five original power-users of ''wind, fire, thunder, lightning'' and ''rain'' (åä½ç°è½è¡è) and collect their elements. In the end, he succeeds in collecting the five elemental powers and becomes the legendary Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren.

*''Love life'':
His biggest motivation for developing his power and guitar skills is [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han]], a girl he met when he was a child and has liked ever since. To save her life, he rushed into &quot;Mie&quot; (æ» / ''destruction'') to rescue her trapped soul and was willing to trade his soul for hers. When they both safely returned to the human world, their love blossomed, but not without trials. First, his father told him Han was his half-sister. They were forced to separate and treat each other with indifference. Then, he found out Han was part his paternal grandfatherâs conspiracy to dominate the world. But the good news is that he and Han are not related and the two finally get a happy ending.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;[[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)|Xia Mei]] calls him &quot;Xiao Ge&quot; (å°å¥ / ''Little Big Brother'').

[[List of The X-Family characters#Ren Chen Wen (ä»»æ¨æ)|Ren Chen Wen]] sometimes calls him &quot;Tian Ge&quot; (å¤©å¥ / ''Big Brother Tian'') along with [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mi (çç¥) &amp; Wa Ge (èå¥)|Xia Mi]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mi (çç¥) &amp; Wa Ge (èå¥)|Wa Ge]], however, he is more common to call him &quot;Wo De Tian Ge&quot; (æçå¤©å¥ / ''My Big Brother Tian'').

His evil half Gui Long sometimes calls him &quot;Xiao Tian Tian&quot; (å°å¤©å¤© / ''Little Tian'') to mock him.

'''Specialty:'''
*''As Gui Long'':
When he takes off the Feng Long Tie, he transforms into Gui Long and becomes unable to control his actions. But thanks to Xiu, he learns a spell to help him control Gui Long. Eventually he becomes strong enough to suppress him without using the Feng Long Tie. Gui Long's main weapon is the guitar pick &quot;Gui Long Pi Ke&quot; (é¬¼é¾éå / ''Gui Long Guitar Pick'') as his weapon, into which the Feng Long Ka is embedded. His notable, yet lowest ability is to impregnant people through a simple kiss (this implies boys as well). Those who fall victim will become pregnant, smile crazily and be flirtatious for three days before the effect wears off.

Gui Long disappears when [[List of The X-Family characters#The Master (èæé)|the Master]], his paternal grandfather, executes his plan to dominate the world, causing half of his powers to disappear along with Gui Long. Gui Long's disappearance makes Xia Tian the dominant personality.

*''As Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren'':
When Xia Tian finally becomes Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren, he becomes able to cast all kinds of spells that were previously used and can use the legendary guitar &quot;Tie Ke Wu Ji&quot; (éµåç¡æ¥µ / ''Iron Limitless'') as his primary weapon and also uses the Feng Long Ka as his guitar pick.

'''Alternate counterparts:''' &lt;br&gt;
Xia Tian / Gui Long has three alternate counterparts introduced throughout the Zhong Ji series:
:In the Gold Dimension: [[List of KO One characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Wang Da Dong]] the leader of Zhong Ji Yi Ban (çµæ¥µä¸ç­) from the first series [[KO One]] (çµæ¥µä¸ç­).
:In the Bronze Dimension: [[List of The X-Family characters#Zack|Zack]] a well-known psycho killer sent to the Iron Dimension in attempt to make [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] stronger from the second series [[The X-Family]] (ç»æä¸å®¶).
:In the Silver Dimension: [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Sun Ce (å­«ç­)|Sun Ce]] the student-body president of [[K.O.3an Guo#Schools|Jiangdong High School]] (æ±æ±é«æ ¡) and [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Sun Shang Xiang (å­«å°é¦)|Sun Shang Xiang]]'s older brother from the third series [[K.O.3an Guo]] (çµæ¥µä¸å).

Xia Tian and Da Dong share a similar ability in being able to vary the level of their own powers to their opponent's. It is no doubt that Zack might share this same ability as well.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

===Xia Yu (å¤å®) / Gui Feng (é¬¼é³³)===
'''Full name:''' Xia Lan Xing De Yu (å¤è­èå¾·â§å®).&lt;br&gt;'''Blood status:''' Half-blood.&lt;br&gt;'''Age:''' 20 years old.&lt;br&gt;'''Aura:''' Light yellow.&lt;br&gt;'''Position in the family:''' The eldest of the three siblings.&lt;br&gt;'''Status:''' Alive.&lt;br&gt;'''Actor:''' [[Danson Tang]] (åç¦¹å²).

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Xia Yu (sounds like &quot;raining&quot; (ä¸é¨) in some ways) rarely worries his mother. As a student majoring in law and finance at [[National Taiwan University]], he is great with money and handles the family budget, and is also a money-lover. He always cooks and takes care of his younger siblings during his mother's absence.

*''Secret wishes'':
Despite being the person everyone trusts and relies on, he resents being the only &quot;Ma Gua&quot; (éº»ç) in the family and doing the menial jobs around the home. His resentment grows when he finds out that his mother had given the &quot;Feng Long Ka&quot; (å°é¾å¡) to [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] instead of him, the eldest son, because of his Ma Gua status. Evil sees his jealousy and uses that to turn him evil by giving him a ring to absorb other people's powers. The ring unwittingly unlocks Xia Yu's sealed power. As it turns out, he is not a Ma Gua by birth. Rather, his father secretly sealed his power upon birth because he exhibited the pure evil genes. When he fully comes into his powers, his dark instincts start to take over. The situation forces his father to use &quot;Xi Hun Qu&quot; (æ´é­æ² / ''Soul Cleansing Melody'') to cleanse his soul and seal his power again.

*''Coming into his power'':
Xia Yu's powers remain sealed until his [[List of The X-Family characters#The Master (èæé)|paternal grandfather]]'s plan to take over the world backfires causing a beam of dark energy to strike directly at him, turning him into &quot;Gui Feng&quot; (é¬¼é³³ / ''Ghostly Phoenix''), who is the &quot;original power-user of fire&quot; (ç«çåä½ç°è½è¡è). Gui Feng is so powerful that not even a &quot;Feng Long Tie&quot; (å°é¾è²¼) can suppress him completely. But since his element is needed to help Xia Tian become &quot;Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren&quot; (çµæ¥µéµåäºº), they cannot strip his powers away. His family eventually finds a way to contain Gui Feng by using &quot;Bing Gu Zhou&quot; (å°ç®å) to cool his fire, which gives Xia Yu the time that he needs to learn how to control Gui Feng.

Although Gui Feng is more powerful than Gui Long, he appears to be not as arrogant as he was and sometimes shows a caring side though he tries to hide it.

Because demonized power-users can convert other people's powers into their own, there is a possibility that Gui Feng is actually the reincarnation of Gui Long, since both have similar personalities. Plus there is a fact that whoever falls victim to the Soul Cleansing Melody will receive a different type of supernatural abilities if he ever regains powers.

*''Love life'':
Although Xia Yu does not have any real love interest in the story, he has once fallen for the [[List of The X-Family characters#Fire Ant Girl (ç«è»å¥³)|Fire Ant Girl]], a demonic assassin that his paternal grandfather sent to attack his family and got caught by his maternal grandfather. He learns the ant-language so as to communicate with her and to interpret for the others and he truly cared for her. However, their relationship breaks after she is killed by Xia Tian's evil counterpart, [[List of The X-Family characters#Zack|Zack]].

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;[[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)|Xia Mei]] often calls Xia Yu &quot;Shi Li Gui&quot; (å¢å©é¬¼ - meaning something similar to ''Snob'') as well as &quot;Si Ma Gua&quot; (æ­»éº»ç - meaning &quot;Stupid Muggle&quot; but directly translated to &quot;Dead Muggle&quot;).

Xia Tian calls him &quot;Lao Ge&quot; (èå¥ / ''Big Brother'').

[[List of The X-Family characters#Ren Chen Wen (ä»»æ¨æ)|Ren Chen Wen]], [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mi (çç¥) &amp; Wa Ge (èå¥)|Xia Mi]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mi (çç¥) &amp; Wa Ge (èå¥)|Wa Ge]] call him &quot;Yu Ge&quot; (å®å¥ / ''Big Brother Yu'').

[[List of The X-Family characters#Ye Si Ren (èæä»)|Ye Si Ren]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Gui Long]] have at some point called him &quot;Xiao Yu&quot; (å°å® / ''Little Yu''), a name that is similar with [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Wu (ç¸è)|Jiu Wu]]'s counterpart, [[List of The X-Family characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Xiao Yu]] (å°é¨).

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;As the original power-user of fire, Xia Yu/Gui Feng can manipulate heat.

Aside from Gui Feng's existence, Xia Yu can easily absorb outside energy like other demonized power-users (é­åç°è½è¡è) even without powers, and can also understand certain demonic languages, thanks to the genes he inherited from his dad.

'''Alternate counterpart:''' &lt;br&gt;
Xia Yu has one alternate counterpart introduced throughout the Zhong Ji series:
:In the Gold Dimension: [[List of KO One characters#Lei Ke Si (é·åæ¯) / Wu Shi Duo (æ­¦å±å¥ª)|Lei Ke Si (é·åæ¯)]] from the first series [[KO One]] (çµæ¥µä¸ç­). Lei Ke Si is [[List of The X-Family characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Wang Da Dong]]'s childhood friend. Both Xia Yu and Lei Ke Si are good at their studies and have revealed evil tendencies at some point. Although Lei Ke Si did not appear in the storyline, he did appear in the introduction theme, a flashback of his battle against his enemy and as an image of KO 2 on the Top Ten KO News.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

===Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)===
'''Full name:''' Xia Lan Xing De Mei (å¤è­èå¾·â§ç¾).&lt;br&gt;'''Blood status:''' Half-blood.&lt;br&gt;'''Age:''' 17 years old.&lt;br&gt;'''Aura:''' Deep blue.&lt;br&gt;'''Position in the family:''' The youngest and only daughter in the family.&lt;br&gt;'''Status:''' Alive.&lt;br&gt;'''Actress:''' Sunnie Huang (é»å°æ).

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Despite being born in a powerful magic family, Xia Mei is the only base-levelled power-user, which makes her the least powerful member in the family. Nevertheless, she is strongest among lower-level power-users. Like her mother, she has anger issues, and is very persistent; pretty much the only [[kuso]] in the home. Between her two brothers, [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] is the one she likes the most because he is often understanding while [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Yu (å¤å®) / Gui Feng (é¬¼é³³)|Xia Yu]] only cares for money and benefits, which makes her want to tease him every now and then.

*''Love life'':
Initially, she has a crush on [[List of The X-Family characters#Xiu (è©)|Xiu]], the guitarist in the band [[Dong Cheng Wei]] (æ±åè¡), but later falls for [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]]. She is so obsessed with Lan Ling Wang that she is willing to sacrifice anything for him. However, when she realizes how much Lan Ling Wang truly loves his fiancÃ©e [[List of The X-Family characters#Bing Xin (å°å¿)|Bing Xin]], she decides to give them her full support. Including arranging a wedding for them and giving Bing Xin the wedding dress her mother kept for her own wedding. In the end, she still loves the guy, but they remain friends.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;She is called &quot;Mei Mei Jie&quot; (ç¾ç¾å§ / ''Big Sister Mei Mei'') by [[List of The X-Family characters#Ren Chen Wen (ä»»æ¨æ)|Ren Chen Wen]] (ä»»æ¨æ).

Xia Tian calls her &quot;Lao Mei&quot; (èå¦¹ / ''Little Sister'').

Xia Yu calls her &quot;Hua Chi Mei&quot; (è±ç´ç¾ / referring to a girl who gets obsessed with every cute guy she sees).

Her father sometimes calls her &quot;Mei Mei&quot; (ç¾ç¾ - ç¾ meaning beautiful) or &quot;Mei Mei&quot; (å¦¹å¦¹ - meaning little sister).

Her mother calls her &quot;Tong Xue&quot; (åå­¸ / ''Classmate'') when she does or says something inappropriate.

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;By ripping off her Feng Long Tie (å°é¾è²¼) partially, Xia Mei becomes able to use her power of electricity to attack people; Ren Chen Wen often falls victim to her power of electricity. However, since her powers belong to basic level, she cannot do any serious damage.

When she rips off her Feng Long Tie completely, she becomes Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨ / ''Ghostly Doll''), and becomes able to scare people with [[List of The X-Family characters#Zhen Zi (è²å­)|Zhen Zi]] (è²å­ - a demon from the movie [[Ring (film)|The Ring]]), a ghost-like demon with pale skin and a green glow, which she cojures with a little puppet that appears along when she transforms.

Unlike her brothers, her consciousness remains in her evil form, making her the only sibling that doesn't have much problem controlling her evil half. But when she becomes Gui Wa, her instincts to scare people become overwhelming.

'''Alternate counterpart:''' &lt;br&gt;
Xia Mei has one alternate counterpart introduced throughout the Zhong Ji series:
:In the Gold Dimension: [[List of The X-Family characters#Sha Jie (çå§)|Sha Jie]] from the first series [[KO One]] (çµæ¥µä¸ç­). Both Xia Mei and Sha Jie are instinctive, they act very petty and hostile against those they hate and are passionate or rather obsessive towards those they love. However, Sha Jie is more devoted. Sha Jie does not appear in the storyline, but she does appear in the introduction theme alongside [[List of The X-Family characters#Lei Ke Si (é·åæ¯)|Lei Ke Si]] Xia Yu's alternate counterpart.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

===Xia Liu (å¤æµ)===
'''Full name:''' Xia Lan Xing De Liu (å¤è­èå¾·â§æµ).&lt;br&gt;'''Blood status:''' Pure-blood.&lt;br&gt;'''Age:''' 70 years old.&lt;br&gt;'''Aura:''' Lavender.&lt;br&gt;'''Position in the family:''' The playful grandfather of [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] (å¤å¤©), [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Yu (å¤å®) / Gui Feng (é¬¼é³³)|Xia Yu]] (å¤å®) and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)|Xia Mei]] (å¤ç¾); and the head of the family.&lt;br&gt;'''Status:''' Alive.&lt;br&gt;'''Actor:''' Chen Bo Zheng / Ah Xi (é³åæ­£ / é¿è¥¿).

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Xia Liu (because his name sounds like &quot;pervert&quot; (ä¸æµ), his name is often dragged into that theme) literally sleeps ''under'' the house as the entrance to his bedroom is located under the living room table. Xia Liu is the guardian of the entrance to the ghostly dimension, Mie (æ»). He may be senile, but he is also the most powerful member in the family: that is before Xia Tian becomes the superior member. His lack of memories is sometimes part of what made the show interesting. This old man may be stubborn, but is also kind-hearted. And farts when something upsets him.

*''Hobbies'':
During free-time, he likes to hang out with his friends, [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Lai (ç¸è)|Jiu Lai]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Demon Hunter (æ¬é­çµå£«)|Demon Hunter]], on a mountain where they can be alone and discuss things. Pizza and bubble tea are two of his favourite meals. Xia Liu is excellent at sewing when he is motivated.

*''Hatred towards Ye Si Ren and Lan Ling Wang'':
He despises [[List of The X-Family characters#Ye Si Ren (èæä»)|Ye Si Ren]] even before he married his daughter, and his dislike towards him grows when he finds out that he is a member of the Ye He Na La family, but learns to accept him over time, though he keeps accusing Ye Si Ren for things that he has not done. He doesn't like [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]] at first either, but after he sacrifices himself to save their world, he starts to change his mind. Xia Liu has given each of them a golden watch, claiming that he only has one and that &quot;it&quot; can only be given to someone heroic and worthy, when the truth is that he has a whole collection of golden watches in his bedroom.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;Everyone knows him as &quot;Ah Gong&quot; (é¿å¬ / ''Maternal Grandpa''). [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Wu (ç¸è)|Jiu Wu]] called him &quot;Xia Liu Qian Bei&quot; (å¤æµåè¾ / ''Senior Xia Liu'') before joining the others.

Some people are more common to call him &quot;Xia Liu Ah Gong&quot; (å¤æµé¿å¬ / ''Grandpa Xia Liu'').

His daughter [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xia Xiong]] calls him &quot;Ba&quot; (ç¸ / ''Dad'') and Ye Si Ren calls him &quot;Qian Ye Fu Da Ren&quot; (åå²³ç¶å¤§äºº / ''Former Father-in-law'').

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;Removing people's memories is one of Xia Liu's many abilities, and is the first one to be used on screen.

His main weapon is a pair of [[cymbal]]s called &quot;Ke Mo Ba&quot; (åé­é¸), which he uses to attack with sound waves and to cast spells. His most notable attacks are eight spells that are mainly used for fighting evils, called &quot;Jiang Mo Ba Jue&quot; (éé­å«è¨£). Other than Ke Mo Ba, he has been seen wielding a trumpet called &quot;Long Wen Hao&quot; (é¾ç´å) to enhance the effects of his freezing spell. He also has a staff called &quot;Jiang Mo Jiang&quot; (éé­é) specifically used for exorcism, however, the weapon was never shown.

Xia Liu is capable of summoning the family spirits to assist them at times.

He also knows a technique to astral project his soul into another's body called &quot;Tai Xu Yun You Su&quot; (å¤ªèé²éè¡).

'''Alternate counterparts:''' &lt;br&gt;
Xia Liu has two alternate counterparts introduced throughout the Zhong Ji series:
:In the Gold Dimension: [[List of KO One characters#Wang Tian Yang (æ±ªå¤©é¤)|Wang Tian Yang]], formerly known as the powerful assassin âDao Fengâ (åç) and is also the father of [[List of KO One characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Wang Da Dong]] from the first series [[KO One]] (çµæ¥µä¸ç­).
:In the Silver Dimension: [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Dong Zhuo (è£å)|Dong Zhuo]] the villainous ruler and principal of [[K.O.3an Guo#Schools|Hedong Institute]] (æ²³æ±å­¸é¢) and later the principal of [[K.O.3an Guo#Schools|East Han Academy]] (æ±æ¼¢æ¸é¢) from the third series [[K.O.3an Guo]](çµæ¥µä¸å). Xia Liu was mentioned when Guan Yu asked Xiu how he knew Dong Zhuo so well, which was when Xiu thought of Xia Liu.

*''Care for his family'':
Because of his naÃ¯vety and unfaithfulness, he and Xia Xiong's marriage ended years ago, but he still has feelings for her as demonstrated by his interference with Xia Xiong's dates. Even though he was not a very good husband, he is a very good father, and will do anything in his capacity to protect his family.

*''Revelation'':
From the start, he appears as a Ma Gua (éº»ç) to everybody, but when Xia Yu's dark powers begin to manifest, he reveals himself as the head member of the [[The X-Family#Yi Neng Families|Ye He Na La family]] (èèµ«é£å¦å®¶æ) and plays the Xi Hun Qu (æ´é­æ² / ''Soul Cleansing Melody'') in order to cleanse Xia Yu's evil instincts and powers.

*''Love life'':
According to himself, he met Xia Xiong when his family attacked hers twenty-three years ago, and fell in love with her at first sight. But because they were arch-enemies, he had to pretend to be a Ma Gua to be able to be with her. However, though he was deeply in love with Xia Xiong, his evil instincts always tried to make him drain her powers, so he relinquished his powers in order to be with her for real.

When things between him and Xia Xiong finally start to get back on track, he discovers that Han is his long-lost daughter, and has no choice but to split up Xia Tian and Han. Then, when things start to get back on track... again, his father comes into picture and ruins everything... again. But everything turns around in the end and he finally gets to live happily ever after with his family.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;Ye Si Ren has the nickname &quot;Si Ren&quot; (æ­»äºº/''Dead Man''), a nickname that Xia Xiong and Xia Liu often use on him, and on occasions call him &quot;Ye Si Ren&quot; (èæ­»äºº).

He is also known as &quot;Si Ren Tuan Zhang&quot; (æ­»äººåå¼µ / ''Dead Man Leader'') to other people.

His children call him &quot;Lao Ba&quot; (èç¸ / ''Dad'').

Lan Ling Wang calls him by the title &quot;Da Shao Ye&quot; (å¤§å°çº / ''Eldest Young Master'').

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;Ye Si Ren possesses two of his family's most valuable objects: &quot;Sou Hun Qu&quot; (èé­æ² / ''Soul Collecting Melody'') which has the power to revive people, and &quot;Xi Hun Qu&quot; (æ´é­æ² / ''Soul Cleansing Melody'') that has the power to cleanse a demonized power-user's powers and evil instincts.

Though he is not a power-user anymore, he still possesses certain abilities that Ma Gua and regular power-users don't have, such as the ability to see past events that occurred to someone else in the form of dreams, and to translate a demonic language that only Mo Hua Yi Neng Xing Zhe can understand.

'''Alternate counterparts:''' &lt;br&gt;
Unlike the others, Ye Si Ren has two alternate counterparts in the Gold Dimension named [[List of The X-Family characters#Duan Chang Ren (æ·è¸äºº)|Duan Chang Ren]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Hei Long (é»é¾)|Hei Long]]. They both gave up their abilities for respective reasons.

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Lan Ling Wang was once a highly trained soldier and commander for the Ye He Na La family. His clothing is almost an exact duplicate to the [[Final Fantasy VII]] character, [[Cloud Strife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://y200000012.110mb.com/fack/1.htm :: å¤ªç©ºæ°å£«åæè¥²è¯ç ::]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://y200000012.110mb.com/fack/pic/t7NG9ogw.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; His lifestyle is pretty retro.

When Lan Ling Wang first appears in the story, he just appears and disappears around the Xia family and [[Dong Cheng Wei]] (æ±åè¡), and was ordered to find &quot;Sou Hun Qu&quot; (èé­æ² / ''Soul Collecting Melody'') and &quot;Xi Hun Qu&quot; (æ´é­æ² / ''Soul Cleansing Melody'').

*''Painful times'':
He challenges [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] in a duel to reclaim the melodies, but then he hears from his dying minion that the young master has captured his family and destroyed his army. [[List of The X-Family characters#Ye Si Ren (èæä»)|Ye Si Ren]] gives him the melodies in hopes that he would be able to use them as trade for his family. However, his attempt turns to a disappointment when he finds out that his family has already been eliminated. When he tries to claim revenge on the young master, he has his powers drained by a &quot;Gui Ling Yan Huo Qiu&quot; (é¬¼éç°ç«ç / ''Ghostly Fireball'') and becomes a Ma Gua (éº»ç) for a time throughout the series, until [[List of The X-Family characters#The Master (èæé)|the Master]] of the Ye He Na La family executes his plan to dominate the world, and Lan Ling Wang learns a spell from his ancestor to ruin his plan, and as result displaces the Ye Ha Na La family's power and has his powers restored, as well as making [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Yu (å¤å®) / Gui Feng (é¬¼é³³)|Xia Yu]] come into his own power. However, the side effect is [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xia Xiong]] getting trapped in &quot;Shi Kong Jia Feng&quot; (æç©ºå¤¾ç¸« / ''separate-dimensional wall'').

*''The Seven Stars Curse'':
When Lan Ling Wang first lost his powers, he finds out that someone had put a &quot;Qi Xin Zhou&quot; (ä¸æå / ''Seven Stars Curse'') on his family six generations ago. And if he, the seventh generation, cannot lift the curse before the eighth generation is born, then the following generations will lose their true powers and become slaves of the Ye He Na La Family forever. But if he can lift it, he will gather up the energy of hatred that his ancestors have collected over the centuries and turn him into a &quot;Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren&quot; (çµæ¥µéµåäºº / ''Ultimate Iron Man''). In the end, he only lifts half-the curse and becomes six times stronger than before. According to [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Wu (ç¸è)|Jiu Wu]], he also has the biggest chance of becoming Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren than Xia Tian. But Lan Ling Wang himself is resistant to the idea, because the thought never occurred and add the fact that his family was killed because of supernatural abilities made him reluctant to using his powers.

*''Love life'':
Although he knows that [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)|Xia Mei]] is in love with him, he only loves one person; [[List of The X-Family characters#Bing Xin (å°å¿)|Bing Xin]] - [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han]]'s twin sister, who he thought was dead until Han senses her pain. With his friends' help, he finally finds her and gets to spend three days with her before she dies. Thanks to Xia Mei's help, they manage to get married and then say goodbye to each other in the morning.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;Xia Mei nicknames him &quot;Xiao Lan Lan&quot; (å°è­è­ / ''Little Lan Lan'').

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;Lan Ling Wang carries a sword from the spiritual realm known as &quot;Lan Ling Zhan&quot; (æéæ¬), and can use it to gather destructive energy and produce a powerful blast called &quot;Fen Jian Da Fa&quot; (å¼åå¤§æ³), which can eliminate everything within 100 miles, including himself.

When Xia Mei accidentally strikes Lan Ling Wang with her electricity, he just stands there seemingly unharmed by it, and then they realize that he is the &quot;original power-user of lightning&quot; (é»çåä½ç°è½è¡è), which explains why he is immune to electricity even as a Ma Gua.

'''Alternate counterpart:''' &lt;br&gt;Lan Ling Wang is the alternate counterpart of [[List of characters of The X-Family#Wang Ya Se (çäºç)|Wang Ya Se]]; both are as stubborn and courageous when it comes to saving their friends and families.

===Jiu Wu (ç¸è)===
'''Full name:''' Jiu Da Zhang Lao Wu (ç¸äº£é¸èâ§è).&lt;br&gt;'''Blood status:''' Pure-blood.&lt;br&gt;'''Age:''' 17 years old.&lt;br&gt;'''Aura:''' Golden yellow.&lt;br&gt;'''Status:''' Alive.&lt;br&gt;'''Actor:''' [[Aaron Yan]] (çäºç¶¸) - ''[[Fahrenheit (Taiwanese band)|Fahrenheit]] (é£è¼ªæµ·)''.

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Jiu Wu (sounds like ''ninety-five'') is the newly ascended ruler of the Iron Dimension. An organization called [[The X-Family#Others|Tie Ke Jin Wei Jun]] (éµåç¦è¡è» / ''The Iron Imperial Army'') is under his control to protect the Iron Dimension.

When he first appears, he has a deep, strange voice which makes him seem powerful and out of the ordinary. But after about twelve episodes, his powerful voice returned to a normal one.

He has a younger brother named [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Lai (ç¸è)|Jiu Lai]], who has the appearance of an old man due to his misuse of supernatural powers. Because he rarely reveals himself, people that know his brother assume that their appearances and ages would be alike; some even refer their names to be similar.

*''Responsibilities as the ruler'':
As the ruler, his main responsibility is to preserve &quot;Fang Hu Ci Chang&quot; (é²è­·ç£å ´ / ''Defense Magnetic Shield'') that protects their world from outside attacks: if he gets hurt, the shield will weaken allowing evils to invade their world; but as he keeps on preserving the force field, it also weakens him in the process, making him unable to use his powers under certain circumstances.

*''Love Life'':
Once when Jiu Wu was kept in Ye Si Ren's titanium coffin, he developed some feelings for Han as a side effect. But once he stopped laying in the coffin, the feelings disappeared quickly.

*''Hobbies'':
Jiu Wu is a big-eater, and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xiong Ge]]'s cooking is his favourite. Ever since he stopped by for the first time and tasted her food, he has been unable to get the taste out of his mouth.

*''Finding Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren'':
From the start, Jiu Wu can already tell that both [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] have the potential to become &quot;Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren&quot; (çµæ¥µéµåäºº), although he believes that Lan Ling Wang's chance is bigger. He can also tell that [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Yu (å¤å®) / Gui Feng (é¬¼é³³)|Xia Yu]] is no ordinary Ma Gua upon meeting the first time, though he does not seem to know anything about him other than that.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;Jiu Wu is mostly called by the title &quot;Meng Zhu&quot; (çä¸» / means something like ''master'' or ''ruler''). Only [[List of The X-Family characters#The Master (èæé)|the Master]] has called him by his name so far.

His master, [[List of The X-Family characters#The Great Traveler (ç¥è¡è) / The God of Guns (æ§éç)|the Great Traveler]] (ç¥è¡è) calls him &quot;Xiao Wu&quot; (å°è / ''Little Wu'').

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;Jiu Wu has been famous since young for his &quot;Jiu Bu Qin Gui Shou&quot; (ä¹æ­¥æé¬¼æ), which indicates the ability to find the opponent's [[Achilles' Heel]] within nine steps. No one has ever escaped this attack until he meets the father of the Ye He Na La Family. This ability was never seen on-screen, only mentioned.

He can also create force fields that prevent evil from entering, and separate part of his power for further use while still having the force field on.

After [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han]] is found out to be the &quot;original power-user of thunder&quot;, Jiu Wu reveals himself as the &quot;original power-user of rain&quot; (é¨çåä½ç°è½è¡è). But because his energy is needed to support the force field that protects the Iron Dimension, he cannot transfer his element to Xia Tian or go to the Gold Dimension to restore the powers of his alternate counterpart, Ding Xiao Yu.

'''Alternate counterpart:'''&lt;br&gt;
Jiu Wu has one alternate counterpart introduced throughout the Zhong Ji series:
:In the Gold Dimension: [[List of The X-Family characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Ding Xiao Yu]] one of the main protagonists from the first series [[KO One]] (çµæ¥µä¸ç­).

Unlike his alternate counterpart [[List of The X-Family characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Ding Xiao Yu]], Jiu Wu is more playful, optimistic and likes to talk a lot and occasionally makes up cold jokes. Aside from looking alike, there appears to be nothing in common between the two.

'''Threequel:''' &lt;br&gt;In ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å), [[List of The X-Family characters#Xiu (è©)|Xiu]] mentioned that Jiu Wu had forbidden everyone from traveling to other dimensions ever since the balance of the worlds was restored.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

===Xiu (è©)===

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;Xiu is the leader and guitarist in the band, [[Dong Cheng Wei]] (æ±åè¡).

*''Teaching Xia Tian'':
At first he thought that [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] was just a Ma Gua (éº»ç), but when he sensed his special powers he started suspecting that Xia Tian might have the potential to become the legendary Zhong Ji Tie Ke Ren (çµæ¥µéµåäºº), so he becomes Xia Tian's guitar teacher and later trainer.

Because he is usually quiet and focused, it comes surprising to people that he has a playful side.

*''Love life'':
Xiu and [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han]] had a tendency to fight each other the second they see each other due to a genetic hatred, but they manage to overcome that. He later secretly develops a soft spot for Han but does not allow himself to fall in love with her because of his duty. Whenever someone asks questions about his love life, he just replies ''&quot;Dong Cheng Wei only plays music, and don't talk about love (''æ±åè¡åªå½ç´ä¸è«æ'')&quot;''. [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Wu (ç¸è)|Jiu Wu]] once asked why he didn't seize his chance to be with Han when she and Xia Tian were misunderstood as half-siblings, and he replied that he just hoped that they would have a happy ending now that there was nothing separating them anymore.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;[[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Gui Long]] often calls him &quot;Xiao Xiu Xiu&quot; (å°è©è© - ''Little Xiu Xiu'') as a way to mock him.

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;Xiu has the ability to force someone to act according to his commands, a spell that every member in his family is capable of.

He can also use a spell that allows him to talk fast and for the listeners to hear clearly.

His special weapon is a [[guitar pick]] called &quot;Shen Feng Pi Ke&quot; (ç¥é¢¨éå / ''God's Wind Guitar Pick''), which has the power to increase its master's magical abilities and produce healing energy.

Xiu is the &quot;original power-user of wind&quot; (é¢¨çåä½ç°è½è¡è). He is the first to transfer his power to Xia Tian as well as telling him to find the other four original power-users.

'''Connection to KO One:''' &lt;br&gt;Aside from protecting the universe and teaching Xia Tian how to play the guitar as well as teaching him how to control his powers, he is also set on another mission: to find the Iron Dimension counterparts of [[List of The X-Family characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Wang Da Dong]], [[List of The X-Family characters#Wang Ya Se (çäºç)|Wang Ya Se]] (çäºç) and [[List of The X-Family characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Ding Xiao Yu]], and use the counterparts to restore their powers so that they can turn the war between light and darkness in their favor.

Though Xiu did not have an alternate self in the Gold Dimension, he has played a minor role in the series of ''[[KO One]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸ç­) where he played music with Da Dong. Only few people in other dimensions know of his band's existence. In ''[[The X-Family]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å®¶), he is the key figure that connects the two dimensions.

'''Alternate counterpart:'''&lt;br&gt;
Xiu has one alternate counterpart introduced throughout the Zhong Ji series:
:In the Silver Dimension: [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Liu Bei (åå)|Liu Bei]] from the third series [[K.O.3an Guo]] (çµæ¥µä¸å). The eldest sworn brother to [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Guan Yu (éç¾½)|Guan Yu]] and [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhang Fei (å¼µé£)|Zhang Fei]].
In ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å), Xiu travels to the Silver Dimension with his friends and finds out that he has an alternate counterpart there, named [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Liu Bei (åå)|Liu Bei]]. Because [[List of The X-Family characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Wang Da Dong]] accidentally causes a giant rock to fall down on Liu Bei, Xiu is forced to take his role for the time being until the real Liu Bei recovers from his injuries.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

She then gave him her hairpin as a gift, and the two became friends. After her mom died, she was abducted by evil power-users. Xia Tian has missed her since she disappeared, thinking that she moved away.

*''Reunion with Xia Tian'':
Years later, Han reappears when Xia Tian and his [[List of The X-Family characters#Ye Si Ren (èæä»)|father]] are attacked by loan sharks and unwittingly rescues them (although she does hit Xia Tian on the head). The next night, Xia Tian and his friends go back to look for her and he recognizes her as soon as he sees the picture that he took with her and her mom on the same day he rescued her. However, she has completely forgotten about her friendship with Xia Tian along with everything else that happened before she was kidnapped. When Han finds out that he is the boy she met and that he has a crush on her, she tells him to leave her alone, because she would never fall for him. But after Xia Tian sacrifices himself to save her, her feelings begin to change and she takes back what she said.

*''Evil control'':
Unbeknownst to her, she is a &quot;Shi Xin Sha Shou&quot; (ç³å¿æ®ºæ / ''Stone-Hearted Assassin''), controlled by evil powers and has once been ordered to kill Xia Tian but gets defeated by Gui Long instead.

*''A new beginning'':
After Han failed her mission, she begins to turn into stone, but Xia Tian manages to save her with &quot;Sou Hun Qu&quot; (èé­æ² / ''Soul Collecting Melody''), but in the process, she completely loses her memories and becomes Xia Tian's girlfriend, acting only on the feelings she has for him since before she lost her memory. But when she finds out that she and Xia Tian are half-siblings, she moves out of his house and starts living and working at The Ass Pub (èå±è¡), which her father owns.

*''Twins'':
[[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]] has a fiancÃ©e named [[List of The X-Family characters#Bing Xin(å°å¿)|Bing Xin]] who looked exactly like her. As she starts receiving Bing Xin's visions of the past, she finds out that they are twins, and later also finds out that she and Xia Tian are not siblings but were fooled by other people, which allows them to finally get back together and live happily ever after.

*''A complicated friendship with Xiu'':
Han and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xiu (è©)|Xiu]]'s families carry a genetic hatred against each other, but they try very hard not to fight each other. Eventually, they overcome that hatred and the two families become friends again.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;In a flashback, Han's mother called her &quot;Xiao Wen&quot; (å°å¦ / ''Little Wen'') in front of Ye Si Ren for some reason.

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;Han has the power to read one's mind and uses a pair of drumsticks known as &quot;Jing Lei&quot; (é©é· / ''Frightening Thunder'') as primary weapons, into which she has transferred her soul in order to make them both powerful and spiritual. Aside from fighting, she also uses the drumsticks for drumming. Before she lost her memory, all attacking spells she cast were thunder-based.

When Han sacrifices herself to save Xia Tian by taking a deadly hit into her own body and unwittingly transfers her thunder-energy to him, they realize that she is actually the &quot;original power-user of thunder&quot; (é·çåä½ç°è½è¡è).

He is somewhat of a funny guy, who does not know the appropriate time to talk.

Although a Chord proves to be part of a supernatural army, he does not appear to manifest any special ability or weapon until Lan Ling Wang begins to sneak around his team and the Xia family.

*''Dislike of Lan Ling Wang'':
He does not like [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]] initially, preferring to let him die, because he was targeted by him when they first met. But he learns to overcome that issue after everything that Lan Ling Wang did to save their world.

*''Short-lived crushes'':
Initially, he seems to have a thing for [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Mei (å¤ç¾) / Gui Wa (é¬¼å¨)|Xia Mei]] when they first met at The Ass Pub. But later on, he develops a crush on [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xia Xiong]] for a short period of time.

*''Jiu Wu'':
He has mentioned that he and [[List of The X-Family characters#Jiu Wu (ç¸è)|Jiu Wu]] were classmates in elementary school, but a Chord always bullied him, which frightened him when he found out that Jiu Wu was the new ruler of &quot;Tie Ke Jin Wei Jun&quot; (éµåç¦è¡è» / ''The Iron Protection Team'').

His son believed that he allowed him to marry [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xia Xiong]] only because he became tired of his rebellious behavior, but in truth he wanted to use their future children as pawns to take over the world: a plan that he has been carefully making for over 20 years. Being the most powerful of the three siblings, [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] went through several obstacles set up by his grandfather to make him stronger, including faking his own death to trick his family.

*''The flaw in the plan'':
When the time to dominate the world finally comes, he possesses his own son and uses Xia Tian's power to absorb powerful energy to become the ruler the whole dimension and as a result makes [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Gui Long]], Xia Tian's evil half, disappear forever. But his plan backfires when [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]] casts a spell to take away the energy he absorbed, and he is killed by the impact of the two spells and his own astral projecting ability.

*''Evil plans'':
In his lifetime, he has made many experiments to form different armies - be they human or demon. Even [[List of The X-Family characters#Bing Xin (å°å¿)|Bing Xin]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han]] were part of his experiments.

'''Nicknames:''' &lt;br&gt;Most people know him as &quot;Lao Zhang Men&quot; (èæé / ''The Master'').

Because Xia Tian's maternal grandfather doesn't allow his grandchildren to call him &quot;grandpa&quot;, they (or rather Xia Tian and Xia Yu) just refer to him as &quot;Lao Ba De Lao Ba&quot; (èç¸çèç¸ / ''Dad's Dad'').

[[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xia Xiong]] and [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Liu (å¤æµ)|Xia Liu]] are more common to call him &quot;Lao Mo Tou&quot; (èé­é ­ / similar to ''Old Monster'').

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;One of his many abilities is an astral projecting power called &quot;Hun You Da Fa&quot; (é­æ¸¸å¤§æ³), which enables him to project his soul and take control of another body. However, he cannot stay in this state for too long, otherwise he will be weakened to death. While in astral projecting state, his body must remain safe from outer attacks, otherwise he will easily be killed.

According to Lan Ling Wang, the Master knows an ability called &quot;Xi Mo Shen Gong&quot; (å¸é­ç¥å), which can increase his own powers by absorbing outside demonic energy.&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

*''The God of Guns'':
He and the God of Guns (æ§éç) are legendary warriors, known by others as good friends. However, they are in fact the same person, with the Great Traveler as the good half and the God of Guns as the evil half. The Great Traveler never knew anything about the God of Guns being a part of him until [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] and Jiu Wu figured it out. In the end, he sacrifices himself for the sake of the world and restores the balance of the Iron Dimension.

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;The Great Traveler is so powerful that his abilities are god-like. His specialty is an attack called &quot;Shen Xing Jiu Bu&quot; (ç¥è¡ä¹æ­¥), an ability that he rarely uses, but has very powerful effects.

The gun &quot;Wu Feng&quot; (çé¢¨) was originally in his evil half's possession, but he passed it on to [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Xiong (å¤é)|Xia Xiong]] years ago.

*''Rescue mission'':
