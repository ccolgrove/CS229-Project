{{2001 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''2001 Iowa Hawkeyes football team''' represented the [[University of Iowa]] and the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football]] program during the [[2001 NCAA Division I-A football season|2001 college football season]].  Coached by [[Kirk Ferentz]], the Hawkeyes played their home games at [[Kinnick Stadium]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]].

== Leading up to the season ==
=== Previous season ===

Iowa opened the [[2000 NCAA Division I-A football season|2000 season]] with five straight losses, adding to a losing streak that totaled 13 games when the Hawkeyes lost to [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] on September 30, 2000.  However, the streak came to an end a week later, when the Hawks defeated [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]], 21â16, giving Ferentz his first ever [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] win as [[head coach]] at Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkmania.com article â Iowa defeats MSU, 21â16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hawkmania.com/articles/2008/02/16/history/2000/doc46aa04b35216c020923686.txt|title = Iowa 21, Michigan State 16: Kasper, Hill step up as Hawks snap 13-game skid|accessdate = 2008-02-16|last = Batterson|first = Steve|publisher = Hawkmania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a three-game losing streak, the Hawkeyes traveled to [[State College, Pennsylvania]], for a game against [[Penn State Nittany Lions football under Joe Paterno (in the Big Ten)#2000 season|Penn State]].  The Hawks won the game, 26â23, and followed it up the next week with another win, this time over [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]].  The 27â17 victory gave Iowa a two-game winning streak, something that had not occurred for the Hawkeyes since the [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997 season]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkmania.com article â Iowa defeats NU, 27â17&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hawkmania.com/articles/2008/02/12/history/2000/doc46aa058d85d93430864832.txt|title = Iowa 27, Northwestern 17: Hawkeyes record first back-to-back wins since 1997|accessdate = 2008-02-16|last = Batterson|first = Steve|publisher = Hawkmania.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iowa finished the season with a 27â24 loss on November 18, 2000, against [[2000 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]].

=== Season outlook ===

2001 was marked as a potential turning point for the Hawkeyes, a year in which a bowl berth was entirely possible.  The Hawks returned two potential starters at [[quarterback]] in Kyle McCann and Jon Beutjer,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNSI article â 2001 Iowa football preview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa Hawkeyes team preview|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/2001/preview/iig/|publisher = SI.com|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even received playing time from [[junior college]] transfer [[Brad Banks]] during the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;HawkeyeSports.com â Brad Banks profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Player Bio: Brad Banks|url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/banks_brad00.html|publisher = HawkeyeSports.com|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ladell Betts]] and [[Kahlil Hill]] came back for their senior seasons at the [[running back]] and [[wide receiver]] positions respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNSI article â 2001 Iowa football preview&quot;/&gt;  Hill would go on win the [[Mosi Tatupu Award]] following the completion of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;HawkeyeSports.com â Kahlil Hill profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Player Bio: Kahlil Hill|url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/hill_kahlil00.html|publisher = HawkeyeSports.com|accessdate = 2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[American football#Defense|defense]], the Hawkeyes looked to improve on their rushing defense numbers from the previous season.  In 2000, Iowa gave up 194.3&amp;nbsp;yards rushing, ninth in the Big Ten.  [[Aaron Kampman]] returned for his senior season on the [[defensive line]], while fellow senior Mike Dolezal looked to replace [[LeVar Woods]] and Derrick Davison at [[linebacker]].  Iowa's passing defense in 2000 allowed 247&amp;nbsp;yards passing a game, tenth in the Big Ten.  It was thought that added experience in that area would help improve that aspect of Iowa's defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNSI article â 2001 Iowa football preview&quot;/&gt;

The [[special teams]] returned Hill and [[sophomore]] [[Nate Kaeding]], who hit 14-of-22 [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] and 20-of-20 [[extra point]]s during his [[freshman]] season. In 2000, Hill finished second in the Big Ten with a 27.2-yard [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] return average. Hill was also named to the first-team all-Big Ten team by the ''[[Sporting News]]'' for his 2000 performances.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNSI article â 2001 Iowa football preview&quot;/&gt;

The annual battle for the [[Cy-Hawk Trophy]] was scheduled originally for September 15, but due to the [[September 11 attacks]], it was postponed or canceled like all sporting events planned for that weekend. The game was rescheduled for November 24, which turned out to be a natural fit since many other major rivalries were played that weekend.

The Cyclones scored a touchdown in each of the first two quarters to head into halftime with a 14-0 lead. Iowa responded finally in the third quarter with two touchdowns of their own.

The final scoring play of the game came early in the fourth quarter, with Tony Yelk kicking a 32-yard field goal to put the Cyclones up 17-14. An interception by Adam Runk with 1:37 remaining sealed the game for the Cyclones.
