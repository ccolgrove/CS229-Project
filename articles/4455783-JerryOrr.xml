'''Charles Moyer''' (1866 &amp;ndash; June 2, 1929) was an [[United States|American]] [[trade union|labor]] leader and president of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] (WFM) from 1902 to 1926. He led the union through the [[Colorado Labor Wars]], was kidnapped and accused of murdering an ex-governor of the state of [[Idaho]], and shot in the back during a bitter copper mine strike. He also was a leading force in founding the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], although he later denounced the organization.

==Early life==
Little is known about Moyer prior to 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot;&gt;Fink, ''Biographical Dictionary of American Labor,'' 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; He was born near [[Ames, Iowa]], and his mother died when he was just a year old. He attended public school but left after the fourth grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot;&gt;&quot;Glossary,&quot; in ''Samuel Gompers Papers, Volume 7,'' 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moyer headed [[Western United States|West]] in 1872 and found work as a cowboy in [[Wyoming]]. He returned East in 1885 and settled in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He committed [[robbery]], and served a year in the [[Joliet Prison|Illinois State Penitentiary]]. After his release, Moyer became a miner at the [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] in [[Lead, South Dakota]], and joined the Lead City Miners' Union.  In 1893, the Lead City Miners' Union was one of several unions which formed the Western Federation of Miners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glossary&quot; /&gt;

Moyer was elected to the Executive Board of the WFM in 1900. After President [[Ed Boyce]] declined to run again in 1902, Moyer was elected his successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;

==WFM presidency==
Moyer was strongly committed to [[industrial unionism]], and pushed the WFM to organize both [[Sub-surface mining|underground]] and [[Surface mining|surface]] miners as well as all ancillary mine workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;&gt;Jensen, ''Heritage of Conflict: Labor Relations in the Nonferrous Metals Industry Up to 1930,'' 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado Labor Wars===
[[Image:Western Federation of Miners-Is Colorado in America.JPG|thumb|The poster &quot;Is Colorado in America?&quot;, with signature by Charles Moyer (bottom, left), which led to his arrest in 1904.]]
Moyer's push for industrial union organizing involved the union in what came to be known as the Colorado Labor Wars. In August 1902, the WFM organized mill workers in [[Colorado City, Colorado]]. The employers planted a [[Labor spies|labor spy]] in the union, and 42 union members were fired. Negotiations over the dismissals dragged on into 1903. On February 14, 1903, the WFM [[strike action|struck]]. The employers claimed a riot was in progress, and [[Governor#United States|Governor]] [[James Hamilton Peabody|James Peabody]] called out the [[Colorado Army National Guard|Colorado militia]] to suppress the strike. Miners in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]] also struck, and the militia was deployed in those cities as well.  Mass arrests began in September 1903 which finally broke the strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suggs&quot;&gt;Suggs, ''Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners,'' 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of those arrested was Moyer. He had gone to Telluride to protest the mass arrests and deportation of miners. While there, he lent his signature to a WFM poster decrying the arrests.  Moyer was arrested on March 28, 1904, for desecrating the American flag.  He was released on bail, but re-arrested the following day on the orders of Adjutant General [[Sherman Bell]] of the state militia on charges of &quot;military necessity&quot;. When Moyer successfully petitioned for a [[writ]] of [[habeas corpus]], the Colorado [[State Attorney General]] and the local [[district attorney]] refused to release him. Moyer appealed to the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] On June 6, 1904, the court ruled in ''[[In re Moyer]],'' 35 Colo. 163, that it could not question the governor's finding that insurrection existed in Colorado and that Moyer had not been arrested or imprisoned in violation of his rights. Moyer appealed to the [[United States District Court for the District of Missouri|U.S. District Court for the District of Missouri]], and obtained a writ of habeas corpus on July 5, 1904. Alarmed by the writ, Governor Peabody revoked the finding of insurrection the same day and ordered Moyer released by 3:45 p.m. (before the federal writ could be served). Moyer was released, but his case continued to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. On January 18, 1909, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court in ''[[Moyer v. Peabody]],'' 212 U.S. 78.  Writing for the majority, [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] refused to question the governor's assertion of facts which led to the declaration of martial law or grounds for Moyer's arrest. Concluding that the governor's good faith would protect a person's constitutional rights, Holmes held that Moyer's civil liberties had not been infringed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suggs&quot; /&gt;

===Radicalization===
The state's use of military power to crush union organizing drives convinced Moyer that no single union could be effective or successful.  He concluded that only &quot;[[one big union]]&quot; linked to a strong political party could effectively counteract the anti-union power of the state and employers. Moyer subsequently became a strong supporter of the [[Socialist Party of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;

In January 1905, Moyer participated in a conference in Chicago to consider whether the Socialist Party would be an effective vehicle for labor's goals. It was at this conference that the delegates decided to form a new union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). When the IWW was formed in Chicago on June 27, 1905, Moyer immediately affiliated the WFM with the new labor federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubofsky&quot;&gt;Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World,'' 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Haywood trial===
In 1906, Moyer was implicated in the assassination of [[Frank Steunenberg]], ex-Governor of Idaho. On December 30, 1905, Steunenberg, who had clashed with the WFM during several strikes, was killed by an explosion at his home in [[Caldwell, Idaho]]. [[Albert Horsley|Harry Orchard]], a former WFM member who had once acted as Moyer's bodyguard, was arrested for the crime. Using coercion and intimidation (including restricted food rations and threats of immediate execution), [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent [[James McParland]] wrung a 64-page confession from Orchard. The confession named Moyer and other WFM leaders as the instigators of the bombing plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson&quot;&gt;Carlson, ''Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood,'' 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Moyer was in Colorado, not Idaho. Idaho authorities were concerned that Orchard's confession would not be enough to persuade a judge to issue extradition papers. Acting in concert with law enforcement leaders, McParland perjured himself in order to convince a judge to issue the extradition papers against Moyer. McParland then traveled to [[Denver, Colorado]], and arrested Moyer, WFM Secretary-Treasurer [[Bill Haywood]], and union member [[George Pettibone]].&lt;ref&gt;The WFM offices were above Pettibone's general store, and Pettibone rented bedrooms in his building to WFM members visiting union headquarters.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 17, 1906, McParland forced the three men onto a special sealed train and brought them to Idaho.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson&quot; /&gt;

Haywood, represented by [[Clarence Darrow]], stood trial on May 9, 1907. He was acquitted. Pettibone, defended by [[Orrin N. Hilton]], was also tried and acquitted. Charges against Moyer were dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson&quot; /&gt;

===Conservatism===
His experiences with the IWW led Moyer to the conclusion that the federation was too radical.  Moyer was especially disturbed by the IWW's refusal to ally with or endorse any political party, which had been the key to Moyer's support for the creation of the IWW.  In 1908, [[Industrial Workers of the World organizational evolution|Moyer led the WFM out of the IWW]], taking most of the IWW's membership (which belonged to the WFM) with him. Concerned that the WFM's reputation for radicalism was making it difficult to reach [[collective bargaining]] agreements, Moyer re-affiliated his union with the conservative [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubofsky&quot; /&gt;

Moyer pushed for more traditional labor union policies in his last decade in office.  He forced the union's locals to agree to contracts which expired after a set period of time.&lt;ref&gt;The WFM practice had been to agree to open-ended contracts with no expiration date. Such contracts had been a hallmark of the WFM since its founding.&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed resolutions through the WFM convention committing the union to the same limited legislative goals favored by the AFL such as the [[eight-hour day]], a ban on [[child labor]], and controls on immigration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubofsky&quot; /&gt; He also withdrew his support for the Socialist Party and adopted the policy of nonpartisanship advocated by [[Samuel Gompers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;

WFM membership declined sharply from 1911 to 1916.  In part, this was due to the continuing intense opposition from mine owners in the West.  But conflict with the IWW also led to significant membership losses.  Historian Vernon H. Jensen has asserted that the IWW had a &quot;rule or ruin&quot; policy, under which it attempted to wreck local unions which it could not control.  From 1908 to 1921, Jensen and others have written, the IWW attempted to win power in WFM locals which had once formed the federation's backbone. When it could not do so, IWW agitators undermined WFM locals, which caused the national union to shed nearly half its membership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubofsky&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Faction's War 1914&quot;&gt;&quot;Mine Federation in West Doomed by Faction's War,&quot; ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' June 27, 1914; &quot;Paid Moyer's Gunmen.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times.'' February 21, 1915; &quot;Armed Guards Posted in Stores of Butte,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 28, 1914; &quot;Butte Unions Back Rebels,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 23, 1914; &quot;Disrupted by I.W.W.,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 22, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Brissenden noted WFM dissatisfaction with the IWW in [[Jerome, Arizona]] in 1913, attributing some of the friction to the fact that the WFM was becoming more conservative, [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#The contract question|accepting contracts with employers]] and affiliating with the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], while the IWW was becoming more revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 318&lt;/ref&gt; (The IWW would not begin to accept contracts with employers until 1938.)&lt;ref&gt;The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905-1975, Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin, 1976, page 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest animosity between the two organizations occurred in [[Butte, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, page 319&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Melvyn Dubofsky, however, offers a different perspective. In Minnesota, for example, the miners went on strike in 1916 to abolish the contract system, to secure a minimum wage, and to end exploitation by the company. They approached the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] and the WFM, both of which failed to respond. Dubofsky notes, &quot;IWW headquarters had been advised of employee discontent on the eve of the [strike] ... and the IWW instantly had organizers on the spot.&quot; Dubofsky states that the walkout occurred without IWW involvement, and he describes the evidence for this as &quot;incontrovertible&quot;. The IWW was approached for help and, according to Dubofsky, the IWW &quot;achieved its aims not by coercion but by giving the striking miners leadership, funds, and publicity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 187-188&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the companies and the press accusing the IWW of sending &quot;outside agitators&quot;, M.E. Shusterich, one of the Mesabi Range strike leaders, attempted to &quot;set the record straight&quot;:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
This strike was not started by the I.W.W., but has been underway the past six years. We have appealed to every labor official in Minnesota to have the miners on the range organized, but we have been shuttled back and forth between the Western Federation of Miners and other organizations who passed us on again until finally the miners took things into their own hands and went out without organization.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, pages 493-494&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Marxist historian Philip S. Foner, the issues of socialism and industrial unionism â and more specifically, the AFL vs. the IWW â had been debated by the Minnesota miners since the WFM's Mesabi Range strike of 1907. Foner concluded that in the 1916 strike, &quot;Most of the Range Finns ... backed the I.W.W.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Sheldon Foner, History of the labor movement in the United States, 1980, 4th edition, page 493&lt;/ref&gt; 

Whatever the reasons for the decline, the WFM was particularly hard hit in the copper mining industries of Michigan and Arizona, and in the WFM's stronghold around [[Butte, Montana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dubofsky&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Faction's War 1914&quot;/&gt;

During the bitter [[Copper Country Strike of 1913-1914]] in [[Michigan]], Moyer was assaulted â beaten and shot in the back by men in the employ of the mine owners. That evening, detectives from the city of [[Calumet, Michigan|Calumet]] escorted him, still bleeding, to a local train and &quot;[[Deportation|deported]] him&quot; (e.g., ran him out of town).  Moyer sought medical treatment in Chicago. State and [[United States Congress|Congressional]] investigations were unable to prove the identity of his assailants, and the crime went unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Moyer Tells of His Deportation,&quot; ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' March 11, 1914; &quot;Moyer, Wounded, Sticks to Battle,&quot; ''Chicago Daily Tribune,'' December 28, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Moyer led a successful movement to change the union's name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (colloquially known as &quot;Mine Mill&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Moyer was unable to reverse Mine Mill's declining membership.  After a bitter internal struggle, Moyer and his entire executive board resigned in 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;

Moyer lived in relative obscurity until his death.  He died in [[Pomona, California]], on June 2, 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fink&quot; /&gt;
