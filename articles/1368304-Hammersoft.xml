==Early life==
Born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, DiCamillo suffered from chronic [[pneumonia]]. At age 5, she moved to [[Clermont, Florida]] for her health (warmer climate) with her mother and older brother, [[Curt DiCamillo]], who would become a noted architectural historian.  &amp; Illustrators Sample Profile: Kate DeCamillo |publisher=Wilsonbiographies.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/books/21dica.html | work=The New York Times | title=Pleasantly Stunned, a Star Children's Author Hits the Tour Trail Again | first=Jane | last=Margolies | date=21 February 2006 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1987 DiCamillo received an English degree at the [[University of Florida]] and worked for various jobs after graduation. At age 30 she moved to Minneapolis and began working at a book warehouse. This job gave her inspiration to write for children and allowed her to meet a sales representative for [[Candlewick Press]], resulting in a draft submission of what would become ''[[Because of Winn-Dixie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Margolies, Jane (2006-02-21). &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/books/21dica.html Pleasantly Stunned, a Star Children's Author Hits the Tour Trail Again]&quot;. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her 2003 novel ''The Tale of Despereaux'' was inspired by a friend's son, Luke Bailey, who asked her to write about an unlikely hero with &quot;exceptionally large ears&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blais, Jacqueline (2004-01-14). &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-01-15-dicamillo-newbery_x.htm Author's Newbery is no small thrill]&quot;. ''USA TODAY''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' was released as a film by [[20th Century Fox]]. ''[[The Tale of Despereaux (film)|The Tale of Despereaux]]'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on December 19, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetaleofdespereauxmovie.com/ ''The Tale of Desperaux''] official film site&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane]]'' was optioned by [[New Line Cinema]] and is in early pre-production. Her newest novel is ''The Magician's Elephant'', and 20th Century Fox is adapting it into a film, hiring [[Martin Hynes]] (''[[The Go-Getter (film)|The Go-Getter]]'') to write a script based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;http://moreresults.factiva.com/results/index/index.aspx?ref=HLYW000020060530e25o0002j&lt;/ref&gt;
