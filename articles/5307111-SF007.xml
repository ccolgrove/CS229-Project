The '''pigmented layer of retina''' or '''retinal pigment epithelium''' ('''RPE''') is the [[pigment]]ed cell layer just outside the neurosensory [[retina]] that nourishes retinal visual cells, and is firmly attached to the underlying [[choroid]] and overlying retinal visual cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Cassin, B. and Solomon, S. |title=Dictionary of eye terminology |publisher=Triad Pub.

==History==
[[Image:Calf-Eye-Posterior-With-Retina-Detached-2005-Oct-13.jpg|thumb|right|Choroid dissected from a calf's eye, showing black RPE and iridescent blue tapetum lucidum]]
The RPE was known in the 18th and 19th centuries as the '''pigmentum nigrum''', referring to the observation that the RPE is dark (black in many animals, brown in humans); and as the '''tapetum nigrum''', referring to the observation that in animals with a [[tapetum lucidum]], in the region of the tapetum lucidum the RPE is not pigmented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Anatomy==
The RPE is composed of a single layer of hexagonal [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that are densely packed with pigment granules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassin&quot;/&gt;

At the [[ora serrata]], the RPE continues as a membrane passing over the ciliary body and continuing as the back surface of the iris.  This generates the fibers of the dilator.  Directly beneath this epithelium is the neuroepithelium (i.e., rods and cones)passes jointly with the RPE.  Both, combined, are understood to be the ciliary epithelium of the embryo.  The front end continuaton of the retina is the posterior iris epithelium, which takes on pigment when it enters the iris&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica from [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewed from the outer surface, these cells are smooth and hexagonal in shape. When seen in section, each cell consists of an outer non-pigmented part containing a large oval [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and an inner pigmented portion which extends as a series of straight thread-like processes between the rods, this being especially the case when the eye is exposed to light.

==Function==
-The RPE shields the retina from excess incoming light.  It supplies omega-3 fatty acids and glucose, the former for building photoreceptive membranes, the latter for energy. Retinol is supplied by the visual [[vitamin A]] cycle.  Water is removed from the retinal side to the choroid side, at a rate of 1.4-11 microliters per square centimeter.  It maintains balance of pH, and performs routine phagocytosis to remove decayed disks of the receptors, every morning, powered by light and taking 11 days to replenish the waste.  Finally, it has a self-contained immune system, which is connected with the immune system proper to either shut down interactions when healthy, and when there is disease, it teams up with the main immune controls.  Finally, it secretes substances to help build and sustain the choroid and retina.&lt;ref&gt;http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/the-retinal-pigment-epithelium/ Webvision:  The retinal pigment epithelium&lt;/ref&gt;

The retinal pigment epithelium also serves as the limiting transport factor that maintains the retinal environment by supplying small molecules such as amino acid, [[ascorbic acid]] and D-glucose while remaining a tight barrier to choroidal blood borne substances. [[Homeostasis]] of the ionic environment is maintained by a delicate transport exchange system.

==Pathology==
In the eyes of [[albinos]], the cells of this layer contain no pigment.  Dysfunction of the RPE is found in [[Age-Related Macular Degeneration]] and [[Retinitis Pigmentosa]].
