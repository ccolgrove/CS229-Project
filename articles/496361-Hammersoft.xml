==History==
Sacred Heart University was founded in 1963 by the Most Reverend Walter W. Curtis, Bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport.  It was established to provide the community with an affordable, quality education at a local Catholic university.  The University was to be led and staffed by the laity independent and locally oriented, serving the needs of the diocese and of southwestern Connecticut.

Enrollment has risen from the original class of 173 to over 6,000 full and part-time undergraduate and graduate students, and the faculty has increased from 9 to 212 full-time professors and over 350 adjunct professors.

The University has enhanced the undergraduate student experience in several notable ways.  In 1990, it accepted for the first time students who wanted the residential experience.  The first dorms, Scholars Commons (previously known as J-Hill), were built 1991. It now has 10 residential buildings with 70% of the full-time undergraduates residing in university housing.   

New degree programs and majors in relevant disciplines are regularly added to the curriculum.  The University offers Division I athletics with 31 varsity teams. The $17.5 million William H. Pitt Health and Recreation Center is available to all students and to the community at large.  Recognizing the importance of technology, Sacred Heart University provides all undergraduate students with a laptop computer.  The University campus is a wireless environment.   

The University consists of four colleges:  College of Arts &amp; Sciences, John F. Welch College of Business, College of Education and Health Professions, and University College.  University College is committed to the adult learner, and its evening, weekend and accelerated courses earn praise for their diversity and relevance to changing lifestyles.

On January 25, 2006, [[Jack Welch]] gave a large sum of money and his name to Sacred Heart University's College of Business, which is now known as the &quot;John F. Welch College of Business.&quot;[http://www.sacredheart.edu/pages/12142_sacred_heart_university_names_college_of_business_for_legendary_ge_chairman_jack_welch.cfm]
