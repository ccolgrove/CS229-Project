'''Australia Network''', originally '''Australia Television International''' and later '''ABC Asia Pacific''', is a [[free-to-air]] [[International broadcasting|international]] satellite television service operated by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] since 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;july06release&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = Australia's Television Service to the Asia-Pacific Region | publisher = [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] | date = 2006-07-10 | url = http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2006/fa076_06.html | accessdate = 2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television and online service broadcasts 24 hours a day on 7 days a week, to approximately 44 countries in Asia, the Pacific and the Indian sub-continent. The channel broadcasts a mix of programming, including news and current affairs, English-language learning programs, international documentaries, lifestyle, drama, sports and children's programming. The current channel operating rights is due to be opened to a tender, with the incumbent ABC, and private channel operators competing for the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Come in, Aussie, come in | work = [[The Age]] | date = 2011-04-19 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/come-in-aussie-come-in-20110418-1dlg0.html | accessdate = 2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international television service's current incarnation launched on 1 January 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;downerspeech&quot;&gt;{{cite speech | title = Australia, the Asia-Pacific, and Television: Broadcasting to the Region | author = Downer, Alexander | first = Alexander | last = Downer | date = 2002-02-13 | location = Canberra | url = http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/speeches/2002/020213_fa_austv_launch.html | accessdate = 2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is funded partially by Australia's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], as well as some advertising (unlike the ABC's [[ABC Television (Australia)#Free-to-air channels|domestic television services]]). The channel is targeted at local audiences in 44 countries across parts of Asia, the Pacific and India. Australia network, along with international radio network [[Radio Australia]], is a part of the ABC's International, Corporate Strategy and Governance division.&lt;ref name=&quot;intldivision&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = ABC Bolsters Its Commitment To International Broadcasting | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = 2007-02-07 | url = http://abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1842867.htm | accessdate = 2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
'''Australia Television International''' the forerunner to '''Australia Network''' was launched in 1 January 1993. [[Radio Australia]] had been operating as part of the ABC since 1939 while the passing of the '''Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act''' in 1983 allowed the Corporation to operate an additional international television service. The channel was originally proposed by directors [[Mark Armstrong (television executive)|Mark Armstrong]] and [[David Hill]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}, who felt that a television channel would further heighten Australia's presence in the Asia-Pacific region and demonstrate the ABC's technical abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoseabc&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Kenneth Stanley |title=Whose ABC? The Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1983-2006 |year=2006 |publisher=Black Inc. |location=Melbourne, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] |isbn=1-86395-189-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new channel was to be funded by a combination of government subsidies and commercial sponsorship.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoseabc&quot; /&gt; The presence of commercials, not previously seen or heard on the ABC, resulted in the creation of an updated edition of the ''ABC Editorial and Programme Practices'' stipulating that the 'Australia Television service will retain editorial control and independence in all programming'.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoseabc&quot; /&gt; [[Paul Keating]] launched '''Australia Television International''' on 1 January 1993 - televised live to 50 countries in the southeast Asian region, from the ABC's television studios in [[Gore Hill, New South Wales|Gore Hill]].

Funding cuts made in the 1997-1998 federal budget, and recommendations made in the Mansfield Report, meant that control of '''Australia Television''' was handed over to the '''[[Seven Network]]''' in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;mr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/stories/2001/265031.htm|title = 2UE; Australian Television International.|accessdate = 2007-09-25|year = 2001|month = March|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Seven's direction the channel continued to receive federal funding, and carry some '''[[ABC News and Current Affairs|ABC News]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mr&quot; /&gt;

===2002-2006 - As ABC Asia Pacific===
Despite efforts made by Seven to expand into Asia using the service, it continued to lose money. In 2002, the government announced a five-year, $50 million tender for the service&lt;ref name=&quot;mr&quot; /&gt; - at the time watched primarily by Australian expats for its news programmes, football coverage, and children's programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;mr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/stories/2001/265031.htm|title = PM - Channel Seven axes Australia TV|accessdate = 2007-09-25|year = 2001|month = March|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven chose not to bid, while [[Imparja Television]]'s application was unsuccessful. The ABC won the contract and launched '''ABC Asia Pacific''' on 1 January 2002, with content from the [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]], [[Network Ten]], and the ABC's own original content, as well as news bulletins produced by [[Sky News Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ausnet-press&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s512844.htm|title = ABC Signs ASIA Pacific TV agreement|accessdate = 2007-09-25|year = 2001|month = August|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;downerspeech&quot; /&gt;

The tender was renewed in 2005 however the ABC was re-awarded control of the service, over other applicants including '''[[Sky News Australia]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediawatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1378484.htm|title = Sky's push for Asian subsidy|accessdate = 2007-09-25|year = 2005|month = June|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dfatrelease&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = Australian Television Service to the Asia Pacific Region | publisher = [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] | date = 2005-12-13 | url = http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2005/fa153_05.html | accessdate = 2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the network stopped showing content from Sky News Australia, replaced with bulletins produced by the ABC's own news and current affairs division from its [[ABV-2|Southbank]] studios in Melbourne.

===2006-2011 - As Australia Network===

ABC Asia Pacific changed its name to '''Australia Network''' on 7 August 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;ausnet-press&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1682937.htm|title = New Australia Network Offers Different View|accessdate = 2007-09-25|year = 2006|month = October|work = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time introducing a number of new programs, as well as the expansion of its existing news programs and English-language learning programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ausnet-press&quot; /&gt; Following a restructure of the ABC in early 2007, Australia Network became a part of the Corporation's International, Corporate Strategy and Governance division.&lt;ref name=&quot;intldivision&quot; /&gt;

The channel is not available in Australia or [[New Zealand]], owing to rights restrictions, although ''ABC News for Australia Network'' bulletins are carried overnight on [[ABC News 24]] in Australia and on [[Triangle TV|Stratos TV]] in New Zealand. Several Australia Network programmes are also available online in Australia on the ABC's iview platform. Australia Network became available in [[Malaysia]] on [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] (Channel 514) in December 2008.

''ABC Asia Pacific News'' is presented from the ABC's Southbank studios in Melbourne by [[Beverley O'Connor]], with stories from ABC reporters based in and around the region. Following the channel's relaunch in 2006, four new correspondents based in New Delhi, Beijing, the South Pacific and [[Jakarta]] were added to report exclusively for the bulletins.&lt;ref name=&quot;programming&quot; /&gt;

Current affairs program ''[[ABC News (Australia)|Asia Pacific Focus]]'', hosted by Edmond Roy and [[Helen Vatsikopoulos]] is also shown after the network's 9.00pm [[Hong Kong Time|HKT]] bulletin.&lt;ref name=&quot;programming&quot; /&gt;

==Logo History==
[[File:ABCAP.png|225px|thumb|left|ABC Asia Pacific Logo from 2002 to 2006]]
In 2002, ABC Asia Pacific used the same logo as ABC in Australia. The station idents also feature the same silver ring and elements as ABC Television's 2002 idents.

In 2003, generic break bumpers are used between commercial breaks, using a simple background and a simple ring animation.

In 2004, the channel used the new slogan ''Everyone's ABC Asia Pacific'', with new idents using the same ribbon package of ABC TV Australia, but usually keeping the 2002 idents.

In 2006, ABC Asia Pacific rebranded as Australia Network, using a new logo as a stylized lower-cased 'a'. In 2009, the logo's color simplified from gold to simple white, with new idents using the new logo in guise of a balloon.
