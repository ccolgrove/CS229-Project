'''VMware Fusion''' is a [[virtual machine]] software product developed by [[VMware]] for [[Macintosh]] computers with [[Intel]] processors. Fusion allows Intel-based Macs to run [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] &quot;guest&quot; [[operating systems]], such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[NetWare]] and [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] as virtual machines simultaneously with [[Mac OS X]] as the &quot;host&quot; operating system using a combination of [[paravirtualization]], [[emulator|emulation]] and [[dynamic recompilation]].

==Overview==

Fusion, made possible by the [[AppleâIntel transition]], marked VMware's first entry into Macintosh-based x86-virtualization. Fusion utilizes [[Intel VT]] present in the [[Intel Core microarchitecture]] platform. Much of the underlying technology in Fusion is inherited from other VMware products, such as [[VMware Workstation]], allowing Fusion to offer features such as [[64-bit]] and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] support from the first beta version onward.

Fusion 1.0 was released on August 6, 2007, exactly one year after being announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWDC: VMware brings virtual machines to Mac OS X |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/vmware/index.php |publisher=Macworld |date=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System requirements==
* A 64-bit capable Intel-based Mac
* 2 GB of RAM (4 GB or more recommended)
* ATI Radeon x1600, Nvidia GeForce 8600M or better graphics hardware required for Windows Aero support
* 750 MB free disk space for VMware Fusion
* 5 GB free disk space for each virtual machine (10 GB or more recommended)
* Mac OS X 10.6.7 or later

==Features==
[[Image:VMware fusion 7 no trans.png|thumb|right|260px|VMware Fusion running in Unity view on Mac OS X 10.6]]
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:fusion unity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|VMware Fusion in Unity mode]] --&gt;'''Unity view''' creates a seamless desktop environment between Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X applications. It optionally hides Windows' [[start menu]] and [[taskbar]] and runs the Windows applications directly from the [[Dock (computing)|dock]] in OS X.  Further, users can drag and drop files between Windows and the Mac, and use familiar Mac keyboard shortcuts to copy and paste between Windows and Mac applications. It is (almost) fully compatible with [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]].&lt;ref name=features&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/features.html |title=VMware Fusion Features |publisher=VMware |date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion windows that are covered by other Fusion windows don't redraw when switching to ExposÃ©, causing visual anomalies. This feature is later made available in [[VMware Workstation]] 6.5 Beta, which is designed to be run on Windows/Linux platforms.

'''DirectX 9.0''' is supported through dynamic recompilation to [[OpenGL]] instructions in Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 virtual machines.  Hence, users can play supported games through Fusion or run applications which require 3D graphics.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/faqs.html |title=VMware Fusion FAQs |publisher=VMware |date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; VMware Fusion 3 has DirectX 9 Shader Model 3 and OpenGL support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macnn.com/articles/09/06/21/fusion.beta.version/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''32-bit and 64-bit guest operating systems''' are supported by VMWare Fusion. &lt;ref name=req&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/system_requirements.html |title=VMware Fusion System Requirements |publisher=VMware |date=2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 60 operating systems are supported, including Windows Vista, Windows XP, Linux, and Solaris. Additionally, VMWare Fusion 2.0 adds support for Mac OS X Server version 10.5 (Leopard) as a guest on a Mac OS X host. Additionally, Fusion 2.0.1 added experimental support for un-released developer builds of Mac OS X Server 10.6 (Snow Leopard) &amp;ndash; presumably for software developers with Apple-granted access to pre-release builds of Snow Leopard. There is also support for Windows XP Service Pack 2 Boot Camp partitions: a user can use his Windows [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] partition, eliminating the need for two separate Windows installations.[6] In addition, VMWare Fusion offers support of up to 8 GB of memory on guest 64-bit operating systems, and up to 16GB of RAM on [[Mac Pro]]s and [[Xserve]]s. &lt;ref name=&quot;features&quot;/&gt;

'''Snapshots''' enable users to save a stable state of the guest operating system to disk, allowing users to quickly return to their virtual machine without the need of rebooting.

'''Shared Folders''' allow the mounting of folders from the host operating system to the guest operating system.

'''Extensive hardware support''' is built into VMWare Fusion.  For networking, there is support for wired and [[wireless networks]], in [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] or bridged mode (albeit, erratic availability with wireless interfaces)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://communities.vmware.com/thread/96699 |title=Please review if you are having bridged wireless network issues |publisher=VMware |date=2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  There is access to physical devices from the virtual machine (i.e. read and write CDs and DVDs) as well as access to [[USB]] 2.0 devices such as [[video cameras]], [[iPods]], [[printer (computing)|printers]], and [[disk storage|disks]] at full speed{{Fact|date=April 2008}}. Firewire support is still missing in the latest version, although a workaround exists by mounting the device as a shared folder &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2008/08/how-to-access-a.html |title=How to Access a FireWire Hard Drive Using VMWare Fusion |publisher=VMware |date=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Support for multiple CPUs (SMP) or multicore CPUs''' is built into VMWare Fusion.  Fusion also allows the user to assign up to eight CPUs to one virtual machine to gain additional performance for CPU-intensive workloads &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vmware.com/support/fusion3/doc/releasenotes_fusion_31.html |title=VMware Fusion 3.1 Release Notes |publisher=VMware |date=2010-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Portability.''' Virtual machines created with VMware Fusion can be used with other VMware products and vice versa, and are compatible with other VMware [[virtual appliance]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;/&gt;

'''VMware Fusion 2.0''' was released as a free upgrade on September 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VMware Fusion 2 (Free Upgrade for All VMware Fusion 1.x Users)|url=http://www.vmware.com/download/fusion/}}&lt;/ref&gt; New features in this release include:
* Multi-display support &amp;ndash; enables the use of up to 10 additional displays by guest operating systems
* Virtual Machine conversion &amp;ndash; allows the conversion of Parallels Desktop and Microsoft Virtual PC virtual machines to VMware
* Support for DirectX 9.0 Shader Model 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Features of VMware Fusion 2.0 Beta 1|url=http://www.vmware.com/communities/content/beta/fusion/fusion2_beta1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Application sharing between Windows and Mac &amp;ndash; users can set certain files to launch with specific Mac or Windows applications
* Folder Mirroring &amp;ndash; allows select folders to be accessible on both the host and guest operating system
* Keyboard and Mouse shortcut mapping
* Snapshot improvements &amp;ndash; multiple snapshot support, in addition to creating automatic snapshots at set intervals
* Improved CPU resource utilization
* Support for 4 processor virtual machines
* Mac OS X Leopard Server virtualization support
* Improved Linux support
&lt;!-- * A complimentary 12-month subscription to McAfee VirusScan Plus for Windows virtual machines --&gt;

'''VMware Fusion 3.0''' was released as a paid upgrade on October 27, 2009. Some new features in this release include:
* Optimization for Mac OS X 10.6 clients, including full 64 bit process support
* Full support for Mac OS X 10.6 Server clients
* Improved PC Migration Assistant
* Improved support for Windows 7 virtual machines, including full Windows Aero support with Flip 3D and Aero Peek
