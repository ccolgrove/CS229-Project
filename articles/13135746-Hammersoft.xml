This drama is actually an audio re-enactment of the first and second manga volumes. It was released before the anime so the characters have different voice actors.

Synopsis: Kun-kun is kidnapped and now its up to the Shinku and the Rozen Maiden dolls to find the culprit and rescue him! Suigintou makes a guest appearance in the drama and falls madly in love with Kun-kun. 

This drama CD is about the length of a regular TV episode. It also includes 5 short &quot;diary entries&quot; of sorts by the dolls. The drama does not tie into the plot, but probably takes place after episode 9 because Souseiseki is not there.

Synopsis: Jun falls ill with a cold and now it's up to the dolls to nurse him back to health. But what will happen when Suigintou and Barasuishou decide to pay a little visit?! 

This drama CD also contains three hilarious comedy side stories. In the first track, &quot;Suiseiseki's First Errand&quot;, Suiseiseki ventures out into the outside world to deliver a letter to Jun. In the second track, &quot;Kun-kun vs. Laplace's Demon&quot;, Detective Kun-kun and Laplaceâs Demon have a frightening confrontation that results in the two falling in love. The third track, &quot;The Barasuishou Makeover Project&quot;, is about Shirosaki having Barasuishou act out various roles because he thinks her personality is bland. So hilarity ensues when Barasuishou acts like a cat by adding &quot;~nya&quot; to her sentences, a bondage queen, (and by Enju's request) a young bride, etc.

==Volume Details==

A number of Rozen Maiden Drama CDs have been released. They are character dramas that often do not tie in with the plot- more like short stories/dramas based on the series. Seven volumes have been released- Vol.1 Suigintou, Vol.2 Kanaria, Vol.3 Suiseiseki, Vol.4 Souseiseki, Vol.5 Shinku, Vol.6 Hina Ichigo, Vol.7 Barasuishou. Though Kirakishou is the true seventh doll in the series, there has been no Drama CDs based on Kirakishou, probably due to the lack of information about her.

A Rozen Maiden Christmas drama CD was released just before Christmas 2007. It is not known whether or not it has ever been translated into English.
