'''Saint Joseph's University''' (also referred to as '''SJU''' or '''St. Joe's''') is a private, [[coeducation]]al Roman Catholic Jesuit university located partially in the [[Wynnefield]] section of [[Philadelphia]] and partially in [[Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Merion Township]] and located in the [[Pennsylvania Main Line]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.

The school was founded in 1851 as Saint Joseph's College by the [[Society of Jesus]]. As of 2010, Saint Joseph's University is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]]. Saint Joseph's University educates over 8,500 students each year in over 60 undergraduate majors, 12 special-study options, 28 study-abroad programs, 53 graduate study areas, and an [[Ed.D.]] in Educational Leadership. It has 17 centers and institutes. Saint Joseph's is one of the oldest [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], Catholic universities in the United States.

Saint Joseph's has grown in physical size and scope since 2001 with the addition of the Maguire Campus, construction of new campus buildings, and the addition of new majors and programs annually. For the 2012 [[U.S. News and World Report]] rankings, in the Master's Universities (North) category, Saint Joseph's was ranked number 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=US News|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/st-josephs-university-3367 |title=St. Joseph's University|St. Joseph's University|Best College|US News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As far back as 1741, a Jesuit College in Philadelphia had been proposed and planned by Rev. Joseph Greaton, S.J., the first resident pastor of Saint Joseph's Church. The suppression of the Jesuits (1773â1814) and lack of people and money delayed for over a hundred years the realization of Greaton's plans.

Credit for founding the college is given to [[Felix-Joseph Barbelin|Rev. Felix Barbelin]], S.J., who served as its first president. Barbelin and four other Jesuits formed the first faculty of Saint Joseph's College. On the morning of September 15, 1851, some 32 young men gathered in the courtyard outside [[Old St. Joseph's Church]], located in Willing's Alley off Walnut and Fourth Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania one block from [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]. After attending High Mass and reciting the ''Veni Creator'' in the church, these men were assigned to their classes in a building adjacent to the church.

Before the end of the first academic year in 1851, the enrollment rose from fewer than 40 students to 98. In the following year, the college received its charter of incorporation from the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and the enrollment grew to 126 students. The fledgling college soon outgrew an increasingly noisy and commercialized location on Willingâs Alley. The college moved into a building at 1234 Filbert Street in Philadelphia, then in a prosperous residential neighborhood near the future site of City Hall. In 1889, Saint Josephâs inaugurated its third site at 17th and Stiles Streets in [[North Philadelphia]], in the heart of Philadelphiaâs booming industrial zone. In 1927, in recognition of population shifts toward the western part of the city and into the western suburbs, the college moved to its current location, 54th and [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|City Avenue]], at the entrance to Philadelphiaâs fashionable [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]]. After World War II, Saint Josephâs began to acquire properties across City Avenue on the Main Line itself, propelling the institution physically as well as culturally into the suburbs proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Contosta | first=David | title=Saint Josephâs Philadelphiaâs Jesuit University | publisher=Saint Joseph's University Press | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 1970, the undergraduate day college opened its doors to women. Saint Joseph's was recognized as a university by the Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on July 24, 1978. The corporate charter was formally changed to reflect university status on December 27, 1978.

==President==
Saint Joseph's University is technically without a President, with current Senior Vice President [[John Smithson (university president)|John Smithson]] currently serving as interim President of the University.  Smithson took on the role when the University's 26th President, Rev. [[Timothy R. Lannon]], S.J., stepped down to assume the Presidency at his ''alma mater'', [[Creighton University]].  On January 24, 2011, the Board of Trustees elected Rev. Joseph M. O'Keefe, S.J. as the 27th President of the University, but O'Keefe later had to step down, citing health issues; the University subsequently selected Smithson, a former chair of the Board of Trustees, to serve as Interim President and directed its efforts to a Jesuit-only search.  Under Smithson, the University began taking steps to complete its ''Plan 2020: Gateway to the Future''.

On November 10, 2011, the University's Board of Trustees announced that it had selected Rev. C. Kevin Gillespie, S.J., Associate Provost of University Centers at [[Loyola University Chicago]], as the 27th President of the University.  Gillespie is a member of the University's Class of 1972 and has served as a trustee since 2006.  Gillespie is only the second President to also be an alumnus of the University, the first was Rev. Cornelius Gillespie, S.J., who served from 1900-1907 and again from 1908-1909.  Gillespie was formally presented at a reception on November 11, 2011, and will formally assume the Presidency on July 1, 2012.  Until this time, the University announced that John Smithson will continue his role as interim President.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sju.edu/news/archives/gillespie_announcement_111011.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current developments and plans==
Two construction projects are under way on campus which include: the Post Learning Commons, a state-of-the-art library multimedia center opening Spring 2012, and Villiger Hall, a six-story, 400 bed freshman residence hall opening Fall 2012. In addition, three NCAA Division I athletic fields are set for completion on the Maguire Campus for field hockey, softball, and baseball.

==Speakers==
Many famous people including Vice-President [[Joseph Biden]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] [[Chuck D]], [[Desmond Tutu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sju.edu/resources/administration/externalaffairs/tutu.html|title=Desmond Tutu To Visit Campus|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Nutter]], [[Chris Matthews]], [[James Cone]], [[Chelsea Clinton]], [[Caroline Kennedy]], [[Tim Russert]], [[Jonathan Weiner]], [[Pat Croce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richardson.com|url=http://www.richardson.com/upload/Press%20Room/Press%20Release%20Archives/Pdf/pat_croce.pdf|format=PDF|title=Vision, Values, &amp; Victory|publisher=richardson.com|accessdate=November 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Wise]], [[Ed Rendell]], [[Dan Marino]], [[Soledad O'Brien]], and [[Rick Santorum]] have spoken various locations around campus, including the [[Alumni Memorial Fieldhouse]].

==Demographics==
61% of the student population is from out of state. 83% of the students are white, 5% are black, 2% are Hispanic, 2% are Asian, and 1% are Native American. The student body is evenly split between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Collegeboard.com|url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?match=true&amp;collegeId=1507&amp;searchType=college&amp;type=qfs&amp;word=st.%20joseph's%20university|title=Saint Joseph's University|publisher=College Board|accessdate=September 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a nearly even split between students who study at the College of Arts and Sciences and the Haub School of Business. Sixty-one percent of traditional full-time students reside on campus. The university is considered to be moderately selective during its admissions process and its freshmen retention rate is 89% while 47% of applicants are admitted which is fourth among the nation's twenty-eight Jesuit institutions. 38 states and 30 countries are represented by the student body. The student-faculty ratio is 13:1 and the average class size is around 30 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peterson's|url=http://www.petersons.com/ugchannel/code/IDD.asp?orderLineNum=949579-4&amp;reprjid=12&amp;inunId=8444&amp;typeVC=instvc&amp;sponsor=1|title=College Close-Up|publisher=Peterson's|accessdate=September 21, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle 50% GPA is a 3.28â3.84 and the middle 50% on the SAT is 1110â1280.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sju.edu/admissions/faqs/#5&lt;/ref&gt; The class of 2012 is the largest in the school's history with nearly 1,500 students.

===College of Professional and Liberal Studies===
The PLS program is Saint Joseph's undergraduate continuing studies division. As early as 1852, the administration at Saint Joseph's organized educational opportunities for adults. A regular series of non-credit courses in several areas was offered beginning in 1942, and beginning in 1946, the Evening Division, which would eventually be known as  College of Professional and Liberal Studies , was formally established. In addition to traditional on-campus programs and majors, PLS offers accelerated degree programs in English and professional communications, health administration, and leadership.  PLS students wishing to pursue a degree during the day take advantage of the division's bridge program, and professionals in certain areas can take part in off-campus programs in professional communications, criminal justice, food marketing, and purchasing and acquisitions.

===Honors Program===
The Honors Program offers an enriched curriculum that broadens cultural interests, integrates knowledge, sharpens writing skills and encourages student involvement in the learning process. Students may enroll in General Honors, which is awarded upon successful completion of eight Honors courses or Departmental Honors, which is awarded upon successful completion of a two-semester honors level research project. Students of an exceptional caliber may apply for the University Scholar designation. Those who qualify are freed from four to ten of their senior year course requirements in order to complete an independent project of unusual breadth, depth and originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sju.edu/honors/|title=Saint Joseph's University Honors Program|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:StJoseph Statue.jpg|200px|thumb|Statue of [[Saint Joseph]]|right]]
Saint Joseph's University's campus, often referred to as Hawk Hill, is located on [[City Avenue]], which splits the University between the northwestern edge of Philadelphia and [[Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Merion Township]]. A bridge which goes over City Avenue, connects the two sides of the campus. Its {{convert|103|acre|km2}} are concentrated from Cardinal Avenue to 52nd Street and Overbrook Avenue to City Avenue, but also includes individual buildings separate from the main campus. With the acquisition of the Maguire Campus, 57 of the {{convert|103|acre|km2}} are located on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue. It is within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of La Salle University, Harcum College, Rosemont College, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Drexel University]], [[Temple University]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Haverford College]], [[Philadelphia University]] and [[Villanova University]]. There are 650 work stations on campus and all of the dorms are wired for access to the campus-wide network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Collegeboard.com|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drmiss_3367_brief.php|title=Saint Joseph's University Academics and Support|publisher=College Board|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two regional rail train stations on each side of campus provide students with easy access to Center City. St. Mary's, Gest, Claver, Neumann, and Wolfington are all lawns located on the Main Campus while there are two quadrangles, College Hall Quad and Barbelin Quad. There are two libraries on campus, the Campbell Collection in Food Marketing &amp; the Francis A. Drexel Library which house approximately 355,000 volumes, 1,450 print journals, 15,000 full-text electronic journals, 2,800 e-books, 866,000 microforms, 4,975 audio-visual materials. Two shuttles operated by Saint Joseph's run along City Avenue and stop at Mandeville Hall for students.

===Main Campus===
The Main Campus at Saint Joseph's contains the majority of academic buildings and freshmen dorms at SJU. Barbelin, Mandeville, Bellarmine, Post Halls, and the Science Center are all located there. It also includes the Campion Student Center, the Drexel Library, Chapel of Saint Joseph, Hawks' Landing parking facility, the bookstore, [[Finnesey Field]], and [[Hagan Arena]]. The Main Campus is located on the Philadelphia side of City Avenue between Cardinal and Overbrook Avenues and 52nd Street.

===James J. Maguire '58 Campus===
On August 8, 2008, Saint Joseph's completed the acquisition of the adjacent Episcopal Academy after purchasing the property in 2005. The new campus {{convert|38|acre|m2}} was named the Maguire Campus for the lead donor, a Saint Joseph's alum, James Maguire. Many existing academic departments such as the English, Education, Sociology, and Fine and Performing Arts departments will relocate to the Maguire Campus effective Spring 2011. The first building to be in use has been named Connelly Hall. The Maguire Campus is located directly across from the Main Campus on the Lower Merion side of City Avenue.

The athletic department is also taking full advantage of the acquisition as eight tennis courts, softball, baseball, soccer, and two multi-purpose fields already reside there. A gym and indoor pool will also be used for intramurals and recreation.

What was the old Episcopal Academy chapel will become a multi-use space which will house lectures, concerts, and social gatherings. There are talks of a small cafeteria and coffee shop being added to this space as well.

Along with all of the buildings and fields, the Maguire Campus adds over 300 parking spaces for faculty and students and a number of acres will be turned into green space. There are over 600 different species of trees on the Maguire Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AnnMarie Gervasio|url=http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2008/05/10/Features/Diverse.Tree.Population.Ads.Character.To.Maguire-3368795.shtml|title=Diverse tree population ads character to Maguire|publisher=Saint Joseph's University Press|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maguire Campus is also home to the Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support established in 2009 which was made possible with donations totaling over $8 million. The Center is located in Connelly Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sju.edu/news/archives/kinney_center_091809.html|title=SJU Formally Opens Doors to Autism Center|publisher=Saint Joseph's University|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overbrook Campus===
The Overbrook Campus is located about a mile from and Main Campusânear Overbrook Train Station, and overlaps both sides of City Avenue. It includes mostly upper-classmen residence halls, a freshman residence hall (Moore Hall), and Alumni House. The SJU shuttle that runs along City Avenue stops at the Overbrook Campus.

===Buildings===
{{main|List of Saint Joseph's University buildings}}
Saint Joseph's most recognizable building is [[Barbelin Hall]], opened in 1927 when the University moved to its current location. The hall is known for its [[Gothic architecture]], particularly the gargoyles that mark what is called the Barbelin Quadrangle and the tall, four-spired bell tower that can be seen from miles away. The bell tower that sits atop Barbelin served as the University's logo for several years and is located upon Philadelphia's highest geographical location.[[Image:Barbelin tower.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Barbelin Tower]] Barbelin was built by [[John McShain]] who would later go on to construct many buildings in Washington, D.C. such as [[The Pentagon]] and The Jefferson Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hennelly, Meghan|url=http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2009/03/04/Features/Figures.On.Barbelin.Immortalize.Past.Presidents.And.1920s.Culture-3657318.shtml|title=Figures on Barbelin immortalize past presidents and 1920s culture|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbelin, and adjacent Lonergan Hall, are two of eight dedicated classroom buildings on campus. Other class buildings include John R. Post Hall, Mandeville Hall, Bellarmine Hall, the Science Center, Cynwyd Hall, and Boland Hall, the University's fine arts building which features the University Gallery where paintings and other works of art are showcased to students and the public. Classes are also held in Claver Hall, the home of the Honors Program; McShain Hall, a residence center; and the ELS building for international students. A number of buildings on the Maguire Campus will be dedicated to classes especially those for the fine arts. One building will be solely dedicated to the music department.[[Image:BarbelinWalkway.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Walkway under Barbelin Hall]]

The University has three dormitory-style residence halls: McShain, Sourin Hall, and LaFarge Residence Center. Students also live in several campus houses, including Hogan, Jordan, Quirk, St. Albert's, St. Mary's, Simpson, Sullivan, and Xavier Halls and the Morris Quadrangle Townhouses. Apartment-style living is available on campus at Ashwood, Merion Gardens, Rashford, and Wynnewood. Rashford and Lannon Halls are the newest campus residences, opened in 2004.

Many of the campuses houses are located on Lapsley Lane, which features a number of campus offices housed in the former homes of Lower Merion residents. These include Bronstein Hall, Regis Hall (Office of the President), and St. Thomas Hall.

The Campion Student Center is where students generally go to eat. It formerly included the Hawk's Nest, Campion C-Store, [[Quizno's]], Bene Pizza, Ancho Grill, Hawk Wrap, Grille Works, Freshens Smoothie Co., and Jump Asian Station. Following a renovation in the summer of 2008 however, it only retained Quizno's, Hawk Wrap, and Grill Works, in the food court, along with the C-Store outside of it. They did this opting to expand a meal plan cafeteria. The Student Center also has a Theatre Forum where current movies are shown frequently. It also used to have an area called the Hawk Rock where students can play pool, watch movies, play videogames, or watch live bands or speakers. This area was removed during the 2008 renovation in favor of cafeteria expansion. A similar area was opened however in the former bookstore which is adjacent to Campion. This area is now referred to as the perch.

In all, there are 89 buildings on the university's campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://www.sju.edu/sju/campus_map/campus_map.html|title=SJU: Campus Map|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60 percent of students at Saint Joseph's live on campus. Options for on campus housing include apartments, residence halls, campus houses, and townhouses.

{{see also|Holy War (Villanova vs. St. Joe's)|Saint Joseph's-Temple rivalry|Philadelphia Big 5}}
Saint Joseph's University is home of [[The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University mascot)|the Hawks]], the University's athletic program. It fields teams in 20 varsity sports in Division I of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. The Hawks are part of the [[Atlantic Ten Conference]]; because the Atlantic 10 does not support men's [[lacrosse]], the Hawks play in the competitive [[Colonial Athletic Association]]. Along with the Atlantic 10, Saint Joseph's is a member of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], intensifying rivalries with [[Temple University]] and [[Villanova University]] along with another A-10 member LaSalle and of course the University of Pennsylvania.  Saint Joseph's plays all of its &quot;home&quot; Big 5 games at The Palestra honoring the Big 5 Palestra traditions and encourages the other Big 5 schools to do so as often as possible.  The Saint Joseph's school colors are crimson and gray. An impressive 89% of student athletes graduate.&lt;ref name=&quot;bus.ucf.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=UCF|url=http://www.bus.ucf.edu/sport/public/downloads/2008_Mens_Basketball_Tournament_PR.pdf|format=PDF|title=Keeping Score When It Counts|publisher=bus.ucf.edu|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men's basketball===
{{main|Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball}}
Men's basketball is the most popular sport at Hawk Hill. The team has competed in nineteen NCAA Tournaments (1959, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008) and has won seven Atlantic 10 regular season titles and two A-10 tournament championships and ranks 33rd all time with a .605 winning percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NCAA|url=http://www.ncaa.org/stats/m_basketball/all_time_wins/2007_all_time_wins.pdf|format=PDF|title=2007 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball All-Time Winningest Teams|publisher=NCAA.org|accessdate=September 22, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080625062308/http://www.ncaa.org/stats/m_basketball/all_time_wins/2007_all_time_wins.pdf |archivedate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is currently led by coach [[Phil Martelli]]. The 2003â2004 Saint Joseph's University Hawks were the last Division I College Basketball team to finish the Regular Season undefeated. Saint Joseph's ended the regular season with a 27â0 record and secured a No. 1 national ranking and a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Saint Joseph's University's basketball team was ranked 43rd best of all-time by Smith &amp; Street's magazine in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=D.A.

The Saint Joseph's basketball teams play most of their home games at [[Hagan Arena]] on the school's campus, while some games are played at the [[Palestra]] on the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. During the 2008â09 basketball season, the Hawks will play all but one of their home games at the Palestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kerith Gabriel|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/colleges/27519759.html|title=Tough schedules for Temple, La Salle, Saint Joseph's|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first home game will be played against [[Rider University]] at the [[Wachovia Center]] in South Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SJU|url=http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/102208aac.html|title=Men's Basketball to Open Season Hosting Rider at the Wachovia Center|publisher=sju.edu|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saint Joseph's University also offers 30 intramural and recreational programs.

Their major rival is [[Villanova University]] (the rivalry is known as the [[Holy War (Villanova vs. St. Joe's)|Holy War]]). Fans of the Hawks often chant &quot;The Hawk Will Never Die!&quot;. Since the school's undefeated regular season, this chant has gained familiarity with the team's opponents. In 2003, [[Sports Illustrated]] listed that cheer among ''The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)'', calling it &quot;the most defiant cheer in college sports.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/sioncampus/09/24/100_things0930/|title=The 100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate (Whatever the Cost)|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Joseph's is also a member of the [[City 6]]. Similar to the Big 5, the City 6 comprises six local colleges who compete in various extramural sporting events. The schools who compete are Saint Joseph's, [[Villanova University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[La Salle University]], [[Drexel University]], and [[Temple University]]. About 75% of SJU men's basketball players graduate.&lt;ref name=&quot;bus.ucf.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BNET|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DXK/is_4_21/ai_n6006880|title=Top 25 graduation rates: March Madness teams, 2004|publisher=bnet.com|accessdate=September 22, 2008 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Joseph's University hosted first and second round games of the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The games were played at the [[Wachovia Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania on March 19 and March 21.

In 2009, the 2004 Hawks were named the best single-season team of the decade by Sports Illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sports Illustrated|url=http://m.si.com/news/to/to/detail/2126433;jsessionid=CECF30A3A358526B519FEDB49F5F9DA4.cnnsi1|title=Best (And Worst) Of 2000s: College Basketball|publisher=si.com|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletic facilities===
*'''East Norriton Field''': Located in East Norriton, Pa., East Norriton Field has served as Saint Joseph's University home softball field for the past 11 seasons. Prior to its move to East Norriton Field, SJU used nearby Belmont Plateau as its primary home field.
*'''[[Gillin Boat Club|Robert Gillin, Jr. Boathouse]]''': Saint Joseph's University celebrated its sesquicentennial anniversary in 2000â01. In conjunction with that celebration, the SJU Rowing Program, along with Saint Joseph's Prep, kicked off a capital campaign to finance the construction of a state-of-the-art boathouse on the Schuylkill River. The boathouse provides a permanent home for the Hawk rowing programs. In addition, it provides the University with a significant presence on Kelly Drive. Named in honor of Robert Gillin, Jr., groundbreaking for the facility took place in the fall of 2001. The total cost for the project was approximately $3 million dollars, plus an endowment fund to support ongoing operational costs.
*'''Finnesey Field''': Laid out in a natural bowl in the center of Saint Joseph's campus, [[Finnesey Field]] has been the home of Hawk athletic teams since 1929. Originally constructed for football and opened in 1929 with plans for an eventual 70,000-seat stadium, the field has undergone numerous changes over the years.
*'''Tennis Complex at the Maguire Campus''': The tennis team moved to the six refurbished courts on the Maguire Campus in 2009 with the first SJU Invitational.
*'''Finnesey Courts''': Adjacent to Finnesey Field stand the Finnesey Courts and home to the Hawk men's and women's tennis teams from the late 1940s until 2009. Prior to that SJU primarily played its home matches at the nearby Narberth courts. When courts were first built on campus, they were located where Bellarmine Hall now stands. Due to Bellarmine's construction in the summer of 1960, however, the Finnesey courts were torn down and rebuilt in their current location. These courts are still used by students.
*'''[[Michael J. Hagan Arena]]''': The on-campus home of the Hawks basketball teams, originally named for the Saint Joseph's graduates who gave their lives in World War II. The building was officially dedicated on November 11, 1949 and two weeks later, played host to its first basketball game, a 62â46 loss to Rhode Island on November 26. Following that initial setback, SJU would go on to win the next 23 games in the friendly confines of the Fieldhouse. Overall, the Hawks have compiled an impressive 305â76 record (80.0 winning percentage) on Hawk Hill. Among the highlights of the Hawks' homecourt advantage was a 34-game winning streak from the late 1950s to the early 1960s, an 11â0 record in 2000â01 and the unbeaten 11â0 mark as the Hawks made their perfect season run in 2003â04.

==Student life==
All students receive a HawkCard which can be linked to banking services and is also used as a swipe card which then gives students access to residence halls or other areas of campus. Students can also use their HawkCards to pay for meals or snacks at various locations around campus. Student life is documented in ''[[The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University Newspaper)|The Hawk]]'', the school newspaper. Intramurals are popular on campus, especially thanks to the [[City 6]] extramurals which pit all Philadelphia Division I schools against one another.

===Organizations===
The school offers many organizations for students to join. They include five national [[fraternities]] and four national sororities, a radio station, WSJR, and two newspapers, [[The Hawk (Saint Joseph's University Newspaper)|''The Hawk'']] and the HawkEye.

The Villiger Debating Society, the school's 150 year-old, nationally recognized speech and debate team, has finished in the top twenty in the nation for the past ten years.

A number of community service organizations exist such as Up 'Til Dawn, [[Habitat For Humanity]], Hand In Hand, Helping Hawks, Students Against Sweatshops, and Students For Peace and Justice. A campus-wide student activities organization, the Student Union Board, and a student government organization, the University Student Senate, also exist.

There are over 100 organizations in all at SJU.

==Traditions==
*'''Hawk Hill''': In the early 1920s, when former University president Albert G. Brown, S.J. decided to move the college campus from its location just north of the city at Seventeenth and Stiles to its current site in Overbrook on Philadelphia's west side, he selected the location in part because its hilltop perch overlooking downtown Philadelphia provided a dramatic setting for the construction of the college's main building, [[Barbelin Hall]]. In fact, for many years Barbelin's signature carillon tower ranked as the highest point from sea level in the city of Philadelphia. Later, according to oral tradition, students and faculty frequently saw real hawks circling the skies above Barbelin, before swooping down on their prey. The familiar scene eventually led to the coining of the moniker &quot;Hawk Hill&quot;.
*'''Colors''': The college colors of crimson and gray date back to the 1890s when it is related that a young seminarian leading a pep rally saw the colors on a book he was holding. Thinking they looked attractive together, he announced that these would be the school colors.
*'''Fight Songs''': &quot;Oh When the Hawks Go Flying In!!&quot; and &quot;Mine Eyes&quot;.
*'''The Hawk Will Never Die''': The motto of Saint Joseph's athletics and the University itself. Chanted at basketball games, the mascot demonstrates the motto by flapping its wings the entire game including halftime.
*'''Free Period''': There are no scheduled classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 11:15 and 1:00 which allows student organizations to meet.
*'''The Seal''': Many students avoid walking on the university seal in Mandeville Hall until their senior year.
*'''Saint Joseph statue''': Students rub the toes of this statue in front of Barbelin Hall for good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Joyce, S.J.|url=http://media.www.sjuhawknews.com/media/storage/paper763/news/2006/09/22/Features/Ignatian.Corner.Sju.Folklore.Rub.St.Josephs.Foot.For.Luck-2290696.shtml|title=SJU folklore: Rub St. Joseph's foot for luck|publisher=sjuhawknews.com|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Chapel of St. Joseph/Michael Smith, S.J. Memorial''': Being a Jesuit institution, the Chapel is an important and popular place for many students.  Mass is celebrated weekly at the University at 11 AM, with 8 PM and 10 PM masses when students are on campus.  Mass is also celebrated daily at noon, with other evening worship activities.
*'''Basketball''': A rich and important tradition at a school in a city known for college hoops.
