<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="4537672" ns="0" title="Fly, Eagles Fly"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">&quot;'''Fly, Eagles Fly'''&quot; is the [[fight song]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]]. The song is played following an Eagles [[touchdown]] at home.

==History==
The fight song was the creation of Charles Borrelli and Roger Courtland as credited in various editions of Eagles programs from 1960. A claim by former Eagles owner Jerry Wolman, that it was his daughter who penned the Eagles Victory song has been proven to be untrue. The original first verse of the song was &quot;Fight Eagles Fight&quot; which was again repeated in the second verse. The lyrics of the first verse were changed to &quot;Fly Eagles Fly&quot; at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This little ditty has big staying power,  Fans can't get Eagles fight song out of their heads |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=January 2, 2003 |page=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
