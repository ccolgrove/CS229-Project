Jacques Laudy was born in [[Schaarbeek]] in 1907 as the son of the painter Jean Laudy. He worked mainly as a painter, illustrator and comics artist. Laudy had started his career as an artist for ''[[Bravo (Belgian magazine)|Bravo]]'', together with ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' one of the leading Belgian comics magazines before and during [[World War II]]. One of the other artists there was [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs]], who had first met Laudy in the 1920s and who would become a lifelong friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=BiermÃ©|first=Philippe|title=Chez Edgar P.: Jacobs: dans l'intimitÃ© du pÃ¨re de Blake et Mortimer|year=2004|publisher=Editions du CEFAL|isbn= 9782871301912|pages=112|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L2jVCRca0x0C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22Jacques+Laudy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_PMhTI7LK5zfsAajpvHlBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Laudy%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 June 2010|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laudy was the physical example for Blake, one of the main characters of Jacobs' ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaudez|first=Florent|title=Les arts moyens aujourd'hui: actes du colloque international d'Albi, 30-31 mars, 1er avril 2006, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=Editions L'Harmattan|isbn=9782296058705|pages=350|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YorGsNMDkTYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22Jacques+Laudy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f_ohTMeBKoiosQaDge3lBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacques%20Laudy%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 June 2010|page=218|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HergÃ©]] asked Laudy as one of the first artists, together with Jacobs, [[Paul Cuvelier]], and [[Jacques van Melkebeke]], to fill the new magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]''. Laudy created ''The Legend of the Four [[Renaud de Montauban|Aymon Brothers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Assouline|first=Pierre|title=HergÃ©: The Man Who Created Tintin|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=9780195397598|pages=288|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YsyEMjvdYJgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22Jacques+Laudy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_PMhTI7LK5zfsAajpvHlBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Laudy%22&amp;f=false|authorlink=Pierre Assouline|accessdate=23 June 2010|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; His only real series was ''Hassan et Kadour'', while the rest of his oeuvre consisted mainly of one-offs, stories that didn't belong in a series. This lack of a series and lack of album publication also meant that Laudy never became as well known as the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Couvreur|first=Daniel|title= L'auteur de bande dessinÃ©e Jacques Laudy amait conter Etterbeek le Royaume d'Otterbeek, Ã  l'Est de Broebeleer|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/l-auteur-de-bande-dessinee-jacques-laudy-aimait-conter-_t-19931216-Z07LFJ.html|accessdate=23 June 2010|newspaper=Le Soir|date=16 December 1993|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he wa the focus of a retrospective exhibition at the [[Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art]].

His main interest outside art was music. From 1928 on, he was a collector and maker of [[Pipe (instrument)|pipes]], mainly Scottish ones. An instrument made by him in 1940 is in the collection of the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Musical Instrument Museum of Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haine|first=Malou|title=Dictionnaire des facteurs d'instruments de musique en Wallonie et Ã  Bruxelles du 9e siÃ¨cle Ã  nos jours|year=1986|publisher=Mardaga|isbn= 9782870092507|pages=785|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hIJlukgYzFUC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=%22Jacques+Laudy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_PMhTI7LK5zfsAajpvHlBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacques%20Laudy%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 June 2010|page=245|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
