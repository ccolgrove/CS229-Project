'''Trinity College''' is a [[Colleges of the University of Cambridge|constituent college]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. Trinity has more members than any other college in Cambridge or [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], with around 700 [[undergraduate]]s, 430 [[graduate student|graduate]]s, and over 170 [[Fellow]]s (however, counting only the student body but not Fellows, Trinity has somewhat fewer students than [[Homerton College, Cambridge|Homerton College]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;student-numbers&quot;&gt;Student figures from the 2006â2007 Cambridge Reporter&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity is widely regarded as &quot;a world-leading academic institution with an outstanding record of education, learning and research&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;leading&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/weekly/6035/|title=Job advertisement for new Trinity College Junior Bursar, Cambridge University Reporter|date=2006-05-10|accessdate=2006-06-19|author=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like its sister college, [[Christ Church, Oxford]], Trinity is traditionally considered the most [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] college of its university, and has generally been the college of choice of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] ([[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]], [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Prince Henry of Gloucester]], [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Prince William of Gloucester and Edinburgh]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] were all graduates) ''The Push Guide to Which University'' (2005) called it &quot;arguably the grandest Cambridge college&quot; and it has been called &quot;the most magnificent collegiate institution in England&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/221566132.html?dids=221566132:221566132&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Aug+26%2C+1952&amp;author=&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Trinity+College%2C+Cambridge&amp;pqatl=google | work=The Christian Science Monitor | title=Trinity College, Cambridge | date=1952-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Christ Church, the college has been associated with [[Westminster School]] since the school's refoundation in 1560 and the Master remains  an ex officio member of the school's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intranet.westminster.org.uk/lists/whoswho/governors.asp |title=Westminster School Intranet |publisher=Intranet.westminster.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of state school to private school pupils at Trinity is roughly 2:3. In 2006 it had the lowest state school intake (39%) of any Cambridge college, and on a rolling three-year average Trinity has admitted a smaller proportion of state school pupils (42%) than any other Oxbridge college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/11/table7.pdf Cambridge 2005/2006 admissions statistics by college]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table7.pdf Cambridge 2004/2005 admissions statistics by college]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/document.rm?id=350 Oxford 3-year average admissions statistics by college]&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity claims that its admissions policy is dictated solely by academic prospects, regardless of prior schooling. It first admitted women graduate students in 1976 and women undergraduates in 1978; and appointed its first female fellow in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=40 Trinity College web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity has an outstanding international academic reputation, its members having won 32 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=401 |title=Trinity College Cambridge - Nobel Prizes |publisher=Trin.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Nobel prizes by university affiliation|88 Nobel Prizes awarded to members of Cambridge University]], four [[Fields Medal]]s and an [[Abel Prize]] in mathematics and two [[Templeton Prize]]s in religion. In 2008 it had the highest proportion of students gaining Firsts of any college.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tompkins Table]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Trinity has many notable alumni including six British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime ministers]] and several heads of other nations, but its most distinguished include [[Isaac Newton]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[George VI]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. 

Amongst its many college societies, Trinity has the oldest mathematical university society in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]] and its [[Sport rowing|rowing]] club the [[First and Third Trinity Boat Club]] gives its name to Trinity's [[May Ball]], one of the largest of the University. 

The first formalised rules of [[Association Football|football]], known as the [[Cambridge Rules]], were drawn up at Trinity College in 1848 by Cambridge undergraduate representatives of fashionable schools such as Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0252067185&amp;id=i32zcifYgEgC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22association+football%22+trinity+college&amp;sig=vDgkE1fJeTAX0isq1nGtNf8Gk-U |title=The world's game: a history of soccer - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgeshirefa.com/history.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Cambridge_University_colleges_timeline.svg|thumb|445px|Timeline showing merger of [[King's Hall, Cambridge|Kingâs Hall]] and [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]] to form Trinity College after [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]].]]  
[[File:CambridgeTrinityGreatGate.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The statue of the college's founder [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] presiding over the Great Gate]]
[[File:StatueOfIsaacNewton.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The statue of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], located in the college chapel]]

The college was founded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1546, from the merger of two existing colleges: [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]] (founded by [[Hervey de Stanton]] in 1324), and [[King's Hall, Cambridge|Kingâs Hall]] (established by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1317 and refounded by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1337). At the time, Henry had been seizing church lands from abbeys and monasteries. The universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], being both religious institutions and quite rich, expected to be next in line. The king duly passed an [[Act of Parliament]] that allowed him to suppress (and confiscate the property of) any college he wished. The universities used their contacts to plead with his sixth wife, [[Catherine Parr]]. The queen persuaded her husband not to close them down, but to create a new college. The king did not want to use royal funds, so he instead combined two colleges ([[King's Hall, Cambridge|Kingâs Hall]] and [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]]) and seven hostels (Physwick (formerly part of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]), Gregoryâs, Ovyngâs, Catherineâs, Garratt, Margaretâs, and Tylerâs) to form Trinity.

Contrary to popular belief, the monastic lands supplied by Henry VIII were alone insufficient to ensure Trinity's eventual rise. In terms of architecture and royal association, it was not until the Mastership of Thomas Nevile (1593â1615) that Trinity assumed both its spaciousness and courtly association with the governing class that distinguished it until the Civil War. In its infancy Trinity had owed a great deal to its neighbouring college of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]]: in the exaggerated words of Roger Ascham Trinity was little more than a ''colonia deducta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66656#s20 |title=The colleges and halls - Trinity College &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first four Masters were educated at St John's, and it took until around 1575 for the two colleges' application numbers to draw even, a position in which they have remained since the Civil War. In terms of wealth, Trinity's current fortunes belie prior fluctuations; Nevile's building campaign drove the college into debt from which it only surfaced in the 1640s, and the mastership of [[Richard Bentley]] (notorious for the construction of a hugely expensive staircase in the Master's Lodge, and Bentley's repeated refusals to step down despite pleas from the Fellowship) adversely affected applications and finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;british-history1&quot;/&gt;

Most of the Trinityâs major buildings date from the 16th and 17th centuries. [[Thomas Nevile]], who became Master of Trinity in 1593, rebuilt and re-designed much of the college. This work included the enlargement and completion of [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]], and the construction of [[Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge|Nevileâs Court]] between Great Court and the river [[River Cam|Cam]]. Nevileâs Court was completed in the late 17th century when the [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]], designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], was built.

In the 20th century, Trinity College, St John's College and [[King's College, Cambridge|Kingâs College]] were for decades the main recruiting grounds for the [[Cambridge Apostles]], an elite, intellectual secret society. Since graduating from Trinity, HRH The Prince of Wales has retained a private apartment in usufruct at the back of the college. The apartment is maintained for private and informal visits.  On a recent visit, his sons William (latterly the HRH The Duke of Cambridge) and brother Harry both visited during their motorcycle tour of the UK.

The full name of the college is &quot;'''The Master, [[Fellow]]s and Scholars of the [[College]] of the Most Holy and Undivided [[Trinity]] in the [[Cambridge|Town]] and [[University of Cambridge]]&quot;.

==Buildings and grounds==
[[File:TrinityCollegeCamGreatGate.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Great Gate]]
[[File:TrinityCollegeCamGreatCourt.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] with fountain]]

;Kingâs Hostel (1377â1416, various architects): Located to the north of Great Court, behind the Clock Tower, this is (along with the Kingâs Gate), the sole remaining building from [[King's Hall, Cambridge|Kingâs Hall]].

;Great Gate: The Great Gate is the main entrance to the college, leading to the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]]. A statue of the college founder, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], stands in a niche above the doorway. In his hand he holds a table leg instead of the original sword and myths abound as to how the switch was carried out and by whom. In 1704, the Universityâs first [[Astronomy departments in the University of Cambridge|astronomical]] [[observatory]] was built on top of the gatehouse. Beneath the founder's statue are the coats of arms of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], the founder of King's Hall, and those of his five sons who survived to maturity, as well as William of Hatfield, whose shield is blank as he died as an infant, before being granted arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=44&amp;stop=1 |title=Trinity College Cambridge - The Great Gate - The Great Gate - Stop 1 |publisher=Trin.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] (principally 1599-1608, various architects): The brainchild of [[Thomas Nevile]], who demolished several existing buildings on this site, including almost the entirety of the former college of [[Michaelhouse, Cambridge|Michaelhouse]]. The sole remaining building of Michaelhouse was replaced by the current Kitchens (designed by [[James Essex]]) in 1770-1775. See [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/360/trinity_college_court.shtml 360Â° panorama of Great Court] from the BBC. The Master's Lodge is the official residence of the Sovereign when in Cambridge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

;[[Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge|Nevileâs Court]] (1614, unknown architect): Located between Great Court and the river, this court was created by a bequest by the collegeâs master, [[Thomas Nevile]], originally â of its current length and without the [[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]]. The appearance of the upper floor was remodelled slightly two centuries later.

;Bishopâs Hostel (1671, [[Robert Minchin]]): A detached building to the southwest of Great Court, and named after [[John Hacket]], Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry. Additional buildings were built in 1878 by Arthur Blomfield.

;[[Wren Library, Cambridge|Wren Library]] (1676â1695, [[Christopher Wren]]): Located at the west end of Nevileâs Court, the Wren is one of Cambridgeâs most famous and well-endowed libraries. Among its notable possessions are two of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeareâs]] First Folios, a 14th-century manuscript of [[The Vision of Piers Plowman]], and letters written by Sir Isaac Newton. Below the building are the pleasant Wren Library Cloisters, where students may enjoy a fine view of the Great Hall in front of them, and the river and [[The Backs|Backs]] directly behind.

;New Court (or ''Kingâs Court''; 1825, [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]]): Located to the south of Nevileâs Court, and built in Tudor-Gothic style, this court is notable for the large tree in the centre. A myth is sometimes circulated that this was the tree from which the apple dropped onto [[Isaac Newton]]; in fact Newton was at Woolsthorpe when he deduced his theory of gravity. Many other âNew Courtsâ in the colleges were built at this time to accommodate the new influx of students.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Whewells.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Whewellâs Courts]] --&gt;
;Whewellâs Courts (1860 &amp; 1868, [[Anthony Salvin]]): Located across the street from Great Court, these two courts were entirely paid for by [[William Whewell]], the then master of the college. The north range was later remodelled by [[W.D. Caroe]]. Note: Whewell is pronounced âHugh-wellâ.

;Angel Court (1957â1959, [[H. C. Husband]]): Located between Great Court and [[Trinity Street, Cambridge|Trinity Street]].

;Wolfson Building (1968â1972, Architects Co-Partnership): Located to the south of Whewellâs Court, on top of a podium above shops, this building resembles a brick-clad ziggurat, and is used exclusively for first-year accommodation. Having been renovated during the academic year 2005â06, it is once again in use.

;Blue Boar Court (1989, [[McCormac Jamieson Prichard|MJP Architects]] and Wright): Located to the south of the Wolfson Building, on top of podium a floor up from ground level, and including the upper floors of several surrounding Georgian buildings on Trinity, Green and [[Sidney Street, Cambridge|Sidney Street]].

;[[Burrell's Field]] (1995, [[McCormac Jamieson Prichard|MJP Architects]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjparchitects.co.uk/index.php?show=Burrells_Field_%3Cbr%3ETrinity_College,%3Cbr%3E_Cambridge |title=MJP Architects |publisher=MJP Architects |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on a site to the west of the main College buildings, opposite the [[Cambridge University Library]].

There are also College rooms above shops in [[Bridge Street, Cambridge|Bridge Street]] and [[Jesus Lane]], behind Whewellâs Court, and graduate accommodation in Portugal Street and other roads around Cambridge.

== Traditions ==
===The Great Court Run===

[[File:ISH WC Trinity3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Trinity Great Court]]
[[File:NewtonsPrincipia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Newton's very own copy of the [[PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]], with handwritten corrections, on display in the Wren Library]]

The Great Court Run is an attempt to run round the 400-yard perimeter of [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] (approximately 367 m), in the 43 seconds of the clock striking twelve. Students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit on the day of the Matriculation Dinner. It is a rather difficult challenge: one needs to be a fine sprinter to achieve it, but it is by no means necessary to be of Olympic standard, despite assertions made in the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/athletics/article2748773.ece Student breaks 'Chariots of Fire' record] ''Times Online'' article. October 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely believed that [[Sebastian Coe]] successfully completed the run when he beat [[Steve Cram]] in a charity race in October 1988. Sebastian Coe's time on 29 October 1988 was reported by [[Norris McWhirter]] to have been 45.52 seconds, but it was actually 46.0 seconds (confirmed by the video tape), while Cram's was 46.3 seconds. The clock on that day took 44.4 seconds (i.e. a &quot;long&quot; time, probably two days after the last winding) and the video film confirms that Coe was some 12 metres short of his finish line when the fateful final stroke occurred. The television commentators were more than a little disingenuous in suggesting that the dying sounds of the bell could be included in the striking time, thereby allowing Coe's run to be claimed as successful.

One reason Olympic runners Cram and Coe found the challenge so tough is that they started at the middle of one side of the Court, thereby having to negotiate four right-angle turns. In the days when students started at the corner, only three turns were needed.

Until the mid-1990s, the run was traditionally attempted by first year students, at midnight following their Matriculation Dinner. Following a number of accidents to drunk undergraduates running on slippery cobbles, the college now organises a more formal Great Court Run, at 12 noon: the challenge is only open to freshers, many of whom compete in fancy dress.

===Open-Air Concerts===

One Sunday each June (the exact date depends on the university term), the [[Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge|College Choir]] perform a short concert immediately after the clock strikes noon. Known as ''Singing from the Towers'', half of the choir sings from the top of Great Gate, while the other half sings from the top of the Clock Tower (approximately 60 metres away), giving a strong [[antiphon]]al effect. Midway through the concert, a brass band performs from the top of Queenâs Tower. Later that same day, the College Choir gives a second open-air concert, known as ''Singing on the River'', where they perform [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s (and arrangements of popular songs) from a raft of [[punt (boat)|punts]] on the [[River Cam|river]]. As a 'tradition', however, this latter event dates back only to the mid-1980s, when the College Choir first acquired female members. In the years immediately before this an annual concert on the river was given by the University Chamber Choir.
[[File:Wittgenstein notes 1914.jpg|thumb|200px|The original manuscript of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] '''Notes on Logic', 1914'', on display in the Wren Library]]

===Mallard===

Another tradition relates to a duck known as the Mallard, which should reside in the rafters of the Great Hall. Students occasionally moved the duck from one rafter to another without permission from the college, being photographed with the Mallard as proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1068987174757 Sir Francis (Drake) flies high above Cambridge!]&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered difficult, access to the Hall outside meal-times is prohibited and the rafters are dangerously high, so it was not attempted for several years. During the Easter term of 2006, the Mallard was knocked off its rafter by one of the pigeons which enter the Hall through the pinnacle windows.  It was found intact on the floor, and revealed to not be made out of wood as generally believed. It is currently held by the College and it is unknown whether it will be reinstated.

===Bicycles and chair legs===

For many years it was the custom for students to place a bicycle high in branches of the tree in the centre of New Court. Usually
invisible except in winter, when the leaves had fallen, such bicycles tended to remain for several years before being removed
by the authorities. The students then inserted another bicycle.
Similarly, the sceptre held by the statue of Henry VIII mounted above the medieval Great Gate was replaced with a chair leg as a prank many years ago. It has remained there to this day: when in the 1980s students exchanged the chair leg for a bicycle pump, the College replaced the chair leg.
[[File:ISH WC Trinity1.jpg|thumb|200px|Dining Hall]]

===College Rivalry===

The college remains a great rival of [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St Johnâs]] which is its main competitor in sports and academia (Johnâs is situated next to Trinity). This has given rise to a number of anecdotes and myths. It is often cited as the reason why the older courts of Trinity generally have no J staircases, despite including other letters in alphabetical order. A far more likely reason remains the absence of the letter J in the [[Roman alphabet]], and it should be noted that [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St Johnâs College's]] older courts also lack J staircases. There are also two small muzzle-loading cannons on the bowling green pointing in the direction of Johnâs, though this orientation may be coincidental. Generally the colleges maintain a cordial relationship with one other, and Trinity's benefaction and association with her neighboring colleges has always far outweighed such rivalries; compatriotism led famously to the splitting of the atomic nucleus in 1932 by [[Ernest Walton]] and [[John Cockcroft]], of Trinity and St John's respectively.

===Minor traditions===
Trinity College undergraduate gowns are dark blue, as opposed to the black favoured by most other Cambridge colleges. 

As with many other Cambridge colleges, the grassed courtyards are generally out of bounds for everyone except the Fellows. Only one of two meadows on &quot;the Backs&quot; (riverside area behind the college) is accessible to students, and other lawns are accessible to graduates in formal gowns.

== College Grace ==
Each evening before dinner, grace is recited by the senior Fellow presiding. The simple grace is as follows: 

:''Benedic, Domine, nos et dona tua, (Bless us, Lord, and these gifts)''
:''quae de largitate tua sumus sumpturi, (which, through your generosity, we are about to receive)''
:''et concede, ut illis salubriter nutriti (and grant that we, wholesomely nourished by them,)''
:''tibi debitum obsequium praestare valeamus, (may be able to offer you the service we owe)''
:''per Christum Dominum nostrum. (through Christ our Lord)''

If both of the two High Tables are in use then the following antiphonal formula is prefixed to the main grace: 

:''A. Oculi omnium in te sperant Domine: (The eyes of all are on you, Lord)''
:''B. Et tu das escam illis in tempore. (and you give them their food, in due time.)''
:''A. Aperis tu manum tuam, (You open your hand)''
:''B. Et imples omne animal benedictione. (and bestow upon all living things your blessing.) ''

Following the meal, the simple formula ''Benedicto benedicatur'' is pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald H. Adams, The College Graces of Oxford and Cambridge (Oxford: Perpetua Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarships and prizes ==

The Scholars, together with the Master and Fellows, make up the '''Foundation of the College'''.

In order of seniority:

'''Research Scholars''' receive funding for graduate studies. Typically one must graduate in the top ten percent of one's class and continue for graduate study at Trinity. They are given first preference in the assignment of college rooms and number approximately 25.

The '''Senior Scholars''' consist of those who attain a degree with [[British undergraduate degree classification|First Class honours]] or higher in any year after the first of an undergraduate [[tripos]], but also, those who obtain an extremely good First in their first year. The college pays them a stipend of Â£250 a year and also allows them to choose rooms directly following the research scholars. There are around 40 senior scholars at any one time.

The '''Junior Scholars''' are precisely those who are not senior scholars but still obtained a First in their first year. Their stipend is Â£175 a year. They are given preference in the room ballot over 2nd years who are not scholars.

These scholarships are tenable for the academic year following that in which the result was achieved. If a scholarship is awarded but the student does not continue at Trinity then only a quarter of the stipend is given. However all students who achieve a First are awarded an additional Â£200 prize upon announcement of the results.

All final year undergraduates who achieve first-class honours in their final exams are offered full financial support for proceeding with a [[master's degree|Masterâs]] degree at Cambridge (this funding is also sometimes available for good students who achieved high second-class honours). Other support is available for [[Doctorate|PhD]] degrees. The College also offers a number of other bursaries and studentships open to external applicants. The highly-regarded right to walk on the grass in the college courts is exclusive to Fellows of the college and their guests. Scholars do however have the right to walk on Scholarâs Lawn, but only in full academic dress.

== Trinity in Camberwell ==

[[File:River Cam green.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[River Cam]], as it flows through the back of Trinity; Trinity Bridge is visible and the punt house is to the right of the moored punts.]] 

Trinity College has a long-standing relationship with the Parish of St Georgeâs, [[Camberwell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dswark.org/parishes/051l.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in South London. Students from the College have helped to run holiday schemes for children from the parish since 1966. The relationship was formalized in 1979 with the establishment of '''Trinity in Camberwell''' as a registered charity (Charity Commission no. 279447)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ |title=Charity Commission Homepage |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which exists âto provide, promote, assist and encourage the advancement of education and relief of need and other charitable objects for the benefit of the community in the Parish of St George's, [[Camberwell]], and the neighbourhood thereof.â

== Trinity in Literature ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock, &lt;br /&gt;
Who never let the quarters, night or day,&lt;br /&gt;
Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours &lt;br /&gt;
Twice over with a male and female voice. &lt;br /&gt;
Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;&lt;br /&gt; 
And from my pillow, looking forth by light &lt;br /&gt;
Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold &lt;br /&gt;
The antechapel where the statue stood &lt;br /&gt;
Of Newton with his prism and silent face,&lt;br /&gt; 
The marble index of a mind for ever &lt;br /&gt;
Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; â [[William Wordsworth]], The Prelude (1850), Book Third, describing his view from [[St John's College, Cambridge]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;One night, just before ten o'clock, he [Maurice] slipped into Trinity and waited in the Great Court until the gates were shut behind him. Looking up, he noticed the night. He was indifferent to beauty as a rule, but &quot;what a show of stars!&quot; he thought. And how the fountain splashed when the chimes died away, and the gates and doors all over Cambridge had been fastened up. Trinity men were around him â all of enormous intellect and culture. Maurice's set had laughed at Trinity, but they could not ignore its disdainful radiance, or deny the superiority it scarcely troubles to affirm. He had come to it without their knowledge, humbly, to ask its help. His witty speech faded in its atmosphere, and his heart beat violently.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; â [[E. M. Forster]], graduate of [[King's College Cambridge]], writes of Maurice Hall's search for homesexual love at Trinity College in his novel, [[Maurice (novel)|Maurice]] (completed 1914, published 1970).

&lt;blockquote&gt;'[B]ut here I was actually at the door which leads into the library itself. I must have opened it, for instantly there issued, like a guardian angel barring the way with a flutter of black gown instead of white wings, a deprecating, silvery, kindly gentleman, who regretted in a low voice as he waved me back that ladies are only admitted to the library if accompanied by a Fellow of the college or furnished with a letter of introduction. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That a famous library has been cursed by a woman is a matter of complete indifference to a famous library. Venerable and calm, with all its treasures safe locked within its breast, it sleeps complacently and will, so far as I am concerned, so sleep for ever.'&lt;/blockquote&gt; â [[Virginia Woolf]] describes her attempt at entry to the Wren, [[A Room of One's Own]] (1929)

== Legends ==
&lt;!--Renamed file removed [[File:DSCF3135.JPG|thumb|left|200px]] --&gt;
[[File:Lord Byron in Albanian dress.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Byron]] purportedly kept a pet bear whilst living in the college &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalbyronsociety.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5&amp;Itemid=7 |title=University |publisher=International Byron Society |date= |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many apocryphal stories have been told about the college's wealth. Trinity is sometimes suggested to be the second, third or fourth wealthiest landowner in the UK (or in England) â after the [[Crown land|Crown Estate]], the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and the [[Church of England]]. (A variant of this legend is repeated in the [[Tom Sharpe]] novel ''[[Porterhouse Blue]]''.) This story is frequently repeated by tour guides. In 2005, Trinity's annual rental income from its properties was reported to be in excess of Â£20 million.

A second legend is that it is possible to walk from Cambridge to [[Oxford]] on land solely owned by Trinity. Several varieties of this legend exist â others refer to the combined land of Trinity College, Cambridge and [[Trinity College, Oxford]], of Trinity College, Cambridge and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], or [[St John's College, Oxford]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. All are most certainly false.

Trinity is often cited as the inventor of an English, less sweet, version of [[crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e]], known as &quot;Trinity burnt cream&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thefoody.com/pudding/burntcream.html Cambridge Trinity Burnt Cream]&lt;/ref&gt; although the college chefs have sometimes been known to refer to it as &quot;Trinity Creme Brulee&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/tcss/symp_2006/dinner_menu.html Dinner Menu]&lt;/ref&gt; The burnt-cream, first introduced at Trinity [[High Table]] in 1879, in fact differs quite markedly from French recipes, the earliest of which is from 1691.

===Masters===
[[File:Martin Rees at Jodrell Bank in 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|The Lord Rees of Ludlow, OM, PRS]] has been Master of Trinity since 2004]]
The head of Trinity College is the Master. The first Master was [[John Redman (Trinity College)|John Redman]] who was appointed in 1546. The role is a Crown appointment, made by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=172 |title=Trinity College Cambridge â Master of Trinity â Lord Rees (of Ludlow) |publisher=Trin.cam.ac.uk |date=2004-01-15 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the Fellows of the College, and to a lesser extent the Government, choose the new Master and the Royal role is only nominal. In modern times the Master has customarily been of the highest academic distinction. 

The last three Masters have all been fellows of the college. The current master is [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|The Lord Rees of Ludlow, &lt;small&gt;OM, PRS&lt;/small&gt;]].

==College finances==

Trinity is the wealthiest [[Oxbridge]] college&lt;ref name=&quot;wealthiest&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&amp;sid=aDJspMg5jl24&amp;refer=home|title=Cambridge and Oxford Adopt U.S. Methods to Win Alumni Donations|date=2005-12-01|accessdate=2006-06-19|author=Bloomberg.com}}. By way of comparison, the second wealthiest college in Cambridge ([[St. John's College, Cambridge|St. Johnâs]]) has an estimated endowment of c. Â£504 million, and the richest college in Oxford (St. John's) has about Â£200 million.&lt;/ref&gt; with an independent [[financial endowment]] of approximately Â£700 million (as of 2010). 

Of this amount approx. Â£75 million is part of the college's Amalgamated Trust Funds, which is dedicated for specific purposes. 

Trinity's land, including holdings in the [[Port of Felixstowe]] and the [[Cambridge Science Park]], is insured for approx. Â£266.5 million (this does not include all fixed assets).&lt;ref name=&quot;insured&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/archive/colleges.pdf|title=Varsity report|date=2006-11|accessdate=2006-11-20|format=PDF |publisher=varsity.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Trinity acquired a stake in [[The O2 Arena (London)|The O2 Arena]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/construction_and_property/article6868830.ece|title=Trinity College Cambridge buys into the O2 Arena in Â£24m deal|date=2006-10-10|accessdate=2009-10-16 | work=The Times | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sherwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; in London; under the terms of the deal the college  receives rental and sales income from the venue.
