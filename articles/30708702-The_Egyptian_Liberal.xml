Esraa worked as a human resources administrator,&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; when she co-founded [[April 6 Youth Movement|April&amp;nbsp;6 Youth Movement]] Egypt in 2008, a Facebook group that was made to support the workers in [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]], an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April&amp;nbsp;6. This group gradually became a popular political movement.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Noam Cohen: [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/technology/21iht-link21.1.14629408.html In Egypt, Wikipedia is more than hobby].

==Arrest==
She was arrested by Egyptian security in 2008. The detained ''Facebook Girl'' drew the attention of few Egyptian newspapers challenging by this the state's censorship policy, turning her into an overnight symbol for resistance and resilience against corruption and injustice.

After two weeks in prison she was released. She made a brief public statement renouncing political activism for good&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanoos.com/society/israa_abdel_fattah.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==2011 Egyptian protest==
Esraa Abdel Fattah reappeared again during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|January 2011 nationwide protests in Egypt]], that called for the end of [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s regime. She was active on the internet, and also on the ground, updating [[Al Jazeera TV|Al&amp;nbsp;Jazeera&amp;nbsp;TV]] with the latest news related to the opposition.

==Post-revolution==
When the [[State Security Investigations Service|state security]] buildings were attacked in early March, 2011, in the wake of signs of files there being destroyed, a file for Israâa was found which contained ten pages of documents detailing three years of wiretaps and hacked e-mail, including some focused on her divorce.&lt;ref name=stack&gt;Liam Stack, [[Neil MacFarquhar]] (Amr Emam contributed reporting): [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/middleeast/10cairo.html?hp Egyptians Get View of Extent of Spying].
