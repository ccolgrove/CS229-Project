The '''[[1987 NFL season|1987]] [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] season''' was the team's 50th year with the [[National Football League]] and the 42nd season in [[Los Angeles]].

==Regular season==
On October 31, 1987, the Los Angeles Rams traded [[Eric Dickerson]] to the Indianapolis Colts in a three team trade involving the Buffalo Bills. The Rams sent Dickerson to the Colts for six draft choices and two players. Buffalo obtained the rights to [[Cornelius Bennett]] from Indianapolis. Buffalo sent running back [[Greg Bell (American football)|Greg Bell]] and three draft choices to the Rams, while Indianapolis added [[Owen Gill]] and three of their own draft picks to complete the deal with the Rams.&lt;ref&gt; NFL 2001 Record and Fact Book, Workman Publishing Co, New York,NY, ISBN 0-7611-2480-2, p.286&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Heisman Trophy winner Charles White would become the starting running back. The 1987 season would be his finest year as a pro, rushing for a league-leading 1,387 yards and 11 [[touchdown]]s, which earned him a [[Pro Bowl]] selection and the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]].

On November 23, 1987, linebacker [[Mike Wilcher]] recovered Doug Williams fumble and ran it back it 35 yards for a touchdown. It was Wilcherâs only touchdown in the NFL.
