=== Head coaching history ===
{{Main|List of Alabama Crimson Tide football head coaches}}

Alabama has had 28 head coaches since organized football began in 1892. Adopting the nickname of the ''Crimson Tide'' after the 1907 season, the team has played more than 1,100 games in their 114 seasons. In that time, 12 coaches have led the Crimson Tide in postseason bowl games: [[Wallace Wade]], [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Frank Thomas]], [[Harold Drew]], [[Bear Bryant|Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant]], [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], [[Bill Curry]], [[Gene Stallings]], [[Mike DuBose]], [[Dennis Franchione]], [[Mike Shula]], [[Joe Kines]], and [[Nick Saban]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bama-12NCs-text&quot; /&gt; Eight of those coaches also won [[athletic conference|conference]] championships: [[Wallace Wade|Wade]], [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Thomas]], Drew, Bryant, Curry, Stallings, DuBose, and Saban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bama-12NCs-text&quot; /&gt; During their tenures, Wade, Thomas, Bryant, Stallings, and Saban all won [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championships]] with the Crimson Tide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bama-12NCs-text&quot; /&gt;

[[File:ThinRedLine Alabama.jpg|thumb|Alabama in the early 1900s]]

University of Alabama law student William G. Little learned how to play [[American football]] while attending prep school in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and began teaching the sport to fellow Alabama students in early 1892.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rolltide.com/trads/football-origin.html |title=Football's Origin at Alabama |publisher=The University of Alabama |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, the school formed an official team of 19 players, with Little as captain and [[E. B. Beaumont]] as head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rolltide.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/1892-season |title=1892 Season |publisher=University of Alabama Athletics |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those also on the team were [[William B. Bankhead]], future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. Speaker of the House]], and [[Bibb Graves]], future governor of Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Groom, 2000, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was referred to as the &quot;Cadets&quot;, the &quot;Crimson White&quot;, or simply as &quot;the varsity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crimsontider.com/history.htm |title=Crimson Tide history |publisher=crimsontider.com |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 1892, the team played its first game at a baseball park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], winning 56â0 against a team composed of players from local Birmingham-area high schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt; The team played only one game during the 1897 and 1898 seasons because of a ban restricting student athletes from traveling away from campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot;/&gt; The team resumed play in 1899 after the ban was lifted due to fan and student outcry.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot;/&gt; Following the 1907 season, the team [[University of Alabama traditions#The Crimson Tide|adopted the &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; nickname]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history3&quot;/&gt; The school did not field a team in 1918 because of [[World War I]], but resumed play once again in 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;history4&quot;/&gt;

=== Rise to prominence (1922&amp;ndash;1957) ===
Shortly after the end of the [[1922 college football season|1922 season]] in which he led Alabama in the victory over [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]], head coach [[Xen C. Scott]] died of cancer, and [[Brown University]] alum [[Wallace Wade]] was hired as the new head coach. Intent on building a dynasty after Wade led the team to the Rose Bowl win over Washington, the team's first national championship, and &quot;the game that changed the South.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cptr.ua.edu/news/roses.htm |title=The Football Game That Changed the South |publisher=The University of Alabama |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Athletics director George Denny took advantage of the team's newfound popularity and began advertising the University of Alabama in metropolitan New York City newspapers. Students, football players and fans alike from the Northeast began enrolling at Alabama at such a rate that by 1930, over one-third of the student body was from out-of-state.&lt;ref&gt;Groom, 2000, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; Wade led the Crimson Tide to two more national titles before taking the head coaching position at [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uSwsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_7kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3069,2979016 |title=Prepare for Wade's team |work=The Florence Times-News |author=Burcky, Claire |date=1931-09-28 |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Frank Thomas (football coach)|Frank Thomas]], a former quarterback for a Notre Dame squad led by [[Knute Rockne]], was hired to replace Wade. Thomas led the team to continued success and two more national championships before health issues forced him to retire after a 14âyear tenure as head coach of the program, which did not field a team in 1943 because of [[World War II]]. Among the players that Thomas coached were [[Harry Gilmer]], [[Don Hutson]], and [[Bear Bryant|Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant]]. 

[[Harold D. Drew|Harold &quot;Red&quot; Drew]] followed Thomas as head coach and led the team to a 54&amp;ndash;28&amp;ndash;7 record over the next eight seasons, though never winning a national championship. Drew's successor, [[Jennings B. Whitworth|J.B. &quot;Ears&quot; Whitworth]], led the Crimson Tide to its [[Alabama Crimson Tide football, 1950â1959|worst three-year stretch in school history]], posting a 4&amp;ndash;24&amp;ndash;2 record before being fired following the [[1957 NCAA Division I-A football season|1957 season]].

=== Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant era (1958&amp;ndash;1982) ===
[[Bear Bryant|Paul William &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant]] came to the Crimson Tide program in December 1957, after leaving his head coaching position at [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bear Bryant leaves A&amp;M for coaching job at 'Bama |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |page=C2 |date=1957-12-03 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, five days after leaving A&amp;M, Bryant was asked why he left for Alabama. Bryant replied, &quot;Mama called, and when Mama calls, then you just have to come running.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Junction Boys: How Ten Days in Hell with Bear Bryant Forged a Championship Team |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jFDoMUE6cFEC |last=Dent |first=Dent |coauthors=Gene Stallings |publisher=Macmillan |year=2000 |isbn=0-312-26755-X |page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant entered an Alabama program which had not had a winning record in four seasons. However, in his [[1958 NCAA Division I-A football season|first season]], Bryant led [[1958 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] to a 5&amp;ndash;4&amp;ndash;1 recordâone more win than Alabama had in the previous three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Bryant_Bear.html |title=Bear Bryant 'simply the best there ever was' |publisher=ESPN |last=Puma |first=Mike |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Turnaround: Bear Bryant's First Year at Alabama |last=Stoddard |first=Tom |publisher=River City Publishing |year=2000 |isbn=1-880216-89-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[1961 NCAA Division I-A football season|fourth season]], Bryant led the [[1961 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Crimson Tide]] to their sixth national championship which included [[1962 Sugar Bowl|Bryant's first bowl victory with Alabama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bama-12NCs&quot; /&gt; Between 1961 to 1966, Alabama went 60-5-1, which included three national championships, four Southeastern Conference Championships, two undefeated seasons, and six bowl berths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESPN College Football Encyclopedia |last=MacCambridge |first=Michael |coauthors=Dan Jenkins |publisher=ESPN Books |isbn=1-4013-3703-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between [[Alabama Crimson Tide football, 1970â1979|1970â1979]], the Crimson Tide was one of the most dominant teams in college football. During the decade the program won eight conference titles and three national championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bama-12NCs&quot; /&gt; The very first game of the decade was notable, as the team was thoroughly defeated by the [[USC Trojans football|USC Trojans]] in Birmingham 42â21.

Perkins was succeeded by his former [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] teammate and [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Bill Curry]]. Curry led the Tide to three winning seasons, including three straight victories over [[Joe Paterno]] and [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] and a 10&amp;ndash;0 start to the [[1989 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1989 season]]. Curry accumulated a record of 26-10 over three seasons at Alabama.  However, tensions within the athletic department and three straight losses against arch-rival Auburn led Curry to resign so that he could go on to become head coach for [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]].  Curry is currently the head coach of the [[Georgia State Panthers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=5&amp;ti=1,5&amp;Search%5FArg=uncivil%20war&amp;Search%5FCode=TALL&amp;CNT=25&amp;PID=18858&amp;SEQ=20061211131425&amp;SID=2 |title=The Uncivil War: Alabama vs. Auburn 1981-1994, Chapter 8 |publisher= Rutledge Hill Press |location=Nashville, TN |isbn=1558533540 |accessdate=2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene Stallings era (1990&amp;ndash;1996) ===
Alabama once again sought someone with ties to Bryant by hiring [[Gene Stallings]], who had been recently fired as head coach of the [[Arizona Cardinals|Phoenix Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cvIRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N-oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6625,7410300 |title=Cardinals fire Gene Stallings |author=Berry, Walter |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''Gainesville Sun'' |date=1989-11-21 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallings had been a member of the [[Junction Boys]], a group of players who trained under Bryant during his tenure at [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_D8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lCQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5634,6695975 |title=One of 'Bear's Boys' goes for the big one |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''The Times-News'' |date=1992-12-26 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1990 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|his first season]], the Tide lost their first three games, but rebounded to finish off the season with a 7â5 record which included a berth in the [[1991 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] and a defeat to [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]] in a 34â7 rout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/71990518.html?dids=71990518:71990518&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |title=Louisville Takes to Air To Blitz Alabama, 34-7 |work=The Washington Post |pages=F8 |date=1991-01-02 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season proved to be much more successful as Alabama finished with an 11â1 record. After a 35â0 blowout loss to the [[1991 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]], the team finished off the regular season with nine consecutive victories, before defeating [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] 30â25 in the [[1991 Blockbuster Bowl|Blockbuster Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4088925.html |title=Alabama slips past Colorado |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1991-12-29 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In just [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|his third season]] as head coach, Alabama was unbeaten in the regular season, and recorded three shutout victories en route to the [[1992 SEC Championship Game|inaugural SEC Championship Game]]. Alabama was able to avoid an upset with a late interception by [[Antonio Langham]], who returned it for a touchdown to secure a 28â21 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1038245.html |title=Alabama Tops Florida In 1st SEC Playoff, Sets Sights on No. 1 |work=The Washington Post |date=1992-12-06 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the win, Alabama was invited to the [[1993 Sugar Bowl]] to face the unbeaten [[1992 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]], who entered with a 29-game winning streak and that year's [[Heisman Trophy]] winner, quarterback [[Gino Torretta]].

The Crimson Tide were forced to forfeit eight victories and one tie achieved during the 9â3â1 [[1993 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1993 season]] in games participated in by senior cornerback [[Antonio Langham]].

=== DuBose-Franchione-Shula era (1997â2006) ===

Following [[Gene Stallings]]'s retirement in 1996, defensive coordinator [[Mike DuBose]] was promoted to the head coaching position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama's DuBose is promoted to head coach |publisher=''Boston Globe'' |date=1996-12-10 |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961209&amp;slug=2364091 |title=Alliance Leaves Byu (13-1) Out |publisher=''Seattle Times'' |date=1996-12-09 |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[1999 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|third season]], DuBose won the [[1999 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL / SEC CHAMPIONSHIP; Alabama Dominates Florida |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |date=1999-12-05 |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the success, [[2000 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] began [[2000 NCAA Division I FBS football season|their 2000 season]] as high as #3 in some polls. The expectations went unfulfilled as the Tide slumped to a 3&amp;ndash;8 record. Following the season, DuBose was replaced by an up-and-coming coach from [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]], [[Dennis Franchione]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/12/04/sports/main254682.shtml |title=Tide Rolls In For Franchione: Dennis Franchione Introduced As Alabama's New Coach |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2008-10-06  |date=2000-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franchione led Alabama to two winning seasons in [[2001 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2001]] and [[2002 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2002]], with a combined 17&amp;ndash;8 record. Late in the [[2002 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2002 season]], rumors began to surface about Franchione expressing desire to leave Alabama for other coaching jobs, including [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] schools [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] and [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Franchione might leave Alabama |publisher=''The Detroit News'' |date=2002-11-25 |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/news/2002/1204/1471312.html|title=Report: Franchione talking with Texas A&amp;M |date=2002-12-04 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2002, Franchione was formally introduced as the head coach at Texas A&amp;M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/big12/2002-12-05-franchione-texasam_x.htm |title=Franchione introduced as new Texas A&amp;M coach |publisher=''USA Today'' |last=Lutz |first=Michael A. |date=2002-12-05 |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the difficult offseason, the Shula-led [[2003 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Crimson Tide]] finished 4&amp;ndash;9 in [[2003 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2003]].  Bama's [[2004 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2004 team]] finished the regular season with a 6â6 record and made their first bowl appearance in three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alabama.scout.com/2/326694.html |title=Tide Makes Bowl Plans |publisher=Scout.com |date=2004-12-05 |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first season the team began playing all their home games exclusively at Bryant-Denny Stadium. In previous years, the Tide had played many of their biggest home games at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. During the offseason, Alabama once again was able to gain a &quot;full&quot; recruiting class, following a probation by the NCAA which occurred in 2001 resulting from [[#NCAA sanctions|recruiting violations]] that occurred during Dubose's tenure. In [[2005 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Shula's third season]], Alabama rolled to a 10â2 record, ending with a 13&amp;ndash;10 victory in the [[2006 Cotton Bowl Classic|2006 Cotton Bowl]]. However, the [[2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|following season]], Alabama struggled to find consistency.

Alabama greatly improved in [[2008 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|the following season]], becoming the first SEC football team in history to post a 12â0 regular season record (followed by both Florida and Alabama in 2009) and climbing to its first #1 ranking in 16 years, before finishing with back-to-back losses in the [[2008 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=283410057 |title=Tebow's 3 TD strikes lead Gators' waltz past Tide |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=2008-12-06 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2009 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsline.com/collegefootball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAF_20090102_UT@AL |title=No. 7 Utah 31, No. 4 Alabama 17 |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=2009-01-02 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to finish the year at 12-2.

In 2009, Nick Saban led Alabama to its second consecutive undefeated regular season (12â0), and added an SEC Championship Game victory over #1 ranked [[2009 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] to improve to 13â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-SEC-USAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sec/2009-12-05-alabama-florida_N.htm |title=Alabama rolls to 32â13 defeat of No. 1 Florida in SEC title game |work=USA Today |author=Jones, David |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2010, Alabama beat Texas 37â21 in the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]], finishing the season 14â0 and winning Alabama its 13th national championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010-NC-USAT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2010-01-07-bcs-title-game_N.htm |title=Alabama sidesteps Texas' charge to emerge with BCS title |work=USA Today |author=Whiteside, Kelly |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saban joined [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]] as the only coach to win National Championships at two different FBS schools.

Before the 2010 season, Alabama was ranked #1, but late season losses to South Carolina, LSU, and in-state rival (and eventual National Champions) Auburn gave Saban's Tide a regular season record of 9-3.  Bama received a trip to the Capital One Bowl where they beat Big 10 opponent Michigan State 49-7.  During the 2011 season the Tide was ranked #2 in the first 2011 BCS Poll behind division rival LSU. It was officially announced on December 4th that the 2011 BCS National Championship game would be a Tide/Tiger match-up.

Saban's current official record at Alabama is 49â12 (54â12 on the field, but 5 wins from the 2007 season were vacated).&lt;ref name=&quot;TextbookNCAA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Alabama's penalty from '09 ruling stands |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5021464 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National championships ===
National championships in [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] college football are debated as the NCAA does not officially award the championship.  Despite not naming an official [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|National Champion]], the NCAA provides lists of championships awarded by organizations it recognizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Past-champs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncaa.com/default.php?id=91434 |title=NCAA History |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=2008-10-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official NCAA 2009 Division I Football Records Book, &quot;During the last 138 years, there have been more than 30 selectors of national champions using polls, historical research and mathematical rating systems. Beginning in 1936, the Associated Press began the best-known and most widely circulated poll of sportswriters and broadcasters. Before 1936, national champions were determined by historical research and retroactive ratings and polls. [...] The criteria for being included in this historical list of poll selectors is that the poll be national in scope, either through distribution in newspaper, television, radio and/or computer online.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 Division I Football Records Book&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009FBS.pdf |title=Football Bowl Subdivision Records pp. 76-78 |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Alabama]] 2009 Official Football Media Guide states that Alabama had 12 national championships prior to winning the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.rolltide.com/promotions/2009-m-footbl-guide.html&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 title brings the total number of national championships claimed by Alabama to 13.  In addition to the championships claimed by the university, the NCAA lists Alabama as receiving a championship for the [[1945 college football season|1945]], [[1966 college football season|1966]], [[1975 college football season|1975]], and [[1977 college football season]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Past-champs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA-history&quot; /&gt; however those championships are not claimed by Alabama.  Eight of Alabama's national championships were awarded by the wire-services ([[AP Poll|AP]] and [[Coaches' Poll]]) since their inception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Past-champs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA-history&quot; /&gt;

In the 1980s, then-Alabama Sports Information Director Wayne Atcheson added five national championship teams (1925, 1926, 1930, 1934, 1941) -- recognized prior to the modern era -- to the University's Football Media Guide.  According to Atcheson, he made the effort in the context of disputed titles being claimed by other schools, and &quot;to make Alabama football look the best it could look.&quot; Though the claim was made in the spirit of competition with other claimants, Atcheson maintains that the titles he included are the school's rightful claims.&lt;ref name=Solomon-2010&gt;Solomon, John (January 6, 2010) &quot;[http://blog.al.com/solomon/2010/01/got_12.html Got 12? Here's how Alabama bumped up its claim to a dozen national titles]&quot; ''[[The Birmingham News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since World War II, Alabama only claims national championships awarded by the final [[AP Poll]] or the final [[Coaches' Poll]].  This policy is consistent with other FBS football programs with numerous national title claims, including [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]], [[USC Trojans football|USC]], and [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]. All national championships claimed by the University of Alabama were published in nationally-syndicated newspapers and magazines, and each of the national championship selectors, ''listed below'', is cited in the Official 2010 NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] Record Book.&lt;ref&gt;http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/2010FBS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rivalries ==
=== Auburn ===
{{Main|Iron Bowl}}
[[File:Alabama offense IronBowl 2010-11-26.jpg|thumb|left|Alabama on offense against the Tigers in 2010]]

The main rivalry of the Crimson Tide is against its in-state rival, [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn University]]. The rivalry is considered to be one of the best and most hard-fought rivalries in all of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html |title=The 10 greatest rivalries |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-01-03 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jpehWR53e7AC |title=Football Feuds: The Greatest College Football Rivalries |last=Rappoport |first=Ken |coauthors=Barry Wilner |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2007 |isbn=1-59921-014-2 |chapter=The Iron Bowl: Auburn-Alabama |page=77 |ref=FootballFeuds}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of the game generally determines &quot;bragging rights&quot; in the state of Alabama until the following contest. Due to the intensity of the rivalry, many families, marriages, and other groups are split over their respective teams. The game may also have implications as to which team will represent the SEC Western Division in the [[SEC Championship Game]]. On February 22, 1893, at Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Auburn were victorious in the first ever Iron Bowl, 32â22. The series was suspended after the 1907 contest, due to violence and financial complications.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, Auburn suggested to reopen the series, though the Board of Trustees at Alabama rejected. However, the series was finally resumed in 1948âAlabama crushing the Tigers 55â0, which is still the largest margin of victory in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html |title=The University of Alabama Football Facts |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2007/mediaguide/176-181.pdf |title=This is Alabama Football: Iron Bowl |publisher=University of Alabama Athletics |page=157 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following contest, Auburn shocked Alabama with a 14â13 victory, which is credited with helping revive the series.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 80&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the contest was held at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham, before the teams began alternating between [[Bryant-Denny Stadium]], in Tuscaloosa, and [[JordanâHare Stadium]], in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]]. Alabama currently leads the series at 41â34â1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Record-book&quot; /&gt; In 2009, Alabama defeated Auburn 26â21&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/college/6742069.html |title=No. 2 Alabama rallies past Auburn, 26-21 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''Houston Chronicle'' |author=Zenor, John |date=2009-11-27 |accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its first victory in JordanâHare since 2001.

=== Tennessee ===
{{Main|Third Saturday in October}}
[[File:Alabama vs Tennessee 2009-10-24.jpg|thumb|Alabama on offense versus Tennessee in Tuscaloosa during the [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2009 season]] ]]

Despite the heated in-state rivalry with Auburn, [[Bear Bryant]] was more adamant about defeating his rivals to the north, the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 81&lt;/ref&gt; The series is named the [[Third Saturday in October]], the traditional calendar date on which the game was played. Despite the name, the game has only been played on the third Saturday five times between 1995â2007. The first game between the two sides was played in 1901 in Birmingham, ending in a 6â6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, only losing once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers. Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was first played on its traditional date and began to be a challenge for the Tide as [[Robert Neyland]] began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=akYFAAAACAAJ |title=Third Saturday in October: Tennessee Vs. Alabama: the Game-by-game Story of the South's Most Intense Football Rivalry |last=Browning |first=Al |publisher=Cumberland House |year=2001 |isbn=1-58182-217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, Jim Goostree, the head trainer for Alabama, began another tradition as he began handing out cigars following a victory over the Volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FMZYRyuuaKcC |title=The Missing Ring: How Bear Bryant and the 1966 Alabama Crimson Tide Were Denied College Football's Most Elusive Prize |last=Dunnavant |first=Keith |publisher=Macmillan |year=2006 |isbn=0-312-33683-7 |page=170 |chapter=The Missing Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1971â1981, Alabama held an eleven-game winning streak over the Volunteers and, between 1986â1994, a nine-game unbeaten streak. However, following Alabama's streak, Tennessee responded with a seven-game winning streak from 1995â2001. Alabama has won the last five meetings from 2007-2011. Alabama won the most recent meeting 37â6 in Tuscaloosa, and leads the series 48â38â7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Record-book&quot; /&gt;

=== LSU ===
{{Main|AlabamaâLSU rivalry}}

A rivalry within the SEC Western Division occurs yearly between Alabama and the [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]]. Starting in 1895, the Tigers were victorious 12-6 in the first meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Record-book&quot;/&gt; The teams did not regularly meet until the mid-1960s, during Alabama's dominance of the SEC. Between 1971â1981, the Crimson Tide won 11 consecutive times. In the 1969 game, LSU defeated Alabama 20â15 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]].  Alabama did not lose again in Baton Rouge until 2000.

In 2007, the meeting was more heated following Alabama's hiring of head coach [[Nick Saban]], who previously coached at LSU. With the hiring, many media outlets dubbed the 2007 meeting as the &quot;Saban Bowl&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/110207dnspocarlton.2725d4b.html |title=LSU, Alabama to meet in first Saban Bowl |publisher=''The Dallas Morning News'' |last=Carlton |first=Chuck |date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2007/11/01/2007-11-01_bayou_lsu_fans_brace_for_nick_saban_bowl.html |title=Bayou, LSU fans brace for Nick Saban Bowl |publisher=''New York Daily News'' |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2003986699_grid01.html |title=It's Saban Bowl for riled LSU fans |publisher=''The Seattle Times'' |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crimson Tide lost the first &quot;Saban Bowl&quot; in 2007, won the 2008 and 2009 meetings only to lose in Baton Rouge in 2010. 

In 2011, both teams played as the consensus #1 and #2 ranked teams in the polls with LSU winning 9-6 in overtime.  Alabama leads the head-to-head series at 45â25â5.&lt;ref name=&quot;Record-book&quot; /&gt; After LSU's 41-17 win over Arkansas and Alabama's 42-14 win over Auburn, the upcoming BCS National Championship Game is being widely billed as 'The Rematch'.

== Controversies ==
=== NCAA sanctions ===
In August 1995, the NCAA Infractions Committee claimed four violations of NCAA rules by the Alabama football program. Alabama cornerback [[Antonio Langham]] signed with a sports agent and applied to enter the NFL draft in January [[1993]]. Alabama's football program was placed on probation, suffered scholarship limitations, a one year post-season ban (1995), and forfeiture of eight wins and one tie from the 9-3-1 1993 season.

During the [[2000 NCAA Division I-A football season|2000 season]], an assistant football coach in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] claimed that an Alabama [[booster club|booster]] had paid him [[United States dollar|$]]50,000 to encourage one of his players to sign with the Crimson Tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tidesports.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/TSNCAA/208290014 |title=It's official: NCAA opens investigation |publisher=TideSports.com |date=2001-02-23 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the NCAA investigation, Alabama received a probation from 2002 to 2006, a two-year post-season ban (2002 and 2003), and scholarship reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/news/2002/0201/1321198.html |title=NCAA puts Alabama football on five-year probation |agency=Associated Press |date=2000-02-01 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A secret witness was later revealed to be Tennessee coach [[Phillip Fulmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/rlb001/2005/12/28/The_Controversy_of_the_Tennessee_Volunteers |title=The Controversy of the Tennessee Volunteers |publisher=Fox Sports |date=2005-12-28 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2004-01-28-tennessee-ncaa_x.htm |title=No bargain with Tennessee in Alabama probe |publisher=''USA Today'' |date=2004-01-28 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 2009, Alabama was sanctioned for textbook-related infractions involving 16 of 19 sports, including football. They were forced to vacate 21 wins from the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons and were put on three years probation, ending in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhamweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/alabamancaaprobationrelease.pdf |title=University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa Public Infractions Report |publisher=Birmingham Weekly |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university stated &quot;none of the textbooks or materials was used for profit or to get items not related to academics, and that the athletes involved who still have eligibility remaining have had to pay restitution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4250596 |title=Sixteen Alabama teams penalized |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama's appeal of the ruling was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;March 23, 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Hurt |first= Cecil |title=UA officials disappointed in appeal outcome |url= http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20100323/NEWS/100329840/1007?Title=UA-officials-disappointed-in-appeal-outcome |work= The Tuscaloosa News |date= March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mike Price incident ===
In April 2003, multiple news reports claimed that recently-hired Alabama head coach [[Mike Price]] spent several hundred dollars at a [[strip club]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]], and that a woman ordered about $1,000 of room service, charged to Price's hotel bill, which was paid for by the University of Alabama. Coach Price was dismissed for behavior unbecoming a representative of the University of Alabama.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price-fired&quot; /&gt; Following a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article, which elaborated on the incident, Price sued the magazine for [[defamation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/2003/06/20/price_lawsuit_ap/ |title=Price files $20 million lawsuit against SI |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' |date=2003-06-20 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20031118&amp;slug=pricetimeline18 |title=Mike Price timeline |publisher=''Seattle Times'' |date=2003-11-13 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sued the University, claiming [[wrongful dismissal|wrongful termination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2003/07/15/SP285798.DTL |title=Prices sues Alabama for $20 million |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' |date=2003-06-15 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit against the University of Alabama was dismissed and the lawsuit against ''Sports Illustrated'' was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/9651797/ |title=UTEP coach Price, SI settle $20 million suit |publisher=NBC Sports |date=2005-10-10 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
