'''[[Heraldry]] in the [[United States of America]]''' was first established by [[Europe]]an settlers who brought with them the heraldic customs of their respective countries of origin. As the use of coats of arms may be seen as a custom of royals and nobility, it has been debated whether the use of arms is reconcilable with American republican traditions. However, George Washington had said that &quot;heraldry is not incompatible with the purest ideals of republicanism&quot;. Several of the &quot;[[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]]&quot; also employed personal arms and a great number of Americans continue to do so.

==Usage of arms==
Most states do not employ coats of arms, but have chosen to use seals as their official emblems, and while the United States has a coat of arms, which is the basis of most governmental seals, the [[Great Seal of the United States]] is the official emblem of the Nation. The U.S. constitution prohibits federal and state governments from conferring or recognizing titles of nobility, and there are few noble coats of arms in the country. However private persons, including several past presidents, employ traditional coats of arms either personal or family related. Since there is no official regulation on arms, except for the official seals, badges, insignia, decorations and medals of the country and the states, many private individuals have assumed arms.  There is one anomalous exception to this lack of regulation: the coat of arms of the Swiss Confederation, is specifically protected from unauthorized use within the USA, under penalty of a fine and/or imprisonment for up to six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000708----000-.html US Code Title 18, Part I, Chapter 33, Â§ 708].

Heraldic and other military symbols have been used by the military forces as well as other organizational elements of the government since the beginning of the Revolution. However, until 1919, there was no coordinated, overall military symbolism program. In that year, within the War Department General Staff, an office was delegated the responsibility for the coordination and approval of coats of arms and insignia of certain Army organizations. In 1924, formal staff responsibility for specific military designs was delegated to The Quartermaster General. As the needs for symbolism by the military services and the national government expanded, the scope of the services furnished by The Quartermaster Generalâs Office evolved into a sizable heraldic program. The acceleration of activities brought about by World War II, the expansion of the Army, and subsequent increase of interest in symbolism, contributed to the growth of the program. In 1949, the Munitions Board, acting for the Army, Navy and Air Force, directed the Army to provide heraldic services to all military departments. The program was expanded further as a result of the enactment of '''Public Law 85-263, approved September 1957, 71 Stat. 589''', which delineates the authority of the Secretary of the Army to furnish heraldic services to the military departments and other branches of the federal government.

The Institute of Heraldry was established in 1960 at Cameron Station in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. Within the Institute, functions formerly performed within the Office of The Quartermaster General and several field activities were consolidated. Upon reorganization of the Army in 1962, responsibility for the Heraldic Program was assigned to The Adjutant Generalâs Office. In 1987, with the realignment of certain Army Staff agency functions, the Institute was transferred to the United States Army Human Resources Command. In April 1994, The Institute of Heraldry was relocated from Cameron Station to [[Fort Belvoir]], [[Virginia]]. As a result of a realignment in October 2004, responsibility for the Heraldic Program was assigned to The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, Resources and Programs Agency.

The US Army Institute of Heraldry consists of a staff of thirty-two civilians. The mission of the Institute is to furnish heraldic services to the Armed Forces and other United States government organizations, including the Executive Office of the President. The activities of the Institute encompass research, design, development, standardization, quality control, and other services relating to official symbolic itemsâseals, decorations, medals, insignia, badges, flags, and other items awarded to or authorized for official wear or display by government personnel and agencies. Limited research and information services concerning official symbolic items are also provided to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/ The US Army Institute Of Heraldry Home Page].

==State heraldry==
{{seealso|Coat of Arms of the U.S. States}}

Eighteen States have officially adopted a coat of arms. The former independent Republic of Texas and Kingdom of Hawaii each had a separate national coat of arms, which are no longer used.

[[Puerto Rico]] has a coat of arms as well, originally granted by the Spanish Crown in 1512, which also influenced the design of that territory's seal.

==Private heraldry==
There are several private organizations working to advance heraldic traditions in the United States.  These organizations keep registers of arms and give advice on designing coats of arms.

For a fee, the English [[College of Arms]] will devise arms for persons of English or Welsh descent, as the Scottish [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] will for persons of Scottish descent.  The [[Chief Herald of Ireland]] has granted arms to Americans of [[Ireland|Irish]] descent.  The Spanish [[Cronista Rey de Armas]] (Chronicler King of Arms) grants arms to descendants of Spanish citizens, and to residents of territories formerly part of the [[Spanish empire]], regardless of ancestry. Some American recipients of foreign [[Order of knighthood|orders of knighthood]] in which arms are expected to be borne have received arms from the relevant foreign authorities.
