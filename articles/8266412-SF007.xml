'''vrms''' (Virtual [[Richard Stallman|Richard M. Stallman]]) is a [[Computer program|program]] that analyzes the set of currently-installed packages on a [[Debian]]-based system, and reports all of the packages from the non-free tree which are currently installed. Software gets placed in the non-free tree when it is agreed not to be too problematic for Debian to distribute but does not meet the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] and therefore cannot be included in their official distribution. For each program from 'non-free' installed, vrms displays an explanation of why it is non-free, if one is available.

This explanation is usually from a list included in the vrms package itself, but other packages can provide additional lists of explanations, too.

==History==
Vrms was written by [[Bdale Garbee]] and Bill Geddes for the [[Debian GNU/Linux]] system, in response to an open discussion with [[Richard Stallman]] about the issues surrounding the availability/desirability of the ânon-freeâ package tree in Debian. Yet the package is somewhat controversial because while it contains Richard's initials it still follows Debian's definitions of ''free''.&lt;ref&gt;http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnewsense-users/2007-02/msg00027.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Software Foundation lists vrms among packages that don't respect its Free System Distribution Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.fsf.org/wiki/List_of_software_that_does_not_respect_the_Free_System_Distribution_Guidelines#vrms&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[RogÃ©rio Brito]], motivated to improve the status of the package status, looked at and fixed some long, outstanding bugs reported in Debian's Bug Tracking System, and, shortly afterwards, the project moved to a more distributed and cooperative development with a mailing list being created and with the source code being put in a Subversion version control system hosted by [[Alioth (Debian)|Alioth]]'s Debian server.

== Example ==

Output of vrms in a system with [[Java (Sun)|Sun Java]], [[RAR (file format)|unrar]] and [[VMware Player]] installed:

                Non-free packages installed on localhost
 
 sun-java5-bin             Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0
 sun-java5-demo            Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0 demos and examp
 sun-java5-jdk             Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0
 sun-java5-jre             Sun Java(TM) Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0
 unrar                     Unarchiver for .rar files (non-free version)
   Reason: Modifications problematic
 vmware-player             Free virtual machine player from VMware
 vmware-player-kernel-modu vmware-player modules for Linux (kernel 2.6.17)
 
   7 non-free packages, 0.6% of 1218 installed packages.
