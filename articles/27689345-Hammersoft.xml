A '''Norwegian Minnesotan''' is a [[Norwegian American]] (a person with Norwegian ancestry) in the [[U. S. State]] of [[Minnesota]]. As of [[2009]], 868,361 [[Minnesota]]ns claim [[Norwegian American|Norwegian ancestry]], 16.5% of [[Minnesota]]'s population, or 18.7% of the total [[Norwegian American]] population&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 2009 ACS Ancestry estimates - Minnesota&quot;&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=adp&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_DP2&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-tree_id=309&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=04000US27&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en &quot;Census 2009 ACS Ancestry estimates - Minnesota&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
=== Settlements ===

[[Image:Phelpsmill ottertailcounty.jpg|thumb|left|Many Norwegian settlers arrived and lived in various other locations in the United States before permanently settling in Minnesota.]]
[[Image:Lake Calhoun MN.jpg|thumb|[[Minneapolis]] has the largest concentration of Norwegians outside Norway, at 42,469.]]

Many Norwegian settlers arrived and lived in various other locations in the United States before permanently settling in Minnesota. The first Norwegian emigrants to come to the United States often settled in the eastern Mid-west. The first Norwegian settlement in Minnesota was Norwegian Ridge, in what is now [[Spring Grove, Minnesota]]. As more and more new immigrants came to America there was a rapid increase in population at the original Norwegian settlements (which was helped along by a high birth rate). Thus, as more and more Norwegian settlers arrived in America, the original Norwegian settlements would move westward where land was plentiful and less expensive and where new settlements could be created.

Norwegian settlement in Minnesota increased after the [[American Civil War]] and the [[U.S.-Dakota War of 1862]], especially to the [[Minnesota River Valley]], where land was taken through the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]]. Following the war, the majority of [[Dakota people]] were expelled from [[Minnesota]] and [[Europe]]an settlement increased rapidly.

Because the land of Minnesota was subdued by force from the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], land was cheap for the European immigrants who came here. Before long, the immigrant population exploded in Minnesota. Norwegians settled all over the state, but they established the first permanent settlements in the southeast. The first Norwegian settlement in Minnesota was Norwegian Ridge, in what is now [[Spring Grove, Minnesota]], in [[Houston County, Minnesota]]. Another such settlement was the 1851 colony in [[Goodhue County, Minnesota]]. They soon settled in [[Fillmore County, Minnesota|Fillmore]] County  as well. By 1860, half of [[Minnesota]]'s 12,000 [[Norwegians]] resided in [[Goodhue]], [[Fillmore County, Minnesota|Fillmore]], and Houston Counties. Ten years later, these three counties were home to nearly 25,000 of [[Minnesota]]'s 50,000 Norwegian residents. By 1880, there were Norwegian settlements in the counties of [[Goodhue County, Minnesota]], [[Fillmore County, Minnesota|Fillmore]], [[Houston County, Minnesota|Houston]], [[Freeborn County, Minnesota|Freeborn]], [[Steele County, Minnesota|Steele]], and [[Waseca County, Minnesota|Waseca]]. [[Norwegians]] also made settlements in [[Blue Earth County, Minnesota|Blue Earth]], [[Brown County, Minnesota|Brown]], and [[Watonwan County, Minnesota|Watonwan]] Counties (the &quot;Linden Settlement&quot;), Lac qui Parle County, the Park Region in west-central [[Minnesota]], and the prairies of southwestern Minnesota.

Immigrants also came to the [[Red River Valley]] in northwestern Minnesota, settling in the counties of [[Clay County, Minnesota|Clay]], [[Marshall County, Minnesota|Marshall]], [[Norman County, Minnesota|Norman]], and [[Polk County, Minnesota|Polk]]. During the early 1870s, the [[St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] helped increase migration to the Red River Valley. As a result, by 1875 Norwegian immigrants made up a 30 percent of the total population of the counties of [[Polk County, Minnesota|Polk]] and [[Clay County|Clay]]. Later, immigrants also made homes in [[Grant County, Minnesota|Grant]], [[Pennington County, Minnesota|Pennington]], [[Red Lake County, Minnesota|Red Lake]], [[Roseau County, Minnesota|Roseau]], and [[Kittson County, Minnesota|Kittson]] Counties. Much of this land belonged to the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Nakota]] peoples.

[[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] was also a center for Norwegian immigration. Its location on [[Lake Superior]] provided those Norwegian fishermen with ample employment. As a result, the Norwegian population of Duluth increased dramatically between 1870 and 1900. In 1870, 242 [[Norwegians]] were counted in Duluth. By 1900 the population had reached 7,500 people of Norwegian ancestry.

By the middle of the 1880s, Norwegian migration to Minnesota began to shift to the cities. Most of these were single people who were accustomed to city life. Many also planned merely to make some money in America and then to return to Norway. There was a large influx of Norwegian immigrants into the city of Minneapolis from the 1880s to early 1900s, although they settled in St. Paul as well.
