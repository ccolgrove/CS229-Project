'''The Oklahoma Democratic Party''' is an [[Oklahoma]] [[political party]] affiliated with the [[United States Democratic Party]]. Along with the [[Oklahoma Republican Party]], it one of the two major parties in Oklahoma politics.

The Oklahoma Democratic Party describes itself as neither [[Liberalism|liberal]] or [[American conservatism|conservative]], but &quot;squarely in the [[centrism|center]] of the political spectrum.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Party&quot;&gt;[http://www.okdemocrats.org/mission-and-by-laws Mission and By-Laws] Oklahoma Democratic Party (accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
The party mission statement goes on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike the [[far left]], we know that less government is sometimes a better government, and that government cannot solve every difficulty faced by our society. But, unlike the [[far right]], we understand there is a role for government to play in finding solutions to our country's problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Party&quot; /&gt;

The party has dominated local politics in Oklahoma almost since the days of early statehood in 1907. In national politics, the party became a dominant force beginning with the [[United States presidential election, 1932|presidential election of 1932]] and the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] political re-alignment. Since 1932, the majority of members of Congress from Oklahoma have been Democrats, and of the 26 men who have been elected to the office of [[Governor of Oklahoma]], 22 have been Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okhistory.org/res/okgov.html Oklahoma Government], Oklahoma Historical Society (accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the party has fared poorly since 1994. Democrats lost all six Congressional races that year and since then have only won a single seat back. In response, the traditionally disorganized Oklahoma Democrats have taken steps to create a more organized state party, hiring a professional executive director in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;GaddieD&quot;&gt;Gaddie, Ronald Keith. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/D/DE013.html Democratic Party], Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Democrats continued to lose ground in the 2000s, losing control of both the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]] and the [[Oklahoma Senate]]. In 2008, Oklahoma gave the lowest percentage of any state's vote to national Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in the presidential election.

==History==
The Oklahoma Democratic Party dominated state politics for much of Oklahoma history, with its strength in greatest concentrations in the southeastern part of the state, known as &quot;Little Dixie&quot; because of the post-Reconstruction migration of people from southern states such as Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;GaddieD&quot; /&gt;

Upon statehood, all but one of the Congressional seats was held by Democrats. The Democrats won eighteen of the twenty-one gubernatorial eletions since its statehood in 1907.  The Democratic Party held on average 81 perecne of the seats in the state legislature between 1907 and 1973. &lt;ref name=&quot;carney&quot;&gt;Carney, George O., &quot;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/M/MC027.html McGuire, George O. (1865-1930)],&quot; ''[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/ Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture]'' (accessed May 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the party gained even more influence for several decades.

Since the 1980s the party has seen a decline as Christian fundamentalists have shifted to the Republican Party. The Democrat Party has not not attained more than 41 percent of the vote for president. As of 2000 about 55 percentof Oklahoma voters registred as Democrats. &lt;ref name= Gaddie, Ronald Keith. &quot;Democratic Party.&quot; Oklahoma Historical Society. Ed. Nancy

     2011. &lt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/D/ 
     DE013.html&gt;.,&lt;/ref&gt; The party continues to decline in strength in both the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] and executive branch. For the first time since statehood, Republicans hold all statewide-elected offices starting in 2011.

==Headquarters and leadership==
The Oklahoma Democratic Party headquarters are located at the George Krumme Center, 4100 North Lincoln Boulevard in Oklahoma City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okdemocrats.org/contact-us Contact Us], Oklahoma Democratic Party (accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace Collins is the chair. Dana Orwig, who was defeated by Collins for the chair position, was elected vice chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okdemocrats.org/officers Staff and Officers], Oklahoma Democratic Party (accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Frasier and Betty McElderry are members of the Democratic National Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ds&quot;&gt;  [http://www.okdemocrats.org/officers Staff and Officers], Oklahoma Democratic Party (accessed February 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The executive officers are elected at biennial state conventions in May of odd-numbered years. The elected DNC committee delegates serve four-year terms concurrent with presidential elections.

==2011 Oklahoma Democratic Party State Convention==

The purpose of the meetting was to elect a Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary and Treasurere of the Oklahoma Democratic Party for a two year term of office.
