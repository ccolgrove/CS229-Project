'''Oracle PowerBrowser''' was a [[web browser]] created in 1996 by [[Oracle Corporation]]. It featured a [[multiple document interface]] and offered the possibility to act as a [[web server]] allowing users to host [[webpages]] on their [[computers]]. It pre-dated [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Client-side scripting|scripting]], and was quickly discontinued.

The original Powerbrowser was built by 3 people, Jon McCormack, Rhys Weatherly and Todd Werelius. They built the first iteration in 90 days as proof of concept for a number of ideas ( personal publishing, extensible component architecture etc. )  

The team was under the direction of Marc Benioff before he left Oracle and founded Salesforce.com
