'''Mohamed Bouazizi''' (29 March 1984 â 4 January 2011; {{lang-ar|ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø§ÙØ¨ÙØ¹Ø²ÙØ²Ù}}&lt;!--Tunisian pronunciation in IPA is needed--&gt;) was a [[Tunisia]]n street vendor who [[self-immolation|set himself on fire]] on 17 December 2010, in protest of the confiscation of his wares and the harassment and humiliation that he reported was inflicted on him by a municipal official and her aides. His act became a catalyst for the [[Tunisian Revolution]] and the wider [[Arab Spring]], inciting demonstrations and riots throughout Tunisia in protest of social and political issues in the country. The public's anger and violence intensified following Bouazizi's death, leading then-President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] to step down on 14 January 2011, after 23 years in power.

The success of the Tunisian protests sparked protests in several other Arab countries, plus several non Arab countries. The protests included several men who emulated Bouazizi's act of self-immolation, in an attempt to bring an end to their own [[Autocracy|autocratic]] governments. Those men and Bouazizi were hailed by some Arab commentators as &quot;heroic martyrs of a new Middle Eastern revolution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/weekinreview/23worth.html?src=twrhp|title=How a Single Match Can Ignite a Revolution|author=Worth, Robert F.|work=New York Times|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Bouazizi was jointly awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] along with four others for their contributions to &quot;historic changes in the [[Arab world]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=recent&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/headlines/content/20111014FCS29297/1/html/Three-finalists-for-Sakharov-Prize-2011-honouring-human-rights-activists| title = Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought 2011 | accessdate = 27 October 2011 | publisher = [[European Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and employment struggles==
Mohamed Bouazizi, who was known locally as ''Basboosa'',&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/opinions/editorials/tunisia-events-turning-point-in-arab-world-1.746884|title=Tunisia events turning point in Arab world|work=[[Gulf News]]|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Sidi Bouzid]], Tunisia, on 29 March 1984.

Bouazizi lived in a modest stucco home, a 20-minute walk from the center of Sidi Bouzid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0119/In-town-at-center-of-Tunisia-uprising-23-years-of-repressed-emotions-burst-forth|author=Chick, Kristen|title=Tunisian emotions burst forth|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=19 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE70G18J20110119 |title=Peddler's martyrdom launched Tunisia's revolution|author=Noueihed, Lin|agency=Reuters |date=19 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rural town in Tunisia burdened by corruption&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/bouazizi-has-become-a-tunisian-protest-symbol|author=Thorne, John|title=Bouazizi has become a Tunisian protest 'symbol'|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=13 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suffering an unemployment rate estimated at 30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; According to his mother, he applied to join the army, but was refused, and several subsequent job applications also resulted in rejection.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; He supported his mother, uncle, and younger siblings, including paying for one of his sisters to attend university, by earning approximately {{Currency|140}} per month selling [[produce]] on the street in Sidi Bouzid.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; He was also working toward the goal of buying or renting a pickup truck for his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; A close friend of Bouazizi said he &quot;was a very well-known and popular man [who] would give free fruit and vegetables to very poor families.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt;

==Confiscation of wares and self-immolation==
According to friends and family, local police officers had allegedly targeted and mistreated Bouazizi for years, including during his childhood, regularly confiscating his small wheelbarrow of produce;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; but Bouazizi had no other way to make a living, so he continued to work as a street vendor. Around {{nowrap|10 p.m.}} on 16 December 2010, he had contracted approximately {{Currency|200}} in debt to buy the produce he was to sell the following day. On the morning of 17 December, he started his workday at {{nowrap|8 a.m.}}&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt; Just after {{nowrap|10:30 a.m.}}, the police began harassing him again, ostensibly because he did not have a vendor's permit.&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=Abouzeid, Rania|title=Postcard: Sidi Bouzid|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|page=8|date=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while some sources state that [[street vending]] is illegal in Tunisia,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jan/19/tunisia-democratic-unity-government|author=Kherigi, Intissar|title=Tunisia needs real freedom|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=19 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others that Bouazizi lacked a required permit to sell his wares,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; according to the head of Sidi Bouzid's state office for employment and independent work, no permit is needed to sell from a cart.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;/&gt;

Bouazizi did not have the funds to bribe police officials to allow his street vending to continue.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Backchannels/2011/0114/Sticking-a-fork-in-Tunisia-s-Ben-Ali|author=Murphy, Dan|title=Sticking a fork in Tunisia's Ben Ali |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=14 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, two of Bouazizi's siblings accused authorities of attempting to [[extort]] money from their brother,&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;/&gt; and during an interview with [[Reuters]], one of his sisters stated, &quot;What kind of repression do you imagine it takes for a young man to do this? A man who has to feed his family by buying goods on credit when they fine him ... and take his goods. In Sidi Bouzid, those with no connections and no money for bribes are humiliated and insulted and not allowed to live.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;/&gt;

Regardless, Bouazizi's family claims he was publicly humiliated when a 45-year-old female [[municipal]] official, Faida Hamdi,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/tunisia-i-have-lost-my-son-but-i-am-proud-of-what-he-did-2190331.html|title=Tunisia: 'I have lost my son, but I am proud of what he did'|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=21 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; slapped him in the face, spat at him, confiscated his electronic [[weighing scale]]s, and tossed aside his produce cart.&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; It was also stated that she made a slur against his deceased father.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; Bouazizi's family says her gender made his humiliation worse.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habibtoumi.com/2010/12/31/man-at-the-centre-of-tunisia-unrest-recuperating-doctors-say|author=Toumi, Habib|title=Man at the centre of Tunisia unrest recuperating, doctors say|publisher=HabibToumi.com|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother also claimed Hamdi's aides beat and swore at her son. Countering these claims, in an interview with ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', a brother of Hamdi claimed neither his sister nor her aides slapped or otherwise mistreated Bouazizi. He said they only confiscated Bouazizi's wares. However, an eyewitness told ''Asharq Al-Awsat'' that he did not see Hamdi slap Bouazizi, but that her aides did beat him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAA&quot;/&gt;

Bouazizi, angered by the confrontation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/tunisia-revolt-sparked-by-a-police-slap/story-e6frg6so-1225990556122|title=Tunisia revolt sparked by a police slap |work=The Australian|date=19 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran to the governor's office to complain&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; and to ask for his scales back.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;/&gt; Following the governor's refusal to see or listen to him, even after Bouazizi was quoted as saying &quot;'If you don't see me, I'll burn myself',&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; he acquired a can of gasoline from a nearby gas station and returned to the governor's office.

==Death and funeral==

According to Bouazizi's sister, whose information was based on details relayed from her uncle who was present at the scene, people immediately panicked when he caught fire, and one of them tried to douse the flames with water, which only worsened his condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;habibtoumi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Habib|last=Toumi|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/tunisia/man-at-the-centre-of-tunisia-unrest-recuperating-doctors-say-1.738967|title=Man at the centre of Tunisia unrest recuperating, doctors say |work=[[Gulf News]]|publisher=[[Al-Nisr Publishing]]|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouazizi barely survived, and suffered severe burns over 90% of his body before locals managed to douse the flames. He was taken by ambulance to a medical facility in [[Sidi Bouzid]]. When they were unable to treat Bouazizi's severe burns, he was taken to a larger hospital in [[Sfax]], more than {{convert|70|mi|km}} away.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt; Later, as the government's interest in his case grew, he was transferred to a Burn and Trauma Centre in [[Ben Arous]], where he was placed in an [[intensive care unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arabsahistory.com/?p=4 |title=The Arabs by Eugene Rogan |publisher=Arabsahistory.com |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2010, doctors at the Ben Arous Burn and Trauma Centre reported that Bouazizi was in stable condition, and that he was showing positive prognostic factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;habibtoumi&quot;/&gt; However, he remained in a coma throughout the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jodi Orgill Brown |url=http://www.lifeconstructionzone.com/2011/03/revolutions-of-hope-in-middle-east.html |title=Life Under Construction: Revolutions of Hope in the Middle East |publisher=Lifeconstructionzone.com |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouazizi was visited in hospital by then-President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonlinenews.com/president-zine-el-abidine-ben-ali-visits-young-man-mohamed-bouazizi/|title=President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali visits young man Mohamed Bouazizi|publisher=Tunisia-tour.com|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bouazizi's mother, Ben Ali promised to send him to France for medical treatment,&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; but no such transfer was ever arranged.

While [[al-Azhar]], the most prestigious religious institution in the [[Sunni Muslim]] world, issued a ''[[fatwa]]'' (&quot;directive&quot;) stating &quot;suicide violates Islam even when it is carried out as a social or political protest,&quot; influential Egyptian cleric [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] spoke sympathetically of Bouazizi.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;/&gt;

On 4 February 2011, [[Bertrand DelanoÃ«]], the mayor of Paris, announced that, as a tribute to honour Bouazizi, a square in Paris will be named after him;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ij_goZCOky4OIGq3YqNg-qGjovwQ?docId=CNG.0fc7842c814225c17320c2d9273bc7b9.641|author=[[Agence France-Presse]]|title=DelanoÃ« veut donner le nom du jeune Tunisien immolÃ© Ã  un lieu parisien ''(French)''|publisher=[[Google News]]|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Place Mohamed Bouazizi was unveiled four days later.

===Investigation===
An investigation was launched following Bouazizi's self-immolation to determine the details leading up to his actions. On 20 December 2010, it was reported that Faida Hamdi, the female officer who allegedly accosted Bouazizi the day of his immolation, was suspended along with the secretary-general (governor) of Sidi Bouzid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/tunisia-suspends-four-over-attempted-suicide|title=Tunisia suspends four over attempted suicide|publisher=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |date=28 December 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was subsequently denied by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansamed.info/en/news/ME.XEF81750.html |title=Tunisia: Sidi Bouzid; Municipal Secretary Not Suspended|publisher=[[Ansa Mediterranean]]|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, Hamdi was arrested on orders from President Ben Ali and held in an unspecified town.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=1&amp;id=24003|title=Controversy over &quot;the slap&quot; that brought down a government|date=2 February 2011 |author=Al-Saleh, Huda|publisher=aawsat.com|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brother of Hamdi later stated that she had been arrested and detained on two separate occasions, the first time following Ben Ali's visit to Bouazizi in the hospital and subsequent meeting with his mother and sister at his [[Carthage Palace|presidential palace]]. He says his sister and her aides were released following a short detention and the closing of the investigation which &quot;confirmed her innocence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAA&quot;/&gt; He said her second arrest was &quot;in response to the demands of the Tunisian protesters,&quot; and that the Tunisian security authorities informed him that she was being held only for her own protection and would be released once the protesting ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAA&quot;/&gt;

According to Bouazizi's mother, Bouazizi undertook his action because he had been humiliated, not because of the family's poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; &quot;It got to him deep inside, it hurt his pride,&quot; she said, referring to the police harassment.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; One of Bouazizi's sisters stated during an interview with ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'' that their family intends to take legal action against all involved, &quot;whether this is the municipal officers that slapped and insulted him, or the mayor [who] refused to meet him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAA&quot;/&gt;

On 19 April, the case against Hamdi was dropped after Bouazizi's mother withdrew the family's complaint against her. She stated &quot;It was a difficult but well-thought out decision to avoid hatred and... [to] help reconcile the residents of Sidi Bouzid.&quot; Hamdi had maintained her innocence, telling the court she did not slap Bouazizi, while her lawyer said the matter was &quot;purely a political affair.&quot; Bouazizi's brother Salem supported the decision, saying &quot;All the money in the world can't replace the loss of Mohamed who sacrificed himself for freedom and for dignity.&quot; Large crowds of people outside the courtroom also appeared to have been satisfied by the Bouazizi family's decision with some claiming Hamdi was being used as a [[scapegoat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13138301 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13138301|title=Tunisia revolt: Mohamed Bouazizi police suspect freed|work=BBC News |date=19 April 2011|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/23/fedia-hamdi-slap-revolution-tunisia | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Elizabeth | last=Day | title=Tunisia (News), Arab and Middle East unrest (News), Middle East (News), Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali (News), World news, Africa (News) | date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests===
{{main|Tunisian Revolution#Protests}}
[[Image:Caravane de la libÃ©ration 4.jpg|thumb|Tunisian street protests]]
Outraged by the events that led to Bouazizi's self-immolation, [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests|protests]] began in Sidi Bouzid within hours,&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;/&gt; building for more than two weeks, with attempts by police to quiet the unrest serving only to fuel what was quickly becoming a violent and deadly movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera3&quot;/&gt; After Bouazizi's death, the protests became widespread, moving into the more affluent areas and eventually into the capital. The anger and violence became so intense that President Ben Ali fled Tunisia with his family on 14 January 2011,&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; trying first to go to Paris, but was refused refuge by the [[France|French government]]. They were eventually welcomed into [[Saudi Arabia]] under &quot;a long list of conditions&quot; (such as being barred from participation in the media and politics), ending his 23-year rule and sparking &quot;angry condemnation&quot; among Saudis.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/201111652129710582.html|title=Ben Ali gets refuge in Saudi Arabia|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tunisia, unrest persisted as a new regime took over, leaving many citizens of Tunisia feeling as though their needs were still being ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043557,00.html|author=Abouzid, Rania|title=Bouazizi: The Man Who Set Himself and Tunisia on Fire|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=21 January 2011|accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copycat incidents===
Bouazizi's actions triggered [[Copycat suicide|the Werther effect]], causing a number of self-immolations in protests emulating Bouazizi's in several other countries in the [[Greater Middle East]] and Europe. In [[Algeria]] in particular, protests against rising food prices and spreading unemployment&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinadaily&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-01-25/content_1642189.html |title=Algeria reports 2nd death of self-immolation |author=Xinhua |date=25 January 2011 |work=China Daily |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have resulted in [[2011 Algerian self-immolations|many self-immolations]]. The first reported case following Bouazizi's death was that of Mohsen Bouterfif, a 37-year-old father of two, who set himself on fire when the mayor of [[Boukhadra]] in Algeria refused to meet with him and others regarding employment and housing requests on 13 January 2011. According to a report in ''[[El-Watan]]'', the mayor challenged him, saying if he had courage he would immolate himself by fire as Bouazizi had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dna-algerie.com/politique/42-interieure/1210-le-maire-a-mohcin-bouterfif-l-si-tu-as-du-courage-fais-comme-bouazizi-immole-toi-par-le-feu-r.html |title=Le maire Ã  Mohcin Bouterfif : &quot; Si tu as du courage, fais comme Bouazizi, immole-toi par le feu &quot; |publisher=DNA-Algerie |language=French |author=Benslimane, Mehdi &amp; Slim Badaoui |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 24 January. Maamir Lotfi, a 36-year-old unemployed father of six, also denied a meeting with the governor, burned himself in front of the [[El Oued]] town hall on 17 January, dying on 12 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/ARTJAWEB20110212105526/algerie-pauvrete-tunisie-manifestationquatrieme-deces-par-immolation-en-algerie-a-la-veille-de-la-marche-du-12-fevrier.html |title=QuatriÃ¨me dÃ©cÃ¨s par immolation en AlgÃ©rie, Ã  la veille de la marche du 12 fÃ©vrier |language=French |work=[[Jeune Afrique]] |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdelhafid Boudechicha, a 29-year-old day laborer who lived with his parents and five siblings, burned himself in [[Medjana]] on 28 January over employment and housing issues. He died the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elwatan.com/actualite/un-jeune-decede-apres-s-etre-immole-par-le-feu-a-bordj-bou-arreridj-29-01-2011-109323_109.php |title=Un jeune dÃ©cÃ¨de aprÃ¨s sâÃªtre immolÃ© par le feu Ã  Bordj Bou ArrÃ©ridj |author=A.B. |work=El Watan |language=French |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egypt]], Abdou Abdel-Moneim Jaafar, a 49-year-old restaurant owner, set himself alight in front of the [[Egyptian Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abdou Abdel-Moneim Jaafar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/2/4115/Egypt/Society/In-Egypt,-man-sets-himself-on-fire.aspx|title=In Egypt, man sets himself on fire, driven by economic woes|work=English [[Al-Ahram]] |date=17 January 2011|accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His act of protest helped instigate weeks of protest and, later, the resignation of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] on 11 February 2011. In [[Saudi Arabia]], an unidentified 65-year-old man died on 21 January 2011, after setting himself on fire in the town of [[Samtah]], [[Jizan]]. This was apparently the kingdom's first known case of self-immolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;saudi&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12260465 |title=Man dies after setting himself on fire in Saudi Arabia |date=23 January 2011 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;saudi2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/world-news/4231-man-dies-in-possible-first-self-immolation-in-saudi |title=Man dies in possible first self-immolation in Saudi |author=Mifthah, Mohideen |date=22 January 2011 |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these cases, with the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|exception of Egypt]], did not provoke the same kind of popular reaction that Bouazizi's case did in Tunisia, the Algerian, [[Yemen]]i, and [[Jordan]]ian governments have experienced significant protests and made major concessions in response to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;time mag&quot;/&gt; As such, these men and Bouazizi are being hailed by some as &quot;heroic martyrs of a new Middle Eastern revolution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/weekinreview/23worth.html?src=twrhp |author=Worth, Robert F. |title=How a Single Match Can Ignite a Revolution |work=New York Times |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wave of copycat incidents reached Europe on 11 February 2011, in a case very similar to Bouazizi's. Noureddine Adnane, a 27-year-old [[Morocco|Moroccan]] street vendor, set himself on fire in [[Palermo]], Sicily, in protest of the confiscation of his wares and the harassment that was allegedly inflicted on him by municipal officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agi.it/english-version/italy/elenco-notizie/201102121012-cro-ren1017-street_vendor_sets_himself_on_fire_in_palermo_critical |title=Street Vendor Sets Himself on Fire in Palermo, Critical |publisher=[[Agenzia Giornalistica Italia]] |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died five days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahoraitalia.com/giornale//117595/palermo-dies-after-setting-himself-fire.htm |title=Palermo, Moroccan street vendor dies after setting himself on fire | publisher=Ahora Italia |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Amsterdam]], Kambiz Roustay, a 36-year-old [[asylum seeker]] from Iran, set himself on fire on [[Dam Square]] in protest of being rejected asylum. Roustay had fled the country for publishing works undermining the regime, and feared being tortured by the [[Iran]]ian regime upon his return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.at5.nl/artikelen/60029/iranier-waarschuwde-al-voor-wanhoopsdaad |title=IraniÃ«r waarschuwde al voor wanhoopsdaad â AT5 Nieuws |publisher=At5.nl |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
