It was first announced in September 2006 as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[English Wikipedia]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlowski18&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski.[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/09/18/sanger_forks_wikipedia/ &quot;Wikipedia founder forks Wikipedia, More experts, less fiddling?&quot;], ''[[The Register]]'', 18 September 2006. In software engineering, a project fork occurs when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct piece of software.&lt;/ref&gt; but that idea was abandoned prior to its March 2007 public launch in favor of emphasizing original articles. The project aims to improve on the Wikipedia model by providing increased reliability.&lt;ref name=&quot;citizendium_fundamentals&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |title=The Citizendium's Statement of Fundamental Policies |url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Fundamentals |publisher=Citizendium |date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hopes to achieve this by requiring all contributors to use their real names, by strictly moderating the project for unprofessional behavior, by providing what it calls &quot;gentle expert oversight&quot; of everyday contributors, and also through its &quot;approved articles&quot;, which have undergone a form of peer-review by credentialed topic experts and are closed to real-time editing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caroline McCarthy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=McCarthy |title=Citizendium: Wikipedia co-founder Sanger's Wikipedia riva l|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9680301-2.html |work=[[CNET News]] |date=23 January 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nate Anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Nate |last=Anderson |title=Citizendium: building a better Wikipedia |url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/citizendium.ars |publisher=Ars Technica |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founder viewpoints ==
Sanger said in a 17 October 2006 press release that Citizendium &quot;will soon attempt to unseat Wikipedia as the go-to destination for general information online&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangerpr&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://www.citizendium.org/release_001.html &quot;Co-Founder to Launch Edited Version of Wikipedia: Pilot Project for the Citizendium to Launch This Week&quot;], Citizendium.org, 17 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, he captioned its pages &quot;The world needs a more credible free encyclopedia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CZ:Monthly Write-a-Thon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=CZ:Monthly Write-a-Thon|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Monthly_Write-a-Thon|publisher=Citizendium|date=1 August 2007|accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began its pilot phase in October and November 2006.

On 18 January 2007, a change of plans was announced. Sanger announced on the CZ mailing list that only articles marked &quot;CZ Live&quot;, those which have been or will soon be worked on by Citizendium contributors, would remain on the site, and all other articles forked from Wikipedia would be deleted. Not all Citizendium contributors were supportive of this change, but Sanger emphasized that this deletion was &quot;an experiment&quot; and a new set of Wikipedia articles could be uploaded if the experiment were deemed unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofork&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2007-January/000863.html &quot;OK, let's delete the Wikipedia articles (an experiment)&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning for succession of editor-in-chief ===
In May 2009, Sanger reduced his direct activity at Citizendium, and in a message on 30 July 2009, he reminded those on the Citizendium-l mailing list of his previously declared intention not to serve as editor-in-chief for more than two or three years after the start of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2009-July/001418.html &amp;#91;Citizendium-l&amp;#93; My recent absence]&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger has reiterated his call for the Citizendium community to prepare an orderly process for choosing a new Editor-in-Chief. Sanger said that he was spending more time on his WatchKnow project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watchknow.org/ |title=web site |publisher=Watchknow.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly because he needs to earn an incomeâhe said the &quot;Citizendium project doesn't earn me a dime&quot;âand partly because the Citizendium community had demonstrated that it could function effectively without his close, daily involvement, and because &quot;there are squeakier wheels in my life just now.&quot; He added that stepping aside may &quot;precipitate something of a constitutional crisis, considering that we [Citizendium] never adopted a proper charter.&quot; Citizendium finally ratified its charter in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Charter |title=CZ:Charter |publisher=En.citizendium.org |date=2010-09-23 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 September 2010, Sanger stepped down as editor-in-chief&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger blog post, [http://blog.citizendium.org/?p=578 Citizendium blog: Citizendium Charter Ratified]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently gave up editorial powers and rights to the project. Sanger did not appoint a successor or interim Editor-in-Chief, and the project's financial position did not become clear until after his departure.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Russell D. [http://forum.citizendium.org/index.php/topic,3483.msg36543.html#msg36543 &quot;Announcements&quot;], Citizendium, 6 November 2010. Retrieved 23 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of the project ==
=== Fork of Wikipedia ===
According to statements and essays on [http://www.citizendium.org Citizendium.org], the project was initially intended to begin as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Wikipedia, carrying a copy of each articleâunder the rules of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]âas it existed on Wikipedia at the time of Citizendium's launch.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger. [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2006-September/000483.html &quot;Why we should fork all at once&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after initiating the idea of not forking, and then soliciting comments on the matter from Citizendium [[electronic mailing list|mailing list]] and [[web forum]] members, Sanger said that a complete fork at launch was not a &quot;foregone conclusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://forum.citizendium.org/index.php/topic,68.0.html &quot;Forking argument summary&quot;], Citizendium forum, 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 2007, Sanger announced that the pilot would, as an experiment, only carry articles that had been, or would soon be, worked on by Citizendium contributors, instead of a complete set of Wikipedia articles. He stated that the experiment &quot;represents a reconception of our project's basic aim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nofork&quot;/&gt;

No announcement has yet been made on Citizendium editions in languages other than English, but Sanger has stated in his essays that they may be forthcoming after the English language version is established and working successfully. In a review of [[Andrew Keen|Andrew Keen's]] book ''[[The Cult of the Amateur]]'', Sanger comments ironically on Keen's favorable treatment of Citizendium: &quot;The first example of a 'solution' he offers is the Citizendium, or the Citizens' Compendium, which I like to describe briefly as Wikipedia with editors and real names. But how can Citizendium be a solution to the problems he raises, if it has experts working without pay, and the result is free? If it succeeds, won't it contribute to the decline of reference publishing?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.citizendium.org/?p=200|title=Review of Keen's &quot;Cult of the Amateur&quot; |author=Larry Sanger |publisher=Citizendium Blog |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project goal ===
&lt;!-- There is apparently a problem with one or more reference tags in this subsection. --&gt;
The stated aim of the project is to create a &quot;new compendium of knowledge&quot; based on the contributions of &quot;[[intellectuals]],&quot; defined as &quot;educated, thinking people who read about science or ideas regularly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangeressay&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://www.citizendium.org/essay.html &quot;Toward a New Compendium of Knowledge (longer version)&quot;], Citizendium.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizendium aimed to foster an [[expert]] culture and a community that encourages participants (to be called &quot;authors&quot;) to &quot;respect&quot; the expert contributions (by what he referred to as a &quot;gentle process of guidance&quot;).

An appeals process for disagreements between editors and authors, and between different editors, was planned, according to a provisional &quot;Citizendium Policy Outline&quot; published by Sanger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangeroutline&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://www.citizendium.org/policy_draft.html &quot;Citizendium Policy Outline&quot;], Citizendium.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Citizendium blog, Sanger wrote this caveat about the provisional outline: &quot;This is a work in progress. Therefore, I hope the Wikipedia article about the Citizendium will not say tomorrow that CZ will have features X, Y, and Z. These are in most cases negotiable policy ideas, a place for the invitees to the policy project to work from.&quot; Sanger also stated that future versions of the policy outline would be posted on the restricted-access pilot wiki: &quot;The most current version will be available on the pilot project wiki. To see that, you'll have to be a member of the pilot project.&quot; Experts are required to verify their [[professional certification|qualifications]] openly, for transparency and publicly accepted authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangeroutline&quot; /&gt; This contrasts with the open and largely [[Anonymity|anonymous]] nature of Wikipedia, where subject specialists have neither any verifiable special knowledge of their subject nor agreed special status. Sanger stated that editors would ''not'' have pre-approval rights over edits by ordinary authors, though editors would have somewhat undefined authority over articles that fall within their specific area of expertise.

=== Contrast to Wikipedia ===
{{See also|Reliability of Wikipedia}}
Many of Citizendium's proposed policies are attempts to correct perceived flaws in the original design and the public image of Wikipedia that have led to problems with Wikipedia's acceptance as a valid and trustworthy resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;SusanYoungwood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Youngwood|title=Wikipedia: What do they know; when do they know it, and when can we trust it?|url=http://vermonttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070401/FEATURES/70330002|work=Vermont Sunday Magazine|publisher=[[Rutland Herald]]|date=1 April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-05|quote=Perhaps the most important thing to understand about Wikipedia&amp;nbsp;â both its genius and its Achilles heel&amp;nbsp;â is that anyone can create or modify an entry.

Entries can be edited by numerous people and be in constant flux. What you read now might change in five minutes. Five seconds, even.}}&amp;nbsp;â Susan Youngwood.&lt;/ref&gt; Some academics maintain that Wikipedia is a valuable starting point for inquiry, but (as its co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] concurs)&lt;ref name=&quot;The_Wired Campus&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Wikipedia Founder Discourages Academic Use of His Creation|url=http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/1328/wikipedia-founder-discourages-academic-use-of-his-creation|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; should not be used as a sole or principal source of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news91380859.html |title=Expert: Wikipedia won't go away, so learn how to use it |author=Maggie Morris |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2007-02-22 |accessdate=2007-08-09 |quote=[Purdue University assistant professor [[Sorin Matei]] recommends Wikipedia be used only as a search engine that acts as a springboard to other resources and that it never be cited as the principal source of information.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools and universities accept no references to Wikipedia in formal papers, while other educational institutions have limited its use to being merely a  pointer to external sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;LysaChen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Lysa|last=Chen|title=Several colleges push to ban Wikipedia as resource|url=http://dukechronicle.com/node/142611|publisher=[[The Chronicle (Duke University)|The Chronicle Online]]|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Wikipedia, Sanger wrote that &quot;this arguably dysfunctional community is extremely off-putting to...academics&quot; and as such appears &quot;committed to amateurism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangeressay&quot; /&gt; In his December 2007 essay on Citizendium's content [[license]], Sanger said &quot;we are not in business to put Wikipedia out of business, but we do hope to outdo them in valueâthat is, in quality, quantity (in the fullness of time), and in the maturity and responsibility of our community.[...] On balance, I remain a fan of the project I engineered. I merely think we can do betterâand so we should try.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;czlicense&quot; /&gt;

=== Policies and structure ===
Unlike Wikipedia, Citizendium does not allow anonymous editing. Participants must register under their real names with a working email address.

Sanger decided that Citizendium administrators, or [[sysops]], would be called &quot;constables&quot;, and need a [[bachelor's degree]] to qualify. He also instituted a minimum &quot;maturity&quot; requirementâ25 years of ageâfor constables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangeroutline&quot; /&gt; The &quot;head&quot; constable is the ''Chief Constable'' ([[D. Matt Innis]]), and the head editor is the ''Managing Editor''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SangerEmail092306&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2006-September/000348.html &quot;Constables, editors, and the Citizendium Foundation&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 23 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Sanger operated as ''Editor-in-Chief'', the &quot;main individual in charge&quot;, part of and answerable to a ''Board of Directors''. Sanger stated that final decisions about management structure will not be made &quot;until more of the (future) primary stakeholders are on the scene.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://forum.citizendium.org/index.php/topic,51.0.html &quot;How should we manage growth?&quot;], Citizendium forum, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Citizendium blog entry of 10 November 2006, constable Sarah Tuttle announced the formation of an &quot;executive committee&quot; consisting of herself, Sanger and eleven others, which works on issues of &quot;long term governance&quot; of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Tuttle. [http://blog.citizendium.org/2006/11/10/your-executive-committee/ &quot;Your executive committee&quot;], Citizendium blog, 10 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizendium articles are subject to an &quot;approval&quot; process after they have achieved reasonable quality. An &quot;editor&quot; can determine when an article is ready to be approved. If the article is approved it is then locked, and further editing takes place on a separate &quot;draft&quot; version which may eventually replace the current approved version. There is a dispute-resolution process for disagreements about which version should be selected as approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangeroutline&quot; /&gt;

In a 26 October 2006 post to the Citizendium web forum, then Managing Editor David Marshall indicated that the approved version of an article, if it exists, will be the default version displayed to a visitor to the site. If a contributor wishes to modify or add to the article, login will be necessary to work on the &quot;dynamic wiki page&quot; open to editing:

{{bquote|All reader searches will auto-forward to the most recently approved version of the page (assuming that a version has been approved). Once at an approved page, the reader will be given the option to register/log in as an author and move to the dynamic wiki page in current use for development purposes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Marshall. [http://forum.citizendium.org/index.php/topic,108.0.html &quot;My ideas on presenting consistently high quality content&quot;], Citizendium forum, 26 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The project is being carried out under the auspices of the Citizendium Foundation,&lt;ref name=&quot;SangerEmail092306&quot;/&gt; and was initially phased under the [[Tides Center]] as an incubator project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.tidescenter.org/directory/project_detail_new.cfm?id=60306 |title=Project Directory: Citizendium Foundation |publisher=The [[Tides Center]] |accessdate=2007-06-05|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929101008/http://www2.tidescenter.org/directory/project_detail_new.cfm?id=60306 |archivedate = 29 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In  September 2010, the Tides Center officially withdrew direct financial support for the project.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[Image:Citizendium number of articles graph.png|thumb|left|Number of articles from launch of the pilot project through March 2010.]]

=== Pilot project ===
The project was announced by Sanger on 15 September 2006, at the [[Wizards of OS]] 4 conference in Berlin. He gave no deadline for the full launch of the [[wiki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deadlines&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2006-September/000476.html &quot;Citizendium launch plan as of 26 September&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 27 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ia341034.us.archive.org/2/items/WOS4_06_13h_QualityManagementInFreeContent/06_13h_QualityManagementInFreeContent.ogg WOS video stream containing Sanger's announcement] {{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 2 October 2006, Sanger released a pilot project announcement that envisioned a fully functioning wiki within &quot;one to two months.&quot;

In an apparent attempt to quicken the pace of the project, on 2 October 2006, Citizendium web forum moderator Peter Hitchmough suggested what he called an &quot;[[alpha test]]&quot; of the concept. Hitchmough proposed the forking of a limited number of Wikipedia articles to a site where Citizendium web forum and mailing list members could &quot;rewrite a complete section&quot; of Wikipedia content.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hitchmough. [http://forum.citizendium.org/index.php/topic,80.0.html &quot;Proposal: Fork Wikipedia and launch with some A1-class model subjects&quot;], Citizendium forum, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Larry Sanger reacted enthusiastically to the idea and at first suggested his already existing Textop wiki as the site for the alpha test. Sanger later posted that Textop would not be a good choice, but showed continued interest in the proposal. He envisioned a &quot;restricted-access&quot; wiki where the idea could be tried and requested further discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger. [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2006-October/000499.html &quot;Administrivia: interesting pilot project proposal&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 2 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

No access to the pilot version of Citizendium, even read-only, was allowed to the general public. Sanger stated: &quot;Only invited people will be able to view and edit the pilot project wiki.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cfa&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger.

In a press release on 17 October 2006, Sanger announced: &quot;the fledgling Citizendium Foundation will launch a six-week pilot project open to potential contributors by invitation&quot;. Several editors and other project leaders were named. It was also announced that the Citizendium Foundation had &quot;started the process of applying for [[501(c)]](3) status [non-profit status]&quot; and had &quot;received a firm commitment for a significant seed grant from a foundation, as well as small personal donations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sangerpr&quot;/&gt; In a follow-up post to the press release, Sanger said that the initial group allowed access to the pilot would consist of &quot;ten editors, three constables, six authors, and me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger.

In a 17 January 2007, post to the Citizendium forum, Sanger stated that &quot;we have had only 10â20 (very) active people out of 500 accounts created.&quot; As a result, Sanger decided to delete all articles besides those marked &quot;CZ live&quot; from the pilot project in an attempt to motivate greater participation.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger.

On 16 February 2007, in response to rising site vandalism, automatic account creation&lt;ref name=&quot;selfreg&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2007-January/000871.html &quot;Self-registration begins!&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 22 January 2007. The first act of [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] was carried out via an account named 'Chris Nguyen', to vandalise three pages including the main one and that of Larry Sanger, apparently before the announcement was made. The account was indefinitely blocked a little over half an hour after the first improper edit.&lt;/ref&gt; was put on hold while increased protections were being put in place to counter vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://blog.citizendium.org/2007/02/16/vandal-assault/ Vandal Assault]'' at the Citizendium Blog&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, page moves were limited to constables as an additional measure against vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2007-February/000901.html &quot;Page moves now require constable help; and semi-automated hand-approval of new accounts?&quot;], Citizendium-l mail list, 17 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sanger continued the process of un-forking the  Citizendium from Wikipedia by inviting contributors to delete any Wikipedia content that had changed only superficially since it was imported.

=== Inauguration ===
[[Image:Citzendium.png|thumb|360px|Default style of the homepage through early 2008; users can choose from a number of &quot;skins&quot;, or formats.]]
On 25 March 2007, Citizendium ended its pilot phase and went live, into its beta phase, and the site became publicly readable.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://blog.citizendium.org/2007/03/25/we-have-launched/ &quot;We have launched&quot;], Citizendium blog, 25 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The launch coincided with a feature-length [[Associated Press]] article that ran widely, with a title in ''[[USA Today]]'' of &quot;Citizendium aims to be better Wikipedia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Bergstein |title=Citizendium aims to be better Wikipedia |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5Nc9GOr3r |agency=Associated Press |date=2007-03-25}} &quot;This week, Sanger takes the wraps off a Wikipedia alternative, Citizendium. His goal is to capture Wikipedia's bustle but this time, avoid the vandalism and inconsistency that are its pitfalls.&quot;&amp;nbsp;â Brian Bergstein.&lt;/ref&gt;

The day prior to launch, Sanger released an essay, &quot;Why the Citizendium Will (Probably) Succeed&quot; in which he stated that activity at Citizendium grew from 100 edits a day in the first month to over 500 prior to launch.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://www.citizendium.org/whyczwillsucceed.html &quot;Why the Citizendium Will (Probably) Succeed&quot;], Citizendium, March 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Our activity has grown from 100 edits per day in the first month to over 500 prior to launch. Every day, a large variety of people from many fields sign on and do some work. This is all in a period in which the project has been visible only to those who have applied to the project. In addition, while it has received a fair bit of press, we have done very little in the way of recruitmentâbut with good results when we have. More aggressive recruitment is our trump card, which we haven't played.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch, on 27 March 2007, a press release quotes Sanger as saying &quot;You don't have to choose between content and accountability. We have shown that we can create open and credible content. We can, in fact, be open to all sorts of participants, but still hold people to higher standards of content and behavior as a community.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pressreleaseofthe27th&quot;&gt;Larry Sanger. [http://www.citizendium.org/release_003.html Citizendium Opens its Free Online Encyclopedia Project to the Public] Citizendium, 27 March 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The modest success of our pilot project shows that there is hope that we can correct exactly the sort of abuses that people demonize Web 2.0 for,&quot; said the project's Editor-in-Chief, Wikipedia co-founder Dr. Larry Sanger. &quot;You don't have to choose between content and accountability. We have shown that we can create open and credible content. We can, in fact, be open to all sorts of participants, but still hold people to higher standards of content and behavior as a community.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after the launch, it was noted that Citizendium's family-friendly policy would mean the project would likely tend to avoid articles on slang terms for sexual activity, and particularly explicit articles on sexual practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;FamilyFriendlyPolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Sanger|title=CZ:Family-Friendly Policy|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Family-Friendly_Policy|publisher=Citizendium|accessdate=2007-06-07|quote=Probably, we will not have graphic depictions of the sex act or photographs of human sex organs; we will have few articles about pornography; we will not catalog every sex position and every fetish; we will not have gratuitous, and truly shocking and disgusting, pictures of gore (e.g., crime scene photos); and so forth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Citizendium has a &quot;professionalism&quot; policy for editors, which Sanger said is different from most online communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ProfessionalismPolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry|last=Sanger|title=CZ:Professionalism|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Professionalism|publisher=Citizendium|accessdate=2007-07-15|quote=The ''Citizendium'' differs significantly from other online communities in its commitment to professionalismâthat is, professional behaviorâand low tolerance for incivility and disruption. For there to be efficient content output and motivated contributors it is crucial that we all treat each other &quot;professionally,&quot; and each other's work respectfully.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2007, Sanger announced an initiative via the project-wide mailing list that he dubbed &quot;Citizendium 2.0&quot;. Characterizing his comments as a &quot;project planning document&quot;, Sanger detailed a series of initiatives designed to launch Citizendium into its next phase of development. The document outlined plans for a judicial board, an advisory board, a personnel manager, a new chairman of the editorial council, wider participation in the project by volunteers, a system of subpages for articles, and an expanded article checklist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2007-June/000994.html |title=Toward CZ 2.0 |author=Larry Sanger |publisher=Citizendium-l |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2007-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later developments ===
[[Image:Citizendium Editing users.png|thumb|Number of users making at least one edit in a given month, through February 2010.]]
At the project's one-year anniversary in September 2007, Citizendium included 3000 [[Article (publishing)|articles]] written and revised by 2000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Comment le web change le monde : l'alchimie des multitudes, Francis Pisani et Dominique Piotet, Ã©d. Pearson, 2008 (ISBN 978-2-7440-6261-2), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; A number of media reports appeared in late October and early November 2007 about the anniversary of Citizendium. A story in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' quoted Larry Sanger predicting strong growth for the project: &quot;At some point, possibly very soon, the Citizendium will grow explosively&amp;nbsp;â say, quadruple the number of its active contributors, or even grow by an order of magnitude. And it will experience that growth over the course of a month or two, and its growth will continue to accelerate from that higher rate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ae382288-8b41-11dc-95f7-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1 |title=Citizendium vs Wikipedia |first=Richard |last=Waters |work=Financial Times |location =London |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citizendium was honored on 5 December 2007, as an award finalist of the [[Society for New Communications Research]]. The Society describes itself as a nonprofit global think-tank &quot;dedicated to the advanced study of new communications tools, technologies and emerging modes of communication, and their effect on traditional media, professional communications, business, culture and society&quot;. The Society chose Citizendium for an award because it considered it &quot;a leading organization&quot; in these respects.&lt;ref&gt;Report: http://www.newsobserver.com/1566/story/803518.html. The Society for New Communications Research website: http://www.sncr.org. Also see [http://blog.citizendium.org/2007/12/06/cz-receives-award-of-excellence-from-the-society-for-new-communications-research/ Citizendium Blog entry].&lt;/ref&gt;

Library writer Walt Crawford noted in April 2009 that Citizendium appeared to be in an &quot;extended lull&quot;, with a constant rate of creation of new articles at around 13â14 per day and a decline in the number of active authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citesandinsights.info/civ9i5.pdf Crawford, Walt, ''Cites &amp; Insights'' Volume 9, Number 5] (April 2009), ISSN 1534-0937.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Richard Waters wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]] '' technology blog: &quot;At best, Citizendium could be called a qualified success. Launched in March 2007, it currently lists 11,810 articles&amp;nbsp;â 2,999,674 fewer than the English-language version of Wikipedia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2009/08/citizendium-founder-ready-to-jump-ship/ |title=Citizendium founder ready to jump ship |publisher=Blogs.ft.com |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu O'Neil, Principal Researcher at the Australian Department of Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy, wrote in a March 2010 article on [[crowdsourcing]] that &quot;new participants to Wikipedia know that their contributions will have a significant audience; becoming a Wikipedia editor is trivial and instantaneous; since it lacks this immediate quality, Citizendium failed to attract the crowd.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, M., 2010:  Shirky and Sanger, or the cost of crowdsourcing. ''Journal of Science Communication'' 09(01) C04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project had a core of 25 contributors who made more than 100 edits a month, with 90 participants making at least one edit, during March 2010. [[Median]] word count dropped from 468 words per article in October 2007 to 151 in May 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordcount&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Statistics#Word_count |title=CZ:Statistics |publisher=En.citizendium.org |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the number of users making 1, 20 or 100 edits per month all were at their lowest point since the project went public in March 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordcount&quot; /&gt; By October 2011, only about a dozen members made edits on a typical day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deadinwater&quot; /&gt; The number of approved articles remains at around 1% of the total.

=== Financial endangerment ===

A financial report was issued in late 2010 and updated periodically. Beginning in early 2011, the report re-emphasized concern about a lack of funds. According to the Management Council's estimate in the October revision of the report, Citizendium would be able to afford to continue running the server until approximately January 2012. The Management Council continues to search for a university, philanthropist, or any other source of funding to take on or help with server costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/CZ:Financial_report|title=CZ:Financial report |publisher=En.citizendium.org| date=2011-3-15 |accessdate=2011-3-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
