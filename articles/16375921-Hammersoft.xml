'''Ohio Field''', home to the football team at [[The Ohio State University]] before [[Ohio Stadium]], was built in 1898 and dedicated ten years later.  Seating capacity was approximately 5,000 until 1907, when a grandstand and bleachers were added. Another renovation in 1910 saw a second grandstand added, with amenities such as brick ticket booths and iron fences, boosting capacity to 14,000. In 1916 Ohio Field saw Ohio State's first [[Big Ten]] [[1916 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|championship team]].

The site of Ohio Field was on North High Street, between 17th and Woodruff Avenues. Presently, the space is occupied by Arps Hall, Ramseyer Hall and a parking garage.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;&gt;[http://www.osu.edu/map/area.php?area=engineering Campus Map - The Ohio State University]&lt;/ref&gt; During the era of Ohio State's first All-American player, Charles [[Chic Harley]], football grew so popular in Columbus that Ohio Field could no longer facilitate the demand for tickets. This would spawn OSU's campaign for a new stadium near the [[Olentangy River]].  The legendary [[Ohio Stadium]] would come to be known as the &quot;House that Harley Built,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;/&gt; and remains a recognizable symbol in college athletics today.
