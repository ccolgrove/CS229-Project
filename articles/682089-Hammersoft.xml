The '''University of Southern Maine''' (USM) is a multi-campus public urban comprehensive university and part of the [[University of Maine System]].  USM's three primary campuses are located in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]],  and [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]].  Originally founded as two separate universities (Gorham Normal School, University of Maine at Portland), the two state universities were combined in 1970 to help streamline the public university system in Maine and eventually expanded by adding the Lewiston campus in 1988. The Portland Campus is home to the [[Edmund Muskie]] School of Public Service along with the Bio Sciences Research Institute and the [[University of Maine School of Law]], the [[Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes|Osher Lifelong Learning Institute]] and the Osher Map Library.  The Gorham campus, much more residential, is home to the College of Education and the School of Music.  At Lewiston-Auburn, students experience a small, intimate campus, with a focus on interdisciplinary learning.  Each campus maintains its own &quot;atmosphere&quot;, and professionals from all campuses provide a world-class experience at this regional university.&lt;ref name=mission&gt;

==History==
Evolving from [[Gorham Academy]] into an institution of higher education, USM originated in 1878 as Gorham Normal School, later called Gorham State Teachers College and then simply Gorham State College.  In 1970 that institution merged with the University of Maine at Portland (previously Portland Junior College) and became the University of Maine at Portland-Gorham (UMPG).&lt;ref name=USMSpecColl&gt;
