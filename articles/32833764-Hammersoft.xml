'''Coastliner 700''' is a popular bus service operated in [[West Sussex]] by [[Stagecoach in the South Downs]] between [[Brighton]] and [[Southsea]]. The route travels via [[Worthing]], [[Littlehampton]], [[Arundel]], [[Bognor Regis]], [[Chichester]], [[Havant]], and [[Portsmouth]]; it also has its own livery. The general daytime frequency of the routes is every ten minutes, and the route is a popular tourist lifeline in the summer as it travels between major tourist destinations on the south coast. [[Double-decker bus]]es are normally used to operate the route, although there are also single deckers. The route has its own website.

==History==
[[File:Portsmouth Cambridge Junction bus stop flags.JPG|thumb|The bus stop flags at Cambridge Junction, Portsmouth, Hampshire.|100px|left]]
The route was introduced in 1975. Passenger numbers increased dramatically in the early 2000s, and by 2010 the service carried four million people per year. New vehicles were introduced by Stagecoach in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/local/east-hampshire/south_coast_bus_travel_gets_a_green_upgrade_1_1248666 |title=South coast bus travel gets a green upgrade |work=[[The News (Portsmouth)]] |date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The service has had its own livery from the beginning. It began with a coloured strip along the side of the green Southdown bus; now it is the regular Stagecoach livery, blue, white, orange and red, with the route description on the side, and different buses having livery related to a certain town along the route, and slogans such as 'We took the Coastliner 700 to fun and fashion'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transport Illustrated: Hants &amp; Sussex Part 1|url=http://transport-illustrated.blogspot.com/2011/02/hants-sussex-part-1.html|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Scroll about halfway down the page on the link to see this --&gt;

In Brighton, the bus is often though of as a bit of a 'foreigner' or visitor to the rest of the [[Brighton &amp; Hove (bus company)|buses in Brighton]] with their cream and red livery.&lt;ref name=&quot;gykonr7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Get your kicks on route 700|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/blogs/blogs/alicewright/4648432.Get_Your_Kicks_on_Route_700_/|accessdate=23 August 2011|journal=The Argus}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only bus route in the UK that stays so close to the shoreline throughout the whole route; for the majority of it the bus is on the very front, so that one could look out and watch the boats on the sea or the beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;gykonr7&quot; /&gt; It is operated from three Stagecoach depots, Worthing, Chichester and Portsmouth, and normally run with branded [[Enviro 400]]s and [[Enviro 300|300]]s.

==Route==
The service operates along the south coast, stopping at several landmarks, among which are [[Brighton Pavilion]] and [[Chichester Cathedral]]. The  [[Worthing Birdman]] competition at Worthing pier also attracts lots in the summer, as the route travels right along the road next to the promenade where it is held and takes people back to their various hotels and caravan sites, of which there are many in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.excite.co.uk/caravan-sites-brighton-area-N23787.html|title=Caravan Sites Brighton|publisher=excite|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
