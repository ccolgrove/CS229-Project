==Biography==
Rozakis is well known as DC's Answer Man, answering trivia questions from readers in the ''[[Daily Planet (DC Comics house advertisement)|Daily Planet]]'' promotional page in many late-1970s comics. He has also had an online presence in that capacity since the mid-1990s.

Rozakis got his start in the comics industry through his many letters to [[comic book letter column]]s. Among his earliest credits is that of editor (both managing and contributing) on [[DC Comics]] &quot;[[fanzine|Pro-zine]]&quot; (&quot;Professional fanzine&quot;) ''[[The Amazing World of DC Comics]]''&lt;ref&gt;Philbin, Brian G. [http://metropolisplus.com/awodcc/index.htm &quot;The Amazing World of DC Comics,&quot; MetropolisPlus.com.] Accessed Oct. 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; between [[1974 in comics|1974]] and [[1978 in comics|1978]]. In addition to editing, Rozakis wrote for the bi-monthly publication and also oversaw the letters page.

==DC Comics==
===Comics credits===
His first comics credit was in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #445 (March [[1975 in comics|1975]]), as writer of the back-up feature &quot;The Touchdown Trap&quot;, with back-up stories in ''[[Action Comics]]'', ''[[The Flash]]'' and ''[[Batman Family]]'' (among others) soon following.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibliography&quot;&gt;[http://members.aol.com/bobro32/Biblio2.html Bob Rozakis: Bibliography by date]. Accessed May 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was assistant editor for [[Julius Schwartz]] on the landmark issue ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #300,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/29898/ ''Superman'' #300 (June 1976)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; and also served editorially on issues of ''Action Comics'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]''. His writing credits consist largely of back-up features and, in particular, dozens of &quot;Action Comics Featuring:...&quot; ([[Air-Wave]], [[Hero Hotline]], [[Aquaman]], etc.), between #461 and #640.  Additionally, Rozakis wrote the 1985 four-issue miniseries ''Superman: The Secret Years'' (with art by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Kurt Schaffenberger]]), and the comics adaptations of such diverse movies as ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' (1987), ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' (1989) and ''[[Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer]]'' (1985). Rozakis was also the writer of the syndicated [[comic strip]] ''The Superman Sunday Special'' for two years.

Arguably, his most well-known writing came in the twelve-issue 1986 series ''[['Mazing Man]]'', featuring the misadventures of self-declared homemade hero Sigfried Horatio Hunch III, which Rozakis co-created with artist [[Stephen DeStefano]]. The two returned to the character for three specials and for June 1987's ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #16, to tell &quot;The Closest Thing To A Secret Origin of 'Mazing Man You Will Ever Get&quot;. Rozakis also co-created the series ''[[Hero Hotline]]'' with DeStefano, on which Rozakis also provided the coloring, a job he also undertook on the &quot;Action Comics Featuring: Hero Hotline&quot; back-up features.

Among his other creations are [[Mister E]], the [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]] and [[Duela Dent]] (of the [[Teen Titans]], created during his run on the ''[[Teen Titans#1970s_revival|Teen Titans]]'' title in the late 1970s), and [[The Calculator]] (a character who later played a major role in DC's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event). His credits during his 25-year career with DC total &quot;almost four hundred stories&quot; featuring most DC characters, &quot;plus dozens of features, puzzles, and activities pages&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homepage&quot;/&gt;

Rozakis' comic book work in 1998-2000 was a variety of custom publications including the &quot;Celebrate the Century&quot; comic books&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series/17143/ &quot;Celebrate the Century (Super Heroes Stamp Album)&quot;] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[United States Postal Service]], as well as publications for [[Consolidated Edison|Con Edison]], the [[San Francisco Giants]] and the [[United Nations]] Land Mine Awareness program. In 2008, he began writing a series of &quot;alternate reality&quot; articles titled &quot;The Secret History of All-American Comics Inc.&quot; for ''[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]'' and ''[[Back Issue (magazine)|Back Issue]]'' magazines.

===Behind the scenes===
Between 1981 and 1998, Rozakis ran DC Comics' production department, and as Executive Director of Production he was instrumental in the development of offset-printed comic books in a wide variety of formats. He was also the leading proponent of &quot;computerized color separations and typesetting, electronic page preparation, and computer-to-plate printing&quot;, and as a result of his efforts on DC's behalf, the look of comic books across the entire industry changed, DC won &quot;over one hundred awards for printing excellence&quot;, and Rozakis himself was profiled in ''Publishing &amp; Production Executive'' on two separate occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Homepage&quot;&gt;[http://members.aol.com/bobro32/ Bob Rozakis's homepage]. Accessed May 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Rozakis announced his retirement from the comic book industry.

Rozakis is married to prolific author Dr. [[Laurie Rozakis|Laurie E. Rozakis]] PhD, a professor of English, grammar-expert and &quot;author of more than 100 books&quot;, and Rozakis' co-writer on ''Detective Comics'' #464 (Oct, 1976).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rozakile.blogspot.com/ &quot;Test Success: Grammar, She Wrote,&quot; Dr. Laurie Rozakis' blog].

Accessed May 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The two have collaborated on ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Office Politics'' (Alpha Books, 1998) (ISBN 0028623975).&lt;ref name=&quot;Homepage&quot;/&gt; They have two children: son Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; (who wrote his [[Princeton University]] thesis on the business viability of [[webcomics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://libweb5.princeton.edu/theses/thesesid.asp?ID=86876 Rozakis, Charles. &quot;An In-Depth Look at the Business Viability of Webcomics&quot;, Princeton University Economics Dept (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;), and daughter Samantha &quot;Sammi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rozakile.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-19-dress.html Dr. Laurie Rozakis' blog: May 12, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Laurie and Bob drove the DC Comic-mobile, a van that served as a lending library for comic books.
