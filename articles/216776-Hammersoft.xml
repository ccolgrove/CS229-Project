'''Laguna''' (PSGC: [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/province.asp?provcode=043400000&amp;regName=REGION%20IV-A%20(CALABARZON) 035400000]; [[ISO 3166-2:PH|'''ISO''': PH-LAG]]) is a [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of the [[Philippines]] found in the [[CALABARZON]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] in [[Luzon]]. Its capital is [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] and the province is located southeast of [[Metro Manila]], south of the province of [[Rizal province|Rizal]], west of [[Quezon]], north of [[Batangas]] and east of [[Cavite]]. Laguna almost completely surrounds  [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country. The province acquired its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''lago'', which means ''lake'' or ''lagoon''. The city with the highest population (based on 2007 census) is [[Calamba City]], while the least poluation is the [[Famy, Laguna|Municipality of Famy]].

Laguna is notable for being the birthplace of [[Jose Rizal]], the country's national hero. Laguna is also famous among tourists for the [[Pagsanjan Falls]], the [[University of the Philippines, Los BaÃ±os|University of the Philippines]] campus and the hot spring resorts in [[Los BaÃ±os, Laguna|Los BaÃ±os]] and [[Calamba City]], on the slopes of [[Mount Makiling]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]] Town Plaza, Taytay Falls, [[Majayjay]], the wood carvings and ''papier mache'' created by the people of [[Paete, Laguna|PaetÃ©]], the ''turumba'' of [[Pakil, Laguna|Pakil]], the [[Seven Lakes of San Pablo|Seven Lakes of San Pablo City]] (San Pablo City is the first city in the province) and Hidden Valley Springs in [[Calauan]].

Currently, the province has a metropolitan area namely the Laguna West Metro, as it has the cities and towns nearest the [[National Capital Region]]. Laguna West Metro consists of 3 cities ([[Binan|BiÃ±an City]], [[Calamba City]] and [[Santa Rosa City]]) and 4 municipalities ([[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], [[Cabuyao, Laguna|Cabuyao]], [[Los BaÃ±os, Laguna|Los BaÃ±os]] and [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]]). Laguna is also considered as the richest and the most progressive province in the Philippines. 

==History==
[[File:Luisiana Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|200px|Luisiana Catholic Church]]
[[File:Church of Liliw, Facade.jpg|thumb|200px|Liliw Catholic Church]]
The Province of Laguna was named after [[Laguna de Bay]], the body of water that forms its northern boundary. Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] (''Laguna de Bay'' is Spanish which means &quot;Lake of Bay&quot;), the first provincial capital. Captain [[Juan de Salcedo]] with a band of one hundred Spanish-Mexican soldiers and many Bisayan allies conquered the province and its surrounding regions for [[Spain]] in 1571. Seven years later, two [[Franciscan]] friars started the work of Christianisation.

In 1577, the Franciscan missionaries arrived in [[Manila]], and in 1578 they started evangelizing Laguna, Morong (now [[Rizal]]), [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]] (now [[Quezon]]) and the [[Bicol Peninsula]]. [[Juan de Plasencia]] and Diego de Oropesa were the earliest Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of [[Bay]], Caliraya, Majayjay, NagcarlÃ¡n, [[Liliw]], [[Pila, Laguna|Pila]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], [[Lumban]], PÃ¡ngil and [[Siniloan]] were founded. In 1678, Fray Hernando Cabrera founded San Pablo de los Montes (now [[San Pablo City]]) and built a wooden church and convent considered as the best and finest in the province.

In 1670, [[delimitation]] of borders were made between [[Lucban]], [[Majayjay]] and [[Cavite]]. The populous town at that time was [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]], the capital of the province until 1688, when the seat of the provincial government was moved to PagsanjÃ¡n, and later in 1858, to Santa Cruz. In 1754, the Province of Laguna and [[Quezon|Tayabas]] were divided, with the Malinao River separating the towns of Majayjay and LucbÃ¡n.

The province became a bloody battle ground for the Chinese during the two instances that they rose in revolt against Spain. In 1603s, the Chinese made their last stand in the mountains of San Pablo, and in 1639, they fortified themselves in the highlands of [[Cavinti]] and [[Lumban]], surrendering in [[Pagsanjan]] a year later.

The natives of Laguna proved loyal to the Spanish crown during the British invasion (1762â1764) when thousands rallied to its defense. When a detachment of British troops under Captain Thomas Backhouse entered the province in search of the silver cargo of the galleon Filipino, Francisco de San Juan of PagsanjÃ¡n led a band of volunteers that fought them in several engagements in and around the town which was then the provincial capital (1688â1858). Backhouse plundered the town and burned its newly reconstructed church but San Juan succeeded in escaping with the precious hoard to Pampanga where the treasure greatly bolstered the defense effort of [[SimÃ³n de Anda y Salazar|SimÃ³n de Anda]], leader of the resistance movement. For his heroism, San Juan was made a brigade commander and alcalde mayor of Tayabas (now [[Quezon]]) province.

The people's loyalty gradually degenerated into bitter hostility. Grave abuses by the colonizers, especially those of the clergy, caused the resentment of the natives to be fanned into a rising flood of insurrection. In 1840 for instance, religious intolerance led the people of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, [[Bay]], and [[BiÃ±an]] to join the revolt of [[Hermano Pule]] ([[Apolinario de la Cruz]]) of [[Lucban]], Tayabas.

Laguna was also exposed to the aspirations of its most famous son, [[Dr. JosÃ© Rizal]], who was born in [[Calamba City]]. The persecution of the Rizal family, along with their fellow landowners toward the end of the century further aggravated the situation. In 1896, thousands of inhabitants, especially of [[Bay]], [[Los BaÃ±os, Laguna|Los BaÃ±os]], Nagcarlan, [[Magdalena, Laguna|Magdalena]], [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], and [[Pagsanjan]] had joined the revolutionary Katipunan.

[[Image:Philippines Paete Catholic Church.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Spanish colonial church in [[Paete]], Laguna, with the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range at the background.]]
Laguna was one of the eight provinces to rise in revolt against the Spanish misrule led by Generals [[Paciano Rizal]] of [[Calamba City]], [[Severino Taino]] of [[PagsanjÃ¡n]], Agueda Kahabagan of [[Calauan]], and [[Miguel Malvar]] of [[Batangas]]. The ill-equipped revolutionaries fought the well-armed enemy until on August 31, 1898, when the last Spanish garrison surrendered to the victorious patriots in Santa Cruz. The province was cleared of Spaniards. There had been only one respite, the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] on December 14 to 15, 1897.

Laguna actively supported the first Philippine Republic proclaimed at [[Malolos]] on January 23, 1899. Its two delegates to the [[Malolos Congress]] were Don Higino BenÃ­tez and Don Graciano Cordero, both natives of PagsanjÃ¡n.

Upon the outbreak of the Filipino-American War (1899â1901), Generals Juan Cailles and Paciano Rizal led the defense of Laguna until June 30, 1901, when surrender became inevitable. Cailles became the first Filipino Governor of Laguna under the American flag.

The Province of Laguna progressed rapidly in peace. Roads were built, schools were established, and in 1917, the Manila Railroad Company extended its line to Laguna as far as Pagsanjan.

During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] (1942â1945), Laguna was a center of Filipino resistance despite the presence of [[Makapili]] collaborators. 

The establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary is a military unit organization was founded on 1942 to 1946 in the province of Laguna, and aided of the local military regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th and 42nd Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 4th Infantry Regiment. Started the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Military Operations in Southern Luzon, Mindoro and Palawan from 1942 to 1945 against the Japanese Imperial forces.

Beginning in 1945, attacks by the Filipino soldiers of the 4th, 41st, 42nd, 43rd, 45th, 46th and 47th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 4th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the recognized guerrillas against Japanese forces in Laguna increased in anticipation of the Liberation of the Philippines by joint Filipino &amp; American forces.

Present-day Laguna shows a thriving economy. Peopled by 2,473,530 (2009 Population) industrious citizens and possessing a total area of 1760&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² of land, Laguna produces millions of pesos worth of coconuts, rice, sugar, citrus fruits, lanzones and other products. Tourists flock to its beauty spots, especially [[Pagsanjan Falls]], [[Calamba City]] and [[Los BaÃ±os, Laguna|Los Banos]] hotsprings, Makiling National Park, Caliraya Lake and many others. Levels of development vary. The towns near Metro Manila have become industrialized whereas the inner towns continue to engage in agricultural production or pursue agri-based industries and cottage and small-scale industries.

===Physical===

Laguna lies on the southern shores of [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country. On the southern border of the province are [[Mt. Makiling]] and [[Mount Banahaw|Mt. BanÃ¡haw]], both are long dormant volcanoes, but still sources of geothermal energy. Mt. Makiling is popular for the numerous hot spring resorts that are found on its slopes. [[Pagsanjan Falls]], is a popular waterfall that tumbles down a deep gorge in the hills.

The eastern portion of Laguna straddles the southernmost portions of the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range.

== Climate ==
The province is relatively dry from November to April and wet during the rest of the year for a small portion near the southern boundary. The other parts, west of Santa Cruz municipality, experience a dry season from November to April and rainy season during the rest of the year. The eastern and southern most portions do not have distinct season, with rainfall more evenly distributed throughout the year.
