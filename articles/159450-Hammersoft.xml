The '''Nebraska Cornhuskers''' (often abbreviated to '''Huskers''') is the name given to several sports teams of the [[University of NebraskaâLincoln]].   The university is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The Cornhuskers compete in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], fielding 21 [[Varsity team|varsity]] teams in 15 sports:
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;
*'''Men's sports'''
**Baseball
**Basketball
**Cross country
**Football 
**Golf
**Gymnastics
**Tennis
**Track and field
**Wrestling
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top&gt;
*'''Women's sports'''
**Basketball
**Bowling
**Cross country
**Golf
**Gymnastics
**Rifle&lt;ref&gt;Rifle is classified as a coeducational sport by the NCAA; however, it is classified as a women's sport at Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Soccer
**Softball
**Swimming and diving
**Tennis
**Track and field
**Volleyball
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Early nicknames for the university's athletic teams included the ''&quot;Hawkeyes&quot;'' (which is now associated with the [[University of Iowa]]), the ''&quot;Antelopes&quot;'' (which the [[University of Nebraska at Kearney]] later adopted), the ''&quot;Old Gold Knights&quot;'', the ''&quot;'''Bugeaters'''&quot;'' and the ''&quot;Mankilling Mastodons&quot;''.  The name Cornhuskers first appeared in the school newspaper as &quot;We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours&quot; referring to a 20-18 upset victory over Iowa in [[1893 Nebraska Bugeaters football team|1893]].  The name would be used again, this time to refer to Nebraska by [[Charles &quot;Cy&quot; Sherman]] in The Nebraska State Journal during the [[1899 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|1899]] season and would replace all other names by [[1900 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|1900]].[http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=2802]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huskernews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/1999/01/01/380d0d7a3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cornhuskers have two official mascots, [[Herbie Husker]] and [[Lil' Red]].

The Cornhuskers participate in 21 sports sponsored by the Big Ten Conference. In addition the Huskers play in two non-sponsor Big Ten events: Rifle and Bowling. Rifle is in the GARC and Bowling is independent.

For over 100 years, the Cornhuskers participated in what is now known as the [[Big 12 Conference]], having been a member since the conference's earliest predecessor, the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, later the [[Big 8 Conference]], was founded.

&lt;/ref&gt; [[1970 NCAA Division I-A football season|1970]], [[1971 NCAA Division I-A football season|1971]], [[1994 NCAA Division I-A football season|1994]], [[1995 NCAA Division I-A football season|1995]], and [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997]]. The latter three mark one of only two times that a team has won three [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions]]hips in four seasons.  The other was Notre Dame in [[1946 NCAA Division I-A football season|1946]], [[1947 NCAA Division I-A football season|1947]] and [[1949 NCAA Division I-A football season|1949]]. Over the past 25 years, the Huskers' three Division I national championships are the second-most of any Division I university, behind only the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]], which has won five.

The coach who brought about the most wins in Cornhusker history is [[Tom Osborne]], who led the team for 25 seasons and attained the best winning % for a coach over a career, from [[1973 NCAA Division I-A football season|1973]] to [[1977 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997]]; his final record at Nebraska was 255&amp;ndash;49&amp;ndash;3. During his tenure, the team won three national titles, including one in his final season.

Nebraska's home games always open with the [[Tunnel Walk]], which signifies the entry of the team onto the field. When the Cornhuskers play at home in [[Memorial Stadium, Lincoln|Memorial Stadium]], the stadium holds more people than [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]] (the third-largest city in Nebraska). The current attendance record was set on Saturday, September 26, 2009, when 86,304 people watched the Cornhuskers play Louisiana-Lafayette.  They currently hold the NCAA record for the most consecutive sold out home games; the sellout streak dates back to November 3, 1962.

On December 2, 2007, athletic director Tom Osborne named [[Bo Pelini]] head football coach at Nebraska. Pelini left his previous position as defensive coordinator at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] after the [[2008 BCS National Championship Game|2008 National Championship]] win against [[2007 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]. Pelini was defensive coordinator at Nebraska in 2003 and was interim head coach for the [[2003 Alamo Bowl]] game, replacing former head coach [[Frank Solich]].

Pelini won his first three bowl games (including the 2003 Alamo Bowl) and lost his fourth.  After his first three years as head coach, Pelini has a record of 30-12 as head coach at Nebraska.  This record includes bowl victories in the [[2009 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] on January 1, 2009, against the [[2008 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson Tigers]] and the 2009 [[Holiday Bowl]] against the [[2009 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona Wildcats]].  The 2009 Holiday Bowl was notable in that Nebraska gave the bowl game its first shutout in its 32-year history. This also earned Nebraska its first shutout in 46 bowl appearances.  On December 31, 2010, Nebraska played in the Holiday Bowl for a second consecutive year, this time against the [[2010 Washington Huskies football team|Washington Huskies]]. Nebraska lost the game 19-7, even though the Huskers had played Washington earlier in the non-conference season and won 56-21.

The previous Husker coach was [[Bill Callahan (football coach)|Bill Callahan]], who was hired before the 2004  football season and was later fired by interim Athletic Director [[Tom Osborne]] on November 24, 2007.  Callahan represented a break from tradition in many ways. First, Callahan was the first head coach since 1956 not to be hand-picked by his predecessor. Second, Bill Callahan had implemented the [[West Coast Offense]] at Nebraska. The Huskers had previously been known for the tough running game; specifically, running the option with a strong backfield, while their new style relies heavily on a balance between the run and the pass. The previous three head coaches were [[Frank Solich]], Tom Osborne, and [[Bob Devaney]].

Nebraska achieved 800 total wins on October 14, 2006 with a 21&amp;ndash;3 victory over [[2006 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. As of April 2011, there are eight teams with 800 wins: [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]], [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]],  Nebraska, [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]], [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]], [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], and [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]].

{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers Women's Volleyball}}

[[Image:Nebraskawomensvolleyball.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nebraska playing [[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]] in 2004]]
Nebraska is home to one of the nation's most storied collegiate women's volleyball programs. The [[Nebraska Cornhuskers volleyball|Nebraska women's volleyball team]] has won three [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA Women's Volleyball National Championships]], in 1995, 2000, and 2006 and has had three [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA National Runner-Up]] finishes in 1986, 1989, and 2005 as well as 5 other [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA National Semifinal (Final Four)]] appearances in 1990, 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2008 bringing the program total to 11 [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] appearances.  The Nebraska program is second only to Stanford in all-time NCAA Tournament wins, all-time NCAA Tournament winning percentage, number of [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA National Semifinal (Final Four)]] appearances, and in the number of [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA National Championships]] won.  Nebraska has made an NCAA Tournament appearance in every year of the tournament's existence except for the tournament's first year in 1981. Nebraska has had more combined [[AVCA|AVCA 1st and 2nd team All-Americans]] than any other program, tops the nation in the number of [[AVCA|AVCA 1st team All-Americans]], and has produced 4 [[AVCA|AVCA National Player of the Year]] award winners.  Nebraska also is one of only three programs east of the west coast to have won a [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|NCAA Women's Volleyball National Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;KEY=&amp;SPID=23&amp;SPSID=18| title = Nebraska volleyball history | last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nebraska volleyball is a very popular spectator sport in the state.  In 2008, [[AVCA|AVCA executive director]] Kathy DeBoer described Nebraska as &quot;the epicenter of volleyball fandom&quot;. The four largest ever NCAA volleyball crowds were in the state of Nebraska, including the largest ever crowd of 17,209 for the [[2006 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2006 National Championship]] game between Nebraska and Stanford. In 2005, an NCAA volleyball-record 13,252 tickets were pre-sold for the NCAA regionals. The vast majority of these sales are attributed to Nebraska volleyball fans, as these games were played at the [[Qwest Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=11&amp;SPID=23&amp;DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=219589| title = Omaha breaks NCAA ticket sales mark | last =  | first =  | date = December 7, 2005  | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Huskers also have the ongoing NCAA record for consecutive home sellouts in a women's sport at the [[Nebraska Coliseum]] in Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=1604564| title = Huskers Sweep Bears, 3-0 | last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4,030-seat [[Nebraska Coliseum]] has provided the Nebraska volleyball program with an unmatched home-court advantage. Nebraska has had 15 undefeated seasons at home compiling an all-time record of 454-30 (.938) under its roof. Only three times in 33 years of regular-season Big Eight/Big 12 play has a conference opponent ever won in Lincoln.

At the [[Nebraska Coliseum|Coliseum]], the Huskers are the current holders of the NCAA record for the most consecutive sellouts in a women's sport.

The [[Nebraska Coliseum]] is one of the few collegiate arenas that is designed specifically for volleyball.  It is noted for its classical architecture, intimate setting with fans close to the floor, perpetually sold-out crowds, and deafening acoustics.  The [[Nebraska Coliseum|Coliseum]] has statistically proven to be one of the most difficult venues for visiting teams to win in all of sports, has anecdotally been described as 'the arena that the volleyball gods would build', and has drawn comparisons to Duke's [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] due to its design, acoustics, and intimate atmosphere.  It has also been the subject of a CBS Sports documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;KEY=&amp;SPID=23&amp;SPSID=399| title = Nebraska Coliseum | publisher = NU athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's soccer===
Nebraska became the first team in the Big Eight to create women's soccer as a varsity sport in the 1995 season. John Walker was hired to coach the soccer team in April 1994 and was determined to get the Huskers into an NCAA tournament by 2008. During his second season, he led the Huskers to the NCAA tournament followed by an addition nine consecutive trips to the tournament, with his first miss in the 2006 season. The team has reached the Sweet sixteen eight times and to the Elite Eight on two occasions. John Walker has earned NSCAA/Umbro National Coach-of-the-Year, NSCAA/Umbro Central Region Coach-of-the-Year and Big 12 Conference Coach-of-the-Year over his tenure at Lincoln. The Husker program has created many professional athletes that went on to the WUSA.

===Cross country===
The Nebraska Cornhuskers field both a male and female cross country team coached by Jay Dirksen. They currently run on a course through Pioneer's Park in Lincoln. The men's team started in 1938 and the women's team started in 1975 as a result of title IX. The Nebraska Cornhuskers have never won a Big 12 conference championship. The only men's conference championship was in 1940 Big Six meet. The women have won the conference championship 5 times.

===Men's basketball===
{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball}}
While the University of Nebraska has experienced varying amounts of success for their intercollegiate athletic programs, men's basketball has been an exception. Nebraska has not won a conference title since sharing the [[Big Seven Conference]] with Kansas and Kansas State in 1950, and they haven't won an outright conference title since going a perfect 12&amp;ndash;0 through the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletics Association in 1916.

Nebraska is one of the few major BCS conference programs never to win a single game in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. In fact, the first trip to the NCAA Tournament for Nebraska did not come until [[1986 in sports|1986]], after 90 years. Much of the team's success came under the tenure of [[Danny Nee]], head coach from 1987 to 2000. Nee is the team's all-time winningest head coach with a record of 254&amp;ndash;190. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their six NCAA Tournament appearances, six bids to the [[National Invitation Tournament]], including the [[1996 National Invitation Tournament|1996 NIT Championship]].

The current head coach is [[Doc Sadler]]. [[Barry Collier (basketball coach)|Barry Collier]], who led Nebraska from 2000 to August 2006, left to become athletic director at [[Butler Bulldogs|Butler University]]. He previously had been Butler's head coach from 1989 to 2000.

===Women's basketball===
{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers women's basketball}}
Womenâs basketball started as a club sport in 1970 and five years later it became a varsity sport when scholarships were offered. George Nicodemus was the first head coach and had a 22-9 record in his first season, taking the Huskers to the AIAW where they lost in the second round of the tournament. Five different head coaches would be hired after Nicodemus left the program in 1971 until 1986 when Angela Beck took a stable head coach position. Beck led the Huskers to their first NCAA bid after winning the Big 8 championship in 1988. She led the Huskers back to the NCAA in 93 and 96. She left the program in 1996 to pursue other opportunities and was replaced by Paul Sanderford. Sanderford led the Huskers to a NCAA sub-regional in 1998 and 1999 and received a third consecutive NCAA bid in 2000. [[Connie Yori]] became the head coach in 2002 and has led the Huskers to WNIT in 2004, 2005, 2006, and NCAA in 2007, 2008, and [[2009â10 Nebraska Cornhuskers women's basketball team|2010]].

===Womenâs gymnastics===
{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers women's gymnastics}}
The Nebraska Womenâs Gymnastics team was first established in 1975. After the first season, the school hired head coach Karen Balke to lead a team of all freshman and sophomores for one year. Judy Schalk took over as head coach in 1977 until 1983. She led the Huskers to five conference titles and to one AIWA bid. In 1983, Rick Walton was hired to serve as head coach and led the Huskers to their first NCAA womenâs gym event title when Michele Bryant came in first place on the vault. He captured four straight Big 8 championship titles and led the huskers to the NCAAs four times in a row. After the 1993 season, Rick Walton left the program and Dan Kendig was brought in. In his first year he became the Big 12 coach of the year after leading the Huskers to a Big 8 championship. In 1997 the Huskers reached the Super Six Finals for the first time by beating #1 ranked Utah. Kendig was named national coach of the year in 1999 after earning 6 conference championships in a row. Kendig's team has won four event titles when Heather Brink won two NCAA event titles in all around and vault in 2000 and Richelle Simpson won the all around title and the floor exercise title in 2003. The huskers have never had a losing season.

===Bowling===
{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers bowling}}
Bowling has been an official varsity sport at Lincoln since the 1996-1997 season. Before bowling became a varsity sport, it was a club sport coached by Bill Straub who led the club team to two national IBC titles in 1991 and 1995. Bill Straub was hired as the full time bowling coach and has led the team to three more IBC titles in 1997, 1999 and 2001. In 2003, the NCAA created a tournament for Womenâs bowling and the Nebraska Womenâs Bowling team has been one of the top college bowling teams since the start of NCAA competition, which the Huskers won the first two national titles in a row, came in third place during the third NCAA tournament and have won three of the first six NCAA tournaments. The huskers have been ranked in the top 5 teams since 1990 and have never been ranked below 17th place. The Huskers can be seen bowling at the East Campus Bowling Lanes.

===Rifle===
{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers Rifle}}

The current coach, Gary Pepin, took over the program in 1981 and has led the women huskers to three national titles.  The NCAA started awarding the national title for Women's Track and Field in 1983, prior to that the award was given by the AIAW.

===Baseball===
{{Main|Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball}}
Nebraska baseball has seen a resurgence in the past decade. After many years of being a perennial doormat, the 2000 Huskers became the first team in school history to advance to the Super Regionals in the NCAA tournament. In 2001 and 2002, the Huskers made their first and second appearances in the [[College World Series]]. Much of the success of these teams and the teams that have followed is due to the efforts of [[Dave Van Horn]], who compiled a record of 214-92 while leading Huskers from 1998-2002. After the 2002 season, Van Horn left to accept a position at his alma mater, [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]]; assistant coach Mike Anderson became head coach. In 2005, the Huskers had their most successful season ever, going 57-15 and advancing to the College World Series for the third time in five years.

In 2002, the Huskers moved into the friendly confines of Hawks Field at [[Haymarket Park]], widely considered one of the best collegiate baseball facilities in the country. Since this move, the Huskers have seen their attendance break numerous records. In the 2005 Super Regional against Miami, an overflow crowd of 8,711 watched as Nebraska clinched their third trip to the College World Series.

While 8 pitchers from 2007 left for the draft, the 2008 Cornhuskers team is the youngest for Mike Anderson with 15 newcomers. They started off with an 11-3 record and started strong in the Big 12 winning their first 4 series. They won 7 of their 9 series going 17-9-1 in conference play. From February 29 to March 18, the Huskers earned a 14 game win streak, the longest since 2000. Like '06, they slumped at the end goin 2-4 in the postseason and losing their own regional. They went 29-5-1 at home and 11-9 away from Hawks Field. They were ranked as high as #5 and ended in 3rd place in the Big 12. Jake Opitz, Mitch Abeita, and Johnny Dorn were selected to the All Big 12 First Team&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-basebl/spec-rel/052008aac.html 2008 All-big 12 baseball awards]&lt;/ref&gt; as Dorn also earned 3rd Team All-American honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&amp;SPID=33&amp;DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=1479823 Dorn Earns Third-Team All-America Honors]&lt;/ref&gt;
