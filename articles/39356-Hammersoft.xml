Anne is also called &quot;marchioness&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry's marriage to Anne,  and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. A commoner, Anne was the daughter of [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Howard]], and  was educated in the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], largely as a [[maid of honour]] to [[Claude of France]]. She returned to [[England]] in early 1522, in order to marry her [[Ireland|Irish]] cousin [[James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond]]; however, the marriage plans ended in failure and she secured a post at court as maid of honour to Henry VIII's queen consort, [[Catherine of Aragon]].

Early in 1523 there was a secret betrothal between Anne and [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]] son of the [[Henry Algernon Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland|5th Earl of Northumberland]]. However, in January of 1524 [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] broke the betrothal, Anne was sent back home to [[Hever Castle]], and Percy was married to Lady Mary Talbot, to whom he had been betrothed since adolescence. In February/ March of 1526 Henry VIII began courtly pursuit of Anne. She resisted  his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress as her sister [[Mary Boleyn|Mary]] had. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to [[annulment|annul]] his marriage to Queen Catherine so he would be free to marry Anne.  When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] would not annul the marriage, the breaking of the power of the [[Catholic Church]] in England began. In 1532, Henry  granted her the [[Marquess of Pembroke|Marquesate of Pembroke]].

Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533 [[Thomas Cranmer]] declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage to be good and valid. Shortly afterwards, the Pope decreed sentences of [[excommunication]] against Henry and Cranmer. As a result of this marriage and these excommunications, the first break between the [[Church of England]] and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533. On 7 September she gave birth to the future [[Elizabeth I of England]]. To Henry's displeasure, however, she failed to produce a male heir. Henry was not totally discouraged, for he said that he loved Elizabeth and that a son would surely follow. Three miscarriages followed, however, and by March 1536, Henry was courting [[Jane Seymour]].

Henry had Anne investigated for [[high treason]] in April 1536. On 2 May she was arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]], where she was tried before a jury of peers and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later on Tower Green. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included [[adultery]] and [[incest]], as unconvincing. Following the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth, as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copperfieldreview.com/reviews/life_and_death_of_anne_boleyn.htm |title=Review: The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn |publisher=Copperfieldreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, she has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]]. As a result, she has retained her hold on the popular imagination. Anne has been called &quot;the most influential and important [[queen consort]] England has ever had,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, p. xv&quot;&gt;Ives, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; since she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to divorce Catherine of Aragon, and declare his independence from Rome.

==Early years==

Anne was the daughter of [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]], later [[Earl of Wiltshire]] and [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earl of Ormond]], and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Howard]], daughter of [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk]]. Thomas Boleyn was a respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of [[Henry VII of England]], who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent. A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne's date of birth. Contemporary evidence is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various historians. An Italian, writing in 1600, suggested that she had been born in 1499, while Sir [[Thomas More]]'s son-in-law, [[William Roper (biographer)|William Roper]], indicated a much later date of 1512. However her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507. As with Anne herself, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but it seems clear that her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister.&lt;ref&gt;The argument that Mary might have been the younger sister is refuted by firm evidence from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I that the surviving Boleyns knew Mary had been born before Anne, not after. See Ives, pp. 16â17 and Fraser, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser119&quot;&gt;Fraser, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Mary was married first, and by custom, the eldest daughter would be married before the younger.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Their brother [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|George]] was born some time around 1504.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, p. 9;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mary Boleyn.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne's sister [[Mary Boleyn]]]]

The academic debate about Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: 1501 and 1507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the 1501 date, while [[Retha Warnicke]], an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nellgavin.net/boleyn_links/boleynhandwriting.htm |title=Anne Boleyn's handwriting |publisher=Nellgavin.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote it in [[French language|French]] to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at [[Mechelen]], in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|contemporary Netherlands]], now [[Belgium]]. Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen at the time of its composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives's view this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a Maid of Honour, as Anne was to the regent{{citation needed|date=September 2011|reason=Maid of Honour to the regent: the regent Margaret of Austria referred to Anne as ''my little Boleyn'' but Anne, if about 7, would have stayed at Margaret of York's palace across the street of her niece Margaret of Austria's palace at which Anne would have stayed if already about 12, then about the age of Charles the later Vth, Holy Roman Emperor. Mechelen does not have a record about Anne Boleyn but does have contemporary records relating ages to homes of other young ladies at the court.}}, [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]]. This is supported by claims by      a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from [[Early Modern France|France]].&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp.18â20.&lt;/ref&gt;
These findings are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles, but the evidence does not conclusively support either date.&lt;ref&gt;The date 1507 was
accepted in Roman Catholic circles. The 16th century author [[William Camden]] inscribed a date of birth of 1507 in the margin of his ''Miscellany''. The date
was generally favoured until the late nineteenth century: in the 1880s, Paul Friedmann suggested a birth date of 1503. Art historian Hugh Paget, in 1981, first
placed Anne Boleyn at the court of Margaret of Austria. See Eric Ives's biography ''The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn'' for the most extensive arguments
favoring 1500/1501 and [[Retha Warnicke]]'s ''The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn'' for her proposal of a birth year of 1507.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne's great-grandparents included a [[Lord Mayor of London]], a [[duke]], an [[earl]], two [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] ladies, and a [[knight]]. One of
them, Geoffrey Boleyn, had been a [[merchant|mercer]] and wool merchant before becoming Lord Mayor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, p. 3&quot;&gt;Ives, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser,
pp. 116-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boleyn family originally came from [[Blickling]] in Norfolk, fifteen miles north of Norwich.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, p. 3&quot; /&gt; At the time of Anne's
birth, the Boleyn family was considered one of the most respected in the English aristocracy. Among her relatives, she numbered the Howards, one of the
pre-eminent families in the land; and one of her ancestors included King [[Edward I of England]]. According to Eric Ives, she was certainly of more noble birth
than [[Jane Seymour]], [[Catherine Howard]], and [[Catherine Parr]], Henry VIII's three other English  wives.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p.4. &quot;She was better born than Henry
VIII's three other English wives&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The spelling of the Boleyn name was variable. Sometimes it was written as ''Bullen'', hence the bull heads which
formed part of her family arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser115&quot;&gt;Fraser, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; At the court of Margaret of Austria in the Netherlands, Anne is listed as ''Boullan''.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser119&quot; /&gt; From there she signed the letter to her father as ''Anna de Boullan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, plate 14&quot;&gt;Ives, plate 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also
referred to as &quot;Anna Bolina&quot; (which is Latin); that name is in most portraits of her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, plate 14&quot; /&gt;

Anne's early education was typical for women of her class. Her academic education was limited to arithmetic, her family genealogy, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing. She developed domestic skills such as dancing, embroidery, good manners, household management, music, needlework, and singing. Anne learned to play games, such as cards, chess, and dice. She was also taught archery, falconry, horseback riding, and hunting.

===Netherlands and France===
[[File:Claude de France by Corneille de Lyon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude of France]], queen consort of Francis I. Anne served as her maid of honour for nearly seven years]]
Anne's father continued his diplomatic career under Henry VIII. In Europe Thomas Boleyn's charm won many admirers, including [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Archduchess Margaret of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. During this period, she ruled the Netherlands on her father's behalf and was so impressed with Boleyn that she offered his daughter Anne a place in her household. Ordinarily, a girl had to be twelve years old to have such an honour, but Anne may have been younger, as the Archduchess affectionately referred to her as ''&quot;la petite Boulin [sic]&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser and Ives argue that this appointment proves Anne was probably born in 1501; but Warnicke disagrees, partly on the evidence of Anne's being described as &quot;petite.&quot; See Ives, p. 19; Warnicke, pp. 12â3.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne made a good impression in the Netherlands with her manners and studiousness, Margaret reported that she was well spoken and pleasant for her young age (''&quot;son josne eaige&quot;'').&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and told Sir Thomas Boleyn that his daughter was &quot;so presentable and so pleasant, considering her youthful age, that I am more beholden to you for sending her to me, than you to me&quot; (E.W. Ives, op.cit.). Anne stayed with Margaret from spring 1513 until her father arranged for her to attend Henry VIII's sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France]], for Mary's marriage to [[Louis XII of France]] in October 1514.

In France Anne was a maid of honour to Queen Mary, and then to 15-year-old Queen Claude of France, with whom she stayed nearly seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 261â63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser_a&quot;&gt;Fraser, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Queen's household she completed her study of French and developed interests in fashion and religious philosophy. She also acquired knowledge of [[Culture of France|French culture]] and [[etiquette]].&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Though all knowledge about Anne's experiences in the French court are conjecture, even Eric Ives, in his latest edition of the biography, conjectures that she was likely to have made the acquaintance of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]]'s sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], a patron of humanists and reformers. Marguerite de Navarre was also an author in her own right, and her works include elements of Christian mysticism and reform that, but for her protection as the French king's beloved sister, verged on heresy.  She or her circle may have encouraged Anne's interest in reform, as well as in poetry and literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser_a&quot; /&gt; Anne's education in France proved itself in later years, inspiring many new trends among the ladies and courtiers of England, and it may have been instrumental in pressing their King toward the culture-shattering contretemps with the Papacy itself.  Eric Ives's latest version of his biography hypothesizes that Anne may have had evangelist conviction and a strong spiritual inner life.  William Forrest, author of a contemporary poem about [[Catherine of Aragon]], complimented Anne's &quot;passing excellent&quot; skill as a dancer. &quot;Here&quot;, he wrote, &quot;was [a] fresh young damsel, that could trip and go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne exerted a powerful charm on those who met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as &quot;not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised ... eyes, which are black and beautiful&quot;.&lt;ref name =Strong6&gt;Strong, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon GrynÃ©e wrote to [[Martin Bucer]] in September 1531 that Anne was &quot;young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion&quot;. Lancelot de Carles called her &quot;beautiful with an elegant figure&quot;, and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that she was said to be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential description of Anne,&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist [[Nicholas Sanders]] in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: &quot;Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, with black hair, and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large [[Sebaceous cyst|wen]] under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat ... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 6; Ives, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonize her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the &quot;monster legend&quot; of Anne Boleyn.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne's experience in France made her a devout [[Christian]] in the new tradition of [[Renaissance humanism]].  Anne knew little Latin but, trained at a French court, she was influenced by an âevangelical variety of French humanismâ which led her to champion the vernacular Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling 1991, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; While she would later hold the reformist position that the papacy was a corrupting influence on [[Christianity]], her conservative tendencies could be seen in her  devotion to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 219â226. For a masterful re-evaluation of Anne's religious beliefs, see Ives, pp. 277â287.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne's European education ended in 1521, when her father summoned her back to England. She sailed from [[Calais]] in January 1522.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the court of Henry VIII: 1522â1533==
Anne was recalled to marry her Irish cousin, [[James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond|James Butler]], a young man who was several years older than she was and who was living at the English court,&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earldom of Ormond]]. The [[Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond|7th Earl of Ormond]] died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland the great-great-grandson of the 3rd earl, [[Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond|Sir Piers Butler]], contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself. He was already in possession of [[Kilkenny Castle]] - the ancestral seat of the earls. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]], who spoke to King Henry about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could be the spark to ignite [[civil war]] in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James, and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt; James Butler later married Lady [[Joan Fitzgerald, Countess of Ormond|Joan Fitzgerald]], daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.

[[Mary Boleyn]], Anne Boleyn's older sister, had earlier been recalled from France in late 1519, ostensibly for her affairs with the French king and his courtiers. She married William Carey, a minor noble, in February 1520, at Greenwich, with Henry VIII in attendance: soon after, Mary Boleyn became the English King's mistress. Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity of one or both of Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. ''Henry VIII: The King and His Court'', by [[Alison Weir]], questions the paternity of Henry Carey;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weir-Henry&amp;Court&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Weir |title=Henry VIII: The King and His Court |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. G.W. Bernard (''The King's Reformation'') and Joanna Denny (''Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen'') argue that Henry VIII was their father.  Henry did not acknowledge either child, as he did his son [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Henry Fitzroy]], his illegitimate son by [[Elizabeth Blount]], Lady Talboys.

Anne made her dÃ©but at the ''Chateau Vert'' (Green Castle) pageant in honour of the imperial ambassadors on 4 March 1522, playing &quot;Perseverance.&quot; There she took part in an elaborate dance accompanying Henry's younger sister Mary, several other ladies of the court, and her sister. All wore gowns of white satin embroidered with gold thread.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 37â39.&lt;/ref&gt; She quickly established herself as one of the most stylish and accomplished women at the court, and soon a number of young men were competing for her.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 271; Ives, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Henryviiiwives}}

The American historian Retha M. Warnicke writes that Anne was &quot;the perfect woman courtier... her carriage was graceful and her French clothes were pleasing and stylish; she danced with ease, had a pleasant singing voice, played the lute and several other musical instruments well, and spoke French fluently... A remarkable, intelligent, quick-witted young noblewoman... that first drew people into conversation with her and then amused and entertained them. In short, her energy and vitality made her the center of attention in any social gathering.&quot; Henry VIII's biographer J. J. Scarisbrick adds that Anne &quot;revelled in&quot; the attention she received from her admirers.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, J. J. (1968): ''Henry VIII''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of  California Press. p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Anne was courted by [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], son of the [[Earl of Northumberland]], and entered into a secret betrothal with the young man. Thomas Wolsey's gentleman usher, [[George Cavendish (writer)|George Cavendish]], maintained the two had not been lovers. If Cavendish is to be believed, it may be that their relationship wasn't sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp. 126â7; Ives, p. 67 and p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The romance was broken off when Percy's father refused to support their engagement. According to Cavendish, Anne was sent from court to her family's countryside estates, but it is not known for how long. Upon her return to court, she again entered the service of Catherine of Aragon.

The distinguished courtier-poet [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]] grew up at Allington, an estate nearly adjoining the Boleyn family's estate at [[Hever Castle]] in Kent.  Wyatt was estranged from his own wife, and unverifiable romantic legends about Anne and him abound, particularly in the writings of Wyatt's grandson.  There is conjecture that some of the most yearning poetry attributed to Wyatt was inspired by their relationship and that it is Anne whom he describes in the sonnet ''Whoso List to Hunt'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nellgavin.com/ThomasWyatt/ |title=Full text of the poem '&amp;#39;Whoso List to Hunt'&amp;#39; |publisher=Nellgavin.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as unobtainable, headstrong, and belonging to the King: &quot;''noli me tangere'' for Caesar's I am/And wild for to hold though I seem tame&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526 King Henry became enamoured with her and began his pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say that Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, often leaving court for the seclusion of Hever Castle.  But within a year, he proposed marriage to her, and she accepted. Both  assumed an annulment could be obtained within a matter of months. There is no evidence to suggest that they engaged in a sexual relationship until very shortly before their marriage; Henry's love letters to Anne seem to suggest that their love affair remained unconsummated for much of their seven year courtship. However, Anne was pregnant by the time of her marriage.

===Henry's annulment===
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|thumb|upright|Late Elizabethan portrait of Anne Boleyn, possibly derived from a lost original of 1533â36.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 42â43; Strong, pp. 6â7.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

It is probable that the idea of annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) had suggested itself to Henry much earlier than this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the legitimacy of the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry's father [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] ascended the throne, England was beset by [[Wars of the Roses|civil warfare]] over rival claims to the crown and Henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except [[Mary I of England|Mary]] died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine of Aragon had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage.  Spain and England had, at that time, still wanted a union of their kingdoms, and, in 1509, Henry and Catherine were wed.  But this marriage could not take place until the Pope had ruled about a passage in the [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 20:21, which seems to forbid the marriage of a man to his brother's widow lest he and the widow be cursed.  The Pope ruled that the passage was inapplicable as Arthur had not had relations with Catherine and so the Pope issued a [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] to that effect.  However some years and a new Pope later, Henry was re-thinking things.  Prodded by Catherine's inability to provide an heir, and possibly by Anne herself, Henry decided that no Pope had a right to overrule the Bible. This meant that he had been living in sin with Catherine of Aragon all these years, though Catherine hotly contested this and refused to concede that her marriage to Arthur had been consummated. It also meant that his daughter Mary was a bastard, and that the new Pope ([[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]) must admit the previous Pope's mistake and annul his marriage. Henry's quest for an annulment became euphemistically known as the &quot;King's Great Matter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne saw an opportunity in Henry's infatuation and the convenient moral quandary. She determined that she would yield to his embraces only as his acknowledged queen.  She began to take her place at his side in policy and in state, but not, at least not just yet, in his bed.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Confusing the issue of whether or not Anne and Henry had a sexual relationship, is the fact that there is no doubt that Anne was pregnant with Elizabeth (born on 7 September 1533) when she and Henry hastily and secretly wed in order to be married when Anne was crowned queen in May, 1533, since any child born before she was queen would not be able to succeed to the throne.

Various are the opinions of scholars and historians as to how deep was Anne's commitment to the Reformation, how much was she perhaps only personally ambitious, and how much she had to do with Henry's defiance of Papal power. There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer [[George Wyatt (writer)|George Wyatt]] by her former lady-in-waiting [[Anne Gainsford]],&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; that Anne brought to Henry's attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps Tyndale's &quot;The Obedience of the Christian Man&quot; or one  by [[Simon Fish]] called &quot;Supplication for Beggars,&quot; which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Marie Dowling &quot;Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural pietyâ and is believed to have reproved her cousin, [[Mary Shelton]], for âhaving âidle poesiesâ written in her prayer book.â&lt;ref&gt;Dowling 1986, 232&lt;/ref&gt; If [[House of Cavendish|Cavendish]] is to be believed, Anne's outrage at Wolsey may have personalized whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France.  Further, the most recent edition of [[Eric Ives|Ives]]'s biography admits that Anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on, not just as catalyst but expediter for Henry's Reformation, though the process took a number of years.

In 1528 [[sweating sickness]] broke out with great severity. In London the mortality rate was great and the court was dispersed. Henry left London, frequently changing his residence; Anne Boleyn retreated to the Boleyn residence at Hever Castle, but contracted the illness; her brother-in-law, William Carey, died. Henry sent his own physician to [[Hever Castle]] to care for her,&lt;ref&gt;Starkey p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly afterwards, she recovered. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment from Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Brigden, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry had set his hopes upon a direct appeal to the [[Holy See]], acting independently of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]], to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans related to Anne. In 1527 [[William Knight (statesman)|William Knight]], the King's secretary, had been sent to [[Pope Clement VII]] to sue for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, on the grounds that the dispensing [[papal bull|bull]] of [[Pope Julius II]] permitting him to marry his brother's widow, Catherine, had been obtained under false pretences. Henry also petitioned, in the event of his becoming free, a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in the first degree of affinity, whether the affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection. This clearly referred to Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michel Sittow 002.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Catherine of Aragon]], Henry's first wife and queen]]

As the Pope was, at that time, prisoner of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], as a result of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in May 1527, Knight had some difficulty obtaining access. In the end he had to return with a conditional dispensation, which Wolsey insisted was technically insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 308â12.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry had now no choice but to put his great matter into the hands of Wolsey, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 314, 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolsey went so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England, with a special emissary, Lorenzo Campeggio, from the Pope himself to decide the matter. But the Pope never had empowered his deputy to make any decision.  The Pope was still a veritable hostage of Charles V, and Charles V was the loyal nephew of Henry's queen, Catherine.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pope forbade Henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in Rome, not in England. Convinced that Wolsey's loyalties lay with the Pope, not England, Anne, as well as Wolsey's many enemies, ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529. [[George Cavendish (writer)|George Cavendish]], Wolsey's chamberlain, records that the servants who waited on the king and Anne at dinner in 1529 in Grafton heard her say that the dishonour that Wolsey had brought upon the realm would have cost any other Englishman his head. Henry replied, &quot;Why then I perceive...you are not the Cardinal's friend.&quot; Henry finally agreed to Wolsey's arrest on grounds of ''[[praemunire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 430â33.&lt;/ref&gt; Had it not been for his death from illness in 1530, he might have been executed for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, 88â95.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later in 1531 (fully two years before Henry's marriage to Anne), Queen Catherine was banished from court and her rooms were given to Anne.

Public support, however, remained with Queen Catherine. One evening in the autumn of 1531, Anne was dining at a manor house on the river Thames and was almost seized by a crowd of angry women. Anne just managed to escape by boat.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Warham]] died in 1532, the Boleyn family chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], was appointed, with papal approval.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, pp. 21â22; Starkey, pp. 467â73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1532 [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] brought before [[List of Parliaments of England|Parliament]] a number of acts including the [[Supplication against the Ordinaries]] and [[Submission of the Clergy]], which recognised [[Acts of Supremacy|royal supremacy]] over the church, thus finalizing the break with Rome. Following these acts, [[Thomas More]] resigned as Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister.&lt;ref&gt;Williams p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Anne Boleyn was able to grant petitions, receive diplomats, give patronage and had enormous influence over her future husband to plead the cause of foreign diplomats. The ambassador from Milan wrote in 1531 that it was essential to have her approval if one wanted to influence the English government, a view corroborated by an earlier French ambassador in 1529.

During this period, Anne Boleyn did indeed play an important role in England's international position by solidifying an alliance with France. She established an excellent rapport with the French [[ambassador]], [[Gilles de la Pommeraie]]. Anne and Henry attended a meeting with the French king at Calais in winter 1532, in which Henry hoped to enlist the support of [[Francis I of France]] for his intended marriage.  On 1 September 1532, Henry  granted her ''[[suo jure]]'' the [[Marquess of Pembroke|Marquessate of Pembroke]], an appropriate peerage for a future Queen;&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 158â59, p. 388 ''n''32, p. 389 ''n''53; Warnicke, p. 116. Contemporary documents call her ''marquess'' or ''lady marquess'' of Pembroke; this reflects Tudor spelling.  Marquesates were relatively new in sixteenth century England, and the English translations of French ''marquis''/''marquise'' were spelled even less stably than most Tudor orthography and many forms were used for either. A male peer was ''Marquys'', ''marquoys'', ''marquess'' and so on; his wife would be ''marquess'', ''marquesse'', ''marquisess'' and so on, the same ending as [[Duchess]]; the resulting confusion was sometimes clarified by such phrases as ''lady marquess''; the modern distinction, by which the wife is [[Marchioness]], was imported from Latin in her daughter's reign. The ''OED'' and the [[Complete Peerage]] (Vol X., p. 402) take Boleyn's title as the feminine sense of ''marquess''; some biographers, such as Fraser, p. 184, take it as the male sense.&lt;/ref&gt; as such she became a rich and important woman: The three Dukes and two Marquesses who existed in 1532 were the King's brother-in-law, the King's bastard, and other descendants of royalty; she ranked above all other peeresses. The Pembroke lands and the title of [[Earl of Pembroke]] had been held by Henry's great-uncle,&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; and Henry performed the investiture himself.&lt;ref&gt;Wooding, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry VIII of England, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Henry VIII'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1536]]

Anne's family also profited from the relationship. Her father, already Viscount Rochford, was created [[Earl of Wiltshire]]. Henry also came to an arrangement with Anne's Irish cousin and created him [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earl of Ormond]]. At the magnificent banquet to celebrate her father's elevation, Anne took precedence over the Duchesses of Suffolk and Norfolk, seated in the place of honour beside the King which was usually occupied by the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Anne's intervention, her widowed sister Mary received an annual [[pension]] of Â£100, and Mary's son, [[Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon|Henry Carey]], was educated at a prestigious [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery.

The conference at Calais was something of a political triumph, but even though the French government gave implicit support for Henry's re-marriage and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] himself held private conference with Anne, the French King maintained alliances with the Pope which he could not explicitly defy.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after returning to [[Dover]], Henry and Anne married in a secret ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 462â464.&lt;/ref&gt;  She soon became pregnant and, to legalise the first wedding considered to be unlawful at the time, there was a second wedding service, also private in accordance with The Royal Book,&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, Six Wives p.463.&lt;/ref&gt; which took place in London on 25 January 1533. Events now began to move at a quick pace. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer (who had been hastened, with the Pope's assent, into the position of Archbishop of Canterbury recently vacated by the convenient death of [[William Warham|Warham]]) sat in judgment at a special court convened at [[Dunstable Priory]] to rule on the validity of the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon.  He thereupon declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void.  Five days later, on 28 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.124.&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
[[File:John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|''Bishop John Fisher'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]. Fisher refused to recognise Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn]]

Catherine was formally stripped of her title as Queen and Anne was consequently crowned [[List of English consorts|queen consort]] on 1 June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at [[Westminster Abbey]] with a banquet afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the last Queen Consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband. Unlike any other queen consort, Anne was crowned with [[St Edward's Crown|St Edward's crown]], which had previously been used to crown only a reigning monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Alice  Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne's pregnancy was visible by then and she was carrying the heir who was presumed to be male.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;Alice Hunt, ''The Drama of Coronation: Medieval Ceremony in Early Modern England'', Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On the previous day, Anne had taken part in an [[Royal Entry|elaborate procession]] through the streets of London seated in a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]] of &quot;white cloth of gold&quot; that rested on two [[palfrey]]s clothed to the ground in white damask, while the barons of the [[Cinque Ports]] held a canopy of cloth of gold over her head. In accordance with tradition she wore white, and on her head a gold coronet beneath which her long dark hair hung down freely.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 177; Starkey, pp. 489â500&lt;/ref&gt; The public's response to her appearance was lukewarm.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, pp. 191â194&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] had forbidden all appeals to Rome and exacted the penalties of ''[[praemunire]]'' against all who introduced papal bulls into England. It was only then that Pope Clement at last took the step of announcing a provisional sentence of [[excommunication]] against the King and Cranmer. He condemned the marriage to Anne, and in March 1534, he declared the marriage to Catherine legal and again ordered Henry to return to her.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, pp. 414â18; Haigh, pp. 117â18&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry now required his subjects to swear the oath attached to the [[First Succession Act]], which effectively rejected papal authority in legal matters and recognised Anne Boleyn as queen. Those who refused, such as Sir [[Thomas More]], who had resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, were then placed in the [[Tower of London]]. In late 1534 parliament declared Henry &quot;the only supreme head on earth of the Church of England&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh, pp. 118â20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church in England was now under Henry's control, not Rome's.

===Struggle for a son===
After her coronation, Anne settled into a quiet routine at the King's favourite residence, [[Palace of Placentia|Greenwich Palace]], to prepare for the birth of her baby. The child was born slightly premature on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Howard]] and Henry's mother, [[Elizabeth of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp.128-131.&lt;/ref&gt; But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the pre-prepared letters announcing the birth of a ''prince'' had an ''s'' hastily added to them to read ''princes[s]'' and the traditional tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;David Starkey: Six Wives, 2003, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=77567 Letter by Chapuys to the Emperor, 10th July 1533]&quot;the King's mistress (amie) was delivered of a daughter, to the great regret both of him and the lady, and to the great reproach of the physicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and sorceresses, who affirmed that it would be a male child&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Palace of Placentia.jpg|thumb|left|Greenwich Palace, after a 17th-century drawing]]

Nevertheless the infant princess was given a splendid christening, but Anne feared that Catherine's daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], now stripped of her title of princess and labelled a [[bastard (Law of England and Wales)|bastard]], posed a threat to Elizabeth's position. Henry soothed his wife's fears by separating Mary from her many servants and sending her to [[Hatfield House]], where Princess Elizabeth would be living with her own sizeable staff of servants, and where the country air was thought better for the baby's health.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne frequently visited her daughter at Hatfield and other residences.&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, pp. 5â6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new queen had a larger staff of servants than Catherine. There were over 250 servants to tend to her personal needs, everyone from priests to stable-boys. There were over 60 maids-of-honour who served her and accompanied her to social events. She also employed several priests who acted as her [[confession|confessors]], [[chaplain]]s, and religious advisers. One of these was [[Matthew Parker]], who would become one of the chief architects of [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] thought during the reign of Anne's daughter Elizabeth I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parkerweb.stanford.edu/parker/actions/page.do?forward=aboutparker&amp;section=parker |title=About Matthew Parker &amp; The Parker Library |publisher=Parkerweb.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strife with the king===
[[File:Henry's reconciliation with Anne Boleyn cph.3g08965.jpg|thumb|Henry's reconciliation with Anne Boleyn, by [[George Cruikshank]], 19th century.]]
The king and his new queen enjoyed a reasonably happy accord with periods of calm and affection. Anne Boleyn's sharp intelligence, political acumen and forward manners, although desirable in a mistress, were unacceptable in a wife. She was once reported to have spoken to her uncle in words that &quot;shouldn't be used to a dog&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser&quot;&gt;Fraser.&lt;/ref&gt; After a stillbirth or miscarriage as early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the possibility of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine.&lt;ref name=will138&gt;Williams, p.138.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing came of the issue as the royal couple reconciled and spent summer 1535 on progress. By October, she was again pregnant.

Anne Boleyn presided over a magnificent court. She spent lavish amounts of money on gowns, jewels, head-dresses, ostrich-feather fans, riding equipment, furniture and upholstery, maintaining the ostentatious display required by her status. Numerous palaces were renovated to suit her and Henry's extravagant tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 231â260.&lt;/ref&gt; Her motto was &quot;The most happy&quot;, and she had chosen a white falcon as her [[personal device]].

Anne was blamed for the tyranny of her husband's government and was referred to by some of her subjects as &quot;The king's whore&quot; or a &quot;naughty paike [prostitute]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals'', p.67. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0-7394-2025-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion turned further against her following her failure to produce a son. It sank even lower after the executions of her enemies [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and [[John Fisher|Bishop John Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp.137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downfall and execution: 1536==
[[File:Jane Seymour. Workshop of Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jane Seymour]] became Henry's third wife shortly after Anne's execution]]

On 8 January 1536, news of Catherine of Aragon's death reached the King and Anne. Hearing of her death, they were overjoyed. The following day, Henry and Anne wore yellow, the symbol of joy and celebration in England, from head to toe, and celebrated Catherine's death with festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 549â51; Scarisbrick, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the home country of Catherine of Aragon, yellow is the colour of mourning, in addition to black.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cobham Brewer 1810â1897. Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the wearing of yellow by Henry and Anne may have been a symbol of mourning. With Princess Mary's mother dead, Anne, for her part, attempted to make peace with her.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen, pregnant again, was aware of the dangers if she failed to give birth to a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality. Mary rebuffed Anne's overtures, perhaps because of rumours circulating that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne and/or Henry. These began after the discovery during her embalming that her heart was blackened. Modern medical experts are in agreement that this was not the result of poisoning, but of [[Heart cancer|cancer of the heart]], something which was not understood at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraser&quot; /&gt;

Later that month, the King was unhorsed in a tournament and knocked unconscious for two hours, a worrying incident that Anne believed led to her miscarriage five days later.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day that Catherine of Aragon was buried at [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]], Anne miscarried a baby which, according to the imperial ambassador [[Eustace Chapuys|Chapuys]], she had borne for about three and a half months, and which &quot;seemed to be a male child&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scarisbrick, pp. 452â53; Starkey, pp. 552â53.&lt;/ref&gt; For Chapuys, this personal loss was the beginning of the end of the royal marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Starkey, pp. 553â54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given Henry's desperate desire for a son, the sequence of Anne's pregnancies has attracted much interest. Author Mike Ashley speculated that Anne had two stillborn children after Elizabeth's birth and before the male child she miscarried in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources attest only to the birth of Elizabeth in September 1533, a possible miscarriage in the summer of 1534, and the miscarriage of a male child, of almost four months gestation, in January 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As Anne recovered from her miscarriage, Henry declared that he had been seduced into the marriage by means of &quot;sortilege&quot;âa French term indicating either &quot;deception&quot; or &quot;spells&quot;. His new mistress, [[Jane Seymour]], was quickly moved into royal quarters. This was followed by Anne's brother being refused a prestigious court honour, the [[Order of the Garter]], given instead to Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charges of adultery, incest and treason===
[[File:Cromwell,Thomas(1EEssex)01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]], Anne's one-time strong ally, with whom she clashed over foreign policy and the redistribution of church wealth. Portrait by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''c''. 1532.]]

According to author and Tudor historian [[Alison Weir]], [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] plotted Anne's downfall while feigning illness and detailing the plot 20â21 April 1536.  Anne's biographer [[Eric Ives]], among others, believes that her fall and execution were engineered by Thomas Cromwell.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 319â329. See also Starkey, pp. 559â569, and Elton, pp. 252â53, who share this view.&lt;/ref&gt; The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell thereafter indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne; evidence of this is seen in the Spanish Chronicle and through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V. Anne differed with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy. She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance. Cromwell insisted on filling the King's depleted coffers, while taking a cut for himself, and preferred an imperial alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, pp. 309â16.&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, suggests Ives, &quot;Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Cromwell's biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that &quot;not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne ... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, pp. 106â108. Schofield claims that evidence for the power struggle between Anne and Cromwell which &quot;now dominates many modern accounts of Anne's last weeks&quot; comprises &quot;fly-by-night stories from Alesius and the ''Spanish Chronicle'', words of Chapuys taken out of context and an untrustworthy translation of the ''Calendar of State Papers''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry's case against Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, pp. 212, 242; Wooding, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Retha Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have manipulated the king in such a matter.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, pp. 210â212. Warnicke observes: &quot;Neither Chapuys nor modern historians have explained why if the secretary [Cromwell] could manipulate Henry into agreeing to the execution of Anne, he could not simply persuade the king to ignore her advice on foreign policy&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clearly, he was bent on undoing her by any means.&quot; Scarisbrick, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; The result, historians agree, was a legal travesty.&lt;ref&gt;Wooding, pp. 194â95; Scarisbrick, pp. 454â55; Fraser, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to do so the Master Secretary Cromwell would need sufficient evidence that would be convincing enough for her conviction or risk his own offices and perhaps life.

Towards the end of April a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] musician in Anne's service named [[Mark Smeaton]] was arrested, perhaps [[torture]]d or promised freedom. He initially denied being the Queen's lover but later confessed. Another courtier, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Sir Henry Norris]], was arrested on [[May Day]], but since he was an aristocrat, he could not be tortured.  Prior to his arrest, Norris was treated kindly by the King, who offered him his own horse to use on the May Day festivities. It seems likely that during the festivities the King was notified of Smeaton's confession and it was shortly thereafter the alleged conspirators were arrested upon order of the King. Norris was arrested at the festival. Norris denied his guilt and swore that Queen Anne was innocent. One of the most damaging pieces of evidence against Norris was an overheard conversation with Anne at the end of April, where she accused him of coming  often to her chambers not to pay court to her lady-in-waiting [[Margaret and Mary Shelton|Madge Shelton]] but to herself. [[Francis Weston|Sir Francis Weston]] was arrested two days later on the same charge. [[William Brereton (groom)|Sir William Brereton]], a Groom of the King's Privy Chamber, was also apprehended on grounds of adultery. [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], a poet and friend of the Boleyns who was allegedly infatuated with her before her marriage to the king, was also imprisoned for the same charge but was later released, most likely due to his friendship or his family's friendship with Cromwell. [[Sir Richard Page]] was also accused of having a sexual relationship with the Queen, but he was acquitted of all charges after further investigation could not implicate him with Anne. {{citation needed|date=February 2011}}  The final accused was Queen Anne's own brother, arrested on charges of [[incest]] and [[treason]], accused of having a sexual relationship with his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp.143-144.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|George Boleyn]] was accused of two incidents of incest: November, 1535 at Whitehall and the following month at Eltham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, p. 344&quot;&gt;Ives, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1536 Anne was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. In the Tower, she collapsed, demanding to know the location of her father and &quot;swete broder&quot;, as well as the charges against her.
In what is reputed to be her last letter to King Henry, dated May 6, she wrote:{{quote|&quot;Sir,

Your Grace's displeasure, and my imprisonment are things so strange unto me, as what to write, or what to excuse, I am altogether ignorant. Whereas you send unto me (willing me to confess a truth, and so obtain your favour) by such an one, whom you know to be my ancient professed enemy. I no sooner received this message by him, than I rightly conceived your meaning; and if, as you say, confessing a truth indeed may procure my safety, I shall with all willingness and duty perform your demand.

But let not your Grace ever imagine, that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where not so much as a thought thereof preceded. And to speak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn: with which name and place I could willingly have contented myself, if God and your Grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so far forget myself in my exaltation or received Queenship, but that I always looked for such an alteration as I now find; for the ground of my preferment being on no surer foundation than your Grace's fancy, the least alteration I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other object. You have chosen me, from a low estate, to be your Queen and companion, far beyond my desert or desire. If then you found me worthy of such honour, good your Grace let not any light fancy, or bad council of mine enemies, withdraw your princely favour from me; neither let that stain, that unworthy stain, of a disloyal heart toward your good grace, ever cast so foul a blot on your most dutiful wife, and the infant-princess your daughter. Try me, good king, but let me have a lawful trial, and let not my sworn enemies sit as my accusers and judges; yea let me receive an open trial, for my truth shall fear no open flame; then shall you see either my innocence cleared, your suspicion and conscience satisfied, the ignominy and slander of the world stopped, or my guilt openly declared. So that whatsoever God or you may determine of me, your grace may be freed of an open censure, and mine offense being so lawfully proved, your grace is at liberty, both before God and man, not only to execute worthy punishment on me as an unlawful wife, but to follow your affection, already settled on that party, for whose sake I am now as I am, whose name I could some good while since have pointed unto, your Grace being not ignorant of my suspicion therein. But if you have already determined of me, and that not only my death, but an infamous slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired happiness; then I desire of God, that he will pardon your great sin therein, and likewise mine enemies, the instruments thereof, and that he will not call you to a strict account of your unprincely and cruel usage of me, at his general judgment-feat, where both you and myself must shortly appear, and in whole judgment I doubt not (whatsoever the world may think of me) mine innocence shall be openly known, and sufficiently cleared. My last and only request shall be, that myself may only bear the burden of your Grace's displeasure, and that it may not touch the innocent souls of those poor gentlemen, who (as I understand) are likewise in strait imprisonment for my sake. If ever I found favour in your sight, if ever the name of Anne Boleyn hath been pleasing in your ears, then let me obtain this request, and I will so leave to trouble your Grace any further, with mine earnest prayers to the Trinity to have your Grace in his good keeping, and to direct you in all your actions. From my doleful prison in the Tower, this sixth of May;

Your most loyal and ever faithful wife,
Anne Boleyn&quot;}}

Four of the accused men were tried in [[Westminster]] on 12 May 1536. Weston, Brereton, and Norris publicly maintained their innocence and only the tortured Smeaton supported [[the Crown]] by pleading guilty. Three days later, Anne and George Boleyn were tried separately in the Tower of London. She was accused of adultery, incest, and [[high treason]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp.54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Treason Act of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] adultery on the part of a queen was a form of treason (presumably because of the implications for the succession to the throne) for which the penalty was hanging, drawing and quartering for a man and burning alive for a woman, but the accusations, and especially that of incestuous adultery, were also designed to impugn her moral character. The other form of treason alleged against her was that of plotting the king's death, with her &quot;lovers&quot;, so that she might later marry Henry Norris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, p. 344&quot;
/&gt; [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy]], 6th Earl of Northumberland sat on the jury that found Anne guilty. When the verdict was announced, he collapsed and had to be carried from the courtroom. He died eight months later, leaving no heirs and his nephew became the next Earl of Northumberland.

On 14 May, Cranmer declared Anne's marriage to Henry dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;David Starkey, p.581, ''Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final hours===
[[File:Anne Boleyn London Tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Anne Boleyn in the Tower by [[Edouard Cibot]] (1799 - 1877)]]
Although the evidence against them was unconvincing, the accused were found guilty under the law and condemned to death by a jury of their peers. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. Anthony Kingston, the keeper of the Tower, reported Anne seemed very happy and ready to be done with life. The King commuted Anne's sentence from burning to beheading and employed a swordsman from [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] for the execution, rather than having a queen beheaded with the common axe. They came for Anne on the morning of 19 May to take her to the [[Tower Green]].&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp.58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Kingston]], the [[Constable of the Tower]], wrote:

{{quote|This morning she sent for me, that I might be with her at such time as she received the good Lord, to the intent I should hear her speak as touching her innocency alway to be clear. And in the writing of this she sent for me, and at my coming she said, 'Mr. Kingston, I hear I shall not die afore noon, and I am very sorry therefore, for I thought to be dead by this time and past my pain.' I told her it should be no pain, it was so little. And then she said, 'I heard say the executioner was very good, and I have a little neck,' and then put her hands about it, laughing heartily. I have seen many men and also women executed, and that they have been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has much joy in death. Sir, her [[almoner]] is continually with her, and had been since two o'clock after midnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert, p.59&quot;&gt;Hibbert, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, her impending death may have caused her great sorrow for some time during her imprisonment. The poem &quot;[[Oh Death Rock Me Asleep]]&quot; is generally believed to have been authored by Anne and reveals that she may have hoped death would end her suffering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elfinspell.com/Boleynstyle.html O Death! rocke me asleep] Sources differ whether George or Anne Boleyne wrote it, [http://www.poetry-online.org/boleyn_anne_o_death_rock_me_asleep.htm O Death Rock Me Asleep] though the consensus is that Anne wrote it. [http://jack-of-all-trades.ca/meandmine/advance6.html O Death Rock Me Asleep].&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before dawn, she called Kingston to hear mass with her, and swore in his presence, on the eternal salvation of her soul, upon the Holy Sacraments, that she had never been unfaithful to the king. She ritually repeated this oath both immediately before and after receiving the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p356&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of Friday 19 May, Anne Boleyn was judicially executed, not upon Tower Green, but rather, a scaffold erected on the north side of the White Tower, in front of what is now the Waterloo Barracks.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 423, based on the contemporary Lisle letters.&lt;/ref&gt; She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by two female attendants, Anne made her final walk from the Queen's House to the scaffold and she showed a &quot;devilish spirit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; and looked &quot;as gay as if she was not going to die&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne climbed the scaffold and made a short speech to the crowd:

{{quote|Good Christian people, I am come hither to die, for according to the law, and by the law I am judged to die, and therefore I will speak nothing against it. I am come hither to accuse no man, nor to speak anything of that, whereof I am accused and condemned to die, but I pray God save the king and send him long to reign over you, for a gentler nor a more merciful prince was there never: and to me he was ever a good, a gentle and sovereign lord. And if any person will meddle of my cause, I require them to judge the best. And thus I take my leave of the world and of you all, and I heartily desire you all to pray for me. O Lord have mercy on me, to God I commend my soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert, p.59&quot; /&gt;}}

This is one version of her speech, written by Lancelot de Carles in Paris, a few weeks following her death; he had been in London, but did not witness either trial or execution. All the accounts are similar, and undoubtedly correct to varying degrees. It is thought that she avoided  criticizing Henry to save Elizabeth and her family from further consequences, but even under such extreme pressure Anne did not confess guilt, in fact subtly implying her innocence, in her appeal to historians who &quot;will meddle of my cause&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Death and burial===
[[File:Thomas Cranmer by Gerlach Flicke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Cranmer]], who was the sole supporter of Anne in the council.]]

She knelt upright, in the French style of executions. Her final prayer consisted of her repeating continually, &quot;To Jesus Christ I commend my soul; Lord Jesus receive my soul.&quot; Her ladies removed her headdress and necklaces, and then tied a blindfold over her eyes. Anne Boleyn was executed by French expert swordsman [[Jean Rombaud]]. According to Eric W. Ives, Rombaud was so taken by Anne that he was shaken. Rombaud found it so difficult to proceed with the execution that in order to distract her and for her to position her head correctly, he may have shouted, &quot;Where is my sword?&quot; just before killing her.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, p.257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn: The Most Happy (new ed. 2004) {{page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The execution consisted of a single stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p.60.&lt;/ref&gt; It was witnessed by Thomas Cromwell, [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]],  the King's illegitimate son, [[Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond|Henry Fitzroy]], the Lord Mayor of London, as well as aldermen, sheriffs, and representatives of the various craft guilds. Most of the King's Council were also present.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Marie Louise (1973). ''Anne Boleyn''. New York: Warner Paperback Library Edition. p.333&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer, who was at [[Lambeth Palace]], was reported to have broken down in tears after telling [[Alexander Ales]]: &quot;She who has been the Queen of England on earth will today become a Queen in heaven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; When the charges were first brought against Anne, Cranmer had expressed his astonishment to Henry and his belief that &quot;she should not be culpable.&quot; Still, Cranmer felt vulnerable because of his closeness to the queen. On the night before the execution, he had declared Henry's marriage to Anne to have been void, like Catherine's before her. He made no serious attempt to save Anne's life, although some sources record that he had prepared her for death by hearing her last private confession of sins, in which she had stated her innocence before God.&lt;ref name=schama&gt;Schama, p.307.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the day of her death a Scottish friend found Cranmer weeping uncontrollably in his London gardens, saying that he was sure that Anne had now gone to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, pp. 149â159&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry failed to have organised any kind of funeral or even provide a proper coffin for her.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Her body lay on the scaffold for some time before a man (believed to be working inside the Tower) found an empty arrow chest and placed her head and body inside.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} She was then buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of [[St. Peter ad Vincula (London)|St Peter ad Vincula]]. Her skeleton was identified during renovations of the chapel in the reign of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and Anne's resting place is now marked in the marble floor.

==Recognition and legacy==
Nicholas Sander, a Roman Catholic [[recusancy|recusant]] born c. 1530, was committed to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Roman Catholicism in England. In his ''De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani'' (''The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism''), published in 1585, he was the first to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, pp. 58â9.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3&quot;, with finely formed, tapering fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, p. 26, Google Books, retrieved on 17 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Boleyn was described by contemporaries as intelligent and gifted in musical arts and scholarly pursuits. She was also strong-willed and proud, and often quarreled with Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Warnicke, pp. 58â9; Graves, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Eric Ives evaluates the apparent contradictions in Anne's persona:

{{quote|To us she appears inconsistentâreligious yet aggressive, calculating yet emotional, with the light touch of the courtier yet the strong grip of the politicianâbut is this what she was, or merely what we strain to see through the opacity of the evidence? As for her inner life, short of a miraculous cache of new material, we shall never really know. Yet what does come to us across the centuries is the impression of a person who is strangely appealing to the early twenty-first century: A woman in her own rightâtaken on her own terms in a man's world; a woman who mobilized her education, her style and her presence to outweigh the disadvantages of her sex; of only moderate good looks, but taking a court and a king by storm. Perhaps, in the end, it is Thomas Cromwell's assessment that comes nearest: intelligence, spirit and courage.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Queen Anne Boleyn 2.jpg|thumb|upright|A 17th-century portrait incorrectly identified as Anne Boleyn by a later inscription on the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pourbus/frans_y/portlady.html |title=Portrait of an Italian Lady by POURBUS, Frans the Younger |publisher=Wga.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

No contemporary portraits of Anne Boleyn survive. The only likeness is a medal struck in 1534 to commemorate her second pregnancy, though it appears to be severely damaged.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Following the coronation of her daughter as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]], who argued that Anne had saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism and that God had provided proof of her innocence and virtue by making sure her daughter Elizabeth I became Queen [[regnant]]. An example of Anne's direct influence in the reformed church is what Alexander Ales described to Queen Elizabeth as the &quot;evangelical bishops whom your holy mother appointed from among those scholars who favoured the purer doctrine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, p.261, Google Books, retrieved on 5 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]]. As a result, she has remained in the popular memory and Anne has been called &quot;the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ives, p. xv&quot; /&gt;

==Legends==
Many legends and fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. One is that she was secretly buried in [[Salle, Norfolk|Salle]] Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her Boleyn ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Norah Lofts, ''Anne Boleyn'', p.181&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. Another is that her heart, at her request,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Suffolk | first =Churches| title = St Mary's Erwarton| url=http://www.suffolkchurches.co.uk/erwarton.html | accessdate = 2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  was buried in [[Erwarton]] (Arwarton) Church, [[Suffolk]] by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Any Village | first =| title = Erwarton, Suffolk| url=http://www.any-village.com/UK/England/Suffolk/Erwarton/home.aspx | accessdate = 2009-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18th century [[Sicily]] the peasants of [[Nicolosi]] believed that Anne Boleyn, for having made Henry VIII a heretic, was condemned to burn for eternity inside [[Mount Etna]]. This legend was often told for the benefit of foreign travellers.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Michael (2005). ''Nelson's Duchy, A Sicilian Anomaly''. UK: Spellmount Limited. p.48 ISBN 1-86227-326-X&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of people have claimed to have seen Anne's [[ghost]] at [[Hever Castle]], [[Blickling Hall]], Salle Church, Tower of London, and [[Marwell Wildlife|Marwell Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Lofts, ''Anne Boleyn'', p.182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/ghost342.html |title=Ghosts and Hauntings |publisher=The Shadowlands |date= |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zurichmansion.org/halls/marwell.html|title=Marwell Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous account of her reputed sighting has been described by [[paranormal|paranormal researcher]] [[Hans Holzer]]. In 1864, Major General J.D. Dundas of the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps|60th Rifles]] regiment was quartered in the Tower of London. As he was looking out the window of his quarters, he noticed a guard below in the courtyard, in front of the lodgings where Anne had been imprisoned, behaving strangely. He appeared to challenge something, which to the General &quot;looked like a whitish, female figure sliding towards the soldier&quot;. The guard charged through the form with his bayonet, then fainted.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Holzer, ''Ghosts I've Met'', p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Only the General's testimony and corroboration at the [[court-martial]] saved the guard from a lengthy prison sentence for having fainted while on duty. In 1960, Canon [[W. S. Pakenham-Walsh]], vicar of [[Sulgrave]], [[Northamptonshire]], reported having conversations with Boleyn.&lt;ref name=sydney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19600731&amp;id=alsVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HuYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2757,4559585 |title=Vicar Who 'Talked' to Henry VIII  |accessdate=12 October 2009 |work= |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date= 31 July 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
