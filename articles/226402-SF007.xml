'''Guido van Rossum''' (born 31 January&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2007-January/070849.html (Python-Dev) Happy Birthday, Guido!], Guido van Rossum, January 31 17:00:29 CET 2007, Python-Dev mailing list&lt;/ref&gt; 1956{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[computer programmer]] who is best known as the author of the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]]. In the Python community, Van Rossum is known as a &quot;[[Benevolent Dictator For Life]]&quot; (BDFL), meaning that he continues to oversee the Python development process, making decisions where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=10 |title=Benevolent dictator for life |date=2005-02-01 |accessdate=2007-11-01 |publisher=[[Linux Format]]}} {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently employed by [[Google]], where he spends half his time working on Python development.

==Biography==
Van Rossum was born and grew up in the Netherlands, where he received a masters degree in mathematics and computer science from the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1982. He later worked for various research institutes, including the Dutch [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica]] (CWI), Amsterdam, the [[United States]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), Gaithersburg, Maryland, and the [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]] (CNRI), Reston, Virginia.

In December 2005, Van Rossum was hired by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/8821 Python Creator Guido van Rossum now working at Google], December 21, 2005, by Jeremy Jones - O'Reilly ONLamp Blog&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a web-based code-review tool for Google in Python.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2006/11/google-mondrian.html Mondrian Google Mondrian: web-based code review and storage], November 30, 2006, Niall Kennedy's Weblog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebogles.com/blog/2010/06/code-reviews-at-google/ Code Reviews at Google], 8 June 2010, Bogleâs Blog{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
Guido van Rossum is the brother of [[Just van Rossum]], a [[type designer]] and also a programmer. Just van Rossum designed the font that is used in the &quot;Python Powered&quot; logo. Currently Guido lives in California together with his American wife Kim Knapp&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-June/004497.html (Python-Dev) Guido and Kim married], Ken Manheimer, 6 June 2000, Python-Dev -- Python core developers&lt;/ref&gt; and their son Orlijn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/~guido/bio.html Guido van Rossum - Brief Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-announce/2000-May/000010.html (Mailman-Announce) forwarded message from Guido van Rossum], &quot;Oh, and to top it all off, I'm going on vacation.  I'm getting married and will be relaxing on my honeymoon.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://csg.csail.mit.edu/6.893/Handouts/PythonWhatsNew.pdf What's New in Python?], &quot;Not your usual list of new features&quot;, Stanford CSL Colloquium, October 29, 2003; BayPiggies, November 13, 2003, Guido van Rossum, Elemental Security&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

While working at the ''Stichting Mathematisch Centrum'' (CWI), Guido van Rossum wrote and contributed a [[Glob (programming)|glob()]] routine to [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[Unix]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071219090708/http://www.isc.org/sources/devel/func/glob.txt 'Globbing' library routine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/perl-5.10.0/ext/File/Glob/Glob.pm File::Glob - Perl extension for BSD glob routine - search.cpan.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rossum also worked on the development of the [[ABC programming language]].

===Python===

About the origin of [[Python (programming language)|Python]], Van Rossum wrote in 1996:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a &quot;hobby&quot; programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office â¦ would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/ Foreword for &quot;Programming Python&quot; (1st ed.)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000 he further wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Python's predecessor, [[ABC (programming language)|ABC]], was inspired by [[SETL]] â [[Lambert Meertens]] spent a year with the SETL group at [[New York University|NYU]] before coming up with the final ABC design!&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2000-August/008881.html [Python-Dev&amp;#93; SETL (was: Lukewarm about range literals)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Computer Programming for Everybody===
In 1999, Van Rossum submitted a funding proposal to [[DARPA]] called ''Computer Programming for Everybody'', in which he further defined his goals for Python:
* an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors
* [[open source]], so anyone can contribute to its development
* code that is as understandable as plain English
* suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times

Arguably, several of these ambitions have since been realized. Python has grown to become a popular programming language.  For example, as of November 2011, it is the 3rd most popular language on the GitHub.com social coding website&lt;ref&gt;GitHub.com Top Languages, [https://github.com/languages]&lt;/ref&gt;, and according to a programming language popularity survey&lt;ref&gt;Programming Language Popularity, [http://langpop.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; it is consistently amongst the top 10 most mentioned languages in job postings.  Additionally, it is consistently in the top 10 most popular languages according to the TIOBE Programming Community Index &lt;ref&gt;TIOBE Programming Community Index for November 2011, [http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html], November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Recognition==
* Van Rossum received the 2001 [[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]] from the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) at the 2002 [[FOSDEM]] conference in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]].
*Guido received a [[NLUUG]] Award in May 2003.
*In 2006 he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].
