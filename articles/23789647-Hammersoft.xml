'''Water.org''' is an [[United States|American]] [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[aid agency|developmental aid organization]] resulting from the merger between [[H2O Africa]], co-founded by [[Matt Damon]], and [[WaterPartners]], co-founded by Gary White.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2009/07/15/waterpartners-actor-damon-create-waterorg/ Damon joins K.C. organization to provide for developing communities] AP, July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its goal is to provide aid to regions of [[developing countries]] that do not have access to safe [[drinking water]] and [[sanitation]].

==Approach==
Water.org's approach to implementing water projects involves four key components:
# forging partnerships with local partner organizations in the countries it serves
# involving the community at each stage of the project
# selecting technology appropriate to the local community and their particular situation
# integrating all projects with health and hygiene education.

The organization conducts monitoring, evaluation, and original research programs. It has initiated third-party evaluations of its programs to determine how it is fulfilling its mission&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.org/FileUploads/SustainabilityStudySummary.pdf Community Water Systems Sustainability Study], Lempira, Honduras, Emory University, October 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;.

==WaterCredit==
Water.org's projects are funded through [[grants]], loans, or a combination of the two. Its loan program, known as WaterCredit, utilizes [[microcredit]] to fund water sanitation projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2006-03/2006-03-28-voa48.cfm?CFID=106693164&amp;CFTOKEN=46309719 Water Projects Sustain Hope and Life in Developing Countries], Voice of America, March 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twfindia.com/environmentDetail1_14.01.07.asp A Thirsty World],  Trans World Features India, January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Funding water supply projects through a combination of grants and loans is a new approach to the water sector. This strategy helps these people in need build credit for the future and also builds confidence in commercial institutions that are considering lending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.org/watercredit/ Water.org/WaterCredit]&lt;/ref&gt;  Until recently, almost all water projects facilitated by other nongovernmental organizations have been funded entirely by grants, even when the individuals served by the project have the means to share costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Prior to its merger with Water.org, WaterPartners received grants from organizations such as the [[PepsiCo]] Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122244674302979203.html Coalition Pledges $400 Million For Clean Water, Sanitation], Wall Street Journal, September 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, [[The Michael and Susan Dell Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119679987030413446.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Firm Decisions], Wall Street Journal, December 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;, and Open Square Foundation (previously called the Agora Foundation)&lt;ref&gt;Grants to Aid Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Education Overseas: a Sampling, [http://philanthropy.com/summary/v20/i01.htm Chronicle of Philanthropy], October 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.
