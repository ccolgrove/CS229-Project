'''Google Images''' is a [[search engine|search]] service created by [[Google]] that allows users to search the [[World Wide Web|Web]] for [[image]] content. The feature was introduced in July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zipern, Andrew. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/12/technology/news-watch-a-quick-way-to-search-for-images-on-the-web.html A Quick Way to Search For Images on the Web].&quot; ''New York Times.'' 12 July 2001. Retrieved 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Keyword (Internet search)|keywords]] for the image search are based on the filename of the image, the link text pointing to the image, and text adjacent to the image. When searching for an image, a [[thumbnail]] of each matching image is displayed. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the image is displayed in a box over the website that it came from. The user can then close the box and browse the website, or view the full-sized image.

In early 2007 Google implemented an updated [[user interface]] for the image search, where information about the image, such as resolution and [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], was hidden until the user moved the mouse over the thumbnail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donutey.com/googleimage.php Updated Google Images UI]&lt;/ref&gt; This was discontinued after a few weeks.

On July 20, 2010, Google updated the [[user interface]] again, hiding image details until mouse over, like before.&lt;ref&gt; [http://mashable.com/2010/07/20/google-images/ Google Image Search Gets an Overhaul] &lt;/ref&gt; This feature can be disabled by pressing &quot;Ctrl + End&quot; on one's keyboard and clicking &quot;Switch to basic version&quot;.

On October 27, 2009, Google Images added a feature to its image search that can be used to find similar images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/similar-images-graduates-from-google.html Similar Images graduates from Google Labs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbronline.com/news/google_launches_similar_images_search_tool_281009 Google launches âsimilar imagesâ search tool]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tusharvickkie.blogspot.com/2009/10/new-feature-in-google-image-search-for.html A new feature in Google image search for searching similar images]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, 250 million images were indexed. In 2005, this grew to 1 billion. By 2010, the index reached 10 billion images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/ooh-ahh-google-images-presents-nicer.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The service gets over one billion [[page view]]s a day, as of July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10693439]&lt;/ref&gt; Google introduced a sort by subject feature for a visual category scheme overview of a search query in May 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;sort by subject&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Wins the War Against Bing Images|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/227563/google_wins_the_war_against_bing_images.html|publisher=PCWorld Communications, Inc.|accessdate=27 May 2011|author=Eric Mack|date=10|month=May|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October of 2011, Google Images began to allow for reverse image searches directly in the image search-bar (that is, without a third-party add on, such as the one previously available for Mozilla Firefox).  This feature allows users to search by dragging and dropping an image into the search-bar, uploading an image, selecting a URL, or 'right-clicking' on an image. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}&lt;!-- Note: This tag has been before in wrong format, so I corrected the format but added the new date since I don't know month this tag was added. ---&gt;
