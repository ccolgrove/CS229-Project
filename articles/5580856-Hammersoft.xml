This article is a chronological listing of allegations of meetings between members of [[al-Qaeda]] and members of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government, as well as other information relevant to [[conspiracy theories]] involving [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]]. Opinions of experts on this subject are that not all of the specific claims about meetings can be substantiated with evidence and that the evidence that does exist leads to the conclusion that no substantial links exist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 2003, American terrorism analyst, [[Evan Kohlmann|Evan Kohlman]], said in an interview:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While there have been a number of promising intelligence leads hinting at possible meetings between al-Qaeda members and elements of the former [[Baghdad]] regime, nothing has been yet shown demonstrating that these potential contacts were historically any more significant than the same level of communication maintained between [[Osama bin Laden]] and ruling elements in a number of Iraq's [[Persian Gulf]] neighbors, including [[Saudi Arabia]], Iran, [[Yemen]], Qatar, and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=&quot;commondreams20030803&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Canellos| first = Peter S.| coauthors = and Bryan Bender| title = Questions Grow Over Iraq Links to Qaeda| publisher=CommonDreams.org| date = 3 August 2003| url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0803-04.htm| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, a report of postwar findings by the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] concluded that: {{quote|Postwar findings have identified only one meeting between representatives of al-Qa'ida and Saddam Hussein's regime reported in prewar intelligence assessments. Postwar findings have identified two occasions, not reported prior to the war, in which Saddam Hussein rebuffed meeting requests from an al-Qa'ida operative. The Intelligence Community has not found any other evidence of meetings between al'Qa'ida and Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate_report_2006_p105&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on Postwar Findings About Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How They Compare With Prewar Assessments | publisher=[[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] | pages = 105 | date = 8&amp;nbsp;September 2006 | url = http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same report also concluded that: {{quote|Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from al-Qaeda to provide material or operational support.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate_report_2006_p105&quot;/&gt;}}

The result of the publication of the Senate report was the belief that the entire connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda was an official deception based on [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] specific intelligence data that bolstered the case for war with Iraq regardless of its reliability. One instance of this reaction was reported in a [[BBC]] news article, which stated: {{quote|Opposition Democrats are accusing the White House of deliberate deception. They say the revelation undermines the basis on which the US went to war in Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc20060909&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Saddam 'had no link to al-Qaeda'|publisher=BBC News | date = 9&amp;nbsp;September 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5328592.stm| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==1988==
* According to sworn testimony of al-Qaeda member Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali in 2001, Osama bin Laden delivered a lecture in Pakistan in 1988. During this lecture he spoke against Saddam Hussein and the [[Ba'ath party]] by warning his listeners about Saddam's expansionist ambitions in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;al_owhali_testimony&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = USA v.

===March===
*During an interview with [[Peter Bergen]], Khaled Batarfi, and old friend of [[Osama bin Laden]], said that bin Laden had already predicted Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and had began preparations for war against Saddam. According to Batarfi, Bin Laden had said, &quot;We should train our people, our young and increase our army and prepare for the day when eventually we are attacked. This guy [Saddam] can never be trusted.&quot;  Batarfi himself went on to say about bin Laden: &quot;He doesn't believe [Saddam] is a Muslim. So he never liked him nor trusted him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;peter_bergen_111_112&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergen | first = Peter | title = The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader | publisher=Free Press | date = 8 August 2006 | location = New York City | pages = 111â112 | isbn = 0743278925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2 August===
*Saddam Hussein's army invades Kuwait. In response to the perceived threat to Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden offers to bring an army of [[jihadist]] fighters to protect the kingdom against Saddam . The [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]]'s decision to seek help from American troops rather than from bin Laden's jihadists is considered a turning point in bin Laden's life. The presence of American troops in the Arabian peninsula after the end of the [[Gulf War]] became, for bin Laden, a key piece of evidence that the U.S. was at war with [[Islam]]. Prince [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud]], the former head of the Saudi intelligence agency [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah]], noted of bin Laden: &quot;I saw radical changes in his personality as he changed from a calm, peaceful and gentle man interested in helping Muslims into a person who believed that he would be able to amass and command an army to liberate Kuwait. It revealed his arrogance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;peter_bergen_112&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergen | first = Peter | title = The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader | publisher=Free Press | date = 8 August 2006 | location = New York City | pages = 112 | isbn = 0743278925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*While bin Laden continued to oppose Saddam's Baathist government, he was also vocal in criticizing the [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions against Iraq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rohan_gunaratna_book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Gunaratna | first = Rohan | title = Inside Al Qaeda: Global Network of Terror | publisher=Berkley Trade | date = 3 June 2003 | location = New York, NY | pages = 37 | isbn = 978-0425191149}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Bin Laden's bodyguard recalls that his intentions included not only the liberation of Kuwait but also &quot;rescuing the Iraqi people from the domination of the Ba'th Party...Sheikh Osama bin Laden was dreaming of this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;peter_bergen_112&quot;/&gt;

==1992==
* According to information that was first made public in the [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations#2003 Feith Report|Feith memo]], a meeting was arranged by [[Hassan al-Turabi]] between members of the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] and members of al-Qaeda, allegedly with the goal of creating a common strategy for deposing pro-Western Arab governments. The American author [[Lawrence Wright]] comments in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Looming Tower]]'' that:
{{quote|The Iraqi delegation met with Bin Laden, even flattered him, claiming that he was the prophesied [[Mahdi]] the savior of Islam. They wanted him to stop backing anti-Saddam insurgents, Bin Laden agreed. But in return he asked for weapons and training camps inside Iraq. That same year, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] traveled to Bagdad where he met Saddam Hussein in person. But there is no evidence that Iraq ever supplied al-Qaeda with weapons or camps, and soon bin Laden resumed his support of Iraqi dissidents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wright_tower_295_296&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Lawrence | title = The Looming Tower | publisher=Knopf | year = 2006 | pages = 295â296 | isbn = 978-0375414862}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==1993==
*The [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] occurred on 26 February. One of the conspirators was [[Abdul Rahman Yasin]], an American of Iraqi descent born in [[Bloomington]], [[Indiana]]. After the attack he fled to Iraq where he allegedly moved in with a relative and received support from the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday20030927&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Diamond| first = John| title = U.S.: Iraq sheltered suspect in '93 WTC attack|work=USA Today | date = 27 September 2003| url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-09-17-iraq-wtc_x.htm| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Web Editor | title =   Abdul Rahman Yasin  | publisher=National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) | url =  http://www.nctc.gov/site/profiles/yasin.htm |  accessdate  =22 November 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109063701/http://www.nctc.gov/site/profiles/yasin.htm| archivedate = 9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Iraqi government claimed they imprisoned Yasin in 1994, where he remained until at least 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/31/60minutes/main510795.shtml 60 Minutes: The Man Who Got Away, Says '93 WTC Bombers Originally Targeted Jewish Neighborhoods â CBS News] at www.cbsnews.com&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq made an offer to the Clinton Administration to trade Yasin in 1998, but the Clinton administration rejected the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;commondreams20040303&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Strobel| first = Warren P.| coauthors = Jonathan S.

But they did not respond.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Editor | first = CBS Web Site | title = Transcript: The Yasin Interview: A 60 Minutes Exclusive |publisher=CBS | date = not provided | accessdate =24 November 2007 |url=? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Neil Herman, who headed the [[FBI]] investigation into the 1993 World Trade Center attack, noted that despite Yasin's presence in Baghdad, there was no evidence of Iraqi support for the attack. &quot;We looked at that rather extensively,&quot; he told CNN terrorism analyst [[Peter Bergen]]. &quot;There were no ties to the Iraqi government.&quot; Bergen writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In sum, by the mid-'90s, the [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] in New York, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]], the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]'s office in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]], the [[United States National Security Council|N.S.C.]], and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] had all found no evidence implicating the Iraqi government in the first Trade Center attack.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washmonthly200312&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Bergen| first = Peter| title = Armchair Provocateur â Laurie Mylroie: The Neocons' favorite conspiracy theorist.| publisher=Washington Monthly| month = December | year = 2003| url = http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0312.bergen.html| accessdate =7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*During the [[9/11 Commission]] Hearings, former U.S. counterterrorism chief [[Richard A. Clarke]] was asked about whether Yasin going to Iraq established a connection between Saddam Hussein and the 1993 World Trade Center attack. His response was unequivocating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the investigation, both the CIA investigation and the FBI investigation, made it very clear in '95 and '96 as they got more information, that the Iraqi government was in no way involved in the attack. And the fact that one of the 12 people involved in the attack was Iraqi hardly seems to me as evidence that the Iraqi government was involved in the attack. The attack was al-Qaida; not Iraq. The Iraqi government because, obviously, of the hostility between us and them, didn't cooperate in turning him over and gave him sanctuary, as it did give sanctuary to other terrorists. But the allegation that has been made that the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center was done by the Iraqi government I think is absolutely without foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo20040324&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Wednesday's 9/11 Commission Hearings| work=transcript|work=Washington Post | date =24 March 2004| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20349-2004Mar24.html| accessdate =7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1994==
*[[Farouk Hijazi]], former head of the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], allegedly meets with [[Osama bin Laden]] in Sudan. Former [[CIA]] [[counter-terrorism]] official [[Vincent Cannistraro]] claimed that bin Laden rejected Hijazi's overtures, and concluded that bin Laden did not want to be &quot;exploited&quot; by Iraq's [[Secularity|secular]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek20031119&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Isikoff| first = Michael| coauthors = and Mark Hosenball| title = Case Decidedly Not Closed|work=Newsweek | date = 19 November 2003| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586/| accessdate =6 December 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061109194327/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most analysts believe, however, that the ideological differences between the Iraqis and the terrorists were insurmountable. It is thought that bin Laden rejected any kind of alliance, preferring to pursue his own policy of global [[jihad]], or holy war.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian20030427&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Bright| first = Martin| coauthors = and Jason Burke| title = Saddam 'held talks on alliance with al-Qaeda'|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 27 April 2003| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,944589,00.html| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1995==
===19 February, Sudan===
*A handwritten note that is a part of the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom documents]] collection (released by the U.S. government in 2006) suggests that a representative of Saddam's government met with bin Laden in Sudan on 19 February 1995. According to the note, bin laden suggested &quot;carrying out joint operations against foreign forces&quot; in Saudi Arabia.

*An [[ABC News]] article, which reported on the document, notes that eight months after the date of this document, al Qaeda staged an attack in [[Riyadh]]. Neither ABC nor any other source has offered information suggesting that Iraq participated in planning these attacks, and the Iraqi government has never been accused of such participation{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, and ABC notes that the militants who attacked the facility &quot;later confessed on Saudi TV to having been trained by Osama bin Laden.&quot;  The ABC article further notes that &quot;the document does not establish that the two parties did in fact enter into an operational relationship,&quot; and also that the contacts may have &quot;been approved personally by Saddam Hussein.&quot;  The ABC article also cautions that &quot;this document is handwritten and has no official seal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc20060323&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Did Russian Ambassador Give Saddam the U.S. War Plan?| publisher=ABC News| date = 23 March 2006| url = http://abcnews.go.com/International/IraqCoverage/story?id=1734490&amp;page=1| accessdate =7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*CNN terrorism expert Peter Bergen commented, &quot;The results of this meeting were ... nothing. Two subsequent attacks against American forces in Saudi Arabia â a car bombing that year and the [[Khobar Towers]] attack in 1996 â were carried out, respectively, by locals who said they were influenced by Mr. bin Laden and by the Saudi branch of [[Hezbollah]], a [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] group aided by [[Iran]]ian government officials.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes20060328&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Bergen| first = Peter| title = Enemy of Our Enemy| work=op-ed| publisher=NY Times| date = 28 March 2006| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/opinion/28bergen.html?ex=1165640400&amp;en=fdde05968a5e2c68&amp;ei=5070| accessdate =7 December 2006 }} Registration required.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that a &quot;joint intelligence task force&quot; concluded that the document &quot;appeared authentic&quot;. The document, which asserts that bin Laden &quot;was approached by our side,&quot; states that bin Laden previously &quot;had some reservations about being labeled an Iraqi operative,&quot; but was willing to meet in Sudan. At the meeting, bin Laden requested that sermons of an anti-Saudi cleric be rebroadcast in Iraq. That request, the document states, was approved by Baghdad. The document also states that Iraqi intelligence officers began &quot;seeking other channels through which to handle the relationship, in light of [bin Laden's departure from Sudan]&quot;. The Iraqi document states that &quot;cooperation between the two organizations should be allowed to develop freely through discussion and agreement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes20040625&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Shanker| first = Thom| title = Iraqis, Seeking Foes of Saudis, Contacted bin Laden, File Says| publisher=NY Times| date = 25 June 2004| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/politics/25TERR.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=d9a3d1aa68140e2c&amp;ex=1403496000&amp;partner=USERLAND| accessdate =7 December 2006 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Registration required.&lt;/ref&gt;

===September, Sudan===
*[[Brigadier]] Salim al-Ahmed, a top explosives expert of the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS), allegedly met with bin Laden in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, in SeptemberâOctober 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_phillips_20062004&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Phillips | first = Melanie | title = There was a link between Saddam and al-Qa'eda | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 20 June 2004 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3607455/There-was-a-link-between-Saddam-and-al-Qaeda.html | accessdate =18 November 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 9/11 Commission Report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At least one of these reports dates the meeting to 1994, but other evidence indicates the meeting may have occurred in February 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p468&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 468 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* A second meeting between the IIS and bin Laden is alleged to have taken place in Sudan, in July 1996. At this meeting, Mani' Abd Rashid al-Tikriti, a director of the IIS, was allegedly present.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_phillips_20062004&quot;/&gt; According to the 9/11 Commission report, however, the veracity of the second meeting is in doubt due to the [[anachronism]] of events:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The information is puzzling, since bin Ladin left Sudan for Afghanistan in May 1996, and there is no evidence he ventured back there (or anywhere else) for a visit. In examining the source material, the reports note that the information was received 'third hand,' passed from the foreign government service that 'does not meet directly with the ultimate source of the information, but obtains the information from him through two unidentified intermediaries, one of whom merely delivers the information to the Service.'&quot; The same source also claims al-Ahmed was seen near bin Laden's farm in December 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p468&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Starting in 1995, Salman Pak, Iraq===
* Several Iraqi defectors report that hundreds of foreign terrorists were being trained in [[Aircraft hijacking|airplane hijacking]] techniques &quot;without weapons&quot; using a real airplane (variously reported as a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Tupolev Tu-154]]) as a [[Theatrical property|prop]] at [[Salman Pak facility|Salman Pak]], an Iraqi military facility just south of Baghdad, between 1995 and 2000. The training program was allegedly run by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], i.e., the Mukhabarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/interviews/khodada.html |title=Frontline: Gunning for Saddam: Interviews: Sabah Khodada |publisher=PBS |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allegation has also been reported by the following defectors:
** Sabah Khalifa Khodada Alami (former Iraqi army captain), who provided details of the layout of the camp as early as 1998
** &quot;Abu Zeinab&quot; al-Ghurairy (former Iraqi sergeant who claimed to be a general), who corroborated Khodada's details in 2000
** [[Khidir Hamza]], a scientist who worked on Iraq's nuclear program&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs_hamza&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/interviews/hamza.html |title=Frontline: Gunning for Saddam: Interviews: Khidir Hamza |publisher=PBS |date=8 November 2001 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Abdul Rahman al-Shamari, a Mukhabarat agent in U.S. custody
** &quot;Abu Mohammed&quot;, a former colonel in [[Fedayeen Saddam]]&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes_abumohammed&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Roberts | first = Gwynne | title = Baghdad Trained Al Qaeda Fighters in Chemical Warfare | work=Daily Times | date = 15 July 2002 | url = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_15-7-2002_pg4_ | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The credibility of Khodada and Abu Zeinab is often questioned, however, due to their association with the [[Iraqi National Congress]], an organization that has been accused of deliberately supplying false information to the U.S. government in order to build support for regime change.&lt;ref name=&quot;landay_wells&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Landay | first1 = Jonathan S. | last2 = Wells | first2 = Tish | title = Global Misinformation Campaign was Used to Build Case for War | work=CommonDreams.org | date = 16 March 2004 | url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Helen Kennedy of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' &lt;blockquote&gt;The INCâs agenda was to get us into a war. The really damaging stories all came from those guys, not the CIA.

He has poetic interests and has a vivid imagination in making up stories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;informationclearinghouse_dwyer&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Dwyer | first = Jim | title = Defectors' Reports on Iraq Arms Were Embellished, Exile Asserts | work=Information Clearing House | date = 9 July 2004 | url = http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6455.htm | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inconsistencies in the stories of the defectors led U.S. officials, journalists, and investigators to conclude that the Salman Pak story was inaccurate. One senior U.S. official said that they had found &quot;nothing to substantiate&quot; the claim that al-Qaeda trained at Salman Pak other than the testimony of several INC defectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;landay_wells&quot;/&gt;

* Saddam's government had even denied that an airplane existed 25 kilometers southeast of Baghdad. The Iraqi ambassador to the U.N., Mohammed Aldouri, told ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' in the fall of 2001,&lt;blockquote&gt;I am lucky that I know the area, this Salman Pak. This is a very beautiful area with gardens, with trees.

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the first report from Ibn al-Shaykh in which he claims Iraq assisted al-Qaidaâs CBRN [Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear] efforts. However, he lacks specific details on the Iraqis involved, the CBRN materials associated with the assistance, and the location where training occurred.

There are no footnotes in the book, and there has been no other independent confirmation of this claim, which was republished uncritically by [[William Safire]] in a column in October 2001.

===Circa 1998, Washington D.C.===
[[Daniel Benjamin]], head of the [[United States National Security Council|U.S. National Security Council]]'s counterterrorism division, heads an exercise aimed at a critical analysis of the CIA's contention that Iraq and al Qaeda would not team up. &quot;This was a red-team effort,&quot; he said. &quot;We looked at this as an opportunity to disprove the conventional wisdom, and basically we came to the conclusion that the CIA had this one right.&quot;   He further stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;No one disputes that there have been contacts over the years. In that part of the America-hating universe, contacts happen. But that's still a long way from suggesting that they were really working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0803-04.htm |title=Questions Grow Over Iraq Links to Qaeda |publisher=Commondreams.org |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===23 February, Afghanistan===
Osama bin Laden issues a [[FatwÄ|fatwa]] urging jihad against all Americans. In his fatwa, bin Laden states &lt;blockquote&gt;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies â civilians and military â is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also states that one of his reasons for the fatwa is the &quot;Americans' continuing aggression against the Iraqi people.&quot;  Bin Laden mentions aggression against Iraq four times in the fatwa. A more important reason is the perceived American aggression against Muslims, which is mentioned seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html |title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date=23 February 1998 | accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March, Baghdad===
*According to Inigo Gilmore of London's ''Telegraph'', the Iraqi Intelligence Service, i.e., the Mukhabarat, arranged for an envoy from bin Laden to travel from Sudan to Baghdad to meet with Iraqi officials. Gilmore's claim is based on three stapled pages that he claims to have found in the Mukhabarat headquarters in early 2003, which he smuggled out of the building while it was guarded by American troops. Gilmore stated that the CIA had already been through the building for intelligence &quot;but they seem to have missed this particular document.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_27april&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Iraq files 'show al-Qaeda link' | date=27 April 2003 |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2979405.stm | accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*According to the handwritten documents, the Al-Qaeda envoy stayed at the al-Mansour Melia, a first class hotel. A letter with this document states that the envoy was a trusted confidant of bin Laden. It also reads &lt;blockquote&gt;According to the above, we suggest permission to call the Khartoum station [Iraq's intelligence office in Sudan] to facilitate the travel arrangements for the above-mentioned person to Iraq. And that our body carry all the travel and hotel costs inside Iraq to gain the knowledge of the message from bin Laden and to convey to his envoy an oral message from us to bin Laden.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The letter refers to al-Qaeda's leader as an opponent of the Saudi Arabian regime and says that the message to be conveyed to bin Laden through the envoy &quot;would relate to the future of our relationship with him, bin Laden, and to achieve a direct meeting with him.&quot; The meeting was allegedly extended by a week and the document &quot;recommends contacts with bin Laden.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F27%2Fwalq27.xml |title=The proof that Saddam worked with bin Laden â Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London |first=Peter |last=Oborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===August, Khartoum===
* U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] orders eighty [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk missiles]] fired at targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, including the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]]. The Clinton Administration claimed the factory was actually a [[chemical weapons]] plant operated by al-Qaeda.

*Clinton's [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] would testify to the [[9/11 Commission]] in 2004 that intelligence officials suspected &quot;indirect links between the facility and bin Laden and the Iraqi chemical weapons program.&quot; He also noted that &lt;blockquote&gt;The direct physical evidence from the scene obtained at that time convinced the U.S. intelligence community that their suspicions were correct about the facilityâs chemical weapons role and that there was a risk of chemical agents getting into the hands of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas_cohen_statement&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Cohen | first = William S. | title = Statement of William S.

*The [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, in which it suggested that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate. James Risen reported in the ''New York Times'' &lt;blockquote&gt;Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State [[Phyllis E. Oakley|Phyllis Oakley]] that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/sudbous.htm]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stephen Hayes of the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' reported that this month, according to a &quot;Summary of Evidence&quot; released by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in March 2005 concerning a detainee held at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], that this former [[infantry]]man of the [[Iraqi Army]] who became an al-Qaeda agent traveled to Pakistan with a member of Iraqi intelligence &quot;for the purpose of blowing up the Pakistan, United States and British Embassies with chemical mortars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklystandard_hayes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Hayes | first = Stephen F. | last2 = Joscelyn | first2 = Thomas | title = The Mother of All Connections | work=The Weekly Standard | date = 18 July 2005 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/804yqqnr.asp | accessdate =25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, no evidence of such an &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;agreement&quot; has ever materialized. Clarke notes in his book ''[[Against All Enemies]]'' that many of the contacts cited by supporters of the invasion as proof of Iraq and al-Qaeda cooperation &quot;actually proved that al Qaeda and Iraq had not succeeded in establishing a ''[[modus vivendi]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;richard_a_clarke&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Richard A. | title = Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror | publisher=Free Press | date = 14 September 2004 | pages = 269 | isbn = 978-0743260459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three intelligence agencies tell ABC News they cannot be certain what was discussed, but almost certainly, they say, bin Laden has been told he would be welcome in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;reasonsforwarwithiraq_jan1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = ABC News:  Iraqi intelligence chief met with bin Laden in December 1998  | work=ReasonsforWarWithIraq.com | date = 14 January 1999 | url = http://www.reasons-for-war-with-iraq.info/abcnews_1-14-99.html | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This story is repeated by [[CNN]] on 13 February. The article reports that &quot;Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has offered asylum to bin Laden, who openly supports Iraq against the Western powers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/13/afghan.binladen/ CNN â Bin Laden reportedly leaves Afghanistan, whereabouts unknown â 13 February 1999]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*According to the [[9/11 Commission]] report, in February 1999 [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] was nervous about [flying a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] mission over Afghanistan to build a baseline of intelligence] because he continued to fear that Bin Laden might leave for someplace less accessible, such as Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p134&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 134 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to Deputy National Security Advisor Donald Kerrick that one reliable source reported that Bin Laden had met Iraqi officials, who may have offered him asylum. Other intelligence sources said that some Taliban leaders, though not [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Mohammed Omar]], had urged Bin Laden to go to Iraq. If Bin Laden actually moved to Iraq, wrote Clarke, his network would be at Saddam Husseinâs service, and it would be 'virtually impossible' to find him. Better to get Bin Laden in Afghanistan, Clarke declared.&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p134&quot;/&gt;

*In 2003, however, former CIA counterterrorism official Vincent Cannistraro told ''[[Newsweek]]'' during an interview that bin Laden rejected Hijazi's overtures, concluding that he did not want to be &quot;exploited&quot; by Iraq's secular regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek20031119&quot;/&gt; Hijazi, arrested in April 2003, reportedly &quot;cut a deal [with American officials who] are using him to reactivate the old Iraqi intelligence network.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker_hirsch_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Hirsch | first = Seymour M. | title = Will the counter-insurgency plan in Iraq repeat the mistakes of Vietnam? | work=The New Yorker | date = 15 September 2003 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/12/15/031215fa_fact | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A similar opinion was expressed by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', which reported &lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, intelligence agencies tracked contacts between Iraqi agents and Al Qaeda agents in the '90s in Sudan and Afghanistan, where bin Laden is believed to have met with Farouk Hijazi, head of Iraqi intelligence. But current and former intelligence specialists caution that such meetings occur just as often between enemies as friends. Spies frequently make contact with rogue groups to size up their intentions, gauge their strength, or try to infiltrate their ranks, they said.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonglobe_canellos&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Canellos | first = Peter S. | last2 = Bender | first2 = Bryan | title = Questions Grow Over Iraq Links to Qaeda | work=Boston Globe | date = 3 August 2003 | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===31 January===
A 2005 article in ''The Weekly Standard'' claimed that the [[Russia]]n [[State media|state-owned]] [[news agency]] ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' reported in 1999 that &lt;blockquote&gt;hundreds of Afghan Arabs are undergoing sabotage training in Southern Iraq and are preparing for armed actions on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. They have declared as their goal a fight against the interests of the United States in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklystandard_joscelyn&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the same article, ''The Weekly Standard'' claimed that the Kuwaiti government detained some al Qaeda members at the border but notes that the Kuwaiti government did not respond to requests for more information about these alleged detainees.

===May, Iraq===
*According to documents summarized by the [[U.S. Joint Forces Command]]'s [[Iraqi Perspectives Project]], [[Uday Hussein]] ordered the Saddam Fedayeen to prepare for &quot;special operations, assassinations, and bombings, for the centers and traitor symbols in London, Iran and the self-ruled areas &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Kurdistan]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;. The special operation was referred to as 'Blessed July,' which was described by defense analyst Kevin Woods as &quot;a regime-directed wave of 'martyrdom' operations against targets in the West.&quot;

*Woods claims that plans for 'Blessed July' &quot;were well under way at the time of the coalition invasion.&quot; He also notes that the Fedayeen was racked by corruption.  &quot;In the years preceding the coalition invasion,&quot; he says, &quot;Iraq's leaders had become enamored of the belief that the spirit of the Fedayeen's 'Arab warriors' would allow them to overcome the Americans' advantages. In the end, however, the Fedayeen fighters proved totally unprepared for the kind of war they were asked to fight, and they died by the thousands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignaffairs_woods&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Woods | first = Kevin | last2 = Lacey | first2 = James | last3 = Murray | first3 = Williamson | title = Saddam's Delusions: The View From the Inside | work=Foreign Affairs | date = May/June 2006 | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61701/kevin-woods-james-lacey-and-williamson-murray/saddams-delusions-the-view-from-the-inside | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*An Iraqi national with connections to the Iraqi embassy, and possibly a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[Fedayeen Saddam]], Ahmad Hikmat Shakir al-Azzawi, supposedly helped arrange a top-level al-Qaeda meeting attended by two of the 9/11 hijackers, [[Khalid al-Midhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], and by [[Walid bin 'Attash|Tawfiq bin Attash]], who was responsible for the [[USS Cole bombing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p159&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 159 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two unidentified Iraqi men are arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying.&lt;ref name=&quot;nci_20010301&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nci.org/iraq/iraq-frg-ap3101.htm |title=Germany Arrests Two Iraqis Suspected of Spying |location=Heidelberg; Iraq; Baghdad; Berlin; Karlsruhe; Wiesbaden; Germany; Israel; egypt; Kuwait |publisher=Nci.org |date=1 March 2001 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}{{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews_March01201&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany arrests two 'Iraqi spies' |date=1 March 2001 |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1196283.stm | accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''The Weekly Standard'', an Arabic newspaper in Paris called ''Al-Watan al-Arabi'' reported &lt;blockquote&gt;The arrests came in the wake of reports that Iraq was reorganizing the external branches of its intelligence service and that it had drawn up a plan to strike at US interests around the world through a network of alliances with extremist fundamentalist parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklystandard_morrissey_Aug242005&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Morrissey | first = Edward | title = Rethinking Prague | work=The Weekly Standard | date = 24 August 2005 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/981wymiq.asp | accessdate =30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same article also reported that&lt;blockquote&gt;The most serious report contained information that Iraq and Osama bin Ladin were working together. German authorities were surprised by the arrest of the two Iraqi agents and the discovery of Iraqi intelligence activities in several German cities. German authorities, acting on CIA recommendations, had been focused on monitoring the activities of Islamic groups linked to bin Ladin. They discovered the two Iraqi agents by chance and uncovered what they considered to be serious indications of cooperation between Iraq and bin Ladin. The matter was considered so important that a special team of CIA and FBI agents was sent to Germany to interrogate the two Iraqi spies.&lt;ref name=&quot;weeklystandard_morrissey_Aug242005&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This report and the interrogation records of the detained Iraqi agents were not discussed in the 9/11 Commission Report, and do not seem to be mentioned in other media sources. It is not known whether the arrests revealed any cooperation between the men and either Iraqi intelligence or al Qaeda.

===8 April, Prague, Czech Republic===
*The Czech counterintelligence service claimed that Mohamed Atta al-Sayed, 9/11 hijacker, met with Ahmad Samir al-Ani, the [[Consulate general|consul]] at the Iraqi Embassy in [[Prague]], in a cafe in Prague. This claim is generally considered to be false (see [[Mohamed Atta's alleged Prague connection]]). According to columnist [[Robert Novak]], Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld &quot;confirmed published reports that there is no evidence placing the presumed leader of the terrorist attacks in the Czech capital.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;novak_chicagost_2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Novak | first = Robert | title = On Atta, Prague and Iraq Why some still insist hijacker met with Saddam's spy when there's no evidence supporting it  |work=Chicago Sun-Times | date = 13 May 2002 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1444344.html | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the January 2003 CIA report ''Iraqi Support for Terrorism'', &quot;the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility&quot; that such a meeting occurred.&lt;ref&gt;States News Service, 15 April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet released &quot;the most complete public assessment by the agency on the issue&quot; in a statement to the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] in July 2004, stating that the CIA was &quot;increasingly skeptical&quot; any such meeting took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;jehl_sfgate_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Jehl | first = Douglas | title = CIA doubts hijacker met with Iraq agent | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date = 9 July 2004 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/09/MNG267J1N51.DTL | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*John McLaughlin, who at the time was the Deputy Director of the CIA, described the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. We looked at it from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. We looked at photographs. We looked at timetables. We looked at who was where and when. It is wrong to say that we didn't look at it. In fact, we looked at it with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/mclaughlin.html |title=FRONTLINE: The Dark Side: Interviews: John McLaughlin , PBS |publisher=PBS |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The source for the claim that the meeting did occur was based on a contact that the Czech intelligence had within the Iraqi embassy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward Jay Epstein |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007584 |title=The Wall Street Journal Online â Featured Article |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was described in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' as &quot;a single informant from Prague's Arab community who saw Atta's picture in the news after the 11&amp;nbsp;September attacks, and who later told his handlers that he had seen him meeting with Ani. Some officials have called the source unreliable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmore_bostonglobe_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A 9/11 legacy: confusion over a name Czechs find error in tracking Atta | date=19 September 2004 | first1=Brian | last1=Whitmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The claim was officially stated by Czech Prime Minister [[MiloÅ¡ Zeman]] and Interior Minister Stanislav Gross,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/2002question/prague.htm |title=Atta, Prague, Iraq |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Czech officials later backed away from the claim, first privately, and then later publicly after the ''[[New York Times]]'' conducted &quot;extensive interviews with leading Czech figures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40816FB34590C728EDDA90994DA404482 â link does not contain full article but the full text available via Lexis/Nexis confirms the quotes in the article&lt;/ref&gt; When rumors of the Czech officials privately backing away from the claims first appeared in the Western media, according to ''[[The Prague Post]]'', Hynek Kmonicek, the Czech envoy to the UN stated &quot;The meeting took place.&quot; One senior Czech official who requested anonymity speculated that the media reports dismissing the meeting were the result of a &quot;guided leak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/P02/2002/20605/news1a.php The Prague Post Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

*On 15 March 2002 David Ignatius wrote in the ''Washington Post''&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the Czechs, who initially put out the reports about Atta's meeting with al-Ani, have gradually backed away. The Czech interior minister, Stanislav Gross, said in October that the two had met in April 2001. That version was altered slightly by Czech Prime Minister MiloÅ¡ Zeman when he told CNN in November, 'Atta contacted some Iraqi agent, not to prepare the terrorist attack on [the twin towers] but to prepare [a] terrorist attack on just the building of Radio Free Europe' in Prague. Then, in December, Czech President [[VÃ¡clav Havel]] retreated further, saying there was only 'a 70 percent' chance Atta met with al-Ani.&lt;ref name=&quot;ignatius_washpost_2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Ignatius | first = David | title = Dubious Iraqi Link | work=The Washington Post | date = 15 March 2002 | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Havel, however, later &quot;moved to quash the report once and for all&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/22/wirq22.xml |title=Havel rebuts report linking Iraq to Sept 11 â Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London |first=Peter |last=Oborne}}&lt;/ref&gt; by making the statement publicly to the White House, as reported in the ''New York Times''. According to the report, &quot;Czech officials also say they have no hard evidence that Mr. Ani was involved in terrorist activities, although the government did order his ouster in late April 2001.&quot;

*The ''New York Times'' report was described as &quot;a fabrication&quot; by Ladislav Spacek, a spokesman for Czech president Vaclav Havel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2002/02-10-22.rferl.html#39 |title=RFE/RL Newsline, 02-10-22 |publisher=Hri.org |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Spacek also &quot;said Mr. Havel was still certain there was no factual basis behind the report that Mr. Atta met an Iraqi diplomat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. Green, &quot;Havel Denies Telephoning U.S. On Iraq Meeting,&quot; ''New York Times'' (23 October 2002) p. A11&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Times'' story was a potential embarrassment to Czech prime minister Milos Zeman after &quot;extensive interviews with Czech and other Western intelligence officials, politicians and people close to the Czech intelligence community revealed that Mr. Zeman had prematurely disclosed an unverified report.&quot; According to an article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' more recently, the Czechs backed off of the claim: &quot;After months of further investigation, Czech officials determined last year that they could no longer confirm that a meeting took place, telling the Bush administration that al-Ani might have met with someone other than Atta.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffooi.com/MT3/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1532]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This perception seems confirmed by an associate of al-Ani's who suggested to a reporter that the Czech informant had mistaken another man for Atta. The associate said, &quot;I have sat with the two of them at least twice. The double is an Iraqi who has met with the consul.

*The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on 29 September 2004 also reported that a man from Pakistan named Mohammed Atta (spelling his name with two &quot;m's&quot; rather than one) flew to the Czech Republic in 2000, confusing the intelligence agency, who thought it was the same Mohamed Atta{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In September 2004, JiÅÃ­ Ruzek, the former head of the [[BIS|Security Information Service]], told the Czech newspaper ''[[MladÃ¡ fronta DNES]]'', &quot;This information was verified, and it was confirmed that it was a case of the same name. That is all that I recall of it.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Opposition leaders in the Czech Republic have publicly called this a failure on the part of Czech intelligence, and it is not clear that any Czech officials still stand by the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitmore_bostonglobe_2004&quot;/&gt; In hopes of resolving the issue, Czech officials hoped to be given access to information from the U.S. investigation but that cooperation was not forthcoming.&lt;ref name=&quot;epstein_slate_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Epstein | first = Edward Jay | title = Prague Revisited: The evidence of an Iraq/al-Qaida connection hasn't gone away | work=Slate | date = 19 November 2003 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2091354 | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Czech police chief, [[JiÅÃ­ KolÃ¡Å]], said, &quot;there were no documents showing that Atta visited Prague at any time&quot; in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;wirq18.xml&quot;/&gt; Even further doubt was cast on rumors of such a meeting in December 2003 when Al-Ani, who is in U.S. custody, reportedly denied having ever met Atta.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/Europe/13INQU.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Newsweek'', it was &quot;a denial that officials tend to believe given that they have not unearthed a scintilla of evidence that Atta was even in Prague at the time of the alleged rendezvous.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

*It is also notable that Atta's own religious and political convictions made him violently opposed to the Saddam regime. According to the 9/11 Commission Report&lt;blockquote&gt;In his interactions with other students, Atta voiced virulently anti-Semitic and anti-American opinions, ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial world and the media, to polemics against governments of the Arab world. To him, Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p161&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 161 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The 9/11 Commission also addressed the question of an alleged Prague connection and listed many of the reasons above that such a meeting could not have taken place. The report notes that &lt;blockquote&gt;the FBI has gathered intelligence indicating that Atta was in Virginia Beach on 4 April (as evidenced by a bank surveillance camera photo), and in Coral Springs, Florida on 11 April, where he and [[Marwan al-Shehhi|Shehhi]] leased an apartment. On 6, 9, 10, and 11&amp;nbsp;April, Atta's cellular telephone was used numerous times to call various lodging establishments in Florida from cell sites within Florida. We cannot confirm that he placed those calls. But there are no U.S. records indicating that Atta departed the country during this period.&quot;  Combining FBI and Czech intelligence investigations, &quot;[n]o evidence has been found that Atta was in the Czech Republic in April 2001.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  The Commission still could not &quot;absolutely rule out the possibility&quot; that Atta was in Prague on 9 April traveling under an alias, but it concluded that&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no reason for such a meeting, especially considering the risk it would pose to the operation. By April 2001, all four pilots had completed most of their training, and the muscle hijackers were about to begin entering the United States. The available evidence does not support the original Czech report of an Atta-Ani meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;911_report_p229&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 229 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

*Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was a proponent of the theory that Atta had met al-Ani in Prague, acknowledged in an interview on 29 March 2006&lt;blockquote&gt;We had one report early on from another intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker, Mohamed Atta, had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

*Spenser Ackerman wrote in November 2003 that&lt;blockquote&gt;Far from being &quot;harbored&quot; by Saddam, Ansar al Islam operated out of northeastern Iraq, an area under Kurdish control that was being protected from Saddam's incursions by U.S. warplanes.

*Ansar al-Islam was officially identified as a terrorist group by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury on 20 February 2003, just one month before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and just weeks after Powell's presentation to the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2003/17823.htm Designation of Ansar al-Islam]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until March 2004 that it was officially added to the U.S. list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/30649.htm Foreign Terrorist Organizations: Designation of Ansar al-Islam (Al), Redesignation of Three Others]&lt;/ref&gt;

The article also reported that&lt;blockquote&gt;Saddam has remained out of the public eye in his network of bunkers since the military alert at the end of August and moved his two wives, Sajida and Samira, away from the presidential palaces in Baghdad to Tikrit, his home town {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north.&lt;/blockquote&gt;While the article reports that the &quot;US is understood to have found no hard evidence linking Baghdad directly to the kamikaze attacks,&quot; it also cites Western intelligence officials as saying that&lt;blockquote&gt;the Iraqi leader had been providing al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, with funding, logistical back-up and advanced weapons training. His operations reached a 'frantic pace' in the past few months.&lt;ref name=&quot;berry_telegraph_2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In another article published on the same day, 23 September 2001, ''The Telegraph'' reported that
&lt;blockquote&gt;Iraq is one of the only countries that has not sent a message of sympathy or condolence to the US in the wake of the attacks. The state-run media seems to be gloating over America's catastrophe.
While distancing themselves from those attacks, Iraqi officials say the US got what it deserved.
In an interview, [[Naji Sabri]], the country's foreign minister, enumerated American &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, from [[Hiroshima]] to [[Vietnam]] and Central America to [[Palestine]], a bloody trail littered with millions of dead going back more than 50 years.

*The Duelfer Report noted Saddam's reaction to the 9/11 attacks, concluding that it was a result of his paranoia
&lt;blockquote&gt;Isolated internally by his paranoia over personal security, and externally by his misreading of international events, Saddam missed a major opportunity to reduce tensions with the United States following the 11&amp;nbsp;September 2001 terrorist attacks. By failing to condemn the attacks and express sympathy to the American people, Saddam reinforced US suspicions about his connections to Al Qaâida and certified Iraqâs credentials as a rogue state. He told his ministers that after all the hardships the Iraqi people had suffered under sanctions he could not extend official condolences to the United States, the government most responsible for blocking sanctions relief. From a practical standpoint, Saddam probably also believedâmistakenlyâthat his behavior toward the United States was of little consequence, as sanctions were on the verge of collapse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The internal debate among Iraqi officials, according to the Duelfer Report, suggested that these officials were wary of Iraq being wrongly associated with al-Qaeda&lt;blockquote&gt;Some ministers recognized that the United States intended to take direct unilateral action, if it perceived that its national security was endangered, and argued that the best course of action was to 'step forward and have a talk with the Americans.' Also concerned with the assertion of a connection between Iraq and its 'terrorist allies,' they felt they must 'clarify' to the Americans that 'we are not with the terrorists.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/cia/reports/iraq_wmd_2004/chap1.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abu Zubaydah said that he was not aware of a relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida.

During the debriefings, Abu Zubaydah offered his opinion that it would be extremely unlikely for bin Ladin to have agreed to ally with Iraq, due to his desire to keep the organization on track with its mission and maintain its operational independence.

Their numbers are believed to have been boosted recently by men fleeing the US military's recent Operation Anaconda in eastern Afghanistan...The Iraqi leader has reportedly dispatched some of his best troops to bolster Ansar al-Islam, despite a long-term hatred of Islamic fundamentalism, because the group is opposed to his enemies in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)...Links between Ansar al-Islam and Saddam were also alleged recently by [[Qassem Hussein Mohamed]], who claims that he worked for Baghdad's Mukhabarat intelligence for 20 years. Saddam had clandestinely supported Ansar al-Islam for several years, he said. &quot;[Ansar] and al-Qa'eda groups were trained by graduates of the Mukhabarat's School 999 â military intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/04/21/wiraq21.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2002/04/21/ixnewstop.html |title=Saddam 'sends troops to help bin Laden men' â Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London |first=Peter |last=Oborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''May â July''' : [[Abu Musab al Zarqawi]] allegedly recuperated in Baghdad after being wounded while fighting with [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]] fighters resisting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|United States invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060800299.html?nav=rss_world/africa |title=Al-Zarqawi's Biography |work=The Washington Post  |date= 8 June 2006|accessdate=7 July 2009 | first=Craig | last=Whitlock}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was allegedly wounded in a U.S. bombardment. Dozens of his followers came to Baghdad as well.

Jason Burke, author of ''Al Qaeda: The True Story of Radical Islam'', wrote that &quot;Stories that an injured leg had been amputated in Baghdad as al-Zarqawi was cared for by Saddam Hussein's personal physicians proved false.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke, ''Al Qaeda: The True Story of Radical Islam'' London: [[I.B. Tauris]], 2004) [ISBN 1-85043-666-5] p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote that &quot;What Powell did not say was that al-Zarqawi ... had operated independently of bin Laden, running his own training camp in the west of Afghanistan near Herat. It was a small operation and al-Zarqawi was not considered a significant player, by militants or Western and Middle Eastern intelligence services, at the time. It is likely that al-Zarqawi had some contact with bin Laden but never took the [[bayat]] and never made any formal allegiance with the Saudi or his close associates. Instead he was one of the thousands of foreign activists living and working in Afghanistan during the late 1990s.... al-Zarqawi was a rival, not an ally, of the Saudi.&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;270). An Israeli intelligence official noted that when bin Laden first met Zarqawi, &quot;it was loathing at first sight.&quot;  Mary Ann Weaver wrote, &quot;According to several different accounts of the meeting, bin Laden distrusted and disliked al-Zarqawi immediately. He suspected that the group of Jordanian prisoners with whom al-Zarqawi had been granted amnesty earlier in the year had been infiltrated by Jordanian intelligence... Bin Laden also disliked al-Zarqawi's swagger and the green tattoos on his left hand, which he reportedly considered un-Islamic. Had Saif al-Adel-now bin Laden's military chief-not intervened, history might be written very differently...As an Egyptian who had attempted to overthrow his own country's army-backed regime, al-Adel saw merit in al-Zarqawi's views. Thus, after a good deal of debate within al-Qaeda, it was agreed that al-Zarqawi would be given $5,000 or so in 'seed money' to set up his own training camp outside the western Afghan city of Herat, near the Iranian border. It was about as far away as he could be from bin Laden. Saif al-Adel was designated the middleman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Weaver, &quot;Inventing al-Zarqawi,&quot; ''Atlantic Monthly'' (July/August 2006) p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Counterterrorism experts told the ''Washington Post'' that while &quot;Zarqawi accepted al-Qaeda money to set up his own training camp in Afghanistan,... he ran it independently. While bin Laden was preparing the 11 Sept. hijacking plot, Zarqawi was focused elsewhere, scheming to topple the Jordanian monarchy and attack Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Whitlock, &quot;Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World,&quot; ''Washington Post'' (10 June 2006) p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weaver writes in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' that bin Laden found Zarqawi &quot;aggressively ambitious, abrasive, and overbearing&quot; and that he found his hatred of Shiites divisive (bin Laden's mother is a Shiite). Weaver reports that &quot;At least five times, in 2000 and 2001, bin Laden called al-Zarqawi to come to Kandahar and pay ''bayat'' â take an oath of allegianceâto him. Each time, al-Zarqawi refused. Under no circumstances did he want to become involved in the battle between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. He also did not believe that either bin Laden or the Taliban was serious enough about jihad. When the United States launched its air war inside Afghanistan, on 7 October 2001, al-Zarqawi joined forces with al-Qaeda and the Taliban for the first time. He and his Jund al-Sham fought in and around Herat and Kandahar.&quot;(p.&amp;nbsp;96)  When Zarqawi finally did take the oath in October 2004, it was &quot;only after eight months of often stormy negotiations.&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;98). Gary Gambill writes, &quot;While Zarqawi's network â by this time known as al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (Monotheism and Holy War) â was not completely independent of al-Qaeda, it was clearly autonomous. Zarqawi's men 'refused to march under the banner of another individual or group,' recalls Nu'man bin-Uthman, a Libyan Islamist leader now living in London who was in contact with Zarqawi at the time. During or shortly before the American-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Zarqawi returned to Iran, where he met with bin Laden's military chief, Muhammad Ibrahim Makawi (Saif al-Adel), who asked him to coordinate the entry of al-Qaeda operatives into Iraq through Syria. Zarqawi readily agreed and by the fall of 2003 a steady flow of Arab Islamists were infiltrating Iraq via Syria. Consequentially, Zarqawi came to be recognized as the regional &quot;emir&quot; of Islamist terrorists in Iraq â without (until last month) having sworn fealty to bin Laden.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=3179&amp;article_id=2369019 The Jamestown Foundation]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conservative newsmagazine the ''Weekly Standard'', which has generally trumpeted alleged ties between Saddam and al-Qaeda, published an article concluding that Zarqawi was not tied to either. On the alleged bin Laden connection, Nixon Center terrorism experts Robert S. Leiken and Stephen Brooke wrote:''Though he met with bin Laden in Afghanistan several times, the Jordanian never joined al Qaeda. Militants have explained that Tawhid was &quot;especially for Jordanians who did not want to join al Qaeda.&quot; A confessed Tawhid member even told his interrogators that Zarqawi was &quot;against al Qaeda.&quot; Shortly after 9/11, a fleeing Ramzi bin al-Shibh, one of the main plotters of the attacks, appealed to Tawhid operatives for a forged visa. He could not come up with ready cash. Told that he did not belong to Tawhid, he was sent packing and eventually into the arms of the Americans.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Font size Print E-mail Share By Bootie Cosgrove-Mather |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/18/opinion/main618114.shtml |title=Who Is Abu Zarqawi? , What We Know About The Terrorist Leader Who Murdered Nick Berg â CBS News |publisher=CBS News |date=18 May 2004 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Spencer Ackerman wrote in the ''Washington Monthly'' that &quot;U.S. intelligence had already concluded [in 2002] that Zarqawi's ties to al Qaeda were informal at best.&quot; He also noted that &quot;if Zarqawi's ties to al Qaeda were loose, his ties to Saddam were practically non-existent.&quot;  He argues that Saddam did not &quot;harbor&quot; Ansar al Islam, since they &quot;operated out of northeastern Iraq, an area under Kurdish control that was being protected from Saddam's incursions by U.S. warplanes. Indeed, some of its members fought against Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war. Powell asserted that Saddam dispatched an agent to Ansar to forge an alliance with the Kurdish terrorists. If true, the far more likely explanation, however, is that the dictator had placed an agent in the group not to aid them, as Powell implied to the Security Council, but to keep tabs on a potential threat to his own regime.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington Monthly Online |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0311.ackerman.html |title=&quot;The Weakest Link&quot; by Spencer Ackerman |publisher=Washingtonmonthly.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While U.S. officials now know that reports of al-Zarqawi's leg being amputated are incorrect, one official still believes that al-Zarqawi may have received medical treatment in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/06/15/bush.alqaeda/ |title= Bush stands by al Qaeda, Saddam link â 15&amp;nbsp;Jun 2004 |publisher=CNN  |date= 15 June 2004|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CIA report in late 2004 concluded that there was no evidence Saddam's government was involved or even aware of this medical treatment, and found &quot;no conclusive evidence the Saddam Hussein regime had harbored Zarqawi.

They pledged allegiance to al-Maqdisi and were in jail for five years. They were sentenced to 15 years. They served five years and then were pardoned. So they went to Afghanistan. Their ideology further developed there. Of course, they accused the government, the army, and the police of heresy. This is the most dangerous group. I understood that they had differences of opinion with bin Laden on a number of issues and positions. Of course, we understood that only later.

Counterterrorism scholar [[Loretta Napoleoni]] quotes former Jordanian parliamentarian Layth Shubaylat, who was personally acquainted with both Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein: &quot;'First of all, I don't think the two ideologies go together, I'm sure the former Iraqi leadership saw no interest in contacting al-Zarqawi or al-Qaeda operatives.

He said, however, &quot;We know Zarqawi better than he knows himself.

Although Saddam did not endorse al-Qaidaâs overall agenda and was suspicious of Islamist movements in general, he was apparently not averse, under certain circumstances, to enhancing bin Ladenâs operational capabilities.

:''What do we really know about Abu-Sayyaf's al-Qaeda connection? A brother-in-law of Osamu bin Laden, who has two Filipino wives, reportedly dispensed money to Abu Sayyaf in the early 1990s. He also, according to the first substantial CNN report on the Filipino action (&quot;Live from the Philippines,&quot; 25 January), funded the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which signed a ceasefire with the Arroyo government last August.

The report states &quot;We have reporting from reliable clandestine and press sources that (deleted) direct meetings between senior Iraqi representatives and top al-Qaida operatives took place from the early 1990s to the present.&quot; (Page 326)  The report concludes that &quot;In contrast to the patron-client pattern between Iraq and its Palestinian surrogates, the relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida appears to more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying to exploit each other â their mutual suspicion suborned by al-Qaida's interest in Iraqi assistance, and Baghdad's interest in al-Qaida's anti-U.S. attacksâ¦. The Intelligence Community has no credible information that Baghdad had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks or any other al-Qaida strike.&quot; (Page 332)&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligence.senate.gov/iraqreport2.pdf Prewar Intelligence Assessment (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also questioned the information coming from captured al-Qaeda leader [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]], determining that the al-Qaeda leader was not in a position to know about any links to Saddam Hussein and that his stories were likely fabrications.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek_deadlink&quot;/&gt;  Nevertheless, this information was cited uncritically by Colin Powell in his speech to the [[United Nations Security Council]] in February 2003.

::&quot;According to several intelligence officials I spoke to, the relationship between bin Laden and Saddam's regime was brokered in the early nineteen-nineties by the then de-facto leader of Sudan, the pan-Islamist radical Hassan al-Tourabi.

::Ambassador Bremer: He did not say that there was no connection between terrorism and Saddam.

::Senator Feingold: No, I agree with that.

::Ambassador Bremer: I just want to correct the record.

::Senator Feingold: What I am indicating is that the American people in polling believed, at the time of the invasion of Iraq, that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11. So what I am suggesting is, the sloppiness in this regard is unfair to the American people.

* '''16 June''':   U.S. attorney [[Patrick J. Fitzgerald]], who oversaw the government's case against al Qaeda members accused of bombing U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, testifies to the 9/11 Commission. He told the Commission that a [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] indictment that mentioned ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda had been superseded by a later indictment which dropped the language because it could not be confirmed by investigators. In his testimony he states:  &quot;And the question of relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda is an interesting one. I don't have information post-2001 when I got involved in a trial, and I don't have information post-11 September. I can tell you what led to that inclusion in that sealed indictment in May and then when we superseded, which meant we broadened the charges in the Fall, we dropped that language. We understood there was a very, very intimate relationship between al Qaeda and the Sudan. They worked hand in hand. We understood there was a working relationship with Iran and Hezbollah, and they shared training. We also understood that there had been antipathy between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein was not viewed as being religious. We did understand from people, including al-Fadlâand my recollection is that he would have described this most likely in public at the trial that we had, but I can't tell you that for sure; that was a few years agoâthat at a certain point they decided that they wouldn't work against each other and that we believed a fellow in al Qaeda named Mondu Saleem, Abu Harzai the Iraqi, tried to reach a, sort of, understanding where they wouldn't work against each other. Sort of, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And that there were indications that within Sudan when al Qaeda was thereâwhich al Qaeda left in the summer of '96 or spring '96âthere were efforts to work on jointâyou know, acquiring weapons. Clearly, al Qaeda worked with the Sudan in getting those weapons in the national defense force there and the intelligence service. There were indications that al-Fadl had heard from others that Iran was involved. And they also had heard that Iraq was involved. The clearest account from al-Fadl as a Sudanese was that he had dealt directly with the Sudanese intelligence service, so we had firsthand knowledge of that. We corroborated the relationship with Iran to a lesser extent but to a solid extent. And then we had information from al-Fadl, who we believe was truthful, learning from others that there were also was efforts to try to work with Iraq. That was the basis for what we put in that indictment. Clearly, we put Sudan in the first order at that time as being the partner of al Qaeda. We understood the relationship with Iran but Iraq, we understood, went from a position where they were working against each other to a standing down against each other. And we understood they were going to explore the possibility of working on weapons together. That's my piece of what I know. I don't represent to know everything else, so I can't tell you, well, what we've learned since then. But there was that relationship that went from opposing each other to not opposing each other to possibly working with each other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A46525-2004Jun16?language=printer washingtonpost.com: Transcript: 9/11 Commission Hearings for 16 June 2004]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''30 July''', [[Center for Policing Terrorism]]:   &quot;Formed in December 2001 out of a conglomeration of Kurdish Islamist groups, [Ansar al-Islam] is closely allied with and receives both ideological and strategic inspiration from al Qaeda. A number of Ansar members trained at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, and the group provided safe haven to al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups until its operations were disrupted during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)...In August 2002, Dr. Rohan Gunaratna, who has described Ansar as a 'very important' group within the larger framework of bin Laden's World Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders stated, '[Ansar] has received limited support from Iraq, and I stress limited.'  According to Dr. Gunaratna, Ansar received support from Iraqi agents with the specific intention of infiltrating the anti-PUK group and not to strengthen the Islamist group; Ansar remains an anti-Saddam and an anti-Western group. Some commentators would draw a different conclusion with respect to the nature of Ansarâs relationship with Saddam, especially in the period immediately prior to OIF. According various reports, as well as claims made by US and PUK officials prior to OIF, the Iraqi regime helped to smuggle weapons to Ansar from Afghanistan. According to another report, PUK explosives experts believe that the Iraqi military intelligence supplied Ansar with TNT, which was in addition to other weaponry that was supplied to Ansar from areas under Baathist control. Another indication of links between al Qaeda and Saddam Husseinâs regime, which the Bush administration cited, are the activities of Abu Musab Zarqawi, who is believed to have run one of Ansar's terrorist training camps in northern Iraq prior to OIF.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt-mi.org/Ansar%20al-Islam%20Final.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Ansar al-Islam Final.rtf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 July 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080418011308/http://www.cpt-mi.org/Ansar+al-Islam+Final.pdf| archivedate = 18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this document, Dr. Gunaratna noted that Saddam's relationship with Ansar was one of spying and infiltration rather than cooperation: &quot;Qassem Hussein, another Iraqi intelligence officer now in Kurdish custody, has stated that Abu Wael is the true leader within Ansar. However, Rohan Gunaratna believes that Qassem Hussein is likely to be a penetration agent with hidden loyalties to Saddam. As Ansar was anti-PUK and the PUK was supported by the U.S. Saddam was very interested to use Ansar against the PUK. Therefore, Qassem may have been providing Abu Wael with a cover story.&quot;  Dr. Gunaratna concluded in his own study of the relationship between Iraq and al-Qaeda that &quot;there is no conclusive evidence of Iraqi assistance to Al Qaeda... The documentation and interviews indicated that Al Qaeda regarded Saddam, a secular leader, as an infidel&quot; and warned in February 2003 that &quot;an invasion of Iraq would give a new lease on life to existing and emerging terrorist groups.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/2003/0219alliance.htm |title=Iraq and Al Qaeda: No Evidence of Alliance â UN Security Council â Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''29 August''':  In an interview with [[Agence France-Presse]], Hudayfa Azzam, the son of [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], claimed Saddam Hussein &quot;strictly and directly controlled&quot; members of al Qaeda in Iraq before the US invasion. According to Hudayfa Azzam, Arabs who fought in Afghanistan began going to Iraq after the 11 September attacks because they wanted to flee Afghanistan and take advantage of a situation which was still stable in Iraq. The AFP quoted Hudayfa as saying, &quot;[al Qaeda] infiltrated into Iraq with the help of Kurdish mujahideen from Afghanistan, across mountains in Iran,&quot; and when the possibility of a US-led invasion became clearer &quot;Saddam Hussein's regime welcomed them with open arms and young Al Qaeda members entered Iraq in large numbers, setting up an organisation to confront the occupation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20040830013931.jsp ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Azzam made it clear that the cooperation was caused by the imminent U.S. occupation.

* '''16 February''': former National Intelligence Officer [[Paul R. Pillar]] appears on the ''[[Charlie Rose Show]].

They were also an active sponsor of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian group, which killed Americans way back in the â in the '70s, but more recently has been focusing its aim at the clerical regime in Iran. But in terms of it having provided support or sustenance or strength, or having anything close to an alliance with al Qaeda, it simply wasn't there.&quot;  Pillar also appeared on the [[NPR]] show [[Fresh Air]] and offered the following elaboration: &quot;Well, what was found â and this has been the pretty consistent story all along with regard to intelligence coverage of that topic â is there were various data points that were relevant to that issue, even some encounters or meetings held years ago in Sudan, other kinds of coincidences or two different names appearing in the same place. What it all added up to in the view of the judgment â in the judgment of the intelligence analysts working those particular issues was that you had two entities, one the Saddam regime and the other al-Qaeda, that were kind of feeling each other out, trying to stay aware of what they were doing, what each other was doing, but no indication of anything that could be described as a patron-client relationship or a sponsor-client relationship or an alliance. There were some of these coincidences and contacts, but that's hardly anything out of the ordinary and not something that adds up to state sponsorship.&quot; Pillar later gave an interview to [[Voice of America]], confirming that the Administration distorted intelligence findings to try to claim the opposite: &quot;The main thing that happened there, particularly with reference to this issue of, was there a relationship between the Saddam regime and al-Qaida â was a selective use of bits and pieces of reporting to try to build the case that in this case there was some kind of alliance without really reflecting the analytic judgment of the intelligence community that there was not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/feb/1158.html |title=Controversy Deepens Over Iraq Prewar Intelligence |publisher=Payvand.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''23 February''': [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] publishes a book titled ''The Secret History of Al-Qaâida''. In it, he writes: &quot;Like Zarqawi, many Arabs fleeing American retaliation in Afghanistan after 9/11 found refuge with Ansar al-Islam. But then came an unexpected development. According to Dr [[Muhammad al-Masari]], a Saudi specialist on Al-Qaedaâs ideology, Saddam established contact with the 'Afghan Arabs' as early as 2001, believing he would be targeted by the US once the Taliban was routed. In this version, disputed by other commentators, Saddam funded Al-Qaeda operatives to move into Iraq with the proviso that they would not undermine his regime. Sources close to the Baâath regime have told me that Saddam also used to send messengers to buy small plots of land from farmers in Sunni areas. In the middle of the night soldiers would bury arms and money caches for later use by the resistance. According to Masari, Saddam saw that Islam would be key to a cohesive resistance in the event of invasion. Iraqi army commanders were ordered to become practising Muslims and to adopt the language and spirit of the jihadis. On arrival in Iraq, Al-Qaeda operatives were put in touch with these commanders, who later facilitated the distribution of arms and money from Saddamâs caches. Most commentators agree that Al-Qaeda was present in Iraq before the US invasion. The question is for how long and to what extent. What is known is that Zarqawi took a direct role in Al-Qaedaâs infiltration. In March 2003 â it is not clear whether this was before or after the invasion began â he met Al-Qaedaâs military strategist, an Egyptian called Muhammad Ibrahim Makkawi, and agreed to assist Al-Qaeda operatives entering Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=15900 |title=Total war: Inside the new Al-Qaeda  |publisher=Middle East Online |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These documents have been hailed by some supporters of the invasion as a possible &quot;[[smoking gun]]&quot; connecting Saddam's Iraq to al-Qaeda terrorists and Representative Hoekstra has been calling for their release to the public; those released so far, however, fail to provide evidence of any such connection. According to Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, the release of the documents &quot;looks like an effort to discover a retrospective justification for the war in Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-ushussein17mar17,1,2360853.story]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pentagon cautions that the government &quot;has made no determination regarding the authenticity of the documents, validity or factual accuracy of the information contained therein, or the quality of any translations, when available.&quot; One of the documents, which seems to have been trumpeted by Stephen Hayes earlier in the year as proof that &quot;thousands&quot; of al-Qaeda terrorists were trained in Iraq between 1999 and 2002 to fight in Afghanistan, is according to the Pentagon simply an investigation of a rumor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents-docex/Iraq/ISGQ-2003-00004500-1.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pentagon synopsis of the document reads: &quot;Fedayeen Saddam received news of a rumor that 3,000 volunteers from Iraq and Saudi Arabia had traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Mujahideen against the US.

The Pentagon summary of the document indicates that Iraqi intelligence suspected these people to be members of al-Qaeda but provides no indication that they trained or supported them. Indeed, an [[Associated Press]] translation of the document suggests that the letter warned Iraqi agents to &quot;be on the lookout&quot; for Zarqawi and other al Qaeda agents; AP reports that &quot;Attached were three responses in which agents said there was no evidence al-Zarqawi or the other man were in Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;  A third document, dated 15 September 2001, describes what an Afghan informant told Iraqi intelligence about statements made by Afghan consul Ahmed Dahastani.

That the U.S. has proof the Iraqi government and 'bin Laden's group' agreed to cooperate to attack targets inside America. That in case the Taliban and bin Laden's group turn out to be involved in 'these destructive operations,' the U.S. may strike Iraq and Afghanistan.

And it is the first time that the parliament of a country (U.S. Congress) speaks after a resolution (unclear) and comes out through the Security Council. It is ignorant to send memos and complain to the Security Council because it is a tool in the hands of America the master of oppression and if we do that it does not mean that we are boycotting the diplomatic process. Also the monetary fund (Translator's note: probably the International Monetary Fund) is in the hand of America and she helps according to her interests.

These men have military IDs. The instruction references an intelligence manual. The letter mentions 'trusted' Afghans, so we know they are working in cooperation with forces in Afghanistan. It is highly unlikely that any military would send a semi-permanent contingent with families into Afghanistan for cooperation or training unless the Afghan organization was stable and in control.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Postwar Findings&quot; volume of the study concluded that there was no evidence of any Iraqi support of al-Qaeda, al-Zarqawi, or Ansar al-Islam. The &quot;Iraqi National Congress&quot; volume concluded that &quot;false information&quot; from INC-affiliated sources was used to justify key claims in the prewar intelligence debate and that this information was &quot;widely distributed in intelligence products&quot; prior to the war. It also concluded that the INC &quot;attempted to influence US policy on Iraq by providing false information through defectors directed at convincing the United States that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to terrorists.&quot;  The Senate report noted that in October 2002, &quot;the DIA cautioned that the INC was penetrated by hostile intelligence services and would use the relationship to promote its own agenda.&quot;

* '''14 September''': Washington, D.C. â In a speech to the [[Brookings Institution]], the Kurdish Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, [[Barham Salih]], who was imprisoned in Saddam's Iraq, contradicted the Senate Report, asserting that &quot;The alliance between the Baathists and jihadists which sustains Al Qaeda in Iraq is not new, contrary to what you may have been told. I know this at firsthand. Some of my friends were murdered by jihadists, by Al Qaeda-affiliated operatives who had been sheltered and assisted by Saddam's regime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/39631 Iraqi Official Testifies to Links Between Saddam and Al Qaeda] â 14 September 2006 â The New York Sun&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to [[Ansar al-Islam]], an organization that the Senate Committee concluded that Saddam's government spied on, but did not support. Salih claims to have presented the CIA with evidence in 2002 of an assassination attempt against him by Ansar al-Islam that was funded by Saddam's Republican Guard. Salih acknowledges of his claim that &quot;we could not prove this in a court of law, but this is intelligence.&quot; The Senate Report concluded that prewar interactions between Saddam Hussein's government and Ansar al-Islam were attempts by Saddam to spy on the group rather than to support or work with them. &quot;Postwar information reveals that Baghdad viewed Ansar al-Islam as a threat to the regime and that the IIS attempted to collect intelligence on the group.&quot;
