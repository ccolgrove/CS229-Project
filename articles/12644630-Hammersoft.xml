'''''With a Twist...''''' is a 1997 [[album]] by [[Todd Rundgren]]. Asked to produce an album of new versions of his older singles, Rundgren decided to record the songs in [[Bossa nova]] style with elements of [[Exotica]], complete with tropical bird call effects at the beginning of ''Hello, It's Me'' similar to [[Martin Denny]]'s recording ''Quiet Village''. Continuing the theme, Rundgren toured theaters with a replica of a [[tiki]] bar, the performers on a very small stage with selected audience members being seated at tables also on the theater stage, and being served drinks by the monitor engineer/bartender. The performers never acknowledged the larger theater audience, and the show ended when the last &quot;bar patron&quot; left the stage.
