The originator of the &quot;[[Wall of Sound]]&quot; production technique, Spector was a pioneer of the 1960s [[Girl group|girl-group]] sound and produced over 25 [[Top 40]] hits in 1960â1965. After this initial success, Spector later worked with artists including [[Ike and Tina Turner]], [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], and the [[Ramones]] with similar acclaim. He produced [[The Beatles]]' [[Academy Award]] winning album ''[[Let It Be]]'', and the [[Grammy|Grammy Award]]âwinning [[The Concert for Bangla Desh|Concert for Bangladesh]] by former Beatle [[George Harrison]]. In 1989, Spector was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a non-performer. The 1965 song &quot;[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]&quot;, produced and co-written by Spector for [[The Righteous Brothers]], is listed by [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] as the song with the most U.S. airplay in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/232893 &quot;BMI Announces Top 100 Songs of the Century&quot;] from BMI website&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson in his [[Alhambra, California]] home led to his 2009 conviction of [[murder]] in the second degree. He is serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn_sentencing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/29/spector.sentencing/index.html|title=Phil Spector gets 19 years to life for murder of actress|date=2009-05-29|accessdate=2009-05-30|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|author=Duke, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early childhood==
Spector was born on December 26, 1939, to a [[American middle class#Lower middle class|lower-middle-class]] [[Jewish]] family in the [[Bronx]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/bc/1998/11/cov_10bc.html|title=Salon Brilliant Careers|publisher=Salon.com|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=a-F4AmTkYgwC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=russian+jew+phil+spector&amp;source=web&amp;ots=R88sbaU1S9&amp;sig=qQAMlSFcPM6XXxd3VH4zl_n_yo8 Phil Spector: Out of His Head] by Richard Williams.

==Musical career==
===Teenage performer and lyricist===
In Los Angeles, Spector got involved with music, learning the guitar. At 16, he performed [[Lonnie Donegan]]'s version of the traditional song &quot;[[Rock Island Line (song)|Rock Island Line]]&quot; at a talent show at his high school, [[Fairfax High School (Los Angeles)|Fairfax High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|month=December|year=2002|isbn=0-8230-7646-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Fairfax, he joined a loosely knit community of aspiring musicians, including [[Lou Adler]], [[Bruce Johnston]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], and [[Sandy Nelson]], the last of whom played drums on Spector's first record release, &quot;[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;virgin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music|publisher=[[Virgin Publishing]]| month=March|year=2002|isbn=1-85227-923-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Teddy Bears===
With three friends from high school, Marshall Lieb, Harvey Goldstein, and singer [[Carol Connors (singer)|Annette Kleinbard]], Spector formed a group, [[The Teddy Bears]]. During this period, Spector also began visiting local recording studios, and he eventually managed to win the confidence of record producer Stan Ross, coowner of [[Gold Star Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], who began to tutor the young man in record production and who exerted a major influence on Spector's production style. By early 1958, Spector and his bandmates had raised enough money to buy two hours of recording time at Gold Star. With Spector producing, the Teddy Bears recorded the Spector-penned &quot;Don't You Worry My Little Pet&quot;, which helped them secure a deal with Era Records. At their next session, they recorded another song Spector had written â this one inspired by the [[epitaph]] on Spector's father's tombstone. Released on [[Era Records|Era's]] subsidiary label, Dore Records, &quot;[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]&quot; went to #1 on ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' singles chart, selling over a million copies by year's end.  It was the seventh number one single on the newly formed chart.

Following the success of their debut, the group signed with [[Imperial Records]], but their next single, &quot;I Don't Need You Anymore&quot; only reached #91. While several more recordings were released, including an album ''The Teddy Bears Sing!'', the group never again charted in the Hot 100. The Teddy Bears went their separate ways in 1959.

===Record producer===
After the split, Spector's career quickly moved from performing and songwriting to production. While recording the Teddy Bears' album, Spector had met [[Lester Sill]], a former promotion man who was a mentor to [[Jerry Leiber]] and [[Mike Stoller]]. His next project, the Spectors Three, was undertaken under the aegis of Sill and his partner, [[Lee Hazlewood]]. In 1960, Sill arranged for Spector to work as an apprentice to Leiber and Stoller in New York.

Spector quickly learned how to use a studio. He co-wrote the [[Ben E. King]] Top 10 hit &quot;[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]&quot; with Jerry Leiber and also worked as a session musician, most notably playing the guitar solo on [[the Drifters]]' song, &quot;[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]&quot;. His own productions during this time, while less conspicuous, included releases by [[LaVern Baker]], [[Ruth Brown]], and Billy Storm, as well as the Top Notes' original version of &quot;[[Twist and Shout]]&quot;. Leiber and Stoller recommended Spector to produce [[Ray Peterson]]'s &quot;[[Corrina, Corrina (song)|Corrina, Corrina]]&quot;, which reached #9 in January 1961. Later, he produced another major hit for [[Curtis Lee]], &quot;Pretty Little Angel Eyes&quot;, which made it to #7. Returning to Hollywood, Spector agreed to produce one of Lester Sill's acts. After both [[Liberty Records]] and [[Capitol Records]] turned down the master of &quot;Be My Boy&quot; by the [[Paris Sisters]], Sill formed a new label, [[Gregmark Records]], with [[Lee Hazlewood]] and released it. It only managed to reach #56, but the follow-up, &quot;[[I Love How You Love Me]]&quot;, was a smash, reaching #5. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Philles Records===
In late 1961, Spector formed a new record company with Lester Sill, who by this time had ended his business partnership with Hazlewood. [[Philles Records]] combined the names of its two founders. Through Hill and Range Publishers, Spector found three groups he wanted to produce: the Ducanes, the Creations, and [[The Crystals]]. The first two signed with other companies, but Spector managed to secure the Crystals for his new label. Their first single, &quot;[[There's No Other (Like My Baby)]]&quot; was a success, hitting #20. Their next release, &quot;Uptown&quot;, made it to #13.

Spector continued to work freelance with other artists. In 1962, he produced &quot;Second Hand Love&quot; by [[Connie Francis]], which reached #7. In the early 1960s, he briefly worked with [[Atlantic Records]]' [[R&amp;B]] artists [[Ruth Brown]] and [[LaVerne Baker]]. [[Ahmet ErtegÃ¼n]] of Atlantic paired Spector with [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star Jean DuShon for &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of which was &quot;Tired of Trying&quot;, written by DuShon.

Spector briefly took a job as head of [[A&amp;R]] for [[Liberty Records]]. It was while working at Liberty that he heard a song written by [[Gene Pitney]], for whom he had produced a #41 hit, &quot;Every Breath I Take&quot;, a year earlier. &quot;[[He's a Rebel]]&quot; was due to be released on Liberty by [[Vikki Carr]], but Spector rushed into Gold Star Studios and recorded a cover version using [[Darlene Love]] and the Blossoms on lead vocals. The record was released on Philles, attributed to the Crystals, and quickly rose to the top of the charts.

By the time &quot;He's a Rebel&quot; went to #1, Lester Sill was out of the company, and Spector had Philles all to himself. He created a new act, [[Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue Jeans]], featuring Darlene Love, Fanita James (a member of the Blossoms), and Bobby Sheen, a singer he had worked with at Liberty. The group had hits with &quot;[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]&quot; (#8), &quot;Why Do Lovers Break Each Otherâs Hearts?&quot; (#38), and &quot;Not Too Young To Get Married&quot; (#63). Spector also released solo material by Darlene Love in 1963. In the same year, he released &quot;[[Be My Baby]]&quot; by the [[Ronettes]], which went to #2.

Although predominantly a singles-based label, Philles released a few albums, one of which was the perennial seller ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records]]'' in 1963.

===The Wall of Sound===
{{Main|Wall of Sound}}

Spector's trademark during that era was the so-called [[Wall of Sound]], a production technique yielding a dense, layered effect that reproduced well on [[AM radio]] and [[jukebox]]es. To attain this signature sound, Spector gathered large groups of musicians (playing some instruments not generally used for ensemble playing, such as [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitars]]) playing orchestrated parts &amp;mdash; often doubling and tripling many instruments playing in [[unison]] &amp;mdash; for a fuller sound. Spector himself called his technique &quot;a [[Wagnerian]] approach to rock &amp; roll: little symphonies for the kids&quot;.

While Spector directed the overall sound of his recordings, he took a relatively hands-off approach to working with the musicians themselves (usually a core group that became known as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], including session players such as [[Hal Blaine]], [[Larry Knechtel]], [[Steve Douglas (saxophonist)|Steve Douglas]], [[Carol Kaye]], [[Roy Caton]], [[Glen Campbell]], and [[Leon Russell]]), delegating arrangement duties to [[Jack Nitzsche]] and having [[Sonny Bono]] oversee the performances, viewing these two as his &quot;lieutenants&quot;.

Spector frequently used songs from songwriters employed at the [[Brill Building]] (Trio Music) and at 1650 Broadway (Aldon Music), such as the teams of [[Ellie Greenwich]] and [[Jeff Barry]], [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]], and [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]]. Spector often worked with the songwriters, receiving co-credit and publishing royalties for compositions.

{{see|History of multitrack recording}}

Spector was already known as a temperamental and quirky personality with strong, often unconventional ideas about musical and recording techniques. Despite the trend towards multichannel recording, Spector was vehemently opposed to [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] releases, claiming that it took control of the record's sound away from the producer in favor of the listener. Spector was more concerned with the overall collage of sound than with the recording fidelity or [[timbral]] quality. Sometimes a pair of strings or horns would be double-tracked multiple times to sound like an entire string or horn section. But in the final product the background sometimes could not be distinguished as either horns or strings. Spector also greatly preferred singles to albums, describing [[LP album|LPs]] as &quot;two hits and ten pieces of junk&quot;, reflecting both his commercial methods and those of many other producers at the time.

The first time Spector put the same amount of effort into an LP as he did into [[Gramophone record|45s]] was when he utilized the full Philles roster and the Wrecking Crew to make what he felt would become a hit for the 1963 Christmas season. ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records]]'' arrived in stores the day of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. The somber mood of the country may have contributed to the album being a flop in its initial release. Despite its initially poor reception, selections from the album are now Yuletide mainstays on radio stations, and the album has since been a regular seller during the holiday season.

===The mid-Sixties===
In 1964, The Ronettes appeared at the [[Cow Palace]], near [[San Francisco]]. Also on the bill were the [[Righteous Brothers]]. Spector, who was conducting the band for all the acts, was so impressed with [[Bill Medley]] and [[Bobby Hatfield]] that he bought their contract from [[Moonglow Records]] and signed them to Philles. In early 1965, &quot;[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]&quot;, became the label's second #1 single. Three more major hits with the group followed: &quot;[[Just Once in My Life]]&quot; (#9), &quot;[[Unchained Melody]]&quot; (originally the B side of &quot;Hung On You&quot;) (#4) and &quot;[[Ebb Tide (song)|Ebb Tide]]&quot; (#5). Despite having hits, Spector lost interest in producing the Righteous Brothers, and sold their contract and all their master recordings to [[Verve Records]]. However, the sound of the Righteous Brothers' singles was so distinctive that the act chose to replicate it after leaving Spector, notching a second #1 hit in 1966 with the Bill Medley-produced, &quot;(You're My) Soul and Inspiration&quot;.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EasyRider 01.jpg|262px|thumb|left|Spector, in character, in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'']] --&gt;The Spector-produced recording of &quot;[[Unchained Melody]]&quot; had a second wave of popularity 25 years after its initial release, when it was featured prominently in the 1990 hit movie, ''[[Ghost (film)|Ghost]]''. A re-release of the single re-charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], and went to number one on the [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Contemporary charts]]. This also put Spector (as a producer) back on the U.S. Top 40 charts for the first time since his last appearance in 1971 with [[John Lennon]]'s &quot;[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]&quot;, although he did have U.K. top 40 hits in the interim with the [[Ramones]].

Spector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of [[Ike and Tina Turner]] in 1966. Spector considered their recording of &quot;[[River Deep â Mountain High]]&quot;, to be his best work,&lt;ref name=pc21&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19772/m1/ |title=Show 21 - Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages. Part 2&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it failed to go any higher than #88 in the United States. The single, which was essentially a solo [[Tina Turner]] record, was more successful in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], reaching #3.

Spector subsequently lost enthusiasm for his label and the recording industry. Already something of a [[recluse]], he withdrew temporarily from the public eye, marrying [[Ronnie Spector|Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Bennett]], lead singer of the Ronettes, in 1968. Spector emerged briefly for a cameo as a drug dealer in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'', in 1969. (He had also, in 1967, appeared as himself in an episode of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''.)

===Comeback===
In 1969, Spector made a brief return to the music business by signing a production deal with [[A&amp;M Records]]. A Ronettes single, &quot;You Came, You Saw, You Conquered&quot; flopped, but Spector returned to the Hot 100 with &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, by [[Sonny Charles]] and the [[Checkmates, Ltd.]].  The record reached #13.

In 1970, [[Allen Klein]], manager of the [[Beatles]], brought Spector to England. While producing [[John Lennon]]'s hit solo single &quot;[[Instant Karma!]]&quot;, which went to #3, Spector was invited by Lennon and [[George Harrison]] to take on the task of turning the Beatles' abandoned &quot;[[Get Back]]&quot; recording sessions into a usable album. Spector went to work using many of his production techniques, making significant changes to the arrangements and sound of some songs. The resulting album, ''[[Let It Be]]'', was a massive commercial success and topped the US and UK charts. The album also yielded three #1 singles: &quot;[[Get Back]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Long and Winding Road]]&quot; and &quot;[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]&quot;. His overdubbing of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; infuriated its composer, [[Paul McCartney]], especially since the work was allegedly completed without his knowledge and without any opportunity for him to assess the results. In 2003, McCartney spearheaded the release of ''[[Let It Be... Naked]]'', which stripped the songs of Spector's input. Spector later stated that McCartney's complaints were &quot;bullshit&quot;: it had not stopped McCartney from accepting the &quot;Best Musical Score&quot; award at the 1971 [[Academy Awards]] for the ''Let It Be'' soundtrack.

John Lennon and [[George Harrison]] were satisfied with the results, and ''Let It Be'' led to Spector co-producing albums with both ex-Beatles. For George Harrison's multiplatinum album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' (#1, 1970), Spector provided a cathedral-like sonic ambiance, complete with ornate orchestrations and gospel-like choirs. The LP yielded two major hits: &quot;[[My Sweet Lord]]&quot; (#1) and &quot;[[What Is Life]]&quot; (#10). That same year, Spector co-produced John Lennon's ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band|Plastic Ono Band]]'' (#6) album, which featured a very different, sparse and raw sound.

In 1971, Spector was named director of A&amp;R for [[Apple Records]]. He held the post for only a year, but during that time he co-produced the single &quot;[[Power to the People (song)|Power to the People]]&quot; with John Lennon (#11), as well as Lennon's chart-topping ''[[Imagine (album)|Imagine]]'' album. The album's title track hit #3 upon its release and #1 after Lennon's murder in 1980. With George Harrison, Spector co-produced Harrison's &quot;[[Bangla-Desh]]&quot; (a #23 hit) and wife Ronnie Spector's &quot;[[Try Some, Buy Some]]&quot; (#77). Also that year, Spector recorded the music for the #1 triple album ''[[The Concert For Bangladesh]]''. The album later won the &quot;Album of the Year&quot; award at the 1972 [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]]. Despite being recorded live, Spector used up to 44 microphones simultaneously to create his trademark Wall of Sound.

Lennon retained Spector for the 1971 [[Christmas]] single &quot;[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]&quot; and the poorly-reviewed 1972 album ''[[Some Time In New York City]]'' (#48). Similar to the unusual pattern of success that Spector's ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Philles Records]]'' experienced, &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; also stalled in sales upon its initial release, only later to become a fixture on radio station playlists during the holiday season. In 1973, Spector participated in the recording sessions for what would be Lennon's ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' album (#6). It was during these sessions that Spector's relationship with Lennon became strained; some versions claim that the producer suffered a breakdown in the studio, brandishing a gun and disappearing with the ''Rock 'n' Roll'' tapes, although Spector biographer Dave Thompson places most of the blame on the out-of-control behavior of Lennon and his entourage. After several months, Lennon retrieved the tapes and finished the album himself. In the years following the debacle, however, Spector maintained contact with Lennon, and the former Beatle had planned on recording with him again.&lt;ref&gt;Editing the Beatles: Addressing the Roles of Authority and Editorial Theory in the Creation of Popular Music's Most Valuable Canon. K WOMACK - Text: An Interdisciplinary Annual of Textual Scholarship. 1998. University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
As the 1970s progressed, Spector became increasingly reclusive. The most probable and significant reason for his withdrawal, recently revealed by biographer Dave Thompson, was that Spector was seriously injured when he was thrown through the windshield of his car in a crash in Hollywood. According to a contemporary report published in the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', Spector was almost killed, and it was only because the attending police officer detected a faint pulse that Spector was not declared dead at the scene. He was admitted to the [[UCLA Medical Center]] on the night of March 31, 1974, suffering serious head injuries which necessitated several hours of surgery with over 300 stitches to his face, and more than 400 stitches to the back of his head. His head injuries, Thompson suggests, were the reason that Spector began his habit of wearing outlandish wigs in later years.

The 1974 accident took place shortly after Spector had established the [[Warner-Spector Records|Warner-Spector]] label with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which undertook new recordings with [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], [[Cher]], [[Harry Nilsson]] and others, as well as several reissues. A similar relationship with Britain's [[Polydor Records]] led to the formation of the Phil Spector International label in 1975.

After a pair of failed singles with [[Cher]], Spector produced Dionâs ''[[Born to Be with You (album)|Born to Be with You]]''. Despite lukewarm reviews, artists like [[Bruce Springsteen]] heralded the album as a masterpiece.

The majority of Spector's classic Philles recordings had been out of print in the U.S. since the original label's demise, although Spector had released several Philles Records compilations in Britain. Finally, he released an American compilation of his Philles recordings in 1977, which put most of the better known Spector hits back into circulation after many years.

Spector began to reemerge in the late 1970s, producing and co-writing a controversial 1977 album by [[Leonard Cohen]], entitled ''[[Death of a Ladies' Man]]''.  The album angered many devout Cohen fans who were used to his stark acoustic sound versus the orchestral and choral wall of sound the album contains. The recording of the album was fraught with difficulty. After Cohen had laid down practice vocal tracks, Spector reportedly mixed the album in &quot;secret&quot; studio sessions, literally locking Cohen, who usually took a strong role in the mixing, out of the studio. Cohen said Spector once threatened him with a [[crossbow]], a claim, according to newspaper reports, others would make about their dealings with Spector. Cohen has remarked that the end result is &quot;grotesque&quot;, but also &quot;semi-virtuous&quot;. Cohen, however, still includes a reworked version of the track &quot;Memories&quot; in live concerts. [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] also participated in the background vocals on &quot;Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On&quot;, which is the second time Spector indirectly &quot;produced&quot; Dylan â the first being Dylan's live recordings on ''The Concert For Bangladesh''.

Spector also produced the much-publicized [[Ramones]] album, ''[[End of the Century]]'' in 1980. As with his work with Leonard Cohen, ''End of the Century'' received negative backlash from Ramones fans who were angered over the radio-friendly sound of the album. However, ''End of the Century'' contains some of the best known and most successful Ramones singles such as &quot;[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]&quot;, &quot;[[Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?]]&quot; and their cover of a previously released Spector song for the Ronettes, &quot;[[Baby, I Love You]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Whatever their differences, [[Ramones|the band]] still namechecked Spector in the song &quot;It's not my place (in the 9 to 5 world)&quot; on their next album, [[Pleasant Dreams]]&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] later commented on working with Spector on the recording of the album, &quot;It really worked when he got to a slower song like '[[Danny Says]]' â the production really worked tremendously. For the harder stuff, it didn't work as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=jrst&gt;{{cite web| author = Devenish, Colin| title =Johnny Ramone Stays Tough: Ramones Guitarist Reflects on Dee Dee's Death and the Difficult Eighties| work = Rolling Stone| date = June 24, 2002| url =http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theramones/articles/story/5934320/johnny_ramone_stays_tough| accessdate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumors had circulated for years that Spector had threatened members of the Ramones with a gun during the sessions. [[Johnny Ramone]] remembered a meeting at Spector's home in which the producer became upset when they tried to leave. &quot;And then he reaches into his jacket pocket and well, he pulls out a gun, puts it on the table right in front of us, and says, 'You guys don't really have to go yet, do you?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/stopthepresses/22948/phil-spector-the-ramones-and-a-gun/ |title=Phil Spector, The Ramones, And A Gun|publisher=yahoo.com|date=December 2, 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer [[Marky Ramone]] recalled in 2008, &quot;They (guns) were there but he had a license to carry. He never held us hostage.

Spector worked with [[Yoko Ono]] in 1981, and co-produced ''[[Season of Glass]]'', her first work after the death of her husband, [[John Lennon]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Since 2000===
Spector remained inactive throughout most of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. He attempted to work with [[CÃ©line Dion]] on her album ''[[Falling Into You]]'', but that fell through. His most recent released project has been ''[[Silence Is Easy]]'' by [[Starsailor (band)|Starsailor]], released in 2003. He was originally supposed to produce the entire album, but was fired owing to personal and creative differences â however, one of the two Spector-produced songs on the album was a UK top 10 single.

Spector produced singer-songwriter [[Hargo (singer)|Hargo]]'s track, &quot;Crying For John Lennon&quot;, which originally appears on Hargo's 2006 album ''In Your Eyes'', but on a visit to Spector's mansion for an interview for the John Lennon tribute movie, ''Strawberry Fields'', Hargo played Spector the song and asked him to produce it. Spector and former Paul McCartney drummer [[Graham Ward]] produced it in the classic [[Wall of Sound]] style on nights after his first murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/phil-spector/30309|title=Phil Spector continues work in studio|publisher=Nme.Com|date=2007-08-13|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the song &quot;[[B Boy Baby]]&quot; by [[Mutya Buena]] and [[Amy Winehouse]] featured melodic and lyrical passages heavily influenced by the Ronettes song &quot;[[Be My Baby]]&quot;. As a result, Spector was given a songwriting credit on the single. The sections from &quot;Be My Baby&quot; are sung by Winehouse, not directly sampled from the mono single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/mutya-buena/8623|title=Mutya Buena|publisher=Nme.Com|date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winehouse had made reference to her admiration of Spector's work with 1960s girl groups. She often performed Spector's first hit song, &quot;[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAHdAVOiw6Q|title=Amy Winehouse: To Know Him Is to Love Him (live)|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2009-10-31|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in December 2007, Spector attended the funeral for [[Ike Turner]] whom he previously produced in the mid-late 1960s with his then-wife [[Tina Turner]]. While delivering a eulogy, Spector lashed out at Tina and stated that &quot;Ike made Tina the jewel she was. When I went to see Ike play at the Cinegrill in the 90sâ¦there were at least five Tina Turners on the stage performing that night, any one of them could have been Tina Turner.&quot; Spector then lashed out at [[Oprah Winfrey]] for promoting Tina Turner's autobiography that &quot;demonized and vilified Ike.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/ike-turner/33364|title=Phil Spector criticises Tina Turner at Ike Turner's funeral|publisher=Nme.Com|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-April 2008, [[BBC 2]] broadcast a special entitled ''Phil Spector: The Agony and The Ecstasy''. It consists of Spector's first screen interview â breaking a long period of media silence. During the conversation, images from the [[Phil Spector#Murder charges|murder court case]] are juxtaposed with live appearances of his tracks on television programs from the 1960s and 1970s, along with subtitles giving critical interpretation of some of his song production values. While he does not directly try to clear his name, the court case proceedings shown try to give further explanation of the facts surrounding the murder charges that were leveled against him. He also speaks about the musical instincts that led him to create some of his most enduring hit records, from &quot;[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]&quot; to &quot;[[River Deep, Mountain High]]&quot;, as well as [[The Beatles]] album ''[[Let It Be]]'', along with criticisms he feels he has had to deal with throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vanessa Thorpe, arts and media correspondent|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2257524,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=uknews|title=Phil Spector breaks his silence before second trial for murder|publisher=Music Guardian|date=2008-02-18|accessdate=2010-06-30|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
Many producers have tried to emulate the Wall of Sound, and [[Brian Wilson]] of the [[Beach Boys]]&amp;mdash;a fellow adherent of mono recording&amp;mdash;considered Spector his main competition as a studio artist, going so far as to name the acclaimed ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album using Spector's initials.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Gallo, [http://weblogs.variety.com/thesetlist/brian_wilson/ ''The Set List''] blog on variety.com, January 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Springsteen]] emulated the Wall of Sound technique in his recording of &quot;[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]]&quot;. [[Shoegazing]], a British musical movement in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, was heavily influenced by the Wall of Sound. British band [[Wizzard]] led by [[Roy Wood]] back in 1973 had 3 heavily Spector influenced hits with See My Baby Jive (UK #1), Angel Fingers (UK #1) and I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday (UK #4), the latter becoming a perennial Christmas hit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

For his contributions to the music industry, Spector was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989. In 1997, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C130 |title=Phil Spector |publisher=Songwritershalloffame.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Rolling Stone Magazine|Rolling Stone]] magazine ranked him #63 on their list of the &quot;Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|publisher=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Immortals: Phil Spector|work=Rolling Stone Issue 946| publisher=[[Rolling Stone Magazine|Rolling Stone]]|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7248223/the_immortals__the_greatest_artists_of_all_time_63_phil_spector}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spector's early musical influences included [[Latin music]] in general, and [[Latin percussion]] in particular. This is keenly perceptible in many, if not all, of Spector's recordings from the percussion in many of his hit songs: shakers, gÃ¼iros (gourds), and maracas in &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; and the [[son montuno]] in &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling,&quot; heard clearly in the song's bridge played by session bassist [[Carol Kaye]] while the same repeating refrain is played on harpsichord by keyboardist [[Larry Knechtel]]. Spector would visit [[Spanish Harlem]] clubs and schools to hone his listening and practical skills.

[[The Beach Boys]] paid tribute to Spector in the lyrics of their song &quot;[[Mona (song)|Mona]]&quot;: &quot;Come on/Listen to '[[Da Doo Ron Ron]],' now/Listen to '[[Be My Baby]]'/I know you're gonna love Phil Spector&quot;.

The character of Ronnie &quot;Z-Man&quot; Barzell in ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'', a 1970 [[Russ Meyer]] film, is based upon Spector, though neither Meyer nor screenwriter [[Roger Ebert]] had met him.

In [[Brian De Palma]]'s film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' (1974), the villainous character Swan (played by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]) was purportedly inspired by Spector. A music producer and head of a record label, Swan was named &quot;Spectre&quot; in original drafts of the film's screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swanarchives.org/Production.asp |title=Production |publisher=The Swan Archives |date=1974-10-04 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Harv Stevens in the 2009 independent short film [http://www.vimeo.com/9665907 ''A Reasonable Man''] was reportedly based on Phil Spector. The film examines his relationship with John Lennon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=142&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=45525|title=Article at Exclaim.com|publisher=Exclaim.ca|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Lana Clarkson==
On February 3, 2003, actress [[Lana Clarkson]] was found dead, killed by a [[firearm]], in Spector's mansion in [[Alhambra, California]]. Spector stated that Clarkson's death was an &quot;accidental [[suicide]]&quot; and that she &quot;kissed the gun&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Phil-Spector-Jailed-For-19-Years-For-Murdering-Lana-Clarkson/Article/200905415291647?lpos=World_News_Top_Stories_Header_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15291647_Phil_Spector_Jailed_For_19_Years_For_Murdering_Lana_Clarkson|title=Phil Spector Jailed For 19 Years For Murdering Lana Clarkson|publisher=News.sky.com|accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency call from Spector's home, made by Spector's driver Adriano De Souza, quotes Spector as saying, &quot;I think I've killed someone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/papercolumnists/donaldmacleod/1766800/Specs-a-maniac.html?print=yes|location=London|work=The Sun|title=Specs a maniac}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some women who were said to have met Spector, there would come a point when they wanted to leave Spector's home, whereupon he would hold them at gunpoint. The prosecution argued that the testimony of the other women was important in order to demonstrate a &quot;common plan or scheme&quot;. The defense sought to prevent the women from providing such testimony. Though the law in California and other states generally forbids the introduction of evidence showing a defendant's previous bad acts, the judge sided with the prosecutors and ruled that the testimony of the other women &quot;can be used to show lack of accident or mistake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;SMH.com: [http://www.smh.com.au/news/People/Jury-to-hear-of-Spectors-dubious-gun-history/2005/05/24/1116700707308.html &quot;Jury to hear of Spector's dubious gun history&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to and during the first trial, Spector went through at least three sets of attorneys. Defense attorney [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]] represented Spector at the [[arraignment]] and early pretrial hearings and achieved his release on $1 million bail. [[Bruce Cutler]] represented him during the 2007 trial, but withdrew on August 27, 2007, claiming &quot;a difference of opinion between Mr. Spector and me on strategy.&quot;  Attorney Linda Kenney Baden then became lead lawyer for closing arguments. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Family==
Spector's first marriage was to Annette Merar, lead vocalist of the Spectors Three (a 1960s pop trio formed and produced by Spector).

Spector's second and final marriage was to Veronica Bennett, later known as [[Ronnie Spector]].&lt;ref&gt;Phil Spector's first marriage to Annette Merar http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/spector-ronnie-biography&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage lasted from 1966 to 1974.

Season 3, episode 6 &quot;Jeannie, the Hip Hippie&quot;
Director: Hal Cooper
Writer: Christopher Golato (a pen-name used by Sidney Sheldon)
October 17, 1967

Dr. Bellows cancels Tony's camping vacation when his wife cannot find a band to play at a function. Jeannie picks 4 guys (played by Boyce and Hart along with William Lewis and Steve O'Reilly) and uses her magic to make them play. Phil Spector, who is credited in this episode as &quot;Steve Davis&quot;, guest stars as himself. Boyce and Hart also perform the tune, &quot;Out and About&quot;, which reached number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1967.
