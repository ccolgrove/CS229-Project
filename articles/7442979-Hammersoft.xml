'''Ä°stanbul BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediye Spor KulÃ¼bÃ¼''', (literally ''Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's Sports Club'')  commonly called '''Ä°stanbul BB''' or '''Belediye''', is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club, part of [[Ä°stanbul BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediyesi S.K.]] They play their home games at the [[AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium]] in [[Istanbul]] and is owned by the Municipality of Istanbul. The club was founded in 1990. Club's former name was ISKI SK and owned by Municipality's water distribution company. ISKI SK competed in Regional Amateur Football League in 1990-1991 season and promoted to 3rd League. After promotion, the club's name changed to Istanbul BB. The club played in [[TFF First League]] until 1996, but after the 2006â2007 season they were promoted to the [[Turkcell Super League]]. Finishing 12th in the 2007â2008 season enabled them to remain in the Turkcell SÃ¼per Lig for the 2008â2009 season. In the 2009â2010 season, the club finished the season 6th place with a historical success at its own.

==Stadium==
AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium (Turkish: AtatÃ¼rk Olimpiyat StadÄ±) located in Ä°kitelli, a district in the western outskirts of Istanbul, is the largest-capacity stadium of Turkey. The stadium takes its name from Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk. Its construction began in 1999 and was completed in 2002. It was built for Turkey's failed 2008 Olympic Games bid and cost about â¬350 million. The 2008 games were awarded to Beijing.
With its 76,092 (all-seater) capacity and Olympic size, it was granted the &quot;5-star sports complex&quot; title by the UEFA in 2004, enabling it to host the finals of UEFA events. The 2005 UEFA Champions League Final between A.C. Milan and Liverpool F.C. was played on May 25, 2005, at the AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium. The stadium is also certified by the IAAF and IOC as a first-class venue for track and field, and has hosted several European athletic competitions.
Galatasaray SK played its home games at the AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium during the 2003â2004 football season, due to the renovation of their own venue, the Ali Sami Yen Stadium, and this was criticized by other teams. Galatasaray eventually returned to Ali Sami Yen for the 2004â2005 season, but played some of its 2006â2007 UEFA Champions League games at the AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium. Sivasspor also played some of its SÃ¼per Lig home games at the AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium due to the bad weather conditions in their original hometown stadium. Istanbul BB, also of the SÃ¼per Lig, play all their home games in the venue. 

== Fan group Boz BaykuÅlar == 

Until recently IBB hardly had any supporters, despite playing in the countries largest stadium every home game felt like an away match. For years the [[AtatÃ¼rk Olympic Stadium]] was the centerpiece to a strange spectacle, the only supporters in the stands would be fans of opposition teams. However, recently the team has won over some followers and they founded a supporter group called the, â[[Boz BaykuÅlar]]â (Grey Owls). 

They are one of the most unusual supporter groups in [[Turkey]], their numbers are small and they never engage in hooliganism, violence or insulting the opposition. They are renowned for their witty slogans, &quot;Bize her yer deplasman!&quot; (Everywhere is away for us), &quot;Hakem haklÄ± beyler!&quot; (The referee is correct gentleman), âMaÃ§ Var Dediler Geldik!â (They said there was a game being played so we thought weâd come along). &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkish-football.com/team_profile.php?teamID=56] IBB Team profile and Turkish club and football news {{en}} &lt;/ref&gt;
