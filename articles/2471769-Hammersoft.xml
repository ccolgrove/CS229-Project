'''WFSB''', channel 3, is a [[CBS]]-affiliated television station located in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], [[United States|USA]], owned by the [[Meredith Corporation]]. WFSB's studios and offices are located in [[Rocky Hill, Connecticut]], and its broadcast transmitter is based on [[Talcott Mountain]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]]. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WFSB includes: ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', and ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]''.

Most of WFSB's programs are seen in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] over a low-power semi-satellite station, [[WSHM-LD]].  This station has its own studios in the Monarch Tower in downtown Springfield, master control and some internal operations are based at WFSB's facilities.

==History==
In the late-1980s, Post-Newsweek moved its corporate offices from [[Washington D.C.]] to space located alongside Broadcast House making the station the company's flagship. This was part of a strategy move by the Post to give its various sub-corporations their own independent identities which worked well at first. By the mid-1990s, however, WFSB found itself in a shrinking market without any significant growth opportunities. In June 1997, Post-Newsweek sold the station to the Meredith Corporation in exchange for WCPX-TV (now [[WKMG-TV]]) in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19461148.html Meredith Corporation to acquire Hartford Conn., television station], ''[[Business Wire]]'' (via [[HighBeam Research]]), June 2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale closed that October although the Post-Newsweek group maintained its base in Hartford until 2000 when the company relocated to its then-largest station, [[WDIV]] in [[Detroit]]. 

On June 12, 2009, WFSB ended its analog broadcasts on VHF channel 3 as part of the completion of the coversion to digital, moving its operations to digital channel 33.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analog to Digital&quot;&gt;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube video of WFSB's analog to digital conversion.&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztee7Q-jKGo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCCForm387&quot;&gt;http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101305937&amp;formid=387&amp;fac_num=53115 CDBS Print&lt;/ref&gt; WFSB is the only Connecticut station that participated in the &quot;[[Short-term Analog Flash and Emergency Readiness Act|analog nightlight]]&quot; program and did so through June 26.&lt;ref name=&quot;FCC Nightlight&quot;&gt;http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-291375A1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Weeknights, WFSB airs a repeat of the evening's ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' after ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show with David Letterman]]'', placing ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on a thirty-minute tape delay.

==Digital programming==
On WFSB-DT2 is a [[SDTV|standard definition]] digital feed of sister station WSHM. On WFSB-DT3, [[Charter Communications|Charter]] digital channel 243, [[Comcast]] digital channel 247, and [[Cox Communications|Cox]] digital channel 801 is a 24-hour local news and weather channel known as &quot;Eyewitness News NOW&quot;.

Even though [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] is part of the [[New York City]] [[media market|market]] where CBS flagship [[WCBS-TV]] is based, WFSB targets viewers in the area through WFSB-DT4 &quot;WFSB Fairfield County&quot;; it is essentially a simulcast of &quot;Eyewitness News NOW&quot; except for a news crawl containing Fairfield County-specific headlines and weather graphics.
