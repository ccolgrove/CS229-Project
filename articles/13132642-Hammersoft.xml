'''Claro''' (''formerly Telgua'') is the biggest [[telecommunications]] provider in [[Guatemala]], provides [[Internet]], [[Telephony]], and [[Cable TV]] services.

==History==
On November 16, 1996, the [[Guatemalan Congress]] passed the &quot;Ley General de Telecomunicaciones&quot;; ''The General Telecommunications Law'' that stipulated the privatization of Guatel, the former, state-owned, telecommunications company. It was purchased by LUCA S.A. and Ricardo H. Bueso became Telgua's first President and CEO until 2000.

In 2000 it joined [[America Movil]] and time after it renamed the brands ALO and PCS Digital to [[Claro (mobile phone network)|Claro]] on Guatemala.
