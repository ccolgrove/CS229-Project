== History ==
[[Image:Maughanclocktower.JPG|[[The Maughan Library]] on Chancery Lane is the College's main library|thumb|left|167px]]
King's, so named to indicate the patronage of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]], was founded in 1829 in response to the founding of &quot;London University&quot;, latterly known as [[University College London]], in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/about/history/found.html|title=Foundation of the College=King's College London|year=2005|accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University College London|UCL]] was founded, with the backing of Jews, [[Utilitarians]] and [[Anglicanism|non-Anglican Christians]], as a secular institution, intended to educate &quot;the youth of our middling rich people between the ages of 15 or 16 and 20 or later&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hearnshaw1929&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | first = F.J.C. | last = Hearnshaw  | title = The Centenary History of King's College, London, 1828â1928  | publisher=Harrap  | year = 1929 | page = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for such an institution was a result of the religious nature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which then educated solely the sons of [[upper class|wealthy]] [[Anglicans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;victorianweb.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Banerjee, PhD.|first = Jacqueline|title = The University of London: The Founding Colleges|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/education/ulondon/2.html|accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation of [[University College London|UCL]] met with the disapproval of [[the establishment]], indeed, &quot;the storms of opposition which raged around it threatened to crush every spark of vital energy which remained&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = MacIlwraith  | first = W.  | title = The Life and Writings of George Grote: An Essay  | publisher=Barford &amp; Newitt  | year = 1884  | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Revd Dr George D'Oyly, rector of [[Lambeth]] and governor of [[Wilson's School]] in [[Camberwell]], opposing the secular nature of the college, published an open letter proposing the formation of a competing institution. This would be of a religious, and more particularly [[Anglican]], nature, one which would instil, &quot;the services of religion performed as directed in our National Church&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hearnshaw1929&quot; /&gt; This prompted [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], the then Prime Minister to chair a public meeting which launched King's on 21 June 1828. His simultaneous support for the Anglican college and the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act]], which was to lead to the granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics, was challenged by [[George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea]] in early 1829. The result was a [[duel]] in [[Battersea Park|Battersea Fields]] on 21 March that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCLFOUND&quot;/&gt; Deliberately off-target shots were fired by both and neither was hurt.&lt;ref name=&quot;KCLFOUND&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/found.html |title=Foundation of the College |work=King's College London â History of the College |accessdate=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Duel Day&quot; is still celebrated on the first Thursday after 21 March every year, marked by various events throughout the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=539&amp;year=2007|title=Alumni celebrate Duel Day=King's College London|year=2007|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's opened in 1831, very much in a similar academic guise to Oxford. Despite the intentions of its founders and the chapel at the heart of its buildings, the initial prospectus permitted, &quot;nonconformists of all sorts to enter the college freely&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | first = F.J.C. | last = Hearnshaw  | title = The Centenary History of King's College, London, 1828â1928  | publisher=Harrap  | year = 1929 | page = 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chemistry]], [[English literature]] and Commerce were among the subjects offered.&lt;ref name=&quot;victorianweb.org&quot;/&gt; At this time, neither King's, nor &quot;London University&quot; had the ability to confer degrees, a particular problem for medical students who wished to practise. Amending this situation was aided by the appointment of [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux]] as [[Lord Chancellor]], who was chairman of the governors of &quot;London University&quot;. In this position he automatically became a governor of King's. In the understanding that the [[UK government|government]] was unlikely to grant degree-awarding powers on two institutions in London, negotiations led to the colleges federating as the &quot;[[University of London]]&quot; in 1836, &quot;London University&quot; thus being changed to University College.&lt;ref name=&quot;victorianweb.org&quot;/&gt;

King's professors played a part in scientific and social advances of the nineteenth century, through extending higher education to women, [[working class|the working class]], and by offering evening classes. One of the most famous pieces of scientific research performed at King's was the work by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]] that was the basis of the elucidation of the molecular structure of DNA.
[[Image:Strand102.jpg|South West Building, Strand Campus, overlooking the [[Thames]]|thumb|167px|left]] During World War II King's was evacuated out of London to [[Bristol University]].

The first qualification issued by King's was the [[Associateship of King's College]], or AKC. The course, which concerns questions of ethics and theology, is still awarded today to students (and staff) who take an optional three year course alongside their standard [[academic degree|degree]]. Successful completion entitles the [[Alumnus|graduate]] to bear the letters AKC after their name.

The College today is the product of mergers with a number of other institutions over the years, including [[Queen Elizabeth College]] and [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology]] in 1985, and with the [[Institute of Psychiatry]] and the [[United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals]]. [[Florence Nightingale]]'s original training school for nurses is now incorporated as the [[Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery]]. Today, there are nine schools of study (see below).

[[King's College School]] was created as King's Junior Department at the time of the College's founding. Originally situated in the basement of the [[Strand, London|Strand]] campus, the School relocated to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] in 1897. [[King's College School]] is no longer associated with King's College London.

In 2003 the College was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right, (as opposed to through the [[University of London]]) by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. This power remained unexercised until 2007, when the College announced that all students starting courses from September 2007 onwards would be awarded degrees conferred by King's itself, rather than by the [[University of London]]. The new certificates however still make reference to the fact that King's is a constituent college of the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edguar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/02/89/68/WEBDOCDAPFAQ2.doc|title=Degree Awarding Powers Frequently Asked Questions 2 August 2005 |accessdate=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All current students with at least one year of study remaining were in August 2007 offered the option of choosing to be awarded a [[University of London]] [[academic degree|degree]] or a King's [[academic degree|degree]]. In 2007, for the second consecutive year, students from the [[King's College London School of Law]] won the national round of the Jessup International Law Moot Court. The Jessup [[moot court|moot]] is the biggest international mooting competition in the world. The King's team went on to represent the UK as national champions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law students repeat mooting success&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/phpnews/wmview.php?ArtID=1746 |title=Law students repeat mooting success|accessdate=2007-04-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070316011127/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/phpnews/wmview.php?ArtID=1746 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campuses ==
=== Strand campus ===
[[Image:Guys campus kcl 2.jpg|Guy's Campus|thumb|right|170px]]
[[Image:kcl guys campus.jpg|The Colonnade, Guy's Campus|thumb|right|170px]]
[[Image:Kcl chapel.jpg|The [[Listed building|Grade I]] listed College Chapel on the Strand Campus was redesigned in 1864 by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]]|thumb|right|170px]]
The Strand Campus is the founding campus of King's. Located next to [[Somerset House]] in the [[City of Westminster]], and sharing its frontage along the [[River Thames]], most of the Schools of [[King's College London School of Arts &amp; Humanities|Arts &amp; Humanities]], [[King's College London School of Law|Law]], Social Science &amp; Public Policy and Physical Sciences &amp; Engineering are housed here. The campus combines the Grade I listed King's Building of 1831 designed by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]], and the Byzantine [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] College Chapel, redesigned in 1864 by [[Sir George Gilbert Scott]] with the more modern [[Strand, London|Strand]] Building, completed in 1972. The Chesham Building in Surrey Street was purchased after the Second World War. The Macadam Building of 1975 houses [[KCLSU]]'s activities and is named after King's alumnus [[Ivison Macadam|Sir Ivison Macadam]], first President of [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]]. A [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]-protected [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Bath is situated on the site of the Strand Campus and can be accessed via the Surrey Street entrance. Hidden by surrounding College buildings, the Baths were mentioned by [[Charles Dickens]] in chapter thirty-five of ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]''. Moreover [[Aldwych tube station]], a well-preserved but disused [[London Underground]] station, is integrated as part of the King's [[Strand, London|Strand]] campus. A Rifle Range is located on the site of a platform taken out of public service in 1917. (Nearest underground stations: [[Temple tube station|Temple]], [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]])

=== Guy's campus ===

[[Guy's Hospital]] in the [[London Borough of Southwark]], established in 1726, houses parts of [[King's College London School of Medicine]]. The founder and benefactor of the hospital, [[Thomas Guy]], was a wealthy bookseller and a governor of [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. He lies buried in the vault beneath the 18th-century chapel at Guy's. Silk-merchant William Hunt was a later benefactor who gave money in the early nineteenth century to build Hunt's House. Today this is the site of New Hunt's House. The Henriette Raphael building, constructed in 1903, and the Gordon Museum are also located here. In addition, the Hodgkin building, Shepherd's House and Guy's chapel are prominent buildings within the campus. Guy's KCLSU centre is situated in Boland House. (Nearest underground stations: [[London Bridge tube station|London Bridge]], [[Borough tube station|Borough]])

=== Waterloo campus ===
Across [[Waterloo Bridge]] from the Strand Campus, the Waterloo Campus near the [[South Bank Centre]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]] consists of the [[James Clerk Maxwell]] Building and the [[Rosalind Franklin|Franklin]]-[[Maurice Wilkins|Wilkins]] Building, which was originally constructed as His Majesty's Stationery Office. King's acquired the building in the 1980s. The James Clerk Maxwell Building  houses the Principal's Office, most of the central administrative offices of the College and part of the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery. The Franklin-Wilkins Building is home to the School of Health &amp; Life Sciences that includes Pharmacy, the Department of Education and to part of the School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery. The campus is also home to the London site of [[Schiller International University]]. (Nearest underground station: [[Waterloo tube station|Waterloo]])

=== St Thomas' campus ===
The [[St Thomas' Hospital|St Thomas' Campus]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], facing the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] across the Thames, houses parts of the School of Medicine and the Dental Institute. The [[Florence Nightingale Museum]] is also located here. (Nearest underground station: [[Westminster tube station|Westminster]])

=== Denmark Hill campus ===
Further south, [[King's College Hospital]], the [[Maudsley Hospital]] and the [[Institute of Psychiatry]] form the [[Denmark Hill]] Campus, straddling the borders of the [[London Borough of Lambeth]] and the [[London Borough of Southwark]] in [[Camberwell]], the only campus not situated on the River Thames. As well as the [[Institute of Psychiatry|IoP]], parts of the Dental Institute and School of Medicine, and a large hall of residence, King's College Hall, are housed here. The KCL library for this campus is on-site, known as the Weston Education Centre (WEC). (Nearest overground station: [[Denmark Hill]])

=== Refurbishment ===
King's is coming to the end of a decade of restorative and refurbishment projects, with investment of Â£550&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile&quot;&gt;King's College London Profile 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Franklin-Wilkins Building at the Waterloo campus,  the [[Maughan Library]] on Chancery Lane and the renovation of the chapel at the [[Strand, London|Strand]] campus at a cost of Â£750,000. The Strand Campus redevelopment won the Green Gown Award in 2007 for sustainable construction. The award recognised the âreduced energy and carbon emissions from a sustainable refurbishment of the historic South Range of the King's Building'.&lt;ref name=&quot;King's wins top Green Award&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/phpnews/wmview.php?ArtID=1779 |title=King's wins top Green Award |work=King's College London |accessdate=2007-04-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070611232155/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/phpnews/wmview.php?ArtID=1779 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; King's was also the recipient of the 2003 City Heritage Award for the conversion of the Grade II* listed [[The Maughan Library|Maughan Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingâs library wins prestigious heritage award&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/phpnews/wmview.php?ArtID=394 |title=King's library wins prestigious heritage award |work=King's College London |accessdate=2007-04-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070708040352/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/phpnews/wmview.php?ArtID=394 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 it was announced that King's would acquire the East Wing of Somerset House under a 78-year lease. The wing is to accommodate a cultural centre, open to the public, and allow the relocation of the college's School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;King's College London (7 December 2009) [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=1244&amp;year=2009 Kingâs and Somerset House join forces (Press Release)].

===Students' Union===
{{main|King's College London Students' Union}}
[[Image:Kclsu logo new.gif|KCLSU logo|thumb|right|170px]]
[[Image:reggiethelion.jpg|Reggie the Lion|thumb|right|170px]]
[[King's College London Students' Union]] ([[KCLSU]]) is the oldest student union in London, founded just before [[University College London Union]], and provides a good range of activities and services: over 50 sports clubs (including the Boat Club which rows on the [[River Thames]] and the Rifle Club which uses the College's shooting range located at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]] beneath the Strand Campus), 60 societies, a wide range of volunteering opportunities, 2 bars, 2 nightclubs, shops, eating places and a gym. A former President of KCLSU, [[Sir Ivison Macadam]] (after whom the Students' Union building on the Strand Campus has since been named) went on to be elected as the first President of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], and KCLSU has played an active role there and in the [[University of London Union]] ever since.

''Roar'' is KCLSU's monthly magazine. It carries stories, reviews and features on a range of topics, reporting on Students' Union events, campaigns, clubs and societies, as well as coverage of the arts, books and fashion.
''King's Bench'', has grown from strength to strength, challenging the dominance ''Roar'' once had in the media spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;King's Bench website, www.kbkcl.co.uk/team&lt;/ref&gt; It is published tri-annually and welcomes contributions from all of King's students, either for publication in its printed edition, or on its [http://www.kbkcl.co.uk website]. The College itself also publishes a range of periodicals reporting on various aspects of King's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/media/publications/index.html |title=Publications |publisher=Kcl.ac.uk |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the King's mascot, &quot;[[King's College London Students' Union#Mascot|Reggie]]&quot;, was buried upside-down in a pit near [[Waterloo Station]], which was filled with concrete; only the tip of his tail remained visible. Later, he was lost for many years in the 1990s, and not recovered until he was found in a field. Having been restored at the cost of around Â£15,000, Reggie has been placed on display in the KCLSU Student Centre at the Strand Campus. Protected in a glass case, he is filled with concrete to prevent theft, particularly by [[University College London|UCL]] students who, prior to his burial and dumping, had also castrated him. (King's students had also stolen one UCL mascot, Phineas and, in an apocryphal legend, allegedly played football with the head of [[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham's]] Auto-icon).

There are three &quot;Reggies&quot; in existence: the original, on display in [[KCLSU]]'s Student Centre at the Strand Campus, a [[papier-mÃ¢chÃ©]] Reggie outside the Great Hall at the Strand Campus (pictured above), and a small [[sterling silver]] incarnation displayed during Graduation ceremonies.

=== Competition with UCL ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[Image:KCLMaughanLibrary.jpg|[[The Maughan Library]]|thumb|right|170px]]
{{main|Student Rags}}
Competition within the [[University of London]] is most intense between King's and [[University College London]], the two oldest institutions. In the early twentieth century, rivalry was centred on their respective [[mascot]]s. University College's was Phineas Maclino, a wooden [[tobacconist|tobacconist's]] sign of a kilted Jacobite [[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]] purloined from outside a shop in [[Tottenham Court Road]] during the celebrations of the relief of [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] in 1900.

King's later addition was a giant beer bottle representing &quot;bottled youth&quot;. In 1923 it was replaced by a new mascot to rival Phineas â Reggie the Lion, who made his debut at a King's-[[University College London|UCL]] sporting [[rag]] in December 1923, protected by a lifeguard of engineering students armed with T-squares. Thereafter, Reggie formed the centrepiece of annual [[fresher]]s' processions by King's students around [[Aldwych]] in which new students were typically flour bombed.

Although riots between respective College students occurred in Central London well into the 1950s, rivalry is now limited to the [[rugby union]] pitch and skulduggery over mascots, with an annual Varsity match taking place between [[King's College Rugby Club|King's College London RFC]] and University College London RFC.

=== Competition with LSE ===
Tensions between King's and the [[London School of Economics]] were ignited on 2 December 2005 when at least 200 students from [[London School of Economics|LSE]] (across the road from the Strand campus) diverted off from the annual &quot;barrel run&quot; and caused an estimated Â£32,000 (''[[The Beaver]]'', [[London School of Economics|LSE]], 26 September 2006) of damage to the English department at King's.&lt;ref name=&quot;rampage&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4506664.stm |title=Students in university rampage |work=[[BBC News]] 7 December 2005 |accessdate=2006-11-20 | date=2005-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal [[Rick Trainor]] called for no retaliation and [[LSE Students' Union]] were forced to issue an apology as well as foot the bill for the damage repair. While [[London School of Economics|LSE]] officially condemned the action, a photograph was published in the ''[[Beaver]]'' (the LSE SU Student Newspaper) which was later picked up by the ''Times'' that showed [[London School of Economics|LSE]] Director [[Howard Davies (LSE)|Sir Howard Davies]]  drinking with members of the [[LSE Students' Union]] shortly before the barrel run â and the &quot;rampage&quot; â began. King's appears to have been targeted, however, principally owing to its close proximity to [[London School of Economics|LSE]] rather than by any ill-feeling. There is also somewhat of a sporting rivalry between the two institutions, albeit to a lesser extent than with [[University College London|UCL]].
