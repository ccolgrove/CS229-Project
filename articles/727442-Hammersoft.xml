The ratio of Vodka to Red Bull varies widely, but is usually around 2:3.&lt;ref name=&quot;AML&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drinknation.com/drink/vodka-red-bull |title=Vodka Red Bull recipe |publisher=Drinknation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places it is customary to serve an entire can with a single shot of vodka, in others a can may be split between several glasses, each containing several shots of vodka. The Red Bull dominates so that the flavor of the alcohol is not too strong.
