'''Droid''' is a [[font family]] created by [[Ascender Corporation]] for use by the [[Open Handset Alliance]] platform [[Android (operating system)|Android]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2008/09/25/font-android-g1-tech-wire-cx_ew_0926font.html Android's Very Own Font]&lt;/ref&gt; and licensed under the [[Apache License]]. The fonts are intended for use on the small screens of mobile handsets and were designed by [[Steve Matteson]] of [[Ascender Corporation]]. The name was derived from the Open Handset Alliance platform name Android.

==Typefaces==
The Droid font family consists of Droid [[Sans-serif|Sans]], Droid Sans Mono and Droid [[Serif]]:

* The Droid Sans typeface consists of Regular and [[Boldface|Bold]] fonts. Droid Sans regular font includes support for [[Simplified Chinese|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], [[Hangul|Korean]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] support for the GB2312, Big 5, JIS X0208 and KSC 5601 character sets respectively.

* The Droid Sans Mono typeface consists of only the Regular font. The design is similar to Matteson's closed source [[AndalÃ© Mono]] typeface design. Taking advantage of the license under which the original typefaces were released, modifications of this Droid Sans Mono have appeared on the internet. Of particular note are those modifications that replace the plain zero [[glyph]] with dotted or slashed versions. Such modifications are particularly desired by users making heavy use of [[monospaced]] typefaces, including [[software developers]], because they provide a more prominent differentiation between the two characters.

* The Droid Serif typeface consists of Regular, Bold, [[Italic type|Italic]] and Bold Italic fonts. The design is similar to Microsoft's [[Georgia (typeface)|Georgia]] designed by Matthew Carter.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Each typeface has an extensive character set including coverage of Western European, Eastern/Central European, [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Cyrillic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascendercorp.com/pr/2007-11-12/ Ascender creates the new Droid font collection for Open Handset Alliance's Android platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
