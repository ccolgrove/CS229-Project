== Career ==
[[File:Kristen Stewart Comic-Con 2011.jpg | thumb | Kristen Stewart at the Comic-Con 2011.]]

Her whole family all worked behind the camera, and Stewart thought she would become a writer/director, but never considered being an actor. &quot;I never wanted to be the center of attention â I wasn't that 'I want to be famous, I want to be an actor' kid. I never sought out acting, but I always practiced my autograph because I love pens. I'd write my name on everything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Today&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biography Today|year=2010|page=156|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7808-1058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's acting career began at the age of eight, after an agent saw her perform in her elementary school's Christmas play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Girls of Fall: Autumn's Crop of Enchanting Entertainers | url=http://www.wwd.com/lifestyle-news/girls-of-fall-autumns-crop-of-enchanting-entertainers-1803246#/article/lifestyle-news/girls-of-fall-autumns-crop-of-enchanting-entertainers-1803246?page=8 | publisher=[[Women's Wear Daily|WWD]] | date=September 29, 2008 | accessdate=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of auditioning, Stewart's first role was a nonspeaking part in the film ''[[The Thirteenth Year]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Then, she had another part in the film ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' as the &quot;ring toss girl&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She subsequently appeared in the independent film ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'', in which she played the [[tomboy]] daughter of a troubled single mother ([[Patricia Clarkson]]). Stewart had a major role in the Hollywood film ''[[Panic Room]]'', playing the [[diabetic]] daughter of a divorced mother ([[Jodie Foster]]). The film received generally positive reviews, and Stewart garnered positive notices for her performance. She was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] for her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Today, pp.158&quot;&gt;&quot;Biography Today&quot;, pp.158&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Panic Room''{{'}}s success, Stewart was cast in another thriller, ''[[Cold Creek Manor]]'', playing the daughter of [[Dennis Quaid]]'s and [[Sharon Stone]]'s characters. She was again nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] for her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Today, pp.158&quot;/&gt; It was revealed that at about this time in her career, she had to be [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] due to her irregular schedule, which was affecting her grades. She said, &quot;I started homeschooling because my teachers were failing me. I think it was just resentment â I made more work for them. But homeschooling is great; you can study what you want, which allows you to get more excited about what you're doing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Today, pp.158&quot;/&gt;

Her first starring role followed, in the children's action-comedy ''[[Catch That Kid]]'', opposite [[Max Thieriot]] and [[Corbin Bleu]]. Stewart also played the role of Lila in the thriller ''[[Undertow (2004 film)|Undertow]]''. To date, Stewart's most critically acclaimed role may be in the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television film ''[[Speak (film)|Speak]]'' (2004), based on [[Speak (novel)|the novel]] by [[Laurie Halse Anderson]]. Stewart, 13 at the time of filming, played high school freshman Melinda Sordino, who stops almost all verbal contact after being raped. Stewart received great praise for playing the character, who had only a few speaking lines, but kept up a darkly humorous commentary inside her head throughout the film.

In 2005, Stewart appeared in the fantasy-adventure film ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'', playing the role of Lisa, the irresponsible older sister of two little boys, who turn their house into a spacecraft hurtling uncontrollably in outer space by playing a board game. The film received praise by critics, but Stewart's performance did not garner much media attention, as it was noted that her character is immobilized during most of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/movies/11zath.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin From Suburbia and Stranded Somewhere Near Saturn] from ''New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she played the character Maya in ''[[Fierce People (film)|Fierce People]]'', directed by [[Griffin Dunne]].

In 2007, Stewart appeared as teenager Lucy Hardwicke in ''[[In the Land of Women]]'', a romantic drama starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Adam Brody]]. The film, as well as Stewart's performance, received mixed reviews. That same year, Stewart appeared in [[Sean Penn]]'s critically acclaimed adaptation film ''[[Into the Wild (film)|Into the Wild]]''. For her portrayal of Tracy â a teenage singer who has a crush on young adventurer [[Christopher McCandless]] â Stewart received generally positive reviews. [[Salon.com]] considered her work a &quot;sturdy, sensitive performance&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2007/09/21/wild/ &quot;Into the Wild&quot;] from ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' noted that she did &quot;vividly well with a sketch of a role.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/movie_review/movie-review-into-the/209126/content Movie review: 'Into the Wild'] from [[Chicago Tribune]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her performance was not without detractors, however; [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s critic Dennis Harvey wrote, &quot;It's unclear whether Stewart means to be playing [[hippie]]-chick Tracy as vapid, or whether it just comes off that way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934548.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 Into the Wild review] from ''[[Variety magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Into the Wild'', Stewart had a cameo appearance in ''[[Jumper (film)|Jumper]]'' and also appeared in ''[[What Just Happened]]'', which was released in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i28d20febe0f2d51b61c3cf616385dced 'What Just Happened' sets release]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} from ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''&lt;/ref&gt; She also co-stars in ''[[The Cake Eaters]]'' an independent film that has only been screened at film festivals.

Stewart reappeared as Bella in the sequel, ''[[The Twilight Saga: New Moon]]'' to critical acclaim, receiving much more positive reviews than her portrayal of the same character in ''Twilight''. Jordan Mintzer from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called Stewart &quot;the heart and soul of the film&quot; and praised her for giving &quot;both weight and depth to dialogue...that would sound like typical chick-lit blather in the mouth of a less engaging actress, and she makes Bella's psychological wounds seem like the real deal&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941623?refcatid=31|title=Variey Reviews - New Moon - Film Reviews|author=Jordan Mintzer|publisher=Variety|date=November 18, 2009|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while critics who gave the film its worst reviews still found her performance &quot;bringing plenty of soul&quot; to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/review/a186951/the-twilight-saga-new-moon.html|title=The Twilight Saga; New Moon - Movies Reviews|author=Stella Papamichael|publisher=Digital Spy.com|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reprised this role in ''[[The Twilight Saga: Eclipse]]''.
