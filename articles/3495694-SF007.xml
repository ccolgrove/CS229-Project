'''''Eureka''''' (stylized as '''''EUR{{raise|0.3em|e}}KA''''') is an [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] [[television series]] that premiered on [[Syfy]] on July 18, 2006. Since then four seasons have aired, and a fifth is currently being filmed. The second half of season 4 began on SyFy on July 11, 2011 and ended on September 19, 2011.  The show is set in a fictional town called Eureka, Oregon, in the [[Pacific Northwest]] inhabited almost entirely by [[genius]]es and [[scientist]]s. Nearly everyone in Eureka works for Global Dynamics, a huge advanced research facility responsible for the development of nearly all major technological breakthroughs in the last 50 years. Each episode features a mysterious accidental or intentional misuse of technology, which the town [[Sheriff]] [[Jack Carter (Eureka)|Jack Carter]] then solves with the help of town scientists. Each season also features a larger [[story arc]] that concerns a particular major event or item.

The series was created by [[Andrew Cosby]] and Jaime Paglia and is produced by [[Universal Media Studios]]. The season one original music was composed by [[Mutato Muzika]] and season two and three were composed by [[Bear McCreary]]. The executive producers of the current season are Paglia, Charles Grant Craig, and Thania St. John. While initially lacking in strong critical acclaim, Eureka has been a popular success, averaging 3.2 million viewers during the second half of season three.&lt;ref name=&quot;best season&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Syfy's Eureka delivers best season ever season finale averages 2.3 million|publisher=TV by the Numbers |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/21/syfys-eureka-delivers-best-season-ever-season-finale-averages-2-3-million/27947|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Eureka was nominated for the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards (Creative Arts)#Outstanding Visual Effects for a Series|Outstanding Visual Effects for a Series]] and won the [[Leo Award]] for Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;leo award&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Eureka (2006) Awards|publisher=IMDB |url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0796264/awards|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom on [[Sky1]] the show is known as '''''A Town Called Eureka''''' although it is also shown under its original name on the [[BT Vision]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bt Vision search results &quot;Eureka&quot;|url=http://www.btvision.bt.com/search/?search=eureka&amp;searchType=All}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters from ''Eureka'' have [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to ''[[Warehouse 13]]'' and vice-versa, and characters from ''Warehouse 13'' have crossed over to ''[[Alphas]]'', making the three shows [[sister show]]s.

It was announced on August 17, 2010 that the show had been picked up for a fifth season of 13 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Syfy renews Eureka for a fifth season|publisher=TV by the Numbers |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/08/17/eureka-renewed-by-syfy-for-a-5th-season/60187|accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Twitter / Eureka Unscripted&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Twitter / Eureka Unscripted|publisher=EurekaWriters|url=http://twitter.com/EurekaWriters/status/57550832035569664|accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fan sites and a show writers' [[Twitter]] feed said on August 4, 2011, that the show had been picked up for a sixth and possibly final season of 6 episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twitter / Eureka Unscripted&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SyFy's 'Eureka' Poised To End Its Run With Final 6-Episode Order|publisher=Deadline |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/syfys-eureka-poised-to-end-its-run-with-final-6-episode-order/|accessdate=2011-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then announced on August 8, 2011, that ''Eureka'' would not get a sixth season, but it would instead be canceled after season five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title='Eureka' canceled, sixth season plans dropped -- EXCLUSIVE|publisher=EntertainmentWeekly|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/08/08/eureka-cancelled|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one additional episode of the fifth season has been approved in order to give the series a proper finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Eureka!

==Synopsis==
[[File:Jaime Paglia by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|Jaime Paglia, co-creator of ''Eureka''.]]
''Eureka'' takes place in a [[high tech]] fictional community of the same name, located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] ([[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in the pilot) and inhabited entirely by brilliant scientists working on new scientific advances. The town is operated by a corporation called Global Dynamics (GD), that is overseen by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The town's existence and location are closely guarded secrets.

[[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] [[Jack Carter (Eureka)|Jack Carter]] stumbles upon Eureka while transporting a fugitive prisoner (his own rebellious teenage daughter [[Zoe Carter|Zoe]]) back to her mother's home in [[Los Angeles]]. When a faulty experiment cripples the sheriff of Eureka, Carter finds himself quickly chosen to fill the vacancy. Despite not being a genius like most members of the town, Jack Carter demonstrates a remarkable ability to connect to others, keen and practical insights, and a dedication to preserving the safety of Eureka.

Beginning the fourth season, the show takes place in an alternate timeline due to a time travel experiment gone wrong, where the characters involved retain memories of the previous timeline (see below).

===Main cast===
* [[Jack Carter (Eureka)|Sheriff Jack Carter]], portrayed by [[Colin Ferguson (actor)|Colin Ferguson]] (seasons 1âpresent), is a [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] who reluctantly ends up as [[Sheriff]] of Eureka. Jack is consistently dumbfounded by the wonders Eureka produces, as well as its propensity to produce things that often threaten the entire town, if not the world. Despite being a man of average intelligence in a town full of geniuses, Jack's admittedly simplistic ideas and ability to make intuitive connections between seemingly disparate events often save the day. (This is in contrast to the other residents of Eureka, who, being stereotypical scientists, tend to over-complicate things and get lost in minutiae). His overall role in the series does not change in the new timeline.
* [[Allison Blake|Dr. Allison Blake]], portrayed by [[Salli Richardson|Salli Richardson-Whitfield]] (seasons 1âpresent), is a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] agent who acts as the liaison between Eureka and the Federal Government, and later becomes the director of Global Dynamics. She is always at the forefront of any dilemma that might arise. Although she works for the DoD, she has two PhDs and an MD. Allison is also raising her son Kevin, an autistic youth whose father died when he was still a baby, and Jenna, the daughter she conceived with Nathan shortly before his death. After the change in the timeline, Kevin is no longer autistic and she never became director of GD; she is, instead, head of GD's medical science division.
* [[Zoe Carter]], portrayed by [[Jordan Hinson]] (seasons 1â3, recurring seasons 4âpresent), is Jack's rebellious teenage daughter. Unlike her father, she is intelligent enough to keep up with the town's residents (her [[IQ]] is 157), yet like her father, possesses the street smarts most of the town's residents do not. She longs to be a medical doctor, and with the help of Henry's recommendation letter, receives an early acceptance to Harvard's medical program. She dates Lucas but in the altered timeline, they broke up when Lucas moved to Geneva, and she is now showing interest in Zane. She is also a bit more mature and responsible after her time at Harvard.
* [[Henry Deacon (Eureka)|Dr. Henry Deacon]], portrayed by [[Joe Morton]] (seasons 1âpresent), is the town jack-of-all-trades. Although, like most residents of Eureka, he is a brilliant multidisciplined scientist, Henry has ethical objections to the kind of research conducted at Global Dynamics, preferring employment as the town's mechanic. Henry's assistance is often invaluable in defusing the situations the experiments in town create. During Season 3, he was elected mayor as a write-in candidate. Following the change in timeline in season 4, he is suddenly married and is trying to keep the timeline shift a secret. Late into the 4th season, he confides in his &quot;wife&quot; after he realizes he is beginning to fall in love with her.
* [[Nathan Stark|Dr. Nathan Stark]], portrayed by [[Ed Quinn]] (seasons 1â3), is one of Eureka's top scientists. He and Jack are frequently at odds, though both respect each other. He is formerly married to Allison, and they rekindled their relationship in the second season. They were supposed to get remarried in the third season, but he dematerializes while saving the world from a time paradox on the day of their wedding, an event that apparently still occurred in Season 4's alternate timeline. The character  is modeled after [[Tony Stark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Melissa Hank|url=http://tvguide.ca/Interviews/Insider/Articles/070425_ed_quinn_eureka_MH.htm|title=Sci-fi made sexy on 'Eureka' (interview with Ed Quinn)|date=April 25, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sp0Timhm|archivedate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jo Lupo|Josephina &quot;Jo&quot; Lupo]], portrayed by [[Erica Cerra]] (seasons 1âpresent), is a tough, no-nonsense cop with a love of firearms. From Season 2 onwards, after a brief fling with Taggart, she later develops a relationship with Zane. Zane proposes to her in the Season 4 premiere, but before she can answer him, time is altered to where the two of them never dated, and in fact cannot stand each other. In the new timeline, she is Head of Security at Global Dynamics, her role as deputy taken by the android Deputy Andy.
* [[Douglas Fargo|Dr. Douglas Fargo]], portrayed by [[Neil Grayston (actor)|Neil Grayston]] (seasons 3âpresent, recurring seasons 1â2), is a junior scientist who is treated somewhat dismissively by his peers. Accident prone, he more often than not ends up a victim of the disasters befalling the town. He has also caused a fair share of the problems. Neil Grayston also provides the voice of S.A.R.A.H. (Self Actuated Residential Automated Habitat), the bunker home Jack and Zoe Carter live in. In the alternate timeline, he is head of GD, and not well liked by the staff because of his alternate's imposing and intimidating manner. He has difficulty in this new role as his alternate was a domineering egomaniac, an act he has trouble pulling off. Even so, the job has begun to transform him into a more decisive and capable leader as the weight of responsibility has forced him to stand up to other GD employees, the Department of Defense, and military generals.
* [[Zane Donovan]], portrayed by [[Niall Matter]] (seasons 3âpresent, recurring season 2), is a rebellious genius, recruited in the second season as an alternative to imprisonment after being arrested for fraud (allegedly causing the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to crash). He also develops a relationship with Jo Lupo shortly after his arrival in Eureka. However, this relationship is erased with the change in timeline. He is back to being a perpetual prankster and a low-level nemesis of Jo, though he shows signs of improving because of the trust she puts in him.
* [[Dr. Trevor Grant]], portrayed by [[James Callis]] (season 4), was an assistant to [[Albert Einstein]] in the late 1940s, when Eureka was a military base. He is first seen in the season 4 premiere, when five Eureka citizens get teleported back into 1947. He assists them in returning, but before they leave, Jack Carter tells Allison Blake that &quot;he left his device in another jacket&quot; (in 1947). At the end of the episode, Dr. Grant is in 2010 Eureka, and it is assumed he was transported there accidentally with Jack's device; however, it is later revealed that he took the time travel device on purpose. He renames himself Charles Grant as an alias, and even those who know his true identity begin calling him Charles in private. He takes on a job as a scientific historian while working with Henry on assorted projects. He is later approached by the alternate Beverley, who convinces him to work with her toward an unknown goal.
* [[Jim Taggart (Eureka)|Dr. Jim Taggart]], portrayed by [[Matt Frewer]] (season 3 episode 17; recurring seasons 1, 2, and 4), is a somewhat eccentric animal expert. He also does work in [[geophysics]].

===Recurring cast===
* Dr. Tess Fontana ([[Jaime Ray Newman]]) is described as a &quot;brilliant engineer and astrophysicist who sees things differently than those around her... putting her at odds with the mainstream scientific community.&quot; Allison, having known this out-of-the-box thinker since [[grad school]], puts her to work on a highly confidential Global Dynamics project. By the last quarter of Season 3, Dr. Fontana finds herself spending time with â and eventually positioned as a love interest for â Colin Ferguson's Jack, by the season finale she had spent at least four nights with Jack in his home. The Season 3 finale suggests her character is to be written out from the primary storylines in Season 4; however, after the timeline is altered in the season 4 premiere, her history is changed and she has just agreed to move in with Carter. This plan is scuttled when Carter realizes that the relationship will not work, and the character appears to move to Australia (as planned at the end of Season 3).
* [[Beverly Barlowe|Dr. Beverly Barlowe]] ([[Debrah Farentino]]) was the town psychiatrist. She secretly works for a mysterious organization known as &quot;the Consortium&quot;, which has expressed a desire to exploit Eureka's innovations by whatever means necessary. A primary villain in Seasons 1 and 2, she is absent for all of season 3 but returns in the Season 4 Episode &quot;Stoned&quot; and meets with [[Trevor Grant|Dr. Trevor Grant]] in a clandestine meeting where she reveals her connection to him and his secret plans in 1947, thereby luring him into cooperating with her and her organization. She escapes capture when her plot is foiled.  Her latest scheme is infecting Allison Blake with nanites for unknown ends.
* Vincent ([[Chris Gauthier]]) is the owner of Cafe Diem. He prides himself on being able to make anything his customers ask for â partially due to the extra-dimensional features of his pantry, which essentially allows him infinite room to store recipe ingredients. He is no exception to the town's geniuses, and holds a Ph.D. in [[Molecular Gastronomy]]. His last name has not yet been revealed.
* Deputy Andy ([[Ty Olsson]] (season 3 and 4), [[Kavan Smith]] (season 4-present)) is a robotic law enforcement unit created by GD. During his initial trial, he is tapped to replace Carter after he is fired, but comes to the conclusion that Carter is the one who should be sheriff. He leaves to find out what it is that he is best at. In the new timeline, Andy was instead tapped as Carter's deputy when Jo was promoted to head of GD security. He quickly determines that time has changed based on Carter's behavior and several Holmesian clues, but he suffers damage that resets his memory to his last backup. Andy suffers through several cases in which his outer skin is repeatedly destroyed, and he is rebuilt with a new face. Andy and SARAH had a whirlwind relationship that led to a wedding, but SARAH called it off, and the two agree to remain friends and see what happens.
* SARAH (voice of [[Neil Grayston (actor)|Neil Grayston]]) is an artificial intelligence that runs Carter's house. She was installed as a test item an unstated amount of time before Carter moved in. While she generally gets along with everyone, she has been known to annoy Carter with her logical, literal personality. When they were considering leaving Eureka, SARAH locked Carter, Allison, Fargo, Stark and Henry in the house in an attempt to have them work things out. In the course of trying to escape, SARAH is accidentally reset, revealing that her current personality had been built on top of an old military project, which killed a pizza boy when he interfered. It is mentioned that this program was in turn based on a war games simulator. When this is mentioned, SARAH asks &quot;Would you like to play a game?&quot; (to which the entire cast frantically replies, &quot;No!&quot;), implying that the war-games simulator she is descended from is [[WOPR]], the computer featured in [[War Games]]. Although SARAH was restored to normal operation, Carter installed several manual overrides and escapes, such as a ladder to a ceiling hatch in the living room, as precautions. SARAH later upgraded Andy with an emotional package, and the two were scheduled to get married, but SARAH got cold feet at the last minute and the two decided to explore their relationship more slowly.
* Eva Thorne ([[Frances Fisher]]) is a corporate fixer hired to make Eureka more profitable, which she mainly accomplishes by [[downsizing]]. She seems to have an ulterior motive involving an underground military base built before Eureka was founded. An accident in this facility resulted in her being extraordinarily long-lived: she is 107 years old when she returns to Eureka. After sacrificing her one chance of finding a cure in order to save Zoe, Thorne leaves to start a new life, finally able to put her past behind her.
* General Mansfield ([[Barclay Hope]]) is an army general who frequently visits Eureka to check up on Government projects, or to enforce [[martial law]] when experiments get out of control.
* Lexi Carter ([[Ever Carradine]]) is Jack's free-spirited sister who comes to live with him and Zoe early in Season 3 after finding out she (Lexi) is pregnant. Her fanatic emphasis on [[waste management]], [[recycling]], [[spirituality]] and [[politics]] quickly endears her to others and makes her an asset to the community. She leaves Eureka with her husband-to-be in the middle of season 3 after he discovers her pregnancy.
* Kevin Blake (Meshach Peters seasons 1-3, Trevor Jackson season 4) is Allison Blake's son. He is an autistic savant with an IQ of 182. Kevin's birthday is March 15, 1997. His character is a major part of the artifact story arc in season two. Kevin does not appear again until season four, where he &quot;accidentally&quot; (although this is uncertain) activates the 2010 side of the bridge device. In the new timeline, Kevin is not autistic.
* Lucas (Vanya Asher) is Zoe's shy genius boyfriend. They start dating after being forced to work together on a high school science project in Season 2. In Season 3, Lucas is cited as having the third highest IQ ever measured, even though he can be a bit of a klutz. He receives early acceptance to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] after a letter of recommendation from Henry, so he is able to be with Zoe in Massachusetts.  They broke up when he moved to Geneva.
* Dr. Grace Monroe ([[Tembi Locke]]) is Henry's wife. They are shown as a close couple with her being his intellectual equal, often helping him with his work. At the beginning of the &quot;Founder's Day&quot; episode in Season 4 Henry and Grace barely know each other by the end, after the group returns to the present altered timeline, Henry discovers they are married. When Henry later reveals the truth about the alternate timeline she is upset and wants &quot;her Henry&quot; back; but he is eventually able to win her affection, and by the &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; episode they renew their vows and she accepts that this Henry is &quot;her Henry.&quot;
* Dr. Holly Marten ([[Felicia Day]]) is a socially inept scientist sent to Eureka to assist with the upcoming mission to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].  Although brilliant, she is painfully awkward with human relationships, which complicates Fargo's determined wooing of her.
* Dr. Isaac Parrish ([[Wil Wheaton]]) is a scientist who has a running adversarial relationship with Fargo, as he considers himself smarter than almost everyone else and thinks of Fargo as a legacy-kid who has had everything handed to him.  He is Fargo's rival for Holly Marten's affections, though it is unclear whether his interest is in Holly herself or simply in out competing Fargo.

===Critical reaction===
Critical reaction was mixed, with general praise for the premise, but overall middling reaction to the writing of the pilot.

The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'':
{{cquote|It's all very quirky. Too quirky, maybe, for an audience that is used to spaceships, robots, and explosions. Though every episode promises an &quot;aha!&quot; moment based in quantum physics and obscure scientific laws, this world is relatively flat, conceptually speaking, in comparison to the complexity woven into series such as ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''. This does not mean ''Eureka'' is a complete waste of time. Not at all. The characters are fun, [[Colin Ferguson (actor)|Ferguson]] is believable and pleasant, the script is solidly constructed, and the visuals are slickly produced. All in all, it's a sweet series and probably not long for this world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Not a whole lot to discover on Eureka' |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/277848_eureka18.html |date=2006-07-18 |accessdate=2006-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''[[New York Daily News]]'':
{{cquote|With its playful new series ''Eureka'', set in the Pacific Northwest and telling the story of an outsider who comes to explore, and settle in, a remote town full of eccentrics, Sci-Fi Channel isn't just inviting comparisons to ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' and ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. It's demanding them. But co-creators Andrew Cosby and Jaime Paglia hold up to them pretty well. ''Eureka'' has a premise, a cast and a plot that make it one of the TV treats of the summer. The folks at Sci-Fi Channel clearly intended to reinvent the summer TV series here, and come up with something breezy and fun. And ''Eureka'' â they've done it!}}

==Cancellation==
On August 8, 2011, it was announced that ''Eureka'' would be cancelled after five seasons. Syfy gave this statement: &quot;After painstaking consideration, we have had to make the difficult business decision to not order a season six of ''Eureka''. But ''Eureka'' is not over yet. There is a new holiday episode this December and 12 stellar episodes set to debut next year, marking its fifth season and six memorable years on Syfy. The 2012 episodes are some of the best we've seen, and will bring this great series to a satisfying end. We are very grateful to Bruce Miller and Jaime Paglia, their team of incredible writers, and an amazing cast and crew who have consistently delivered a series we continue to be very proud of. We thank the fans for their support of this show and know they will enjoy its final season in 2012.&quot;

With the announcement of the show's cancellation, a social media movement immediately emerged. Thousands of fans gathered at social web sites in order to state their disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fans Take To Twitter To Protest 'Eureka' Ax|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/8667/fans-take-to-twitter-to-protest-eureka-ax.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
