'''phpMyAdmin''' is an [[open source]] tool written in [[PHP]] intended to handle the administration of [[MySQL]] with the use of a [[Web browser]]. It can perform various tasks such as creating, modifying or deleting [[database]]s, [[Table (database)|tables]], [[Field (computer science)|fields]] or [[Row (database)|rows]]; executing [[SQL]] statements; or managing users and permissions.

==History==
{{noref|section|date=June 2010}}
Tobias Ratschiller, then an IT consultant and later founder of the software company Maguma, started to work on a PHP-based web [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] to MySQL in 1998, inspired by MySQL-Webadmin. He gave up the project (and [[phpAdsNew]], of which he was also the original author) in 2000 because of lack of time.

By that time, phpMyAdmin had already become one of the most popular PHP applications and MySQL administration tools, with a large community of users and contributors. In order to coordinate the growing number of patches, a group of three developers registered ''The phpMyAdmin Project'' at [[SourceForge.net]] and took over the development in 2001.

==Similar products==

Another very similar tool, [[phpPgAdmin]], provides similar functionality for [[PostgreSQL]]. It originally started as a [[fork (software)|fork]] of phpMyAdmin, but is now a completely different [[code base]].&lt;ref&gt;http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/?page=about&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a similar lightweight tool for managing MySQL databases called [[Adminer]] (previously phpMinAdmin), which has all the basic features of phpMyAdmin, but consists of only one PHP file.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adminer.org/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

Chive is a next generation MySQL database management tool aims to be an alternative to phpMyAdmin. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chive-project.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
