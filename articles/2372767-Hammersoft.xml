'''Joint Services Command and Staff College''' (JSCSC) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] military academic establishment providing training and education to experienced officers of the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army|Army]], [[Royal Air Force]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence Civil Service]], and serving officers of other states.

==History==

JSCSC combined the single service provision of the [[British Armed Forces]]: [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], [[Staff College, Camberley]], [[RAF Staff College, Bracknell]] and the [[Joint Service Defence College]], [[Greenwich]].  Initially formed at Bracknell in 1997, the college moved to a purpose-built facility in the grounds of the [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]] at [[Watchfield]] in [[Oxfordshire]] in 2000, and is now co-located with the [[Defence College of Management and Technology]], Shrivenham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nao.org.uk/idoc.ashx?docId=ae520e13-2c49-437f-8e3c-b3161869deb1&amp;version=-1 Ministry of Defence: The Joint Services Command and Staff College] National Audit Office Report 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command, Control and Organisation==

The Joint Services Command and Staff College (JSCSC) trains the future commanders and staff officers of all three UK Armed Services and those of many countries around the world, supporting the operational effectiveness of all three Services.

JSCSC is a component of the Defence Academy and the Commandant is a full member of the DA Management Board, reporting to the Director of the Defence Academy.  The [[Commandant]] is a [[two-star rank|two-star]] appointment ([[Rear Admiral]], [[Major General]] or [[Air Vice-Marshal]]) and can be filled by candidates from each of the three services.  Within JSCSC itself each service is represented by a [[one-star rank|one-star]] Assistant Commandant (Maritime, Land, and Air), each with responsibility for both single service issues and delivery of training.  The [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of Academic Studies, Professor [[Matthew Uttley]], leads [[King's College London]]'s Defence Studies Department, which provides theoretical and conceptual academic education in partnership with the military directing staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/sspp/defence/index.html The Defence Studies Department :Defence Studies Department :King's College London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest==

The college crest features a [[cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax carbo''), a symbol of all three armed services; Britain's largest seabird flies, swims on the sea surface and catches its fish underwater, yet builds its nest on dry land (either on cliffs or in riverside trees).  The Cormorant was derived from the symbol of the Joint Service Defence College.
