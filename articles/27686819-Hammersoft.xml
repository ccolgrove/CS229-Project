Its stock trades under the UAL symbol. To effect the merger, Continental shareholders received 1.05 shares of UAL stock for each Continental share; at the time of closing, it was estimated that United shareholders owned 55% of the merged entity and Continental shareholders owned 45%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=83680&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1478014&amp;highlight=|title=United Continental Holdings, Inc. - Investor Relations - News|publisher=Ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com|accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company or its subsidiary airlines also have several other subsidiaries. United, when it is completely combined, will be the world's largest airline, as measured by revenue passenger miles. United is a founding member of the Star Alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;unitedcontinentalmerger.com&quot;&gt;http://www.unitedcontinentalmerger.com/press-release&lt;/ref&gt;

UCH has major operations at ChicagoâO'Hare, Cleveland, Denver, Guam, HoustonâIntercontinental, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, TokyoâNarita and WashingtonâDulles.

==Development==
Early in February 2008, [[UAL Corporation]] and [[Continental Airlines]]  began advanced stages of merger negotiations and were expected to announce their decision in the immediate aftermath of a definitive merger agreement between rival [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Northwest Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/chi-fri_airlinesfeb15,0,3837947.story United stands ready to merge{{ndash}} chicagotribune.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the events was notable because Northwest's [[golden shares]] in Continental (that gave Northwest veto authority against any merger involving Continental) could be redeemed, freeing Continental to pursue a marriage with United. On April 27, 2008, Continental broke off merger negotiations with United and stated it was going to stand alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/business/28air.html|work=The New York Times|title=Continental Abandons Merger Talks With United|date=April 28, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite ending merger talks, Continental announced that it will join United in the [[Star Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/news/alliance.aspx Continental Airlines]&lt;/ref&gt;

United and [[US Airways]] were in advanced merger talks in late April 2008, following the announcement that [[Continental Airlines|Continental]] had broken off talks with United.&lt;ref&gt;'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24352806/'&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, [[CEOs]] of both United Airlines and [[Continental Airlines]] signed an alliance pact presaging their eventual merger. The alliance is an agreement to link international networks and share technology and passenger perks. This agreement is basically a &quot;virtual merger&quot; that includes many of the benefits of a merger without the actual costs and restructuring involved. The alliance took effect about a year after [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Northwest Airlines]] completed their merger, as that released Continental from the [[SkyTeam]] contract and allowed for the required nine-month notice. Additionally, Continental joined the [[Star Alliance]], as Delta and Northwest merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-fri-united-alliance-uaua-caljun20,0,3619794.story|title=United, Continental join forces|author=Johnsson, Julie|work=Chicago Tribune|date=2008-06-20|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Airlines was reported to be in serious merger discussion with US Airways in early April 2010. A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report indicated that a deal was close. Union consent was cited as a major hurdle for negotiators to clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/united-and-us-airways-hold-merger-talks/?ref=business|title=United and US Airways Said to be in Merger Talks|work=New York Times|date=2010-04-07|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 2010, United announced that it would not pursue a merger with [[US Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Dan|url=http://www.usatoday.com/MONEY/usaedition/2010-04-22-us-airways-ends-merger-talks-united-airlines_NU.htm?csp=34|title=Irked US Airways ends merger talks with United|publisher=Usatoday.Com|date=2010-04-22|accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Directors at Continental and United airlines approved a stock-swap deal that would combine them into the world's largest airline on Sunday, May 2, 2010. The airlines publicly announced the deal the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;unitedcontinentalmerger1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Press Release|url=http://www.unitedcontinentalmerger.com/press-release|title=Press Release &amp;#124; Let's Fly Together|publisher=Unitedcontinentalmerger.com|accessdate=2010-05-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new airline will take on the United Airlines name and be based in United's hometown of Chicago. It will be run by Continental's CEO, [[Jeff Smisek]]. UAL's CEO, [[Glenn Tilton]], will be non-executive chairman. The deal will still need final approval from labor unions and antitrust regulators before being allowed to go forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews1&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/02/continental-united-reportedly-approve-deal-combine/ Continental and United Reportedly Approve Deal to Combine]&lt;/ref&gt; This would re-unite [[Walter Varney]]'s airlines, which offspring includes Continental and United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16064180|work=The Economist|title=Love is in the air|date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the two airlines remain separate until the operational integration is completed (by mid-2012), as of this day both airlines are corporately controlled by the same leadership. Both carriers achieved a single operating certificate from the FAA on November 30, 2011 which allowed both airlines to operate under the name &quot;United&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/pilots-united-gets-single-operating-certificate-231520061.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding==
When United Airlines and Continental Airlines announced their merger in May 2010 they introduced their new corporate branding. It featured the words &quot;United Airlines&quot; in the then-current Continental typeface, and Continental's globe-like logo. United updated their branding once again in August 2010, replacing the words &quot;United Airlines&quot; with the single word '''UNITED''' and changing the font to United's traditional upper-case sans-serif font.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted Aug 12th 2010 05:13 PM|url=http://news.travel.aol.com/2010/08/12/united-continental-show-off-new-livery/|title=United, Continental Show Off New Livery - AOL Travel News|publisher=News.travel.aol.com|date=2010-08-12|accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; United's new CEO Jeff Smisek, who previously served as Continental's chairman, helped design the new font, integrating it with the existing [[Lippincott]]-designed Continental graphics. He has noted that he has received over 15,000 emails with suggestions for a new livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brookson|first=Ben|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/flight-international/2010/12/heres-what-uniteds-ceo-thinks.html|title=Here's what United's CEO thinks of the carrier's new livery - Flight International|publisher=Flightglobal.com|accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Continental Airlines Boeing 737-900ER series aircraft (N53442) was the first aircraft to be painted into the new livery for the combined company.

United Continental Holdings also brings its larger airline services to smaller communities via its branding rights and ownership over the [[Continental Connection]], [[Continental Express]],  and [[United Express]] trademarks. Continental Connection and Continental Express will be consolidated into the United Express marketing and branding as the [[merger integration]] moves forward.

As of late 2010, [[George Gershwin]]'s 1924 &quot;[[Rhapsody in Blue]]&quot; will remain as the new United's theme song, the song has since been featured on new safety videos on United and Continental aircraft.

It was announced February 2011 that United would maintain its P.S., or Premium Service transcontinental aircraft and update the interiors. 

The first United 747 featuring the new livery was painted in February 2011. Re-painting and branding is said to be &quot;accelerated&quot; beginning mid-2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.unitedcontinentalholdings.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=83680&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1532591&amp;highlight= Boeing 747 Debuts in New United Livery] United Continental Holdings PR, 24 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bigger Map - United Airlines.png|thumb|200px|United's new interim advertisement, shown on a print ad on March 1, 2011.]]
On March 1, 2011, United unveiled an &quot;interim&quot; marketing campaign replacing the previous &quot;It's Time to Fly&quot; campaign, which included fingerpaint ads and television spots created by Fallon. On the same date, United removed the iconic 38-year-old [[Saul Bass]]-designed &quot;Tulip&quot; logo from its website and all new advertisements will feature the former Continental globe logo. This new campaign will be used until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/media/2011/03/united_airlines_launches_new_c.html|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=United Airlines launches new campaign from Kaplan Thaler/New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly released ads adopt the same concept of the former Continental ads which simply express a one-liner. As of now, United tagline is 'You're going to like where we land!&quot;

==Hubs==
The combined airline serves up to 370 destinations, from the 10 hubs listed below. This may be subject to change due to future developments and decisions. Continental and United said that Houston's [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] will be the largest hub for the new airline, which is a primary gateway to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Continental Holdings|url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2010/05/continental_and_united_announc.html|title=Cleveland Hopkins to remain a hub after Continental-United merger - at least for now|publisher=cleveland.com|accessdate=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago-O'Hare, Houston-Bush, and San Francisco hubs have completely rebranded. Hubs at Denver, Cleveland, Newark, Tokyo-Narita, and Washington-Dulles are currently being rebranded in phases. Guam is the only hub airport that have not rebranded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continental.com/CMS/en-US/travel/Pages/airportupdates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
