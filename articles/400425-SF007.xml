'''''The Shooting Star''''' ({{lang-fr|'''L'Ãtoile mystÃ©rieuse'''}}) is the tenth of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a series of classic comic-strip books that were written and illustrated by Belgian writer and illustrator [[HergÃ©]], featuring young reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a hero. 

''The Shooting Star'' was first serialized in the newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' in black and white in 1941, and was subsequently published in a colour album in 1942.

==Synopsis==
One particularly hot evening Tintin is out walking with his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]]. Tintin then notices an extra star in the [[Ursa Major|Great Bear]]. When he reaches home, he calls the [[observatory]]. They say that they have the phenomenon under observation and hang up. From his window, Tintin sees that the star is getting bigger every minute. He walks to the observatory and, after some trouble, gets inside. He meets a man called [[Philippulus the Prophet|Philippulus]] who proclaims himself to be a prophet and tells him that &quot;It is a Judgement! Woe!&quot; Puzzled, Tintin proceeds to the main room with the giant telescope. There he meets the director of the observatory, [[Professor Decimus Phostle]], who explains that the extra star is a [[meteor]], a vast ball of fire making its way towards Earth, which will cause the end of the world tomorrow morning.

In the end, however, the shooting star does not collide with the Earth, but passes by it. A piece of it, a [[meteorite]], lands in the [[Arctic Ocean]], causing an [[earthquake]] that lasts a mere few seconds. After an analysis of a [[spectroscope|spectroscopic]] photo of the meteorite, Phostle deduces that it is composed of an entirely new metal. He names this metal &quot;Phostlite&quot;, but is dismayed to discover that the meteorite has landed in the sea and therefore, presumably, is lost. Tintin, however, realises that the meteorite could be protruding above the surface of the water. The Professor is persuaded to organise an expedition to find the metal and to retrieve a sample of it for further research. The expedition consists of leading scientists, as well as Tintin, Snowy and their friend, the alcoholic [[Captain Haddock]] (ironically serving as president of the Society for Sober Sailors), aboard the trawler ''Aurora''.

However, unknown to the ''Aurora'' expedition, another team has already set out aboard the polar expedition ship ''Peary'', backed by a financier from SÃ£o Rico, [[Mr. Bohlwinkel]]. The expedition becomes a race to be the first to land on the meteorite. Bohlwinkel attempts to sabotage the ''Aurora'' expedition by getting a henchman to plant a stick of [[dynamite]] on the ship on the eve of departure, but it is found and thrown overboard. While crossing the [[North Sea]], the ''Aurora'' is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock manages to steer his ship out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the [[Iceland]]ic port of [[Akureyri]], when Captain Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He is furious, but then he and Tintin come across an old friend of his, [[Captain Chester]], who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three of them devise a plan to run a hose from Chester's ship, ''Sirius'', to the ''Aurora'' and thus trick Golden Oil into providing them with the fuel they need.

Coming close to catching the ''Peary'', the ''Aurora'' then receives an indistinct distress call from another ship and has to turn round in order to help. Inquiries by Tintin lead him to realise that the distress signal is a fake designed to further delay them. Resuming the journey, they then intercept a cable announcing that the ''Peary'' expedition has reached the meteorite but not actually claimed it yet. Tintin uses the ship's [[seaplane]] to parachute on to the meteorite and plant the expedition flag, beating the crew of the ''Peary'' by seconds. The ''Aurora'' expedition has won the race.

Tintin makes camp while the ship's over-exerted engines are repaired. The next day he discovers the remarkable properties of Phostlite: his apple core instantly grows into an enormous tree full of oversized apples, and a [[maggot]] turns into a massive butterfly. Tintin is menaced by a giant spider and huge, exploding mushrooms before rescue arrives. Then a sudden [[seaquake]] shakes the meteorite to its core; the young reporter and Snowy retrieve a rock sample and jump to safety as the meteorite sinks into the sea.

The triumphant expedition's return is reported on the radio. Bohlwinkel listens at first in frustrated silence, but then gets concerned at the news that law enforcement agencies are closing in on him over his attempts at destroying and delaying the ''Aurora''. Back on the ship itself, as they prepare to dock, the Captain announces that they are short on one vital commodityâ[[whisky]].

==History==

===Background===

The Belgian comic book creator Georges Remi â who would become better known under his pen name of HergÃ© â first came up with the character of Tintin, a young boy reporter, whilst working at the right wing Belgian newspaper ''[[Le XXe SiÃ¨cle]]'' (''The 20th Century''). Pioneering this new character in the story ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'', this comic, which involved Tintin battling the socialist authorities in the [[Soviet Union]], was serialised in ''Le XXe SiÃ¨cle'''s supplement for children, ''[[Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me]]'' (''The Little Twentieth''), from 10 January 1929 until 11 May 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lof92|Lofficier and Lofficier 2002]]. pp. 22&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Proving a success, HergÃ© went on to pen a string of new ''Adventures of Tintin'', sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, the United States, Egypt, India, China and the United Kingdom, and also to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of [[San Theodoros]] and the East European kingdom of [[Syldavia]].

As he produced these works, his political approach to the world began to change; the earliest books reflected the [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], [[fascism|fascist]] and [[imperialism|imperialistic]] attitudes of those for whom he worked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Later he became critical of the militarism and expansionism of Germany and Italy, with the eighth Tintin adventure, ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' (1939), involving Tintin battling the forces of fictional state of [[Borduria]], whose leader, named MÃ¼sstler, was a combination of Nazi German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment somewhat continued in his subsequent work, ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'', in which the main antagonist, Dr MÃ¼ller, is a German intent on sabotaging the oil supply in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 1991. p. 91-92&quot;&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] broke out across Europe in 1939, and Germany invaded Belgium in 1940. Although HergÃ© initially considered fleeing into a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to stay in his occupied homeland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure their own dominance, the occupation authorities closed down ''Le XXe SiÃ¨cle'', leaving HergÃ© unemployed and his story ''Land of Black Gold'' unfinished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 1991. p. 91-92&quot;/&gt; In search of employment, he was given a job as an illustrator by [[Raymond de Becker]], an executive of the popular newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' (''The Evening''), which was allowed to continue publication under German management.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 92-93.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 October 1940 he was made editor of the paper's children's supplement, ''Le Soir Jeunesse'', in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures, ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'' (1941) and then ''[[The Shooting Star]]'' (1942).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; In this new, more repressive political climate, HergÃ© could no longer explore political themes in his ''Adventures of Tintin''. As Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]] noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer, something which was not a politically sensitive topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson 1991. p. 112&quot;&gt;[[#Tho91|Thompson 1991]]. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication ===
[[Image:Etoile-mysterieuse-drap.jpg|thumb|right|One of the politically loaded features of the original album: the antagonists of the original album were explicitly Americans (top), while later editions feature the flag of the fictitious country of SÃ£o Rico (bottom).]]
''The Shooting Star'' was first published in serial form in the newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' in black and white in 1941. It was subsequently published in a colour album in 1942, the first Tintin album to be in colour. It was also the first Tintin story that was restricted from the start to what would become the standard fixed length of 62 pages. The previous stories had all been about 110 pages long in their original incarnations due to the size of the panels.

The original version had some significant differences from later editions; for example the rival expedition is from the United States. There are also villainous [[Jewish]] characters which led to [[Ideology of Tintin#Tintin and the Jews|charges of anti-Semitism against HergÃ©]]: when the end of the world is announced, two stereotypical Jewish men are seen hoping that the disaster will mean they do not have to pay off their creditors. In addition, the main [[villain]] of the piece is an American [[financier]] with a [[Jewish name]], Blumenstein.

The two [[Jewish]] debtors were removed when the story was published in [[book]] form. In post-war editions of the book, the villains hail from the [[fictional country]] of SÃ£o Rico, and Blumenstein's name becomes Bohlwinkel, a name less immediately identifiable as Jewish. Despite these changes, traces of the original version remain: the Sao Rican ships still have American names (the ''[[Robert Peary|Peary]]'' and the ''[[Kentucky]] Star'') and Tintin uses a [[World War II]] [[Arado Ar 196|Arado 196]] [[Nazi Germany|German]] reconnaissance aircraft.

Finally, references to [[God]] were removed from the English language version to avoid offending the [[Church of England|church]]. In the original French, in the scene depicting Philippulus at the top of the ship's mast, Captain Haddock claims that he is the only master of the ship after God and orders Philippulus to climb down. But Philippulus rejects this by claiming it is he who is the only master after God. Tintin also claims to be the voice of God the Holy Father when he uses the megaphone to tell Philippulus to climb back down.

==Points of interest==
*The atmosphere of doom and foreboding that occupies the early part of the story very much conveys the feelings of the time, when [[World War II]] was still at its height.&lt;ref name=TintinTheCompleteCompanion&gt;''Tintin: The Complete Companion'' by [[Michael Farr]], John Murray publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

*When Phostle announces the discovery of Phostlite he decides to celebrate with a packet of [[Humbug (sweet)#Bulls-eyes|bulls-eye]]s, a rather odd way of celebrating a discovery of this importance. As well as the humour, it may be a reflection on the fact that most foodstuffs were rationed during the war.

*Philippulus the Prophet drops Tintin's suitcase on the head of '''Professor Paul Cantonneau''', a member of the expedition. Cantonneau was to reappear as one of the victims of ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'', which explains how he and Tintin know each other in that adventure.

*[[Thomson and Thompson]] only appear in one panel in this adventure, as they make their way to the docks to see the ''Aurora'' off. Also in the same panel are [[Quick &amp; Flupke]], fans of Tintin (who had also appeared in the opening panel of ''[[Tintin in the Congo]]'').

*In most of the Tintin books involving sea travel, HergÃ© was careful to obtain as much data concerning the ships involved in the adventure as possible. However, the ''Aurora'' was an entirely fictional vessel, and HergÃ© admitted later that it was probably unseaworthy.&lt;ref name=TintinTheCompleteCompanion&gt;''Tintin: The Complete Companion'' by [[Michael Farr]], John Murray publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Swedish expedition member Eric BjÃ¶rgenskjÃ¶ld (seen on the right of the panel in which Professor Phostle is given the flag to plant on the meteorite) physically resembles a real person: [[Auguste Piccard]], who was HergÃ©'s inspiration for [[Professor Calculus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeTournesolillustre&quot;&gt;''Le Tournesol illustrÃ©'' by Albert Algoud, [[Casterman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The seaplane pilot who flies Tintin to the meteorite and back is nameless, but after WWII he featured in a number of text articles in the newly-launched [[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin magazine]]. In these articles, Tintin would &quot;interview&quot; the pilot and Captain Haddock on technical details concerning [[aircraft]] and [[ship]]s, from [[Scale model|model]]s to full-scale versions. The questions in the interviews were based on readers' letters. The technical aspects of balloons and planes were explained by the seaplane pilot who was given the name '''Major Wings''' and often lapsed into English. The rank of Major would imply an [[United States Air Force|American USAF]] commissionâwhich would be odd for a European-based expeditionâbut it might be noted that continental writers have often given Army ranks to officers of the [[Royal Air Force|British RAF]] regardless of the fact that it does not use such a system. The comic book hero ''[[Clifton (comics)|Colonel Clifton]]'', who is retired from the RAF, is an example of thisâhis proper rank would be that of [[Group Captain]].

*This book features a brief appearance of the ''Sirius'' (in [[Captain Chester]]'s scenes), which is later used as the expedition vessel in ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]''. The version of ''Sirius'' shown here looks somewhat different from its depiction in the later album.

* Tintin, who had disapproved of Captain Haddock's drinking in ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', actually gets him to drink alcohol in order to make him more co-operativeâhe would use the same tactic in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'' and ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]''.

*Although Herge removed the ship's identity in the latest version, an American flag is still left at the &quot;Peary&quot; It is shown on page 35 panel 8.
