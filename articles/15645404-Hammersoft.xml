'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;The ring leader of the school gang &quot;[[KO One#Groups|Zhong Ji Yi Ban]]&quot; (çµæ¥µä¸ç­ / ''Ultimate Class''). Self-confident and stubborn. Acts as an obedient child in front of his parents, and has attempted to keep his parents in the dark about his school life. Everybody in Zhong Ji Yi Ban listens to what he says.

Da Dong is number three on the [[KO One#KO Rank|KO Rank]] and has the fighting count of 9000.

Although Da Dong seems harsh and cold, he is actually a good person at heart and shows his caring side whenever his friends need help.

Because of his confidence and stubbornness, [[List of KO One characters#Wang Ya Se (çäºç)|Ya Se]] often calls him &quot;Zi Da Kuang&quot; (èªå¤§ç / ''Egomaniac'').

*''Hobbies'':
Da Dong often spends time singing with an underground music band named [[List of KO One characters#Dong Cheng Wei (æ±åè¡)|Dong Cheng Wei]] (æ±åè¡) to enchance his power.

*''Love life'':
Da Dong has been in love with a girl named [[List of KO One characters#Huang An Qi (é»å®çª)|An Qi]] since he was a kid, but was too shy to reveal it. However, during her time in America, she's written over 500 letters to him, and though he did not respond to any of the letters, he has been secretly collecting and reciting them. The two of them were a couple at a point in the storyline, but eventually broke up due to Da Dong's crush on his teacher and his best friend [[List of KO One characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Xiao Yu]]'s crush on An Qi. And the fact that they were being targeted by a powerful enemy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.oioj.net/blog/new2/qqovb/archives/2006/352511.shtml Â¡Â¶ÃÃÂ¼Â«ÃÂ»Â°Ã Â¡Â·Â³Â¬Â¼Â¶Â½ÃÃÂ¼-Â´Â½Â¶Â¤ÆÃÂ¶Â¾&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;He carries the &quot;Long Wen Ao&quot; (é¾ç´é / ''Dragon Tattooed Pan'') as his primary weapon. A unique aspect of this weapon is that it can vary its master's fighting count according to the opponent's fighting count; it becomes stronger when fighting strong opponents and remain normal when facing weaker ones (éå¼·åå¼·ãéå¼±åå¼±).

Before revealing his main weapon, he has also been seen using a normal cooking pan to fight ordinary gangsters.

'''Sequels:''' &lt;br&gt;In ''[[The X-Family]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å®¶), he becomes a secondary character and is desperate to restore his powers. Realizing his desperation, his friend [[List of KO One characters#Xiu (è©)|Xiu]] tells him that he may have a chance to restore his powers: if he can find an alternate counterpart in another dimension. During Xiu's search, he finds out that Da Dong has an alternate counterpart in the Iron Dimension called [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian]] and later another counterpart named [[List of The X-Family characters#Zack|Zack]] from the Bronze Dimension. Turns out, Xia Tian shares his ability to vary the flow of his power according to the opponent's power level.

In ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å), Da Dong travels to the Silver Dimension with his friends. While trying his cellphone's camera, he accidentally drops a coin that causes a gigantic rock to fall on Xiu's alternate counterpart, Liu Bei. He then takes Liu Bei back to his dimension for treatment while Xiu is forced to take Liu Bei's place until he recovers from his injuries. Later, [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Sun Ce (å­«ç­)|Sun Ce]], Da Dong's alternate counterpart in the Silver Dimension appears.

'''Alternate counterparts:'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Biography:''' &lt;br&gt;The son of the gangster leader of &quot;[[KO One#Groups|Tu Long Bang]]&quot; (åé¾å¹«).

Rich, powerful, self-centered, and his concerns are his looks.

His name is a Chinese translation of the English name &quot;[[Arthur]]&quot;.

Like Da Dong, he has a 3rd position on the [[KO One#KO Rank|KO Rank]], his fighting count being 9000. Because he and Da Dong shared the third position, he joined Zhong Ji Yi Ban intending to challenge him, but before they could fight, they became best buddies.

*''Titles'':
Most people know him as &quot;Ya Se Wang&quot; (äºçç / ''King Arthur''), his last name switching positions with his first name: but [[List of KO One characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Da Dong]] often calls him &quot;Zi Lian Kuang&quot; (èªæç / ''Narcissist'').

*''Being framed'':
He is the first person to find out that [[List of KO One characters#Lei Ke Si (é·åæ¯) / Wu Shi Duo (æ­¦å±å¥ª)|Lei Ke Si]] is KO 2, although nobody seems to believe him.

When Lei Ke Si finally reveals his identity, he exonerates his name and returns to school.

*''Hobbies'':
Ya Se's most notable habit is to [[KO One#Quotes Said By Ya Se|quote]] authors like [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. His favorite quote being ''&quot;To be or not to be, that is a question&quot;''.

*''Love life'':
Although Ya Se only loves himself, he eventually learns to love others when a girl named [[List of KO One characters#Cai Wu Xiong (è¡äºç)|Cai Wu Xiong]] risks her own life to save him. When he finds out that Wu Xiong is aging to death, he forces himself to fall in love with her in order to save her, which he succeeds and learns the true meaning of love - the most precious thing of all.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Specialty:''' &lt;br&gt;His primary weapon is the Shi Zhong Jian (ç³ä¸­å / ''Sword in the Stone'') - a spiritual dagger created by the wizard [[Merlin]] and used by [[King Arthur]]. When he removes the stone from the dagger, the sword essence will possess Ya Se, allowing him to instantly gain evil powers at the expense of losing control over his own actions.

His other special ability is his super-speed (an ability that other people can also use), which he indicates is well-known, which probably means that he can run faster than others.

'''Sequels:''' &lt;br&gt;In ''[[The X-Family]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å®¶), he becomes a secondary character and finds out that he has an alternate counterpart in the Iron Dimension called [[List of The X-Family characters#Lan Ling Wang (è­éµç)|Lan Ling Wang]].

He is prone to giving others cold looks if they are not willing to leave him alone. Xiao Yu is also very straightforward.

Unlike everybody else, he lives in a tent instead of a real home and has no family of his own.

*''Hobbies'':
Xiao Yu is more likely to be found spending time in the music room because he likes to play the piano. His music is so touching that anyone who hears it can be reminded of what it's like to love others.

*''Love life'':
Xiao Yu carries a cellphone with him, but never gives his number to anyone - including Da Dong and Ya Se. But when he falls in love with Da Dong's girlfriend, [[List of KO One characters#Huang An Qi (é»å®çª)|An Qi]], he gives it to her and tells her to call him whenever she's in need of help. Da Dong eventually finds out that he is in love with An Qi and the three of them become odd against each other, and prefer to rather not talk about their relationship. Their relationship ends with An Qi deciding to return to America. After this, Da Dong and Xiao Yu solve their problem and become friends again. However, Xiao Yu declares that An Qi belongs with Da Dong and not him.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

While Xiao Yu is quiet and turned inward, Jiu Wu is more open and alive.

In ''[[K.O.3an Guo]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å), Xiao Yu travels to the Silver Dimension with his friends and meet new friends there. While Da Dong is trying out his cellphone's camera, Da Dong accidentally drops a coin that causes a gigantic rock to fall on Xiu's alternate counterpart, Liu Bei.

She has been in love with Da Dong for a really long time, but never knew how he felt, nor the fact that Lei Ke Si was in love with her as well.

She moved to America five years ago, but during that time she has written over five hundred letters to Da Dong - two letters per week. She never got any response from Da Dong for any of her letters, but he has secretly been collecting and memorizing them.

*''Love and disappointment'':
Her love for Da Dong is the reason to why Lei Ke Si holds such anger against Da Dong. When Lei Ke Si finally reveals his identity as KO 2 and gets Da Dong into a hospital, she decides to return to America in order to forget about everything she feels about Da Dong, because she believes it is her love that has caused the rivalry between him and his best friend.

Her name is referred to as &quot;five bears,&quot; because she killed five bears when she was still a newly born baby and was therefore named &quot;Wu Xiong&quot; (äºç), meaning ''five bears'' in translation.
