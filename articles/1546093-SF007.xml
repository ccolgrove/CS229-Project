{{Bell Unix}}
'''UNIX/32V''' was an early version of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]] from [[Bell Laboratories]], released in June [[1979]].  32V was a direct [[porting|port]] of the [[PDP-11]] [[Seventh Edition Unix]] to the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VAX]] architecture.

UNIX/32V was released without [[paging]] [[virtual memory]], retaining only the [[swapping]] architecture of Seventh Edition.  A virtual memory system was added at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] by [[Bill Joy]] and others in order to support [[Franz Lisp]]; this was released to other Unix licensees as the Third [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] ('''3BSD''') in 1979.  Thanks to the popularity of the two systems' successors, 4BSD and [[UNIX System V]], UNIX/32V is an antecedent of nearly all modern Unix systems.
