==History==
The [[Whitmore Baronets|Whitmore family]] had been feudal landowners of Apley since 1572 &lt;ref&gt;''A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain'' John Burke (1836) p409&lt;/ref&gt; when the manor was purchased by William Whitmore(d.1593), a haberdasher of London. The will of William Whitmore, dated 6th August 1593 records:&lt;ref&gt;From: 'Wills: 31-40 Elizabeth I (1588-98)', Calendar of wills proved and enrolled in the Court of Husting, London: Part 2: 1358-1688 (1890), pp. 713-725 [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=67037&amp;strquery=balmes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Roll 274 (15). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

William Whitmore's eldest son was Sir William Whitmore of Apley, knight, [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]] in 1620, and his second son was [[George Whitmore (Lord Mayor)|Sir George Whitmore]](d.1654), Lord Mayor of London. Sir William resided at Apley and in 1634 purchased the manor of Balmes in Hackney, held under a lease by his father, for his brother Sir George, who there received King Charles I in 1641.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria County History, Middlesex, vol.10, 1995, Hackney, pp.75-91&lt;/ref&gt;
Sir William's son and heir was [[Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet]](d.1653)

The existing Georgian style house was remodeled during the [[Regency architecture|Regency period]] in Neo-Gothic style between 1808 and 1811 for Thomas Whitmore, [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]] in 1806 and [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Bridgnorth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgnorth]] 1806-1831. It incorporated a faux chapel, hexagonal turrets and battlements.&lt;ref name=IOE/&gt; Design work is attributed to members of the architectural family of [[Thomas Wyatt]] and construction work was undertaken by the Carline family of [[Shrewsbury]].

In 1867, the Foster family purchased the property for a record amount and remodelled it during a [[Gothic Revival architecture|revival of Gothic style]] in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period. Famous English eccentric Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th [[Baron Berners]] was related to the Foster's and  was born at Apley in 1883. The Hall and Estate remained in Foster family ownership until 1960 when the last incumbent of the Foster family died.

Due to the vastness of the house and its substantial upkeep it was difficult to find a family willing to occupy Apley Hall and so alternative uses were sought. In 1962 the house became a [[private school]] and remained so until its closure in 1987.

Apley Hall remained empty and suffered a great deal of deterioration and [[vandalism]] during the following 10 years and was listed on the [[English Heritage]] [[Buildings at Risk Register]]. In 1997 the house was bought by Neil Avery an [[entrepreneur]] and conservation specialist as a family home. The house was restored and subsequently removed from the Buildings at Risk Register.

There had long been speculation that [[Jeeves and Wooster]] author [[P.G.Wodehouse]] had based his fictitious [[Blandings Castle]] on Apley. In 2003, Dr Daryl Lloyd and Dr Ian Greatbatch (two researchers in the Department of Geography and Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, [[University College London]]) made use of a [[Geographic Information System]] to analyse a set of geographical criteria, such as a [[viewshed]] analysis of [[The Wrekin]] and drive time from Shrewsbury. Their final conclusion was that Apley was the best suited location for fulfilling the geographical criteria

During 2004 the house was sold to specialist developers who have since divided the Hall into several self-contained [[apartment]]s.
