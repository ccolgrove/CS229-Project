==Current Work==
Anita Alvarez is currently pursuing charges against Tiawanda Moore who is being charged with recording a police officer's inappropriate sexual advances towards her. According to the Huffington Post &quot;When Chicago police answered a domestic disturbance call at the home of Tiawanda Moore and her boyfriend in July 2010, the officers separated the couple to question them individually. Moore was interviewed privately in her bedroom. According to Moore, the officer who questioned her then came on to her, groped her breast and slipped her his home phone number.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/08/chicago-district-attorney-recording-bad-cops_n_872921.html?ref=fb&amp;src=sp|work=Chicago State's Attorney Lets Bad Cops Slide, Prosecutes Citizens Who Record Them|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Illinois it is against the law to record anyone, audio or visual, without his or her consent.
