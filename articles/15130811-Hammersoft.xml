'''Massimiliano Allegri''' (born 11 August 1967 in [[Livorno]]) is an [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] coach and former [[midfielder]]. He is the current head coach of [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|A.C Milan]].

==Club career==
After spending the earlier part of his career in the lower leagues, including his hometown club [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], Allegri joined [[Pescara Calcio|Pescara]] in 1991. He established himself in midfield as [[Giovanni Galeone]]'s side won promotion to [[Serie A]] in 1992. Allegri was an outstanding performer for Pescara in Serie A. Despite the side's relegation in last place, there was no shortage of goals and Allegri scored an impressive 12 goals from midfield. He moved on to [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and then [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] before returning to Pescara. Brief spells at [[A.C. Pistoiese|Pistoiese]] and [[Aglianese Calcio 1923|Aglianese]] followed before his retirement from active football in 2003.

==Coaching==
===Early career===
Allegri started a coaching career in 2004, serving as boss of [[Serie C2]] team [[Aglianese Calcio 1923|Aglianese]], the club where he spent his two final years as a player. Following an impressive season with them, Allegri was called to head [[U.S. Grosseto F.C.|Grosseto]], then in [[Serie C1]]; his experience with the ''biancorossi'' however proved not to be as successful as with Aglianese, and he was ultimately sacked shortly after the beginning of the 2006â07 Serie C1 season. Shortly after being sacked by Grosseto, Allegri agreed to rejoin his mentor [[Giovanni Galeone]] at [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], becoming part of his coaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportnews.it/news/index.php?nid=2056480&amp;srctxt= |publisher=SportNews.it |language=Italian |title=Udinese, Allegri entra nello staff tecnico come ottimizzatore |accessdate=28 April 2008|date=6 November 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice however proved to be forbidden by the Italian football laws because he was still contracted with the Tuscan club, and caused Allegri to be disqualified for three months on early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.unionesportivafoggia.com/index.php?id=2533 |publisher=Foggia Calcio|language=Italian |title=Allegri il prigioniero. Tra venti giorni esce |accessdate=28 April 2008|date=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sassuolo===
On August 2007 Allegri became head coach of ambitious [[Serie C1]] team [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]], who Allegri managed to lead quickly into the top league spots. On 27 April 2008 Sassuolo mathematically ensured the 2007â08 Serie C1/A league title, thus winning a historical first promotion to [[Serie B]] for the ''neroverdi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/04/sezioni/sport/calcio/ritornano-in-b/ritornano-in-b/ritornano-in-b.html |publisher=La Repubblica |title=Sassuolo e Salernitana in serie B, promozione storica per gli emiliani |accessdate=27 April 2008|date=27 April 2008|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cagliari===
On 29 May 2008 he was announced as new head coach of [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] in the [[Serie A]], replacing [[Davide Ballardini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allegri_cagliari&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/notizia.asp?idNotizia=5599&amp;type=0&amp;id_menu=1 |language=Italian |publisher=Cagliari Calcio |accessdate=29 May 2008 |date=29 May 2008|title=Allegri sulla panchina del Cagliari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a disappointing start, with five losses in the first five league matches, Allegri was confirmed by club chairman [[Massimo Cellino]] and later went on to bring his team up to a mid-table placement in December. On 9 December following a 1â0 home win to [[U.S. CittÃ  di Palermo|Palermo]], Cagliari Calcio announced to have agreed a 2-year contract extension with Allegri, with a new contract set to expire 1n June 2011. The contract was then revealed to have been signed on October, in the midst of the ''rossoblu'''s early crisis result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&amp;id=131831 |publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb |language=Italian |accessdate=13 December 2008 |date=9 December 2008|title=Il Cagliari conferma Allegri fino al 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He completed the 2008â09 season in an impressive ninth place, that was hailed as a huge result with respect to the limited resources, the lack of top-class players and the high quality of Cagliari's attacking football style which led the Sardinians not far from [[UEFA Europa League]] qualification. Such results led him to be awarded the [[Panchina d'Oro]] ''(Golden bench)'', a prize awarded to the best Serie A football manager according to other managers' votes. He won the same prize for a second consecutive time also for his results in the 2009â10, where he managed to confirm Cagliari's high footballing levels despite the loss of regular striker [[Robert Acquafresca]], and leading an impressive number of three players from his side ''(namely, [[Davide Biondini]], [[Federico Marchetti]] and [[Andrea Cossu (born 1980)|Andrea Cossu]])'' to receive Italian national team call-ups during his reign at the club. 

On 13 April 2010 Cagliari surprisingly removed Allegri from his managerial duties despite a good twelfth place with 40 points, and youth coach Giorgio Melis (with [[Gianluca Festa]] as his assistant) was appointed at his replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;allegri_sacked&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/notizia.asp?idNotizia=8572&amp;type=0&amp;id_menu=1 |publisher=Cagliari Calcio |language=Italian |accessdate=13 April 2010|date=13 April 2010|title=Esonerato Allegri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2010/04/13/1877346/official-cagliari-sack-coach-massimiliano-allegri|title=OFFICIAL: Cagliari Sack Coach Massimiliano Allegri|date=13 April 2010|work=Goal.com|publisher=Ellinton Invest Inc.|first=Rick|last=D'Andrea|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milan===
He was released from his contract by [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] on 17 June 2010, under request of Serie A giants [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who were interested in appointing him as their new head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/notizia.asp?idNotizia=8813&amp;type=0&amp;id_menu=1 |publisher=Cagliari Calcio |language=Italian |accessdate=17 June 2010|date=17 June 2010|title=Il Cagliari libera Allegri}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June, Allegri was officially appointed as the new coach of [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. In his first season in charge, Allegri led [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] to their first championship title since [[2003â04 Serie A|2004]], beating [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] in both league fixtures, however, his side failed to make it past the [[2010â11 Coppa Italia|semi-finals of the Coppa Italia]], by losing to [[U.S. CittÃ  di Palermo|Palermo]] 4-3 on aggregate in his first season. The team also qualified for the [[2010â11 UEFA Champions League|second round of the Champions League]], where they were eliminated by [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. 

However, Massimiliano Allegri has proven to the [[Serie A]] that he's a promising young coach and he led [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] to their sixth [[Supercoppa Italiana]] by coming from behind in a 2-1 win over [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter]] in a game played in the [[Beijing National Stadium]].
