==German forces==
The majority of German units stationed west of the [[Rhine]] were under the responsibility of [[Oberbefehlshaber West]] ([[OB West]]), commanded at the time by [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Gerd von Rundstedt]]. 

Due to a lack of replacements (both in terms of personnel and [[materiel]]) German units were generally severely understrength at this point in the war, with many units at about 50% of establishment strength.
