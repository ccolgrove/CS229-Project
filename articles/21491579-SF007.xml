{{Politics of the United States}}
'''Elections for [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] of the [[United States]]''' are [[indirect election]]s in which voters cast ballots for a slate of electors of the [[Electoral College (United States)|U.S. Electoral College]], who in turn directly elect the President and Vice President. They occur [[wiktionary:quadrennial|quadrennially]] (the count beginning with the year 1792) on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], the Tuesday between November 2 and 8,&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|3|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the general elections of various other federal, states and local races. [[United States presidential election, 2008|The most recent presidential election]] occurred on November 4, 2008, with [[United States presidential election, 2012|the next one]] scheduled for November 6, 2012.

The process is regulated by a combination of both [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] laws. Each state is allocated a number of Electoral College electors equal to the number of its [[United States Senate|Senators]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] in the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clause 1&quot;&gt;[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Washington, D.C.]] is given a number of electors equal to the number held by the smallest state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are not represented in the Electoral College.

Under the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] is allowed to designate a way of choosing electors.&lt;ref name=&quot;clause 1&quot;/&gt; Thus, the popular vote on Election Day is conducted by the various states and not directly by the federal government. Once chosen, the electors can vote for anyone, but &amp;ndash; with rare exceptions like an [[unpledged elector]] or [[faithless elector]] &amp;ndash; they vote for their designated candidates and their votes are certified by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in early January. The [[United States Congress|Congress]] is the final judge of the electors; the last serious dispute was in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]].

The nomination process, including the [[United States presidential primary|primary elections]] and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating conventions]], were never specified in the Constitution, and were instead developed by the states and the [[political party|political parties]].

==History==
[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] originally established the method of presidential elections, including the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. This was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to choose the president, and those who preferred a national popular vote.

Each [[U.S. state|state]] is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of Congress combined. With the ratification of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]] to the Constitution in 1961, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] is also granted a number of electors, equal to the number of those held by the least populous state. However, [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are not represented in the Electoral College.

Constitutionally, the manner for choosing electors is determined within each state by its legislature. During [[United States presidential election, 1789|the first presidential election in 1789]], only 6 of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;Out of the 13 original states during the [[United States presidential election, 1789|1789 election]], 6 states chose electors by some form of popular vote, 4 states chose electors by a different method, [[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]] were ineligible to participate since they had not yet ratified the U.S. Constitution, and [[New York]] failed to appoint their allotment of electors in time because of a deadlock in their state legislature.&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually throughout the years, the states began conducting popular elections to help choose their slate of electors, resulting in the overall, nationwide indirect election system that it is today.

Under the original system established by Article Two, electors could cast two votes to two different candidates for president. The candidate with the highest number of votes (provided it was a majority of the electoral votes) became the president, and the second-place candidate became the vice president. This presented a problem during the [[United States presidential election, 1800|presidential election of 1800]] when [[Aaron Burr]] received the same number of electoral votes as [[Thomas Jefferson]] and challenged Jefferson's election to the office. In the end, Jefferson was chosen as the president because of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s influence in the House of Representatives. This added to the deep rivalry between Burr and Hamilton which resulted in their [[Burr-Hamilton duel|famous 1804 duel]].

In response to the 1800 election, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]] was passed, requiring electors to cast two distinct votes: one for President and another for Vice President. The Amendment also established rules when no candidate wins a majority vote in the Electoral College.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1824|presidential election of 1824]], [[Andrew Jackson]] received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], but not a majority, of electoral votes cast. The election was thrown to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and [[John Quincy Adams]] was elected to the presidency. A deep rivalry was fermented between Andrew Jackson and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]], who had also been a candidate in the election.

Although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the winner of a presidential election, it does strongly correlate with who is the victor. In 52 of the 56 total elections held so far (about 93 percent), the winner of the Electoral College vote has also carried the national popular vote.  However, candidates can fail to get the most votes in the nationwide popular vote in a Presidential election and still win that election. In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular vote, but no one received the majority of electoral votes. According to the 12th Amendment in the Constitution, the House of Representatives must choose the president out of the top 3 people in the election. Clay had come fourth, so he threw his support to Adams, who then won. Because Adams later named Clay his Secretary of State, Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal with Clay. Charges of a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; followed Adams through his term. Then in [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]] and [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]], the winner of electoral vote lost the popular vote outright. Numerous [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] have been submitted seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, but none has ever successfully passed both Houses of Congress. Another alternate proposal is the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[United States interstate compact|interstate compact]] whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results.

==Nominating process==
{{main|United States presidential primary|United States presidential nominating convention}}

The modern nominating process of U.S. presidential elections currently consists of two major parts: a series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] held in each state, and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] held by each [[political party]]. This process was never included in the [[United States Constitution]], and thus evolved over time by the political parties to clear the field of candidates.

The [[primary election]]s and [[caucus]]es are run by state and local governments. Some states only hold primary elections, some only hold caucuses, and others use a combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered between January and June before the federal election, with [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and primary, respectively.

Like the general election, presidential caucuses or primaries are indirect elections. The major political parties officially vote for their presidential candidate at their respective nominating conventions, usually all held in the summer before the federal election. Depending on each state's law and state's political party rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary, they may be voting to award delegates &quot;bound&quot; to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions, or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national convention.

Unlike the general election, voters in the [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] can also elect delegates to the national conventions.

Along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses, state delegations to both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] conventions also include &quot;unpledged&quot; delegates who can vote for whomever they want. For Republicans, these include top party officials. Democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called &quot;[[superdelegate]]s&quot;, who are party leaders and elected officials.

Each party's presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential nominee to run with them on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention.

==The popular vote on Election Day==
Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature.  Although each state currently designates electors by popular vote, other methods are allowed.  For instance, a number of states formerly chose presidential electors by a vote of the state legislature itself.   

However, the Constitution does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day, which is &quot;the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November,&quot; i.e. a Tuesday no earlier than November 2 and no later than November 8.  Today, the states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] each conduct their own popular elections on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] to help determine their respective slate of electors. Thus, the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate and simultaneous state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government.

Like any other election in the United States, the eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at state level. The Constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on grounds of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|race or color]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sex]] or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|age for citizens eighteen years or older]]. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility.

Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote &quot;for the electors of a candidate&quot; meaning that the voter is not voting for the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate.

Many voting ballots allow a voter to âblanket voteâ for all candidates in a particular [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]] or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as [[ballot access]]. Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for President, but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided that enough voters have endorsed the candidate, usually through a signature list.

The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written in at the time of election as a [[write-in candidate]]. This is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as [[Mickey Mouse]] or comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] (whose application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President of the United States.

Because [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] are not represented in the Electoral College, U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for President. [[Guam]] has held [[straw poll]]s for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;guammove&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/07/10/guam-legislature-moves-general-election-presidential-vote-to-the-september-primary/ |title=Guam Legislature Moves General Election Presidential Vote to the September Primary |publisher=Ballot-Access.org |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral college==
{{main|Electoral College (United States)}}

Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket that wins a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] of votes wins all of that state's allocated electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College. [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] do not use this method, opting instead to give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.

Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for President and Vice President. Although Electoral College members can technically vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 24 states have laws to punish [[faithless elector]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairvote.org/e_college/faithless.htm&lt;/ref&gt; those who do not cast their electoral votes for the person whom they have pledged to elect.

In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by the sitting Vice President, acting in his capacity as [[President of the Senate#United States Senate|President of the Senate]], and read aloud to a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the President.

If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (currently at least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]]. Specifically, the selection of President would then be decided by a ballot of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. For the purposes of electing the President, each state only has one vote. A ballot of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each senator has one vote.  Congress has chosen the victor of the election only twice, in [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]] and [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]].

If the President is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the Vice President-elect acts as President. If neither are chosen by then, Congress by law determines who shall act as President, pursuant to the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th Amendment]].

Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies, the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a formality since the winner can be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote results.

==Trends==
===Political experience===
A number of trends in the political experience of presidents have been observed over the years. In recent decades, the presidential nominees of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties have been either incumbent presidents, sitting or former vice presidents, sitting or former U.S. Senators, or sitting or former state [[Governor]]s. The last major nominee from either party who had not previously served in such an office was General    [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who won the Republican nomination and ultimately the presidency in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 election]]. [[Chester A. Arthur]] had held no federal or statewide office, before becoming Vice President and then President.

The [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] used to be a stepping-stone to the White House, with five of the six Presidents who served between 1801 and 1841 previously holding that office. However, since 1841, only one Secretary of State has gone on to be President ([[James Buchanan]]).

Fourteen Presidents have previously served as Vice President. However only [[John Adams]] ([[United States presidential election, 1796|1796]]), [[Thomas Jefferson]] ([[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]]), [[Martin Van Buren]] ([[United States presidential election, 1836|1836]]), [[Richard Nixon]] ([[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]]) and [[George H. W. Bush]] ([[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]]) began their first term after winning an election. Among the remaining nine who began their first term as President according to the [[presidential line of succession]] after their respective predecessor died or resigned from office, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] were reelected. [[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], and [[Gerald Ford]] served as President but never won any presidential election.

In the most recent [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], the nominees of both major parties, [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]], were sitting U.S. Senators. Before 2008, fifteen presidents previously served in the Senate, including four of the five Presidents who served between 1945 and 1974. However, only two out of those fifteen were sitting U.S. Senators at the time they were elected president ([[Warren G. Harding]] in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]]). Major-party candidate Senators Andrew Jackson ([[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]]), [[Lewis Cass]] ([[United States presidential election, 1848|1848]]), [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] ([[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]]), [[Barry Goldwater]] ([[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]]), [[George McGovern]] ([[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]]), and [[John Kerry]] ([[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]]) all lost their elections.  Only one sitting member of the House of Representatives has been elected president ([[James A. Garfield]]), although eighteen presidents have been former members of the House.

Despite the 2008 election, contemporary electoral success has clearly favored state governors. Of the last six presidents, four ([[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]]) have been governors of a state. Geographically, these presidents were from either very large states ([[California]], [[Texas]]) or from a state south of the [[Mason-Dixon Line]] and east of Texas ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Arkansas]]). In all, sixteen presidents have been former governors, including seven who were in office as governor at the time of their election to the presidency. 

After leaving office, one President, [[William Howard Taft]], served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  Only two Presidents, [[John Quincy Adams]] (serving in the House) and [[Andrew Johnson]] (serving in the Senate), have served in Congress after being President.  John Quincy Adams however is the only former President to be elected to federal office; when Andrew Johnson served as a Senator, state legislatures appointed the Senators.

===Technology and media===
Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. The invention of both radio and television have given way to the reliance of national political advertisements across those methods of communication. National advertisements such as [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s 1964 commercial &quot;[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]&quot;, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1984 commercial &quot;[[Morning in America]]&quot;, and [[George H.W. Bush]]'s 1988 commercial &quot;[[Revolving Door (advertisement)|Revolving Door]]&quot; became major factors in those respective elections. In 1992, George H. W. Bush's broken promise of &quot;[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]&quot; was extensively used in the commercials of [[Bill Clinton]] and Bush's other opponents with significant effect during the campaign.

Since the development of the [[Internet]] in the mid-90s, [[Internet activism]] has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000.  The [[internet]] was first used in the 1996 presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski|title=The Role of the Internet in Presidential Campaigns|journal=Communications Studies|year=2009|volume=60|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It was only used by a few candidates and there is no evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009&quot;/&gt;   

In 2000, both candidates ([[George W. Bush]] and [[Al Gore]]) created, maintained and updated their campaign website.  But it was not until the 2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the [[internet]] seen.  By the summer of 2003, ten people competing in the 2004 presidential election had developed campaign websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Endres, Warnick|title=Text-based Interactivity in Candidate Campaign Web Sites: A case Study from the 2002 Elections|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=68|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Howard Dean presidential campaign, 2004|Howard Deanâs]] campaign website from that year was considered a model for all future campaign websites. His website played a significant role in his overall campaign strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Endres, Warmick|title=Text-based Interactivity in Candidate Campagin Web Sites: A case Study from the 2002 Elections|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=2009|volume=68|issue=3|pages=322â342}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It allowed his supporters to read about his campaign platform and provide feedback, donate, get involved with the campaign, and connect with other supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski|title=The Role of the Internet in Presidential Camapigns|journal=Communications Studies|year=2009|volume=60|issue=5|pages=574â588|doi=10.1080/10510970903260418|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Chesebro|first2=James W.|last3=Studinski|first3=David Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll from January 2004 revealed that 49 percent of Americans have used the [[internet]] to get information about candidates, and 28 percent said that they use the [[internet]] to get this information frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009 574â588&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski|title=The Role of the Internet in Presidential Campaigns|journal=Communications Studies|year=2009|volume=60|issue=5|pages=574â588|doi=10.1080/10510970903260418|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Chesebro|first2=James W.|last3=Studinski|first3=David Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[internet]] became a [[grassroots]] and a voice of the people tool-a way for the users to connect with each other and with the campaign, like Deanâs website had done in 2004. All of the major candidates had a website and utilized [[social networking]] like [[facebook]] and [[myspace]].  The popularity of a candidate could be measured by the number of âfriendsâ on these sites as well as on websites like Hitwise, which listed the number of hits all of the presidential candidateâs websites had each week. 

Internet channels such as [[YouTube]] were used by candidates to share speeches and ads for free.  This also served as a forum for users to attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollard, Chesebro &amp; Studinski 2009 574â588&quot;/&gt; 

A study done by the [[Pew]] Internet &amp; American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the [[United States]] used the [[internet]] to get information about the [[2010 midterm elections]] and about specific candidates.  This represents 73 percent of adult [[internet]] users.  The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used [[Social networking websites|social network]] sites or [[Twitter]] to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/The-Internet-and-Campaign-2010.aspx|work=The Internet and Campaign 2010|publisher=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

E-campaigning as it has come to be called, is subject to very little regulation.  On March 26, 2006 the [[Federal Election Commission]] voted unanimously to ânot regulate political communication on the Internet, including emails, blogs and the creating of Web sitesâ&lt;ref name=&quot;Bimbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bimbaum|first=Jeffrey|title=Loophole a Spigot for E-Mail; Critics Fear Voters Will Be Deluged as Fall Elections Near|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to campaign finance limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trent &amp; Friedenberg|title=Political Campaign Communication Principles &amp; Pratices|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A comment was made about this decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc. that explain this loophole in the context of a political campaign,  &quot;A wealthy individual could purchase all of the [[e-mail]] addresses for registered [[voters]] in a [[congressional district]] . . . produce an Internet video ad, and [[e-mail]] it along with a link to the campaign contribution page..Not only would this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent expenditure requirements; it would never even need to be reportedâ&lt;ref name=&quot;Bimbaum&quot;/&gt;

==Voter turnout==
{{see also|Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections}}
[[Voter turnout]] in the 2004 and 2008 elections showed a noticeable increase over the turnout in 1996 and 2000. Prior to 2004, voter turnout in presidential elections had been decreasing while voter registration, measured in terms of voting age population (VAP) by the U.S. Census, has been increasing. The VAP figure, however, includes persons ineligible to vote â mainly non-citizens and ineligible felons â and excludes overseas eligible voters. Opinion is mixed on whether this decline was due to voter apathy [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/013995.html] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/htmlto5.htm|title=National Voter Turnout in Federal Elections: 1960-1996|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2003-07-29|accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html|title=Election Information: Election Statistics|publisher=[[Office of the Clerk]]|accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/voting.html|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]|title=Voting and Registration Date|accessdate=2007-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an increase in ineligible voters on the rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/FAQ.html |title=Voter Turnout Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Elections.gmu.edu |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between these two measures are illustrated by analysis of turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Voter turnout from the 2004 and 2008 election was &quot;not statistically different,&quot; based on the voting age population used by a November 2008 U.S. Census survey of 50,000 households [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/013995.html]. If expressed in terms of vote eligible population (VEP), the 2008 national turnout rate was 61.7% from 131.3 million ballots cast for president, an increase of over 1.6 percentage points over the 60.1% turnout rate of 2004, and the highest since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/preliminary_vote_2008.html |title=2008 Preliminary Voter Turnout |publisher=Elections.gmu.edu |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidential coattails==
{{main|Coattail effect}}

Presidential elections are held on the same date as those for all the seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]], the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the [[United States Senate]], the [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] in several [[U.S. state]]s, as well as many state and local elections.  Presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who then vote for his party's candidates for those other offices. Members of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are also more likely to be voted for on a year of the presidential election than a [[United States midterm election|midterm]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Government By the People; national, state, and local version&quot; Prentice Hall publishers, by Cronin Magleby O'Brien Light&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, these other candidates are said to ride on his coattails.

== Notes ==
{{reflist}}
* Presidents [[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], and [[Chester Arthur]] -- having been elected vice-president and having assumed the presidency upon the death of presidents William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Abraham Lincoln, and James Garfield, respectively -- each failed, while in office, to gain nomination for a full term.

* Although Fillmore was not a major candidate for president as an [[incumbent]] in 1852, he was later a major candidate, for a different party, in 1856.  On the other hand, John Tyler, Andrew Johnson, and Chester Arthur -- unlike any other presidents -- were never major candidates for that office, and therefore do not appear in the above table of presidential election results.

* Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson both were elected vice-president.  They assumed the presidency upon the death of presidents Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy, respectively.  Each was elected to one subsequent full term as president.  Each withdrew from the contest for the Democratic Party's nomination for a second full term while in office, in each case early in the [[United States presidential primaries|presidential primary season]].

* Calvin Coolidge was elected vice-president, assumed the presidency upon the death of president Warren Harding, and was elected to one subsequent full term as president.  He declined to seek nomination for a second full term.  

* Theodore Roosevelt was elected vice-president, assumed the presidency upon the death of president William McKinley, and was elected to one subsequent full term as president.  He declined to seek the Republican Party's nomination for a second full term while in office in 1908.  However, he was later a major candidate, for a different party, in 1912.

* Gerald Ford was appointed vice-president (and confirmed by Congress) upon the resignation of Spiro Agnew from that office.  He assumed the presidency upon the resignation of president Richard Nixon.  Ford was nominated for a subsequent full term, but lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter.

* In sum, eight presidents were elected vice-president and then assumed the presidency upon the death of the president.  One president (Ford) was never elected either president or vice-president, but was instead appointed vice-president and then assumed the presidency upon the resignation of the president.
