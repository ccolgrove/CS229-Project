'''Calabasas''' is an affluent city in [[Los Angeles County, California]] in the western United States. It is located in the hills in the southwestern [[San Fernando Valley]] and the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] between [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], [[Agoura Hills]], [[West Hills, Los Angeles, California|West Hills]], and [[Malibu, California]]. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 23,058, up from 20,033 at the 2000 census, according to the U.S. Census Bureau website, factfinder.census.gov. The city was formally incorporated in 1991.  Prior to that the area was an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County.

The [[Leonis Adobe]], an [[adobe]] structure in Old Town Calabasas, dates from 1844 and is one of the oldest buildings in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|greater Los Angeles]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://you-are-here.com/building/leonis_adobe.html|title=Los Angeles architecture photo gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
It is generally accepted that Calabasas as the city name is derived from the Spanish ''calabaza'' meaning &quot;pumpkin,&quot; &quot;squash,&quot; or &quot;gourd.&quot;  Some historians hold the theory that Calabasas is a translation of the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] word ''calahoosa.''

In honor of its namesake, the City of Calabasas and the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce hold an annual Pumpkin Festival in October, including carnival games, exhibits, demonstrations, and live entertainment. The festival has evolved from a small town fair to an annual event. Though the current Pumpkin Festival is held at Juan Bautista de Anza Park in Calabasas, the original festival was meant to have taken place where, according to legend, a traveling wagon carrying pumpkins overturned and started the area's first pumpkin patch.

The City's official logo, depicting the red-tailed hawk flying over the Santa Monica Mountains, symbolizes a commitment to preserving the community's natural beauty and semi-rural quality of life. The City logo is featured on the Calabasas City flag which is flown in front of City Hall and hangs in the City Council Chambers.

==Communities==
Vista Pointe is located along the transverse ranges that run parallel to, and in between, the [[U.S. Route 101|Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101)]] and Parkway Calabasas Road.

From Parkway Calabasas: Westridge, Calabasas Hills, Calabasas Park Estates, Calabasas Country Estates, and The Oaks.

From Park Granada or [[Mulholland Drive]]: Mulholland Heights, Mulwood, Las Villas, Bellagio, The Ridge, Creekside, Clairidge, Calabasas Highlands, Mountain Park, Cold Creek, and Park Moderne.

From Lost Hills Road: Saratoga Hills, Saratoga Ranch, Deer Springs, Steeplechase, and Mira Monte.

==Civic Center==
In July 2008, the City completed construction of a Gold LEED certified Civic Center and Library complex. Located at 100 Civic Center Way, the two building complex is the first municipal-owned and constructed 'green' civic center structure in the state of California. It is estimated that the complex cost approximately $45,000,000 to complete. This figure includes the outright purchase of the land on which the complex sits.

The Civic Center complex contains: The Calabasas Library, meeting rooms and an amphitheater, and the Calabasas Channel (CTV).

==Public services==
Calabasas funds its own public transportation in the form of a shuttle and [[tram|trolley]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/departments/transportation.html#shuttle2 |title=Transportation/Transit Division |publisher=Cityofcalabasas.com |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It augments the service provided by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|LACMTA]]: line 161&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.net/images/161.pdf |title=metro.net &amp;#124; Transit Services and Information for Los Angeles County |publisher=Mta.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409150941/http://www.mta.net/images/161.pdf |archivedate = April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funds its own [[library]]  as opposed to using the County library system), runs the Calabasas Tennis &amp; Swim Center, and has a protected and maintained historical district called &quot;Old Town Calabasas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/vtour/old-town/oldtown01.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The City sponsors many annual events including:
* The Pumpkin Festival &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calabasaspumpkinfestival.com/ |title=Calabasas Pumpkin Festival |publisher=Calabasas Pumpkin Festival |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brandon's Village Universally Accessible Playground==
Brandonâs Village is a universally accessible playground at Gates Canyon Park in Calabasas that serves over 5,000 special needs children from Calabasas and the surrounding communities. Designed by Shaneâs Inspiration, a non-profit organization that designs and builds universally accessible playgrounds, Brandonâs Village is about {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} in size and all playground equipment is over 70% independently playable for children with disabilities and will also provide meaningful and stimulating play opportunities for able-bodied children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/recreation/brandons.html   Brandonâs Village opened in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental stewardship==
Safeguarding the environment and the protection of open space has been a longstanding priority for the residents of Calabasas. Calabasas played a vital role in the 10-year battle to save Ahmanson Ranch, a {{convert|2983|acre|km2}} property in the [[Simi Hills]] in [[Ventura County]] nestled at the western edge of the San Fernando Valley, from development. The land was sold by Seattle-based Washington Mutual to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in late 2003 for $150 million. Ahmanson Ranch is now known as the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve and is protected from further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamountains.com/parks.asp?parkid=28 |title=Parks |publisher=LAMountains.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calabasas voters overwhelmingly passed Measure D in 2005. The [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] protects and preserves the existing areas of Open Space in Calabasas by requiring two-thirds voter approval before any land in the City designated as Open Space may be redesignated for another use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/election2005/Special-Election/R2005-954%20Open%20Space%20-%20Adopted%20ordinance.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Calabasas City Council adopted Ordinance 2007-233] banning retail food establishments, nonprofit food providers and City facilities from using food packaging materials made of expanded polystyrene, known popularly by the trademark name Styrofoam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/environmental/PDF/Calabasas_Ordinance_No_2007-233.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance requires food service establishments in Calabasas to start using environmentally acceptable packaging by March 31, 2008, and report on-going compliance with this ordinance on the first business day of each calendar year.

==Technology center==
During the [[dot-com bubble]], a number of technology companies appeared on a stretch of Agoura Rd. parallel to the 101 Freeway, leading that area of Calabasas to develop a reputation as the &quot;101 Technology Corridor&quot;. These businesses included medical technology company Atlas Development Corporation and several computer-networking companies [[Xylan]] (later [[Alcatel]]), [[Netcom Systems]] (later [[Spirent|Spirent Communications]]), [[Ixia_(company)|Ixia Communications]], [[j2 Global Communications]], and [[Tekelec]], as well as video-game publisher [[THQ]], and software companies [[Digital Insight]] and [[NetSol Technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnston-group.com/corporate_center.asp |title=Our Properties - Corporate Center at Malibu Canyon |publisher=The Johnston Group |date= |accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of these companies have since relocated, been acquired, or ceased their operations, the area continues to be home to a significant technology presence.

==Second-Hand Smoke Ordinance==
In February 2006, Calabasas enacted the Comprehensive Second-Hand Smoke Control Ordinance that prohibits smoking in all public places in the City of Calabasas where other persons can be exposed to second-hand smoke.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/secondhandsmoke.html&lt;/ref&gt; These places include indoor and outdoor businesses, hotels, parks, apartment common areas, restaurants and bars where people can be reasonably expected to congregate or meet.  Under the law, smoking outside in public areas within the city is restricted to select &quot;Designated Smoking Areas.&quot;  The law went into effect on March 16, 2006, garnering much local and national media attention. The full text of the ordinance may be found at Calabasas' official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Ordinance Of The City Of Calabasas regulating second-hand smoke and amending the Calabasas municipal code|url=http://www.cityofcalabasas.com/pdf/agendas/council/2006/021506/item2-O2006-217.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Comprehensive Second-Hand Smoke Control Ordinance has been expanded in the beginning of 2008 requiring 80% of rental apartment buildings to be permanently designated as non-smoking units by January 1, 2012.

==The Hindu Temple of Calabasas==
There is a large [[Hindu]] Temple complex on Las Virgenes Road in Calabasas visited by many Hindus from the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area and the wider State of California. The Hindu Temple Society of Southern California (HTSSC) was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit religious organization on August 18, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Hindu temple Society of Southern California |url=http://www.hindutemplesoutherncalifornia.org/|year=2008 |work=The Hindu temple Society of Southern California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claretville of Calabasas==
The [[Claretians]] (The Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Rome, or The Claretian Order) of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] had come to [[Southern California]] by way of [[Mexico]] in the early 1900s, working in [[Los Angeles]] inner city missions.  From 1952 to 1977 they operated the 'Theological Seminary of Claretville' and the 'Immaculate Heart Claretian Novitiate,' on the former King Gillette Ranch, which they renamed Claretville.&lt;ref&gt;http://smmc.ca.gov/KGRP/Gillette%20Ranch%20Historical%20Study%20April07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamountains.com/planning_king_gillette.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Thomas Aquinas College' was also here from 1971 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumsanfernandovalley.blogspot.com/2009/09/claretville-novitiate-in-calabasas.html] museum of san fernando valley_Claretville&lt;/ref&gt; The property is at the intersection of [[Mulholland Highway]] and Las Virgenes Road in Calabasas. The land and historic structures by architect [[Wallace Neff]] are now part of [[Malibu Creek State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smmc.ca.gov/KGRP/guide.html |title=Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy |publisher=Smmc.ca.gov |date=2002-12-01 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamountains.com/parks.asp?parkid=670 |title=Parks |publisher=LAMountains.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The city is located at the southwestern part of the [[San Fernando Valley]] and comprises a portion of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]]. It is {{convert|22|mi|km}} away from Downtown Los Angeles.

The historic [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] runs east-west through Calabasas as [[U.S. Route 101]].

Calabasas is often considered similar to its neighboring two communities to the east, Woodland Hills and Topanga, because of similar demographics, size, geography, and low-density general plans.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.0|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|12.9|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.38%) is water.

Part of the city, near Calabasas High School, has all of its streets named patriotically. There is Declaration Ave., America Way, Liberty Bell St., Paul Revere Dr., Founder's Dr., Bon Homme Rd., etc.

One of the oldest neighborhoods in Calabasas is Park Moderne, or the Bird Streets. A former artist colony, remnants remain of the club house, pool and cabins scattered across streets with bird names, such as Meadow Lark, Blackbird, Bluebird and Hummingbird.
