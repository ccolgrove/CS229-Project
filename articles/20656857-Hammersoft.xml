The '''1995 Alabama Crimson Tide football team''' represented the [[University of Alabama]] for the [[1995 NCAA Division I-A football season|1995â96 college football season]], competing in the Western Division in the [[Southeastern Conference]]. The team played their home games at [[Bryant-Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. [[Gene Stallings]] led the Crimson Tide to a 8â3 record. Due to NCAA sanctions, no bowl appearance was made.

The early season victory over Southern Miss came in dramatic fashion, as Alabama completed a 36&amp;nbsp;yard pass on 4th down for a go ahead touchdown with under 30&amp;nbsp;seconds left in the game. The three games Alabama lost were also particularly noteworthy. The game against Arkansas featured a last minute 4th and goal touchdown pass by Arkansas giving them the win, however replays later showed the ball was likely trapped. This call, along with a missed twelve men on the field penalty on Arkansas' final drive lead to the suspension of the officiating crew the following week. The 41â14 blowout loss to Tennessee marked the Vols first win over the Tide since 1985, ending Alabama's 9 game unbeaten streak. The season ending loss at Auburn also featured a questionable last minute call regarding a pass. Alabama QB [[Freddie Kitchens]] had apparently hit Curtis Brown for a late go ahead touchdown, but officials ruled Brown out of bounds. Photos would later reveal that Brown had his right foot down upon making the catch.
