==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Members of the [[Potawatomi Indians|Potawatomi Indian]] [[tribe]], who settled along Salt Creek just south of where the city would develop, are the earliest known settlers of the Elmhurst area. Around 1836, European [[immigrants]] settled on tracts of land along the same [[stream|creek]]. At what would become Elmhurst City Centre, a native of [[Ohio]] named Gerry Bates established a community on a tract of &quot;treeless land&quot; in 1842.&lt;!-- Working on proper citation. --&gt;

The following year, Cottage Hill Tavern opened where St. Charles Road and Cottage Hill Avenue presently intersect. In 1845, the [[community]] was officially named '''Cottage Hill''' when a [[post office]] was established. Four years later the [[Galena and Chicago Union Railroad]] was given right-of-way through Cottage Hill giving [[farmer]]s easier access to Chicago. The community changed its name to Elmhurst in 1869. Elmhurst was incorporated as a village in 1882, with a population of 1,050, and legal boundaries of St. Charles Road to North Avenue, and one half mile west and one quarter mile east of York Street. [[Elmhurst Memorial Hospital]] was founded in 1926 as the first hospital in DuPage County.

The Memorial Parade has run every [[Memorial Day]] since 1918, and the Annual Elmhurst St. Patrick's Day Parade continues to be the third largest parade of that sort in the Chicago area, following the more famous parades downtown and on the city's South Side.

The [[Keebler Company]]'s corporate headquarters was in Elmhurst until 2001, when the [[Kellogg Company]] purchased the company. The city is home to the headquarters of [[Sunshine Biscuits]] and [[McMaster-Carr]] Supply Co. [[Famous Amos]] cookies are also distributed from Elmhurst.
