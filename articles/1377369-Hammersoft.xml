'''Sparky the Sun Devil''' is the official [[mascot]] of [[Arizona State University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASU_graphic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commguide.asu.edu/elements/mascot|title=Graphic Elements: The University Mascot|work=Communication Guide|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|accessdate=8 January 2010|location=[[Tempe, Arizona]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the ASU athletic teams' mascot was an [[owl]], then became a &quot;Normal&quot; (named for the Tempe Normal School), then was later changed to a [[bulldog]]. The State Press, the student newspaper, ran frequent appeals during the fall of 1946, urging the Bulldog to be replaced by the new Sun Devil. On November 8, 1946, the student body voted 819 to 196 to make the change. On November 20, as reported by the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', the student council made it official. The following day, the first Arizona State team played as the Sun Devils.  Two years later an alumnus and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] illustrator by the name of [[Bert Anthony]] designed Sparky, an [[imp]] with a [[trident]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ASU_graphic&quot;/&gt; (also described as a [[pitchfork]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cronkite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronkitezine.asu.edu/spring2005/sparky.html|title=The Face Behind the Mascot: The real life of Sparky the Sun Devil|last=Holexa|first=Emily|year=2005|work=The Devilâs Tale|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|accessdate=8 January 2010|location=[[Phoenix, Arizona]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the 1970s and early 1980s, [[Orange Julius]] beverage stands used the image of a devil with a [[pitchfork]] around an orange. The company later dropped the logo after threats of a lawsuit from the alumni association.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesundevils.cstv.com/trads/asu-trads-sparky.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The hand gesture &quot;[[Pitchfork (hand gesture)|The Pitchfork]]&quot;, which is widely used by those associated with Arizona State, is an extension of the trident that Sparky carries.
