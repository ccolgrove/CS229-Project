Fresno State operates on a [[semester]] schedule. The fall semester runs from late August through December. The spring semester runs from mid-January through mid-May.

==History==
Fresno State was founded as the '''Fresno State Normal School''' in 1911 with Charles Lourie McLane as its first president.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSUFarts&quot;&gt;[http://www.csufresno.edu/artshum/about/history.shtml History &amp; Milestones], CSUF College of Arts and Humanities, Accessed August 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The original campus was what is now [[Fresno City College]]. In 1921, Fresno State Normal School became '''Fresno State Teachers College''', and in 1934 it was renamed '''Fresno State College''' and adapted its official fight song &quot;Fight! Varsity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CSUFarts&quot;/&gt;  Fresno Junior College, now FCC, moved onto the campus with Fresno State in 1921 and the two institutions shared the campus until 1948, when the FCC moved to another location.&lt;ref name=&quot;OldAdmin&quot;&gt;[http://www.oabalegacyrenewed.com/history.html History], SCCC Foundation: Old Administration Building, Accessed August 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first [[graduate degree]]s, in English and Education, were granted in 1949.  In 1954, the 70-member Fresno State College Orchestra became the Fresno Philharmonic Orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSUFarts&quot;/&gt;  

In 1956, Fresno State moved its campus to its present location in the northeast part of the city, and FCC bought the old campus and moved back in.&lt;ref name=&quot;OldAdmin&quot; /&gt; Fresno State College became a charter institution of the California State University System in 1961.  In 1972 the name was officially changed to California State University, Fresno.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSUFarts&quot;/&gt;
