'''Sleep''' is a [[doom metal#Stoner doom|stoner doom metal]] band from [[San Jose, California]]. Active during the 1990s, Sleep earned critical and record label attention early in their career. Critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes them as &quot;perhaps the ultimate [[stoner rock]] band&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5456|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Sleep &gt; Biography )))&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and notes they exerted a strong influence on [[Heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] in the 1990s. However, conflict with their record company had contributed to Sleep's breakup by the end of the decade.

==History==
===Early years===
Sleep evolved in the early 1990s from the band [[Asbestosdeath]], which was established by vocalist/bassist [[Al Cisneros]], drummer [[Chris Hakius]], and guitarist Tom Choi. Asbestosdeath expanded to a quartet with the introduction of [[Matt Pike]] on guitar, and recorded two singles - &quot;Dejection&quot; for [[Profane Existence]] and the self released &quot;Unclean&quot;. Choi departed, and would later found Operator Generator, It Is I, [[Noothgrush]], and Las Vegas' Black Jetts. Asbestosdeath recruited Justin Marler as replacement and the band adopted the new name, Sleep.

===Recording era===
Their debut album ''[[Volume One (Sleep album)|Volume One]]'' was released in 1991. Frequently compared to bands like [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]], Sleep soon gained a devoted fanbase within the developing [[doom metal]] scene. Marler quit the band soon after to take up life as a [[monk]], leaving the band as a power trio for the recording of their ''[[Volume Two (EP)|Volume Two]]'' EP, which was released unofficially by Off The Disc Records in 1991.

The band's next album was sent to the independent label, Earache, as a demo.  Recorded at Razors Edge studios in San Francisco, with Billy Anderson handling production, the tape showcased Sleep's love of all things retro, from the blatant [[Black Sabbath]]/[[Blue Cheer]] influences, to their fixation with 1970's-style tube amplification. The label immediately signed the band and released the tape exactly as it was received.

''[[Sleep's Holy Mountain]]'' (1992) is widely considered a seminal album in the evolution of stoner metal. The album's release was followed by a potentially lucrative offer from [[London Records]], and Sleep signed with them. Around this time, Earache released its first Black Sabbath Tribute album, and Sleep contributed a cover of &quot;[[Snowblind (Black Sabbath song)|Snowblind]]&quot;.

Under their new contract, they began work on their third album, ''[[Dopesmoker]]'', in 1995. Much to the dismay of executives at London records, ''Dopesmoker'' was a single song more than one hour long. London Records declared the album unmarketable and refused to release it. Sleep returned to the studio and then submitted their second attempt at the new album. They had retitled it ''Jerusalem'', re-written some of the lyrics and trimmed it down to a &quot;lean&quot; 52 minutes, but it was essentially the same as ''Dopesmoker''. London Records again refused to release it. Frustrated and generally unhappy with the situation, the members of Sleep decided to disband.

===After Sleep===
In 1998, Sleep and their former manager granted approval to Tony Presedo, head of Tee Pee Records and friend of the band, for the release of ''[[Jerusalem (Sleep album)|Jerusalem]]'' posthumously as an &quot;official bootleg&quot;. One year later, ''Jerusalem'' was given an official legitimate release by [[The Music Cartel]] in the US and [[Rise Above Records]] in Europe. 

Finally, in 2003 the original version of ''[[Dopesmoker]]'' was officially released by [[Tee Pee Records]]. It is generally considered the definitive version of the album. An excerpted version can be heard on [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Broken Flowers]]'' original soundtrack.

[[Image:Pike.jpg|thumb|right|[[Matt Pike]] is now the frontman of his band [[High on Fire]].]]
Cisneros and Hakius later formed the [[experimental rock]] band [[Om (band)|Om]] while Pike formed [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[High on Fire]].

In 2007 a CD compilation of both 7&quot; releases of the pre-Sleep band, Asbestosdeath, was released on [[Southern Lord]] Records.

===Reunion===
In May 2009, Sleep reformed to perform two exclusive reunion sets in England as part of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival. In the shows the band performed for the first time a song that had previously been intended for inclusion on, and wrote during the Dopesmoker recording sessions and widely unheard entitled 'Antarcticans Thawed'.

On November 19, 2009 Al Cisneros confirmed in an interview with The Obelisk that Sleep will be reuniting in the fall of 2010 for some US dates. It has also been confirmed that Jason Roeder (of experimental metal band Neurosis) will replace Chris Hakius on drums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2009/11/19/shrinebuilderinterview/ The Obelisk - Shrinebuilder Interview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group are confirmed to play the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP New York 2010]] music festival in Monticello, New York this September where they will perform ''Holy Mountain'' in its entirety. They are touring the rest of the United States, playing headlining dates and festivals, through September.

Sleep embarked on a 9-date US tour shortly after the All Tomorrow's Parties festival.

On April 14, 2012, Sleep will headline the 17th annual [[Roadburn Festival]]. A band statement for which reads âSleep are honored to attend the Symposium of Iommic Research, Tilburg at Roadburnâ. In May 2012 the band will support Slayer at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] 'I'll Be Your Mirror' festival at Alexandra Palace, London. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymlondon2012.php&lt;/ref&gt;
