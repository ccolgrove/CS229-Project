'''Richard Gene Strenger''' (born March 10, 1960) is a former All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] [[American football]] [[offensive tackle]] who played for the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] (1980â1982) and [[Detroit Lions]] (1983â1987).  He is now working as a lawyer in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]].

==High school and college==
Strenger began in football as a speedy, 218 pound [[End (American football)|end]] for [[Grafton High School (Wisconsin)|Grafton High School]] in [[Grafton, Wisconsin]].  In 1977, he was named All-Metro at the end position after catching four touchdown passes, including a 41-yard reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Waupun, Ripon switch and win|publisher=The Reporter|date=1977-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monona Grove has 4 shutouts|publisher=Stevens Point Daily Journal|date=1977-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Key for West is strong defense|publisher=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1977-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Michigan, Strenger grew into a six-foot, seven inch, 285 pound lineman and became an intimidating presence in the Michigan offensive line from 1980â1982.  In 1981, he was a backup to [[Ed Muransky]] and [[Bubba Paris]], and in 1982, he started all 12 games for the Big Ten champion Wolverines.  In 1982, Strenger's blocking led the ways for tailback [[Lawrence Ricks]] to [[Rush (American football)|rush]] for 1,428 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/footstart.php|title=Michigan Football Statistic Archive Query Page|accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was named All-Big Ten at offensive tackle and honorable mention [[College Football All-America Team|All-America]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=Captain/&gt;  In the 1983 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl game]], Strenger injured his ankle on the third play of the game and did not return to the lineup as the Wolverines lost to [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]], 21-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bo blames turnovers for loss|publisher=Chronicle-Telegram (Elyria, Ohio)|date=1983-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strenger was also selected to play for the East Squad in the 58th [[East-West Shrine Game]] on January 15, 1983 at [[Stanford Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=East-West Rosters|publisher=The Gettysburgh Times|date=1982-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional football==
Strenger was the Detroit Lions' second-round draft pick (40th selection overall) in the 1983 NFL Draft.  He played in 49 NFL games, including all 16 games for the Lions in 1983.  He had earned the starting tackle job in 1984, but he sustained torn ligaments in his right knee in the seventh play of the season opener against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] on September 2, 1984, and underwent surgery.&lt;ref name=Captain&gt;{{cite web|title=Rich Strenger will be the Alumni Honorary Captain for Lions-Packers Game, September 24|url=http://www.detroitlions.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=448509|publisher=Detroit Lions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lions ink free agent tackle|publisher=The Daily Globe|date=1984-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comeback&gt;{{cite news|author=AP wire service report|title=Strenger tries for comeback with Lions|publisher=The Stars and Stripes|date=1985-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lions coach [[Monte Clark]] said of the loss of Strenger, &quot;That's a disaster.&quot;&lt;ref name=TSN&gt;{{cite news|title=Lions' Tough Loss Frustrates Fantetti|publisher=The Sporting News|date=1984-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He underwent surgery and missed the entire 1984 season and much of the 1985 season while recuperating.&lt;ref name=TSN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Selmon Finds Out Laster No Pushover|publisher=The Sporting News|date=1984-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On returning to football after his injury, Strenger said, &quot;Sometimes I feel like a rookie out there.  In some ways, it's a new challenge to earn my position back, but I'm really anxious to get out there and do some hitting.&quot;&lt;ref name=comeback/&gt;  Starting mid-way through the 1985 season, Strenger started 22 consecutive games and was considered Detroitâs comeback player of the year in 1986.&lt;ref name=Captain/&gt;  He started all 16 games and played every offensive snap in 1986 on an offensive line that included [[Keith Dorney]] and [[Lomas Brown]].  Strenger was a leader on the Lions' offensive line, opening holes for [[Billy Sims]] (1,040 yards rushing in 1983) and [[James R. Jones (football player)|James Jones]] (903 yards rushing in 1986).  Comparing the college and pro training regimens, Strenger once noted that [[Bo Schembechler]] ran a more strenuous training camp than the Lions: &quot;Things were tougher at Michigan, but they could afford to be because camp was only four weeks long.  This is six weeks long, so there is more attention given to not tiring people out.&quot;&lt;ref name=comeback/&gt;  The injuries caught up with Strenger as he was placed on injured reserve by the Lions in November 1987 and did not play in the NFL again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Football League signings|publisher=The Daily Globe|date=1987-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strenger signed with the [[Buffalo Bills]] in May 1988 but did not make the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Football League signings|publisher=The Daily Globe|date=1988-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After trying to make the Bills team in 1988 and 1989, Strenger was waived by the Bills on August 30, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transactions: Football|publisher=The Intelligencer/Record|date=1989-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2006, Strenger was honored by the Lions as the Alumni Honorary Captain for the Lions-[[Green Bay Packers]] game at [[Ford Field]].&lt;ref name=Captain/&gt;

==Legal career==
Strenger later received his [[law degree]] from the [[Michigan State University College of Law|Detroit College of Law]] of [[Michigan State University]] in 1999,&lt;ref name=MSU&gt;{{cite web|title=MSU alumni news|url=http://www.law.msu.edu/amicus/wi_2003-04/a-news.html|date=2003-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with the law firm of [[Butzel Long]] in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]] before opening the Law Offices of Rich Strenger in [[Lake Orion, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=Captain/&gt;  He was named Volunteer of the Quarter for the first quarter of 2003 by the board of directors and staff of Community Legal Resources in Detroit.&lt;ref name=MSU/&gt;   In December 2007, Strenger was hired by the North Oakland Transportation Authority to respond to allegations that the agency's director, Pat Fitchena, had engaged in misconduct and abuse of staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carnacchio, C.J.|title=Allegations against Fitchena prompt NOTA to hire attorney|publisher=The Oxford Leader|url=http://www.clarkstonnews.com/1editorialbody.lasso?-token.folder=2007-12-05&amp;-token.story=208313.112112&amp;-token.subpub=|date=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
