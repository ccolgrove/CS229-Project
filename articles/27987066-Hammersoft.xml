The '''2010 G-20 Seoul summit preparations ''' encompasses all the work which precedes the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit|fifth summit]] of the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] [[Head of government|heads of government]] in discussion of [[financial market]]s and the [[world economy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes1&quot;&gt;Cho Jin-seo.

July 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which will take place at [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] during November 11&amp;ndash;12, 2010.

==Multiple agendas ==
The G20 summit is not construed as having a global governance role, primarily in helping to establish a new agenda to respond to new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/specialreport/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100315000054  &quot;'G20 Seoul Initiative' aims to pave way for global green economic order,&quot;] ''Korea Herald.'' March 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Korea is reported to want to use the summit as a promotional opportunity, as happened with the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]] and [[2002 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes1&quot;/&gt;  

The pre-planning of others is less explicit.

Planning for the summit encompasses nested aspects of the event, e.g.,

==Site construction==
In conjunction with the [[2010 G-20 Seoul summit|Seoul summit]], three artificial islands and venues are being built at a cost of 96.4 billion [[South Korean won|won]].  The international leaders will meet on islands in the midst of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] between the Banpo and Dongjak bridges in Seoul.&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes2&quot;&gt;Kang Shin-who.

==Website, logo, and slogan ==
[[File:2010 G20 Seoul summit logo.JPG|thumb|right|The logo reflects the summit slogan &amp;mdash; &quot;with people to the world; with the world to the future&quot;]]

The initial publicly visible preparatory steps were in the creation of a website.  After four months of test runs, the online venue became a platform for announcing the choice of a summit logo, which was chosen out of 2,279 entries in an open contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsworld.php?id=511993  &quot;South Korea Unveils G-20 Summit Logo, Web Site,&quot;] Bernama (Malaysian National News Agency).

July 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This forward-looking theme is repeated in the official Korean slogan &amp;mdash; &quot;with people to the world; with the world to the future.&quot;  The logo incorporates an image of the sun rising over the sea, and the 20 rays coming from the center represent the 20 members of the meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes2&quot;/&gt;

==Security==
The South Korean People [[National Police Agency (South Korea)|National Police Agency]] (NPA) created a special police unit as part of its efforts to enhance security at the G-20 summit.  Th NPA-lead security committee will coordinate the work of 25 government-related agencies,&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua1&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/xinhua-news-agency-ceis/mi_8007/is_20100305/south-korea-launches-security-committee/ai_n52385852/ &quot;South Korea launches security committee for G20 summit,&quot;] Xinhua.

* [[Ministry of Public Administration and Security (South Korea)|National Emergency Management Agency]]&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhua1&quot;/&gt;

This security will limit access some parts of the summit islands.  The waters of the Han River will be closely monitored. 

World leaders attending this summit will stay at various hotels around Seoul, but, for security reasons, the press have been discouraged from writing about this aspect of summit preparations.&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes2&quot;/&gt;
