Slater's career improved when he played the dark character J.D. in the 1989 film ''[[Heathers]]'' alongside [[Winona Ryder]]. ''Heathers'' was billed as the teen film of the late '80s, and Slater's performance drew comparison with a young [[Jack Nicholson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; After ''Heathers'', Slater had offers to play more troubled youths, including as a rebellious teen in [[Pump Up the Volume (film)|''Pump Up the Volume'']] (1990) and a wild gunman in ''[[Young Guns II]]'' (1990), in which Slater acted alongside [[Emilio Estevez]] and [[Kiefer Sutherland]].

In 1993, Slater tried to expand his film genre, playing opposite [[Marisa Tomei]] in ''[[Untamed Heart]]'' and playing Clarence Worley in ''[[True Romance]]'', which was written by [[Quentin Tarantino]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biochannel&quot; /&gt; In review of ''True Romance'' [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the movie 3 stars out of 4 and commented, 'the energy and style of the movie are exhilarating. Christian Slater has the kind of cocky recklessness the movie needs.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930910/REVIEWS/309100304/1023|title=True Romance|date=10 September 1993| author=Roger Ebert |work= |publisher=''[[Chicago Sun Times]]''|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
