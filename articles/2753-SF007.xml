'''AutoCAD''' is a [[software application]] for [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[technical drawing|drafting]] in both [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. It is developed and sold by [[Autodesk, Inc.]] First released in December 1982, AutoCAD was one of the first CAD programs to run on [[personal computer]]s, notably the [[IBM PC]]. At that time, most other CAD programs ran on [[mainframe computer]]s or [[minicomputer|mini-computers]] that were connected to a graphics [[computer terminal]] for each user.

== History ==
[[file:AutoCAD 2012 For Windows Screen Shot.png|thumb|AutoCAD 2012 for Windows]]

AutoCAD derived from a program called Interact, which was written in a proprietary language (SPL) and ran on the Marinchip Systems 9900 computer (Marinchip was owned by Autodesk co-founders [[John Walker (programmer)|John Walker]] and Dan Drake.)

When Marinchip Software Partners (later renamed Autodesk) formed, they decided to re-code Interact in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[PL/1]] They chose C because it seemed to be the biggest upcoming language. In the end, the PL/1 version was unsuccessful. The C version was, at the time, one of the most complex programs in that language. Autodesk even had to work with the compiler developer (Lattice) to fix certain limitations to get AutoCAD to run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/&lt;/ref&gt; Early releases of AutoCAD used primitive entitiesâlines, polylines, circles, arcs, and textâto construct more complex objects. Since the mid-1990s, AutoCAD has supported custom objects through its C++ [[Application Programming Interface]] (API). Modern AutoCAD includes a full set of basic [[solid modeling]] and 3D tools. With the release of AutoCAD 2007 came improved 3D modeling, which meant better navigation when working in 3D. Moreover, it became easier to edit 3D models. The [[mental ray]] [[Software engine|engine]] was included in [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], it was now possible to do quality renderings. AutoCAD 2010 introduced parametric functionality and mesh modeling.

The latest AutoCAD release is AutoCAD 2012 and AutoCAD 2012 for Mac. This release marked the 26th major release for the AutoCAD for Windows, and the second consecutive year for AutoCAD for Mac.&lt;ref name=Cohn/&gt;

== Design ==

=== File formats ===

AutoCAD's native file format, [[.dwg]], and to a lesser extent, its interchange file format, [[DXF]], have become [[de facto]] standards for CAD data [[interoperability]]. AutoCAD in recent years has included support for [[DWF]], a format developed and promoted by Autodesk for publishing CAD data. In 2006, Autodesk estimated the number of active DWG files at in excess of one billion.

In the past, Autodesk has estimated the total number of existing DWG files as more than three billion.&lt;ref&gt;AutoCAD and it's Applications&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===

AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are available for [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Chinese Simplified]], [[Chinese Traditional]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. The extent of localization varies from full translation of the product to documentation only. The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization.

=== Extensions ===

AutoCAD supports a number of [[application programm interface|API]]s for customization and automation. These include [[AutoLISP]], [[Visual LISP]], [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] and [[ObjectARX]]. ObjectARX is a [[C++]] class library, which was also the base for products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields, to create products such as AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Civil 3D, or third-party AutoCAD-based applications.

=== Vertical integration ===

Autodesk has also developed a few vertical programs, for discipline-specific enhancements. [[AutoCAD Architecture]] (formerly Architectural Desktop), for example, permits architectural designers to draw 3D objects such as walls, doors and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them, rather than simple objects such as lines and circles. The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented. Additional tools generate standard 2D drawings, such as elevations and sections, from a 3D architectural model. Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional support data-specific objects, facilitating easy standard civil engineering calculations and representations.

The following are examples of industry-specific CAD applications built on the AutoCAD platform: [[AutoCAD Electrical]] is designed specifically to aid in the creation of electrical controls, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Electrical&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Electrical|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-electrical/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Civil 3D]] is designed to aid civil engineers in the creation of land, transportation, and water systems, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Civil 3D&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Civil 3D|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/civil-3d/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Map 3D]] is designed to aid in the planning and mapping of model infrastructures, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Map 3D&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Map 3D|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-map-3d/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Mechanical]] is designed for mechanical engineers to design parts ranging in all kinds of fields but mainly automotive, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Mechanical&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Mechanical|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-mechanical/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD MEP]] is designed to aid in the drawing of plumbing systems, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD MEP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD MEP|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-mep/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD P&amp;ID]] is designed specifically for creating piping and instrumentation design, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD P&amp;ID&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD P&amp;ID|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=8877989&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Plan 3D]] is designed to aid users in drawing process plants,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Plan 3D&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Plan 3D|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=12261005&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Raster Design]] is designed to allow users to &quot;clean up, edit, and enhance&quot; scanned images, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Raster Design&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Raster Design|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=2600114&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Revit Architecture Suite]] contains AutoCAD and AutoCAD Architecture to create one sign program, &lt;ref name=&quot;Revit Architecture Suite&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Revit Architecture Suite|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=3761844&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Revit MEP Suite]] is designed to add the drawing of building systems,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Revit MEP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Revit MEP|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=6668606&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Revit Structure Suite]] is designed to allow manufactions to take their drawings from the design stage to the fabrication stage, &lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Revit Structure&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Revit Structure Suit|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?id=6553715&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Structural Detailing]] is designed specifically for creating steel and concrete reinforcement drawings,&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Structural Detailing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Structural Detailing|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-structural-detailing/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AutoCAD Utility Design]] is designed mainly for electrical drawings involving the creation of both above and underground distribution networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoCAD Utility Design&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Utility Design|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=17224013&amp;siteID=123112|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants ==

=== AutoCAD LT ===

AutoCAD LT is the lower cost version of AutoCAD, albeit, with reduced capabilities, first released in November 1993. AutoCAD LT, priced at $495, became the first product in the company's history priced below $1000 to bear the AutoCAD name. In addition to being sold directly by Autodesk, it can also be purchased at computer stores, unlike the full version of AutoCAD, which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers. Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT to have an entry-level CAD package to compete in the lower price level.

As of the 2011 release the AutoCAD LT MSRP has risen to $1200. While there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT, currently there are a few recognized major differences&lt;ref&gt;http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_lt_2011_faq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the software's features:

* 3D Capabilities: AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create, visualize and render 3D models as well as 3D printing.
* Network Licensing: AutoCAD LT cannot be used on multiple machines over a network.
* Customization: AutoCAD LT does not support customization with LISP, ARX, and VBA.
* Management and automation capabilities with Sheet Set Manager and Action Recorder.
* CAD standards management tools.

=== AutoCAD WS ===

|image2=AutoCAD WS Mobile App iPhone 4 (Move, Scale, Rotate).png|alt2=|caption2=View 2
}}

In 2010, Autodesk released their first AutoCAD mobile application [[AutoCAD WS]]. The mobile app allows registered users to âview, edit, and shareâ their work wherever they go. &lt;ref name=iTunes&gt;{{cite web|last=Autodesk|title=AutoCAD WS|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autocad-ws/id393149734?mt=8|work=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app can be downloaded for free from the [[App Store]] for [[iOS]] users or from the [[Amazon Appstore]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] users. A registered license is required to use the mobile app. Both the android and iOS versions allow users to save files online and offline when no internet connection is available. &lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/&gt; Autodesk also announced future plans to store the majority of their software to the cloud ([[cloud computing]]) starting with the AutoCAD WS mobile app. &lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Autodesk Shifts Design Apps to the Cloud|url=http://jump.dexigner.com/news/23929|work=The A Register|publisher=The A Register|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autodesk officially released their [[iOS]] mobile app in September of 2010. &lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac 2012: Built for Mac OS X Lion|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/23640|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner Network|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the start of their mobile application marketing campaign. Since then the release has grown from just the [[iPhone]] to the [[iPod Touch]], [[iPad]], Android phones, and Android tablets. &lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac and AutoCAD WS App for iPad and iPhone|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/21266|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner Network|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AutoCAD WS app has several of the desktop AutoCAD features, but is limited in other areas. The app provides the ability to draw lines, circles, and other various shapes. Text and comment boxes are supported features. Colors, Layers, and measurement are also included features found in the mobile app. The latest version, version 1.3, was released on August 17, 2011 and added the following features: unit typing, layer visibility, area measurement, and file management. &lt;ref name=iTunes/&gt; Both landscape and portrait modes are supported while using the app.

Autodesk announced that they would release their [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile app on April 20, 2011. &lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD WS for Android|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/22874|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner Network|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app is very similar to the iOS app with basically all the same features and abilities. The Android AutoCAD WS mobile app has some unique features not found in the [[iOS]] version. The Android App allows users to insert text or captions by voice commands instead of forcing them to manually input the text into the drawings. &lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/&gt; This feature is not currently supported on the iOS mobile device.

=== AutoCAD Freestyle ===

Built on the AutoCAD platform, [[AutoCAD Freestyle]] is a simplified, low-cost (US$149) application that makes it easy to create accurate, professional-looking 2D drawings and sketches. This software has been discontinued by Autodesk.

=== Student versions ===

AutoCAD is licensed at a significant discount over commercial retail pricing to qualifying students and teachers, with a 36-month license available. The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception: DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the &quot;educational flag&quot;). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD (commercial or student), the output includes a plot stamp / banner on all four sides. Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use. Student Version objects &quot;infect&quot; a commercial version DWG file if imported.&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2011/ENU/filesAUG/WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-6050.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autodesk Education Community provides registered students and faculty with free access to different Autodesk applications.

== Ports ==

=== Microsoft Windows ===

While the latest release of AutoCAD did not come with a major overhaul, the 2012 version did receive minor improvements. Several small changes were made to improve the 3D capabilities, and some new features were added to enhance the productivity of the program.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohn|first=David|title=AutoCAD 2012 Review: Software Provides a Wealth of Improvements|url=http://www.deskeng.com/articles/aabbjs.htm|accessdate=29 September 2011|newspaper=DE Desktop Engineering|date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes and features included: increased canvas control, associated arrays, improved 3D model manipulation, and other less noticeable additions.&lt;ref name=Cohn/&gt; After the release of AutoCAD 2011 for Mac, the Windows version lacked several features found in the Mac version. Several of the Mac version canvas controls have now been added to the 2012 release. To accomplish the goal for better 3D model manipulation, Autodesk did away with the old saved history method and introduced a new plug-in that will automatically be installed, [[Autodesk Inventor Fusion]]. This plug-in allows users to directly open and edit 3D models without having to save and export their work manually. When the user is finished editing the plug-in automatically opens the updated version back in AutoCAD. Autodesk also replaced the older array feature with new associated arrays features. This now allows users to duplicate things using three different commands: polar arrays, rectangular arrays, and placing objects along a predetermined path. The new redesigned array feature will also work with both 2D and 3D objects.&lt;ref name=Cohn/&gt; Autodesk has also chosen to allow users to purchase companion applications directly within the AutoCAD 2012 program. &lt;ref name=CompanionApp&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=Companion Apps Now Available in AutoCAD 2012|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/23231|work=Dexigner|publisher=Dexigner Network|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newest release of AutoCAD also came with new system requirements and recommendations in order to run AutoCAD 2012. &lt;ref name=Cohn /&gt;

=== Mac OS ===
[[file:AutoCAD 2012 for Mac Basic Layout Picture.png|thumb|330px|right|AutoCAD 2012 for Mac]]

Autodesk stopped supporting Apple's computers in 1994. Over the next several years, no compatible versions for macintosh computers were released. In the fall of 2010 though, Autodesk announced that they would once again support Apple's Mac OS X software in their future version of AutoCAD. &lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Most of the same features found in the 2012 Windows version can also be found in the 2012 Mac version as well. The main difference is the user interface and layout of the program. The interface is designed so that users who are already familiar with Apple's OS X software will find it similar to other Apple applications. &lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac/&gt; Autodesk has also built in various features in order to take full advantage of Apple's trackpad capabilities as well as the fullscreen mode in Apple's OS X Lion. &lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac /&gt; &lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone/&gt; AutoCAD 2012 for Mac supports both the editing and saving of files in DWG formatting that will allow the file to be compatible with other platforms besides the OS X. &lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone /&gt; AutoCAD 2012 currently supports [[Mac OS 10.6.4]] upwards.&lt;ref name=SystemReqMac&gt;{{cite web|title=System Requirements Mac 2012|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=17327014|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AutoCAD LT 2012 is now available through the [[Mac App Store]] for $899.99. The full featured version of AutoCAD 2012 for Mac, however, is not currently available through the Mac App Store due to the price limit of $999 set by Apple. AutoCAD 2012 for Mac can currently be purchased only from Autodesk's website for $3995. &lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Don|title=Autodesk Adopts Apple App Store for Mac Software|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/16/ autodesk-adopts-apple-app-store-for-mac-software/?KEYWORDS=AutoCAD|accessdate=30 September 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
