'''''Rent''''' (often stylized as '''RENT''') is a [[rock musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Jonathan Larson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Bible&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=[[New York, New York]]| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s [[opera]] ''[[La bohÃ¨me]]''. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists and musicians struggling to survive and create in New York's [[Lower East Side]] in the thriving days of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]]&lt;!-- The exact time in which the story takes place is never mentioned but is generally considered to be somewhere in between 1989 and 1991--&gt;, under the shadow of [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]].

The musical was first seen in a limited three-week [[workshop production]] at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 1994. This same [[New York City]] off-Broadway theatre was also the musical's initial home following its official January 25, 1996 opening. The show's creator, Jonathan Larson, died suddenly the night before the off-Broadway premiere. The show won a [[1996 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]], and the production was a hit. The musical moved to Broadway's larger [[Nederlander Theatre]] on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Glory&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (&quot;Glory&quot;)| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=54â64| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Broadway, ''Rent'' gained critical acclaim and won a [[Tony Award for Best Musical]] among other awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run and 5,124 performances, making it the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|ninth-longest-running Broadway show]] by that time, ten years behind ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' as of December 2009. The production grossed over $280 million.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[[Time Magazine]], March 10, 2008 issue, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions, and in 2005, it was also adapted into a [[Rent (film)|motion picture]] that features most of the original cast members.

==Concept and genesis==
In 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create &quot;a musical based on [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La BohÃ¨me]]'', in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Leap of Faith&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (&quot;Leap of Faith&quot;)| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=18â37| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old [[composer]], began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed a few songs together, including &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, &quot;Splatter&quot; (later re-worked into the song &quot;Rent&quot;), and &quot;I Should Tell You&quot;. Larson made the suggestion to set the play in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], the artsy [[avant-garde]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] down the street from his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment, and also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that &quot;rent&quot; also means torn apart.). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make ''Rent'' his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for ''Rent''; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera &quot;to bring [[musical theater]] to the [[MTV Generation|MTV generation]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odyssey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tommasini| first=Anthony| title=The Seven-Year Odyssey That Led to ''Rent''| journal=[[The New York Times]]| date=1996-03-17| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E1D91639F934A25750C0A960958260| pages=Section 2 Page 7 | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odyssey&quot;/&gt;

Jonathan Larson focused on composing ''Rent'' in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the [[Moondance Diner]] to support himself. Over the course of seven years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained forty-two songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of ''Rent's'' script. When ''Rent'' had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odyssey&quot;/&gt;

As of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of ''Rent'' featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as &quot;You're A Fool&quot;, Voice Mail #4&quot;,&quot;Come To The Meeting&quot;,&quot;Open Road&quot;, &quot;He Says&quot;,&quot;On The Street #1-3&quot;, &quot;You'll Get Over It&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;Tango: Maureen,&quot; featuring Mark and Maureen; &quot;Right Brain&quot;,the predecessor to &quot;One Song Glory,&quot; featuring Roger; &quot;Do A Little Business&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;You'll See,&quot; featuring Benny, Mark, Roger, Collins, and Angel; &quot;Female to Female A &amp; B,&quot; featuring Maureen and Joanne; and &quot;Real Estate&quot;, a number where Benny tries to convince Mark to become a real estate agent and drop his film making. This workshop version of ''Rent'' starred [[Anthony Rapp]] as Mark and [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Mimi. Larson continued to work on ''Rent'', gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.&lt;ref name=Memoir&gt;Rapp, Anthony.  ''Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent'' (2006) Simon &amp; Schuster ISBN 0-7432-6976-4&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson enjoyed his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see ''Rent's'' success; he died from an undiagnosed [[aortic aneurysm]] (believed to have resulted from [[Marfan syndrome]]) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. The first preview of ''Rent'' was canceled and instead, friends and family gathered at the theater where the actors performed a sing-through of ''Rent'' in Larson's memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odyssey&quot;/&gt;  The show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theatre Workshop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Glory&quot;/&gt;  Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Glory&quot;/&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
Larson's inspiration for ''Rent's'' content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera ''La bohÃ¨me'', the world premiere of which was in 1896â100 years before ''Rent'''s premiere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Leap of Faith&quot; /&gt; ''La bohÃ¨me'' was also about the lives of poor young artists. [[Tuberculosis]], the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by AIDS in ''Rent''; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of ''Rent's'' characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in ''Rent'' represents the character of Alcindoro in ''BohÃ¨me'', but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only ''Rent'' character whose predecessor in ''La bohÃ¨me'' is the opposite gender.

Other examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song &quot;[[Light My Candle]]&quot;, which is nearly identical to the first scene between Mimi and Rodolfo in ''La bohÃ¨me'', &quot;Quando me n'vo (Musetta's Waltz)&quot;, a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera, and &quot;Goodbye Love&quot;, a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Libretto&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.impresario.ch/libretto/libpucboh_e.htm|title=La bohÃ¨me&amp;nbsp;âLibretto in English|accessdate=|publisher=Kernkonzepte: Impresario|year=|author=Puccini, Giacomo|authorlink=Giacomo Puccini}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Quando me n' vo' &quot; is paralleled in the first verse of &quot;Take Me or Leave Me,&quot; when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, &quot;Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song...&quot;  Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, &quot;...that ''doesn't'' remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'.&quot;

''Rent'' is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in &quot;Rent&quot;]) made their way into the play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beals&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beals, Gregory|title=The World of ''Rent''|journal=Newsweek|date=1996-05-13|volume=CXXVII|issue=20|pages=58â59}} ([http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/larson-jonathan/gregory-beals-essay-date-13-may-1996 Abstract])&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman.

Playwright [[Sarah Schulman]] has alleged that Rent bears striking similarities to her novel ''People in Trouble''.

The line, &quot;I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!&quot;, attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at his funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films ''[[Mannequin (1987 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1987) and ''[[Mannequin Two: On the Move]]'' (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood is a flamboyantly homosexual man who performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing; however, the line was originally in the film ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]'' (1976) as delivered by [[Antonio Fargas]], a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser.

The earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off [[Oedipus]] in her performance piece instead of [[Hey Diddle Diddle]]; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a [[jazz]] [[philosopher]], while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like &quot;Real Estate&quot;, which was later cut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siteforrent.com/intro.html SiteforRent.com] accessed April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. The Life CafÃ©, where the &quot;La Vie Boheme&quot; numbers are set, is an actual restaurant in the East Village of New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life Cafe&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.shtml|title=Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City|accessdate=2007-01-05|publisher=Life Cafe|year=2005, 1998|author=Ben Lerman; Andrew Jacobs|work=Life Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Connection&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (&quot;Connection&quot;)| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=138â141| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village conflicts of the late 1980s that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in [[Tompkins Square Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Connection&quot; /&gt;

&quot;Will I?&quot;, a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with [[AIDS]], was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of [[Friends in deed|Friends in Deed]], an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line in the single stanza of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali, and Pam carry the names of Larson's friends who died of AIDS. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) are changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who are living with or have died from AIDS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Friends In Deed&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (&quot;Leap of Faith: Friends in Deed&quot;)| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=21| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The scene and song &quot;Life Support&quot; was also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the &quot;forget regret&quot; refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this &quot;credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?&quot; Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, &quot;Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?&quot; Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, &quot;Then why choose fear?&quot; Gordon says, &quot;I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life.&quot;

===Lynn Thomson controversy===
Lynn Thomson was a [[dramaturg]] who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework ''Rent''. She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a &quot;new version&quot; of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for $40 million USD and sought 16% of the show's royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the &quot;new version&quot; of ''Rent''. 

During the trial, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she wrote or the structures of the libretto she created. The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to ''Rent''. A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;dramaturgy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dramaturgy.net/RENT/|title=The ''Rent'' Lawsuit Transcript Website |accessdate=2008-01-01|publisher=Dramaturgy.net|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
{{Plot|section|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Rentt.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Rent at David Nederlander Theatre in Manhattan, New York City]]

===Act I===
Mark begins a new documentary, as Roger tunes up his guitar (&quot;''Tune Up #1''&quot;) but they are quickly interrupted by a call from Mark's mother (&quot;''Voicemail #1''&quot;). Roger and Mark's friend Tom Collins arrives at their building but is mugged before he can enter. Meanwhile, Roger and Mark receive a call from former friend and roommate Benjamin &quot;Benny&quot; Coffin III. Benny bought Mark and Roger's apartment building, as well as the lot next door. He tells them the rent is due, despite his promise to let them live there for free (&quot;''Tune Up #2''&quot;). Mark and Roger refuse to pay their rent (&quot;''Rent''&quot;). Meanwhile, Angel finds Collins on the street (&quot;''You Okay Honey?''&quot;).

Back at the loft, Mark tries to get Roger out of the apartment before reminding him to take his [[Zidovudine|AZT]] (&quot;''Tune Up #3''&quot;). Roger attempts to write a great song to make his mark on the world before he dies of AIDS (&quot;''One Song Glory''&quot;). Their downstairs neighbour, a club dancer and drug addict named Mimi MarquÃ©z walks in, asking Roger to light a candle for her, only to continually blow it out (&quot;''Light My Candle''&quot;).

Joanne's parents call her, wondering why she is stage managing and reminding her that she has to attend her mother's confirmation hearings (&quot;''Voicemail #2''&quot;). Angel, now in drag, and Collins arrive bearing gifts (&quot;''Today 4 U''&quot;). Benny arrives with an offer: if they convince Maureen to cancel her protest, he'll let them live in his new studio project, rent-free (&quot;''You'll See''&quot;). However, the two rebuff his offer. After Benny leaves, Angel and Collins invite Mark and Roger to attend Life Support, a local HIV [[support group]] meeting. 

Mark hurries off to help fix Maureen's equipment, only to run into Maureen's new girlfriend Joanne, and the two of them commiserate about Maureen's flighty, unfaithful ways (&quot;''Tango: Maureen''&quot;). He then entersâslightly lateâinto the support group meeting (&quot;''Life Support''&quot;). Meanwhile, Mimi attempts to seduce Roger (&quot;''Out Tonight''&quot;) but is harshly rebuffed by Roger (&quot;''Another Day''&quot;) who then admits to an empty apartment his fears about dying from AIDS (&quot;''Will I?''&quot;).

On their way to the show, Collins, Mark and Angel help a homeless woman who is being harassed by police officers. She then mocks Mark for trying to assuage his guilt while not really doing anything to help them (&quot;''On the Streets''&quot;). Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York and opening up a restaurant (&quot;''Santa Fe''&quot;). Soon after, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other (&quot;''I'll Cover You''&quot;). Joanne exasperatedly prepares for Maureen's show (&quot;''We're Okay''&quot;).

Roger intercepts Mimi on her way to buy drugs, inviting her to come to the protest and dinner with them instead, to which she agrees. Meanwhile, people from the streets protest for not having a place to spend Christmas (&quot;''Christmas Bells''&quot;).

Maureen arrives and begins her performance: A thinly-veiled criticism of Benny through a metaphor involving a cow and a bulldog, culminating in her urging the crowd to &quot;moo&quot; with her (&quot;''Over The Moon''&quot;). At the Life Cafe after the show, Benny criticizes the protest and the group's Bohemian lifestyle, declaring that Bohemia is dead. Mark and all the bohemians in the cafÃ© rise up and celebrate the Bohemian lifestyle, paying tribute to everything they love, driving Mr. Grey and Benny from the cafÃ© (&quot;''La Vie Boheme A''&quot;).

Mimi confronts Roger about ignoring her during dinner. Roger tries to explain that he has baggage, but Mimi isn't fazed. Then, as Mimi's beeper goes off (reminding her to take her AZT) she and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive (&quot;''I Should Tell You''&quot;). Joanne returns, explaining how the evicted residents of Avenue B are rioting and &quot;mooing&quot; in the streets (&quot;''La Vie Boheme B''&quot;).

===Act II===
[[Image:Rent.JPG|thumb|400px|left|Cast of ''Rent'' performing &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; at ''Broadway on Broadway'', 2005.]]
Opening with &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; - a song which contemplates how to measure a year in a life - the second act takes place over the course of the year following the first act, beginning on [[New Years Eve]].

After Benny locks them out of their apartments, the Bohemians gather to break-in (&quot;''Happy New Year A''&quot;). We learn through a series of voicemails (&quot;''Voicemail #3''&quot;) that Mark had taken film of the riot which had made the nightly news and gained him the attention of media producer Alexi Darling.

The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives. He says he's there to call a truce, but the group doesn't trust him. He reveals that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, came-on to him. This revelation upsets Roger and he briefly rebuffs Mimi before Angel settles everyone down. Roger and Mimi both apologize, but Mimi remains upset, and turns to the drug dealer for a fix (&quot;''Happy New Year B''&quot;).

Maureen and Joanne have a fight, giving each other relationship ultimatums (&quot;''Take Me Or Leave Me''&quot;). Maureen's flirtatious ways and Joanne's controlling behavior are too much to take, so they break up. The company sings a reprise of &quot;Seasons of Love&quot;, as time passes and seasons change (&quot;''Seasons of Love B''&quot;). By spring, Roger and Mimi's relationship becomes strained. Roger keeps talking about moving out of town. Mimi comes home late again, causing Roger to believe that she is cheating on him with Benny. Roger jealously storms out, Mimi stops him and tries to tell him the truth, that she is not cheating and that she is still using drugs, but can't get the words out, and Roger leaves her (&quot;''Without You''&quot;). Collins continues nursing Angel who is very sick as AIDS begins to overtake him. Mark continues to receive calls from ''Buzzline'' (&quot;''Voicemail #4''&quot;).  Eventually, Roger and Mimi, and Joanne and Maureen, reconcile.

They then break up just as quickly (&quot;''Contact''&quot;). At the same time, Angel dies and Collins is heartbroken (&quot;''I'll Cover You [Reprise]''&quot;). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS (&quot;''Halloween''&quot;). He finally accepts the job offer from ''Buzzline''. Roger reveals that he is leaving New York for [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral. Maureen and Joanne realize their fighting is petty, and they reconcile. Mimi tries to go to Roger, but he turns away (&quot;''Goodbye Love''&quot;).

Roger and Mark both have an artistic [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory. Roger returns to New York just in time for [[Christmas]], and Mark quits ''Buzzline'' to work on his own film (&quot;''What You Own''&quot;). 

Worried about their children not answering their calls, the cast's parents leave several messages on their phones (&quot;''Voice Mail #5''&quot;).  On Christmas Eve, one year to date from where the show started, Mark has finished his film and is ready to screen it.  Roger has found his song but can't find Mimi anywhere.  Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a convenience store to provide money to anybody with the code (A-N-G-E-L).  Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who is very weak and close to death.  She begins to fade, but not before telling Roger that she loves him (&quot;''Finale A''&quot;). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, which says that he has always loved her (&quot;''Your Eyes''&quot;). Mimi appears to die as Musetta's Waltz plays but suddenly awakens.  She says that she was heading into a light, but Angel told her to go back. The surviving Bohemians and Benny gather together to rejoice and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other (&quot;''Finale B''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: No Day but Today&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Rent (''no day but today'')| url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0688154379/qisbn=1164910567| last=Larson| first=Jonathan| authorlink=Jonathan Larson| coauthors=Interviews and text: McDonnell, Evelyn, with Silberger, Katherine|year=1997| pages=188â189| publisher=HarperEntertainment / HarperCollins| location=New York, New York| isbn=0-688-15437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
===New York workshops and off-Broadway production===
''Rent'' had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Odyssey&quot;/&gt;  A further two-week New York Theatre Workshop version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened on January 25, 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews.  ''The New York Times'' theater critic [[Ben Brantley]] called it an &quot;exhilarating, landmark rock opera&quot; with a &quot;glittering, inventive score&quot; that &quot;shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E7DC1239F937A25751C0A960958260 &quot;Rock Opera A la 'Boheme' And 'Hair'&quot;,] ''The New York Times'', February 14, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reviewer wrote, &quot;''Rent'' speaks to [[Generation X]] the way that the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' spoke to the [[baby boomers]] or those who grew up in the 1960s, calling it 'a rock opera for our time, a ''Hair'' for the 90s.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Comet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birth of a Theatrical Comet|journal=The New York Times|date=1996-03-17|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B10F83D5D0C748DDDAA0894DE494D81|pages=Section 2 page 1|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Glory&quot;/&gt;

===Original Broadway production===
Due to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, ''Rent'' moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rent: Glory&quot;/&gt;  On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included [[Taye Diggs]], [[Wilson Jermaine Heredia]], [[Jesse L. Martin]], [[Idina Menzel]], [[Adam Pascal]], [[Anthony Rapp]], [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] and [[Fredi Walker]].

The production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marks, Peter| title=Looking on Broadway For Ramshackle Home | journal=The New York Times | date=February 26, 1996| page=C9| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20616FD3A5D0C758EDDAB0894DE494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fN%2fNew%20York%20Theater%20Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production was nominated for ten [[Tony Awards]] in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia)&lt;ref name=&quot;Tonys Search&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?year=1996&amp;show=Rent|title=Past Winners Search|accessdate=November 30, 2006 |publisher=IBM Corp., Tony Award Productions|work=The Official Website of the American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the [[Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation]], [[Friends In Deed]] and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; as the finale of the performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playbill 10th&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98789.html|title=''Rent's'' 10th Anniversary Celebration Will Reunite Past Bohemians, for Three Good Causes|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=2006-03-30|author=Jones, Kenneth |accessdate=November 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It originally featured [[Neil Patrick Harris]] in the role of Mark Cohen. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Cast members appearing in the Benny Cast included [[Eric Reed]], Wilson Cruz, Keely Snelson, [[d'Monroe]], Mark Lull, Courtney Corey, Pierre Angelo Bayuga and Jonathon Morgan.

In 2007, a modified edition of ''Rent'' was made available to five non-professional acting groups in the United States for production. Billed as {{nowrap|''Rent: School Edition''}}, this version omits the song &quot;Contact&quot; and eliminates some of the coarse language and tones down some public displays of affection of the original.&lt;ref name=&quot;School Edition&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/tcp/local_news/article/0,2545,TCP_16736_5609675,00.html|title=With 'Rent,' local theater finally fulfills promise|accessdate=2007-07-02|publisher=Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers|date=2007-06-30|author=Deyoung, Bill |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070706021228/http://www.tcpalm.com/tcp/local_news/article/0,2545,TCP_16736_5609675,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-06}}

The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, &quot;They call this 'Rent Remixed'. I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La BohÃ¨me, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/reviews/story/0,,2192137,00.html Rent | Theatre story|Guardian Unlimited Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The production closed on February 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/113661.html Playbill News: New London Production of Rent to Close in February 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British.

==Cultural impact==
The song &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own.

===RENT-heads===
''Rent'' gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as &quot;RENT-heads.&quot;  The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time for 'Rent'&quot;&gt;Adams, Bob.  [http://web.archive.org/web/20021024083952/http://www.geocities.com/WestHollywood/Village/1432/phillynews8.html &quot;Time for 'Rent'&quot;,] ''The Philadelphia Gay News'', August 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time for 'Rent'&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reidel Party&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Riedel, Michael|title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office|date=1997-03-03|pages=27|url=http://www.nydailynews.com}} ''[[New York Daily News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Broadway shows have followed ''Rent'''s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.

The term originated in RENT's first months on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The show's producers offered 34 seats in the front two rows of the orchestra for $20 each, two hours before the performance. Fans and others interested in tickets would camp out for hours in front of the [[Nederlander Theater]] - which is on 41st Street, just outside  [[Times Square]] -- to buy these tickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reidel Party&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Riedel, Michael | authorlink= | title=Every Day a 'Rent' Party: hardcore fans of the hit musical form a squatters camp at the box office| journal=| date=March 3, 1997| pages=27}} New York Daily News [http://www.nydailynews.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; Many RENTheads have seen the show dozens of times, some in various cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;RENT book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Larson  | first = Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Larson  | coauthors = Evelyn McDonnell with Katherine Silberger | title = RENT  | publisher = Rob Weisbach Books  | year = 1997  | location = New York  | isbn = 0688154379  | page = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At least one person has seen the show more than 1100 times over the course of the show's nearly 12 year run.

{{Main|Rent (film)}}

''Rent'' was adapted into a movie directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] with a screenplay by [[Stephen Chbosky]]. With the exception of Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker, the original Broadway cast members reprised the principal roles.  Rosario Dawson played Mimi and Tracie Thoms was cast as Joanne, as Rubin-Vega (Mimi) was pregnant at the time of filming and Walker (Joanne) felt she was too old for the part. Released on November 23, 2005, the film remained in the box office top ten for three weeks. Several plot elements were changed slightly, and some of the songs were changed to spoken dialogue in the film. The film's soundtrack was produced by [[Rob Cavallo]], engineered by Doug McKean and features renowned session musicians, [[Jamie Muhoberac]], [[Tim Pierce]], and [[Dorian Crozier]].
