'''Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah''' is the ninth and current [[Sultan of Selangor|Sultan]] of the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Selangor]]. He ascended the throne in 2001, succeeding his father, [[Salahuddin of Selangor|Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah]].

==Early life and education==
Sharafuddin was born on 24 December 1945, at Istana Jema'ah, [[Klang]], as the first son of the Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Selangor, [[Salahuddin of Selangor|Tengku Abdul Aziz Shah]] and his first wife, Raja Saidatul Ihsan Tengku Badar Shah (c. 1923â2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Life's a simple and beautiful journey, says Sultan |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DkAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aHsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=sharafuddin%20of%20selangor&amp;pg=1474%2C440681 |work=Sultan of Selangor's Birthday |publisher=[[New Straits Times]] |date=2002-12-11 |pages=6â8 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selangor Sultanâs mother dies |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/5/31/nation/20110531125627&amp;sec=nation |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the eldest son of [[Hisamuddin of Selangor|Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah]] and [[Raja Jemaah|Raja Jemaah Raja Ahmad]], who became the second [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] and [[Raja Permaisuri Agong]] of Malaysia. His mother was a grandchild of both [[Sulaiman of Selangor|Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah]] and [[Abdul Jalil of Perak|Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah of Perak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selangor |url=http://uqconnect.net/~zzhsoszy/states/malaysia/selangor.html |work=Genealogical Gleanings |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, his parents were first cousins. He was named ''Tengku Idris Shah'' at birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;utusan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Biodata Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah |url=http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/SpecialCoverage/agongmangkat/index.asp?y=2001&amp;dt=1122&amp;pub=agongmangkat&amp;sec=Berita&amp;pg=be_15.htm |publisher=[[Utusan Malaysia]] |work=Agong mangkat |date=2001-11-22 |accessdate=2011-06-03 |language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his education at Malay Primary School, [[Kuala Lumpur]], aged nine, before attending [[St. John's Institution]] until 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot;/&gt;

In 1960, his father became the Sultan of Selangor, [[regnal name|becoming]] Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah. That same year, Tengku Idris, 15, was proclaimed the Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Selangor; his formal installation occurred ten years later. He was sent abroad to continue his education, attending the [[Hale School]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Australia, from 1960 and later Langhurst College in [[Surrey]], United Kingdom, from 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot;/&gt;

After returning from the United Kingdom, Tengku Idris joined the government service, and was attached to the Selangor State Secretariat under the administration of [[List of Menteris Besar of Selangor|Menteri Besar]] [[Harun Idris]]. He served in the Kuala Lumpur District Office and police department.&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot;/&gt;

On 24 April 1999, he was appointed Regent of Selangor after his father became the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nst&quot;/&gt;

==Sultan of Selangor==
On 22 November 2001, Tengku Idris was proclaimed [[Sultan of Selangor]], succeeding his father, who died after only two years as Yang di-Pertuan Agong.&lt;ref name=&quot;sultan&quot;&gt;{{cite article |title=Fulfilling a Ruler's destiny |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/3/8/nation/sultan08&amp;sec=nation |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=2003-03-08 |accessdate=2011-06-03 |last=Kee |first=Hua Chee}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the [[regnal name]] ''Sharafuddin'' (connoting 'religious enlightenment' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), and is styled as ''Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah''.&lt;ref name=&quot;utusan&quot;/&gt; His formal [[coronation]] took place on 9 March 2003 at [[Istana Alam Shah]], [[Klang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=State to reach greater heights |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2003/3/9/nation/klgruler&amp;sec=nation |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=2003-03-09 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Sultan, he is known to have revoked [[Malay titles|state awards]] conferred by him or by his father. In 2007, he revoked the [[Malay titles#Datuk|Datuk]] title of a businessman who pleaded guilty for financial fraud. He has also suspended others who have been charged in court for various misdealings or faced bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selangor Sultan strips trader of title |url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/new-straits-times/mi_8016/is_20070809/selangor-sultan-strips-trader-title/ai_n44373155/ |publisher=[[New Straits Times]] |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he suspended the datukship of former transport minister [[Chan Kong Choy]] in relation to the latter being charged in court over the [[Port Klang Free Zone#Financial_problems|Port Klang Free Zone scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ex-minister and bankrupt lose Selangor titles |url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&amp;file=/2011/4/11/nation/8458075 |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]] saw sweeping political change in Selangor. For the first time, [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) did not win control of the [[Selangor State Legislative Assembly|state assembly]]. Sharafuddin presided over the swearing-in of the first non-BN [[List of Menteris Besar of Selangor|Menteri Besar of Selangor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The New Straits Times|url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Thursday/NewsBreak/20080313173454/Article/index_html|title=Khalid Ibrahim sworn-in as new Selangor Mentri Besar|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2008-03-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080314043108/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Thursday/NewsBreak/20080313173454/Article/index_html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, he underwent a ten-hour [[open heart surgery]] at [[Stanford University Medical Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sultan Selangor Stabil Selepas Pembedahan Jantung |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/bm/news_lite.php?id=408427 |publisher=[[Bernama]] |date=2009-05-03 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, he became embroiled in a crisis over the appointment of the state secretary, the state's highest-ranking civil servant. The federal government appointed Mohd Khusrin Munawi to the position, which was consented to by Sharafuddin.&lt;ref name=&quot;oath&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Khusrin takes his oath at last |url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2011/2/17/north/8083255&amp;sec=north |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |author=A. Ruban |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pakatan Rakyat]]-led state government opposed the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Selangor Sultan maintains Khusrinâs appointment lawful |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/selangor-sultan-maintains-khusrins-appointment-lawful/ |publisher=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |author=Shazwan Mustafa Kamal |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government eventually relented, and Khusrin assumed his duties in February 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;oath&quot;/&gt;
