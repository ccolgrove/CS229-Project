'''Shorten''' ('''SHN''') is a [[file format]] used for compressing audio data. It is a form of [[lossless data compression|data compression]] of files and is used to [[Audio data compression|losslessly compress]] [[Compact Disc|CD]]-quality audio files (44.1 [[kilohertz|kHz]] 16-[[binary digit|bit]] stereo [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]). Shorten is no longer developed and more recent lossless [[audio codec]]s such as [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], [[Monkey's Audio]] (APE), [[TTA (codec)|TTA]], and [[WavPack]] (WV) have become more popular. However, Shorten is still in use by some people because there are legally traded concert recordings in circulation that are encoded as Shorten files.  Shorten files use the .shn file extension.

==Handling Shorten files==
Since few players or media writers attempt to decompress Shorten files, a standalone decompression program is usually required to convert to a different file format that those applications can handle.  Some [[Rockbox]] applications can play Shorten files without decompression, and third-party Shorten plug-ins exist for [[Nero Burning ROM]], [[Foobar2000]] and [[WinAmp]]. All [[libavcodec]] based players and converters support the Shorten codec.
