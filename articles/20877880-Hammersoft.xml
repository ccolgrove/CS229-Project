The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[New York Jets]] season''' was the 50th season for the club and the 40th season in the [[National Football League]] and the last season at Giants Stadium. While they did not improve their 9â7 record from 2008, this time the team headed to the playoffs. The Jets fired head coach [[Eric Mangini]] on December 29, 2008 and hired [[Rex Ryan]] from the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on January 18, 2009. The New York Jets were represented at the [[2010 Pro Bowl]] by [[Darrelle Revis]], [[Nick Mangold]], [[Shaun Ellis]], [[DâBrickashaw Ferguson]], and [[Alan Faneca]].

==Offseason==
===Coaching changes===
Head coach [[Eric Mangini]] was fired by the Jets on December 29, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mangini&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/sports/football/30jets.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mangini%20fired&amp;st=cse|title=After Jets' Collapse, Mangini Is Sent Packing, Too|author=Bishop, Greg|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|page=B10|date=December 30, 2008|accessdate=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made after the Jets fell from 8â3 and sole possession of first place in the AFC East with four losses in their last five games, causing them to miss a playoff berth. He finished his tenure as head coach with a 23â25 record including the playoffs.

At first, the Jets attempted to lure former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] head coach [[Bill Cowher]] out of retirement, with the possibility of Cowher gaining personnel decisions in addition to coaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowher&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2008/12/30/2008-12-30_jets_bill_cowher_agree_to_discuss_coachi.html|title=Jets, Bill Cowher agree to discuss coaching vacancy|author=Cimini, Rich|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=December 30, 2008|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowher ultimately decided to stay retired in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/sports/football/05nfl.html?ref=football|title=Cowher Says He Won't Coach in 2009 Season|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 4, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets interviewed several candidates for their vacancy. In-house candidates included offensive coordinator [[Brian Schottenheimer]] and offensive line coach [[Bill Callahan (American football)|Bill Callahan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3806701|title=Jets start first round of interviews|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 2, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other candidates interviewed were [[Indianapolis Colts]] defensive coordinator [[Ron Meeks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin.newyorkjets.com/blog/posts/906-colts-meeks-coming-in-to-talk-on-friday|title=Colts' Meeks Coming In to Talk on Friday|author=Lange, Randy|publisher=newyorkjets.com|date=January 6, 2009|accessdate=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York Giants]] defensive coordinator [[Steve Spagnuolo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/jets/index.ssf/2009/01/jets_interview_spags_a_second.html|title=New York Jets interview Steve Spagnuolo second time|author=Hutchinson, Dave|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=January 15, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] head coach [[Jeff Jagodzinski]] (who was subsequently fired from his position as a result of accepting the interview).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28498583/|title=Boston College fires coach over Jets interview|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 7, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jets eventually picked [[Baltimore Ravens]] defensive coordinator [[Rex Ryan]] as their head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/sports/football/20jets.html?partner=rss|title=In Ryan, Jets Find a Fiery Innovator|author=Bishop, Greg|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|page=D12|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the position just hours after the Ravens' loss in the AFC Championship Game on January 18, and was introduced by the Jets on January 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80e3d259&amp;template=with-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true|title=Jets Introduce Ryan As Head Coach|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=January 21, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signings===
On February 27, the Jets signed former Baltimore Ravens linebacker [[Bart Scott]] to a six-year, $48&amp;nbsp;million deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/sports/football/28jets.html|title=Seeking Bruising Defense, Jets Turn Purple|author=Bishop, Greg|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=D1|date=2009-02-27|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, the Jets inked [[Jim Leonhard]], former Ravens safety, to a three-year, $6&amp;nbsp;million deal.

===Departures===
After failing to come to terms on a contract extension, the Jets restructured the contract of wide receiver [[Laveranues Coles]] to allow him to immediately become an unrestricted free agent on February 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/jets/ny-spcoles0226,0,1392562.story|title=Jets part ways with Laveranues Coles|author=Boland, Erik|work=[[Newsday]]|date=2009-02-25|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Coles admitted a chance he could re-sign with the Jets, he signed a four-year deal with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3952628|title=Coles, Bengals agree to contract|author=Clayton, John|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-03-04|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, former kicker [[Mike Nugent]] was signed by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] to a one-year deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nugent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/scorecard/nflnews.asp?articleID=254844|title=Bucs bring in K Nugent|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=2009-03-04|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trades===
On February 28, the Jets traded for cornerback [[Lito Sheppard]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], sending the Eagles a 2009 fifth-round draft pick and a 2010 conditional draft pick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2009/02/28/2009-02-28_jets_trade_for_eagles_cornerback_lito_sh.html|title=Jets' trade for Eagles cornerback Lito Sheppard becomes official|author=Cimini, Rich|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=2009-03-01|accessdate=2009-03-06|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iidpy350|archivedate=2009-08-02|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pick can be as high as second and as low as fourth. Upon the trade, Sheppard received a four-year, $27.2&amp;nbsp;million contract extension.

On October 7, the Jets made a blockbuster deal with the [[Cleveland Browns]]  to send Wide Receiver [[Braylon Edwards]] to the Jets for Wide Receiver [[Chansi Stuckey]], Linebacker [[Jason Trusnik]], and 2 draft picks.

===2009 NFL Draft===
The Jets were assigned the 17th selection in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Prior to the 2008 season, the Jets traded a conditional fourth round selection to the [[Green Bay Packers]] in exchange for quarterback [[Brett Favre]]; this became a third round selection because Favre took the majority of snaps for the Jets in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;favre trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp08/news/story?id=3522971|title=Jets set for Brett|work=ESPN.com|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|date=August 7, 2008|accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gave their fifth round pick to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Lito Sheppard trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheppard&quot;/&gt; They also received a third round selection from the [[New Orleans Saints]] in exchange for linebacker [[Jonathan Vilma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vilma&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/01/sports/football/01jets.html?_r=1|title=Jets Trade Vilma to Saints and Add Jenkins|last=Bishop|first=Greg|date=March 1, 2008|publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2007 season, the Jets received a fourth round selection from the [[Washington Redskins]] in exchange for guard [[Pete Kendall]]; the pick was originally a 2008 fifth round selection that was upgraded due to Kendall's playing time in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;petekendall&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2988171|title=Jets' Kendall dealt to Redskins for mid-round draft pick|last=Pasquarelli|first=Len |date=August 23, 2007|work=ESPN.com|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On draft day, the Jets traded their first and second-round picks, defensive end [[Kenyon Coleman]], safety [[Abram Elam]], and quarterback [[Brett Ratliff]] to the [[Cleveland Browns]] for their first round selection, the fifth overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanchez&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/sports/football/26jets.html|title=Jets Trade Up to Draft Mark Sanchez|author=Heyman, Brian|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=SP1|date=April 25, 2009|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets used the selection to draft quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] from the [[University of Southern California Trojans|University of Southern California]]. The Jets also sent their third, fourth, and seventh-round selections to the [[Detroit Lions]] for the Lions' third-round pick, which was the first of the second day of the draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;sid=acRbjQtUOW6U&amp;refer=amsports|title=Jets Trade With Detroit to Land First Pick on NFL Draft Day Two|author=McClusky, Dex|publisher=Bloomberg.com|date=April 26, 2009|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets selected running back [[Shonn Greene]] of the [[University of Iowa]] with the pick.

==Schedule==
The Jets' slate of regular season opponents was determined after the completion of the 2008 season. In addition to their traditional AFC East rivals, the team played opponents from the [[American Football Conference South Division|AFC South]] and [[National Football Conference South Division|NFC South]] divisions, and the third-place teams of the [[American Football Conference West Division|AFC West]] and [[American Football Conference North Division|AFC North]], as determined by the [[Regular season (NFL)|NFL scheduling formula]]. Their schedule was released in full on April 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;schedule&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4068983|title=NFL releases full schedule|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|work=ESPN.com|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game times and channels from weeks 11, 12, and 14â17 were subject to change per the NFL's [[NFL on television#Flexible scheduling|flexible scheduling]] policy. Some controversy ensued over the placement of the Jets' first two home games, coinciding with the Jewish holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]. In response, the NFL moved the time of the game against the [[Tennessee Titans]] to 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4078103|title=Jets to play Titans at 1&amp;nbsp;pm in Week 3|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|work=ESPN.com|date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets played a regular season game outside the United States for the first time when they played the Bills in Toronto; the game is the second in a five-year series of regular and preseason games the Bills are playing at the [[Rogers Centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/football/2009/04/15/9115316-sun.html|title=Bills Toronto date is with the Jets|author=Fidlin, Ken|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=April 15, 2009|accessdate=April 18, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iids1seK|archivedate=August 2, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jets began their season at [[Reliant Stadium]] for a Week 1 showdown with the [[Houston Texans]].  New York took off in the first quarter as kicker [[Jay Feely]] nailed a 24-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Jets would increase their lead as rookie quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] completed his first career touchdown pass as he connected with wide receiver [[Chansi Stuckey]] on a 30-yard pass.  In the third quarter, New York continued their run as running back [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]] got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as safety [[Dominique Barber]] returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, but the Jets would end the game with Jones getting a 38-yard touchdown run.

With the win, not only did New York begin their season at 1â0, but Sanchez (18-of-31, 272 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT) would become the 1st Jets rookie QB since [[Richard Todd (American football)|Richard Todd]] in 1976 to win a game.

Coming off an impressive road win over the Texans, the Jets played their Week 2 home opener against their AFC East rival, the [[New England Patriots]]. In the week prior to the game, first-year Jets head coach [[Rex Ryan]] placed a phone message to all Jets season ticket holders asking them to &quot;make it miserable for (Tom) Brady and company,&quot; following up on his comments during the off-season that he would not &quot;kiss Bill Belichick's Super Bowl rings.&quot; He told the Jets fans that &quot;the Patriots had a better head coach and a better quarterback,&quot; but that the game would decide &quot;who has a better team.&quot; Meanwhile, Jets safety [[Kerry Rhodes]] said the Jets intended on not just winning, but &quot;embarrassing&quot; the Patriots in the game, while nose tackle [[Kris Jenkins]] called it the Jets' version of the Super Bowl; the Jets had not defeated the Patriots at home since 2000. 
On the first drive of the game, without an injured [[Wes Welker]], the Patriots drove to the Jets' 36-yard line before having to punt. The Jets' first play from scrimmage was a strip-sack of rookie quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] by defensive lineman [[Mike Wright]]; Sanchez recovered the fumble at the Jets' 3-yard line. On 4th-and-24, the Jets punted back to their own 49-yard line; the Patriots could not capitalize on the field position and went three-and-out. However, Jets running back [[Leon Washington]] fumbled on the next play; cornerback [[Leigh Bodden]] recovered it at the Jets' 17-yard line. Two holding penalties would push the Patriots back to the Jets' 37-yard line, setting up a 45-yard [[Stephen Gostkowski]] field goal to give the Patriots a 3â0 lead. Following a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots moved to their own 41-yard line before Jets cornerback [[Darrelle Revis]] intercepted a pass intended for [[Randy Moss]] at the Jets' 16-yard line. The Jets offense would continue to struggle, however, going three-and-out again to end the first quarter. 
The Patriots began the second quarter with a 9-play, 53-yard drive, one that stalled at the Jets' 7-yard line; the Patriots settled for another [[Stephen Gostkowski]] field goal, extending their lead to 6â0. The Jets would pick up their initial first down of the game on their next possession, going 52 yards on 10 plays before a [[Jay Feely]] 33-yard field goal cut the Patriots' lead in half. Starting from their own 10-yard line after a holding penalty on [[Sam Aiken]] on the kickoff, the Patriots took nearly six minutes off the clock, reaching the Jets' 11-yard line before two incomplete passes by Brady prevented the Patriots scoring their first touchdown of the game. Instead, Gostkowski kicked his third field goal of the day to increase the Patriots' lead to 9â3 going into halftime. Receiving the opening kickoff of the second half due to their deferral of the opening coin toss, the Jets took the lead in barely a minute. Following a 43-yard kick return by Washington, Sanchez hit wide receiver [[Jerricho Cotchery]] for 45 yards and a play later connected with tight end [[Dustin Keller]] on a 9-yard touchdown pass. The 10â9 lead was the first for the Jets over the Patriots at home since 2001. After a Patriots three-and-out, punter [[Chris Hanson]]'s 30-yard punt gave the Jets the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. From the Patriots' 6-yard line, Sanchez appeared to throw a touchdown pass to [[Chansi Stuckey]], but the catch was overturned after the Patriots challenged. Two plays later, Feely hit his second field goal of the day to give the Jets a 13â9 lead.
The Patriots' ensuing possession reached the Jets' 35-yard line on a third down, but back-to-back delay of game penalties on [[Tom Brady]], an incomplete pass, and a face-mask penalty on Moss on the punt backed the Patriots up to their own 40-yard line. However, Hanson's subsequent attempt was better than the first, nullified by the penalty, and the Jets began their next drive from their own 15-yard line. On a 14-play, 63-yard drive that spanned into the fourth quarter, the Jets extended their lead to 16â9 on a 39-yard Feely field goal. The Patriots started their next drive from their own 15-yard line as well, but were unable to reach midfield before punting. A Jets three-and-out gave the Patriots another opportunity with five minutes remaining, but a [[Benjamin Watson|Ben Watson]] holding penalty in the middle of the drive helped set up a 2nd-and-20 situation and eventually another punt. Just before the two-minute warning, Sanchez was sacked, but a penalty on [[BenJarvus Green-Ellis]] on the ensuing punt meant the Patriots had to start their last drive of the game from their own 10-yard line. After a [[Julian Edelman]] 18-yard reception began it, four straight in-completions ended the drive and the game. With the win, not only did the Jets improve to 2â0, but it also marked the first time that they defeated the Patriots at home since 2000. This also marked the first time that New England was held without a touchdown since December 10, 2006. 
[[Rex Ryan]] would become the first Jets rookie head coach since [[Al Groh]] to win their first two games.

The Jets wore New York Titans throwback uniforms for an AFL Legacy Game with the [[Tennessee Titans]], who wore 1960s Houston Oilers uniforms.

New York would take flight in the first quarter with rookie quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] getting a 14-yard touchdown run. And later in the first he completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Ben Hartsock]].  The Titans would answer in the second quarter with running back [[LenDale White]]'s 5-yard touchdown run and kicker [[Rob Bironas]]' 38-yard field goal. This made the score 14â10 with the Jets leading.

Tennessee would take the lead in the third quarter with quarterback [[Kerry Collins]]' 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Nate Washington]], yet the Jets came right back with Sanchez's 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jerricho Cotchery]].  In the fourth quarter, New York would add onto their lead with a 30-yard field goal from kicker [[Jay Feely]].  Afterwards, the defense would prevent any possible comeback attempts from the Titans. 

With the win, not only did the Jets improve to 3â0, but Sanchez (17-of-30, 171 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT) would become the first rookie quarterback since the [[AFLâNFL merger]] of 1970 to win their first three games.  Also, this marked the first time since 2004 that New York began a season at 3â0.

Coming off their home win over the Titans, the Jets flew to the [[Louisiana Superdome]] for a Week 4 interconference duel with the [[New Orleans Saints]].  New York would find themselves struggling early with Saints kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] making a 34-yard field goal.  New Orleans would take command in the second quarter with safety [[Darren Sharper]] returning an interception 99 yards for a touchdown, followed by rookie quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] fumbling the ball in his own endzone (due to a sack by defensive end [[Will Smith (American football)|Will Smith]]), which was recovered by defensive tackle [[Remi Ayodele]] for a touchdown.  The Jets would close out the half with a 38-yard field goal from kicker [[Jay Feely]].

New York tried to make a comeback run as running back [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]] got a 15-yard touchdown run in the third quarter, but the Saints sealed the victory with running back [[Pierre Thomas (American football)|Pierre Thomas]]' 1-yard touchdown run and a stiff defensive effort.

With the loss, the Jets fell to 3â1.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Saints, the Jets flew to [[Land Shark Stadium]] for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with their AFC East rival, the [[Miami Dolphins]].  New York immediately trailed as the Dolphins took the game's opening drive and capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown run from running [[Ronnie Brown]].  The Jets immediately responded with rookie quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to newly-acquired wide receiver [[Braylon Edwards]].  Afterwards, Miami closed out the opening quarter with a 35-yard field goal from kicker [[Dan Carpenter]].  In the second quarter, New York took the lead as kicker [[Jay Feely]] got a 40-yard and a 43-yard field goal.

After a scoreless third quarter, both the Jets and the Dolphins would get involved in a back-and-forth fourth quarter.  Miami opened up the period with quarterback [[Chad Henne]] hooking up with tight end [[Anthony Fasano]] on a 2-yard touchdown pass, while New York got a 1-yard touchdown run from running back [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]].  The Dolphins would immediately respond as Henne threw a 53-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Ted Ginn, Jr.]], but Jones came through again with a 3-yard touchdown run.  Late in the game, Miami managed to crack through the Jets' defense as Brown got a 2-yard touchdown run.  New York tried to rally, but Sanchez's last-second hail mary pass was knocked away.

With the loss, the Jets fell to 3â2.

Hoping to snap a two-game losing streak, the Jets went home for a Week 6 AFC East duel with the [[Buffalo Bills]].  Both teams began the first quarter with field goals, as Bills kicker [[Rian Lindell]] made a 33-yard field goal and Jets kicker [[Jay Feely]] getting a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New York soared into the lead with Feely's 41-yard field goal and running back [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]]' 71-yard touchdown run.  However, Buffalo rallied to tie the game in the third quarter with Lindell's 25-yard field goal and quarterback [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]]'s 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]].  After both teams failed to get any point in the fourth quarter, the game went into overtime.  Despite getting the ball to start off OT, the Jets failed to get any point out of their opening drive.  After a hard-fought period, the Bills would emerge on top as Lindell booted the game-winning 47-yard field goal.

With the loss, New York fell to 3â3.

Thomas Jones would have a career day as he ran 22 times for a franchise-best 210 yards (in addition to his rushing touchdown).

Coming off their shutout road win over the Raiders, the Jets went home, donned their white New York Titans uniforms again, and played a Week 8 divisional rematch with the [[Miami Dolphins]].  After a scoreless first quarter, New York and Miami would exchange field goals with Jets kicker [[Jay Feely]] making a 23-yard field goal, followed by Dolphins kicker [[Dan Carpenter]] getting a 48-yard field goal.

In a back-and-forth third quarter, New York would begin the wild scoring with Feely nailing a 55-yard field goal.  Miami would immediately answer with wide receiver [[Ted Ginn, Jr.]] returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown, followed by linebacker [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] returning a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown.  The Jets would reply with rookie quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] getting a 1-yard touchdown run, but the Dolphins instantly came right back as Ginn, Jr. returned a kickoff 101 yards for an touchdown.  New York would close out the wild and crazy period with Sanchez hooking up with wide receiver [[Braylon Edwards]] on a 19-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion).  In the fourth quarter, Miami struck again as quarterback [[Chad Henne]] found tight end [[Joey Haynos]] on a 5-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion).  The Jets tried to rally as Sanchez completed a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Dustin Keller]] (with another 2-point conversion), but New York's rally would fall short.

With the bitter loss, New York went into their bye week at 4â4.

In the first quarter, New York struggled early on both sides of the field as Patriots cornerback [[Leigh Bodden]] returned an interception 53 yards for a touchdown, followed by quarterback [[Tom Brady]] completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Randy Moss]]. In the second quarter, the Jets continued to trail as running back [[Laurence Maroney]] got a 2-yard touchdown run, while kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] made a 26-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Jets fell to 4â6.

With the win, the Jets ended the Colts' perfect season run, and also ended their 23âgame regular season winning streak.  The Jets were able to capitalize on the Colts' decision to bench quarterback Peyton Manning to avoid injury given they had already made the playoffs.  The Jets improved their playoff chances greatly by moving to 8â7 on the season.
