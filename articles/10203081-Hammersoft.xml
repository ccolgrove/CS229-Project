{{Unreferenced|date=December 2008}}'''Jetix Scandinavia''' was a television channel owned by [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] targeting children broadcasting to the Nordic countries. It was launched in 1998 and was then known as '''Fox Kids''', but it was rebranded in 2004 since [[Saban Entertainment]] and [[News Corporation]] had sold all Fox Kids channels to Disney.

The Scandinavian version of Jetix available in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]] was replaced by [[Disney XD Scandinavia|Disney XD]] on September 11, 2009.

On satellite, the channel was initially only available on the [[Canal Digital]] platform. It launched on the [[Viasat]] platform in 2005. It was also available on most cable networks in the region. The channel broadcasted between 06:00 and 18:00 and carried audio in four languages: [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]].

Jetix received a license to broadcast terrestrially in Sweden in March 2008, but was never able to use it. This was because transmission company [[Teracom]] decided to freeze its investment in the network where Jetix would have broadcast, because of a disagreement with the [[Post and Telecom Agency (Sweden)|Post and Telecom Agency]] over transmission fees.

==Disney XD rebrand==
The Scandinavian version of Jetix available in [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]] was replaced by Disney XD, on September 12, 2009. When [[Disney XD]] successfully launched on February 13, 2009, in the US, [[Disney XD]] was rolled out to France on April 1, 2009 and was rolled out to other European territories in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD&quot;&gt;
