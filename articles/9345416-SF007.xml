'''CDRWIN''' is a [[Optical disc authoring software|CD/DVD burning software]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] developed by Golden Hawk Technology company.

Once popular, CDRWIN's usage has diminished due to the bundling of limited versions of other software packages, such as [[Nero Burning ROM]] and [[Easy Media Creator|Roxio Easy CD Creator]], with new computers and optical drives.

==Unique features==
CDRWIN is known for its unique features such as analyzing the [[Optical disc authoring#TOC|TOC]] of a CD. It is also one of the programs which introduced the [[Cue sheet (computing)|cue sheet]] format&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Cue_sheet|title=Cue sheet|work=Hydrogen audio knowledgebase|accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

CDRWIN is useful for the [[karaoke]] industry, as it fully supports reading/writing karaoke CDs.

==PlayStation TOC Protection==
CDRWIN was mostly used during the [[PlayStation]] era. People could backup PlayStation games quickly and easily, and soon discovered that its unique cuesheet operations allowed them to alter the TOC for any CD being duplicated, provided the CD-Writer supported writing an invalid TOC. Most CD-Writing software could not make copies or images of the CD if the [[Optical disc authoring#TOC|TOC]] was invalid. This problem was overcome when [[CloneCD]] was released and duplication was made more accessible when [[Nero Burning ROM]] was updated to support this type of copying.
