'''''Stargate''''' is a [[Adventure science fiction|adventure]] [[military science fiction]] [[Media franchise|franchise]], initially conceived by [[Roland Emmerich]] and [[Dean Devlin]]. The first film in the franchise was simply titled ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. It was originally released on October 28, 1994, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Carolco]], and became a hit, grossing nearly $200&amp;nbsp;million (USD) worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;estimated&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=stargate.htm |title=Stargate (1994) |publisher=''''Box Office Mojo'' | accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;estimated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0SGTE.php|title=Movie Stargate - Box Office Data, News, Cast Information - The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, [[Brad Wright]] and [[Jonathan Glassner]] created a television series titled ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' as a sequel for the film.

In addition to film and television, the ''Stargate'' franchise has expanded into other media, including [[List of Stargate literature|books]], video games, and [[List of Stargate comics|comic books]]. These supplements to the film and television series have resulted in significant development of the show's fictional universe and mythology. In 2008, the films ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' and ''[[Stargate: Continuum|Continuum]]'' were released [[direct-to-DVD]], which in total grossed over $21&amp;nbsp;million in the United States. In 2002 the franchise's first animated series, ''[[Stargate Infinity]]'', began airing, which holds no canonicity in the franchise despite its ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''-inspired plot. In 2004, the TV series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' was released as a spin off from ''Stargate SG-1'' and a third series, ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', premiered on October 2, 2009. ''Stargate Universe'' was cancelled during its second season, leaving it on a cliffhanger. Then on April 17, 2011, Stargate producer Brad Wright announced that any plans for the continuation of the franchise had been cancelled indefinitely, ending 17 years of Stargate television production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colvin&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Chad | last=Colvin |title=SGU continuation, other movies dead â for now |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/04/wright-sgu-continuation-other-movies-dead-for-now/ |format= |agency=|work=GateWorld |date=April 17, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
''Stargate'' productions center on the premise of a &quot;[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]&quot;, a ring-shaped device that creates a [[wormhole]] enabling personal transportation to complementary devices located cosmic distances away. Under the control of the United States government, the Stargate discovered on Earth is kept a secret from the public. This allows for storylines to present [[suspension of disbelief|no contradiction]] between depicted events and [[reality]], an effect compounded by setting ''Stargate'' in the [[present day]] and depicting Earth accurately, with any unrealistic technology originating solely from alien civilizations. These extraterrestrial civilizations are typically more [[Industrialisation|pre-industrial]] than [[science|scientifically advanced]] and are almost always human. Together, this allows for stories predominated by human interaction in Earth-like environments, an unusual feature for a science fiction franchise focused on exploration of other worlds.

In the story, this is explained as being the result of alien interference in Earth's distant pastâthe concept influenced by the theories of [[Erich von DÃ¤niken]]. Many ancient [[mythology|mythologies]] are shown to be the result of aliens who had visited Earth posing as [[polytheism|gods]] by using their technology to give the impression of deific power. While some of these aliens had benign intentions, a race later known in ''Stargate SG-1'' as the &quot;[[Goa'uld]]&quot; used Stargates to move slaves from [[Ancient Egypt]] to other habitable planets, simultaneously being responsible for the Egyptian religion and culture. Following a successful rebellion, the Goa'uld fled Earth, and the Stargate was buried and forgotten until modern times, when the United States acquired it following an archaeological dig. With the rediscovery of the function of the Stargate, the galaxy becomes a source of knowledge as well as threats, and the attention of the Goa'uld is drawn once more to Earth.

==Franchise releases==
Due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various ''Stargate'' productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official [[canon (fiction)|canon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gateworldbradwright&quot;&gt;{{Cite interview|subject=Brad Wright |interviewer= Darren Sumner |program=''GateWorld'' |title=Brad Wright Interview |city=''Chicago'' | language=| accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest [[fanbase|following]] exists for the three live-action series.&lt;ref name=&quot;gateworldomnipedia&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5 |work=GateWorld |title=GateWorld Omnipedia | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their predecessor).

==''Stargate'' franchise timeline==
{{Stargate timeline}}

==Theatrical films==
===''Stargate''===
{{main|Stargate (film)}}

In 1994, the [[military science fiction]] feature film ''Stargate'' was released; directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] and co-written by [[Dean Devlin]]. The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.

The theatrical version of the film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in [[Giza]] in 1928. As of [[Present Day]] (i.e. 1994), the failing [[egyptologist]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] ([[James Spader]]) helps to make the Stargate work again by deciphering the [[hieroglyphs]] on the [[cover stone]]s of the Stargate, now housed at a military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado. A team led by Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to aid in translations to allow them to return home later. At their arrival, the team discovers a [[slave]] civilization serving an alien who is [[Ra (Stargate)|posing as the Egyptian god Ra]] ([[Jaye Davidson]]). He and his minion-gods have taken human form, commanding the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a [[slave rebellion]], overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to [[Teleportation|teleport]] and detonate a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named [[Sha'uri]].

===Other releases and future development {{anchor|Future productions}} ===
After Bill McCay had written a [[Stargate film novels|series of five novels]] continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the ''Stargate'' television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that &quot;he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newstargatefilmfromorg&quot;/&gt; According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;newstargatefilmfromorg&quot;/&gt; The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together.&lt;ref name=&quot;ignrusselspader&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 |title=Devlin Announces Plans For Stargate Sequels |work=ComingSoon.net | language=| accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that &quot;Devlin can wish to do a sequel to Stargate all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they'll ask him to do it. He knows better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gateworldinterview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml |title=Interview: Brad Wright |work=GateWorld | language=| accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator [[Dean Devlin]] at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. He has said he is currently in talks with MGM to produce four films and he would like two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]], Devlin says that should the sequels be made, he hopes to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader have expressed interest, Devlin revealed. &quot;They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely.&quot; These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;newstargatefilmfromorg&quot;/&gt;

Dean Devlin has spoken out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hasn't given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film.  He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider.  Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three.  His hope is, now that the series is starting to wind down, that perhaps it will be time to actually get to do parts two and three.

Devlin has said &quot;I think it'll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed,&quot; he said. &quot;We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist â and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger.&quot;  &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gateworldinterview2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|author=|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/07/devlin-still-talking-stargate-movie-sequels/ |title=Interview: Darren |work=GateWorld | language=| accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stargate was directed by Roland Emmerich, and starred Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neil and James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson.  Devlin said he would absolutely want to use the same actors.  The movie was shot with a modest budget of $55 million, and released in October of 1994.

In the meantime, Lionsgate remains the major rights holder to the original film; this was due to the fact that its predecessor, Live Entertainment, owned home video rights to the [[Carolco Pictures]] library and had also owned international distribution rights, although Carolco itself was on the brink of bankruptcy when they produced this film.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

[[File:Sg1-poster.jpg|thumb|upright|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.]]
In 1997, [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] co-developed ''Stargate SG-1'', a television series intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra &quot;L&quot;). The [[Stargate Command]] setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the [[Cheyenne Mountain]] military complex. Other variations and differences between the original film and ''SG-1'' mostly concern the location of the planet [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]], the alien [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]], the race of Ra's underlings ([[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]]), and Stargate travel.&lt;ref name=nytimes &gt;{{Cite web |author=Will Joyner |title=Through a Gate to the Far Side of the Universe: A TV Series |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5D7163AF935A15754C0A961958260 |work=The New York Times |date=July 26, 1997 |accessdate=October 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A765597 |title=Stargate SG-1 â TV Shows |publisher=BBC | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series debuted on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on July 27, 1997, and moved to the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] after its fifth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08/14/12.30.sfc|title=Announcement from SciFi Channel|work=SciFi Wire | accessdate=May 5, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred [[Richard Dean Anderson]] (as [[Jack O'Neill|O'Neill]]) and [[Michael Shanks]] (as [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Jackson]]), alongside [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Christopher Judge]] and [[Don S. Davis]] playing the new characters [[Samantha Carter]], [[Teal'c]] and [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]]. The cast remained fairly regular for most of ''SG-1'''s run, but experienced some changes. [[Michael Shanks]] left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by [[Corin Nemec]] as [[Jonas Quinn]]. Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 [[Don S. Davis|Davis]] left the show and Anderson filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]], but added new regulars [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Ben Browder]]. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, [[Claudia Black]]'s popular reception earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_01.htm|title=Interview â Vala joins ''SG-1'' regulars|work=SciFi World | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MGM]] put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stargate 200&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=''Stargate 200'': 10 years of ''Stargate'' success|work=MultiChannel | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate'' was taken off air in 2007; however, two movies entitled ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' and ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'' were made to tie up loose ends.

===''Atlantis''===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis}}
[[File:Sga poster 1.JPG|thumb|upright|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.]]
The ''Stargate Atlantis'' series follows the adventures of the &quot;Atlantis expedition&quot;, a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]] in search of the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], also known as Lanteans and Alterrans. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of ''SG-1'''s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discover that the Pegasus galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the &quot;[[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]&quot;, against whom they must defend themselves, despite being vastly outnumbered.

''Stargate Atlantis'' was a spin-off television series from ''Stargate SG-1''.  A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of ''SG-1''.  Later, ''SG-1'' was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season.  Finally, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part [[season finale]] episode &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate = | year = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher=Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 10â14 | chapter = Watergate }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later the two shows even become interconnected. ''Atlantis'' was developed by most of the same people and in the same studios as ''SG-1''.

''Atlantis'' debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring [[Joe Flanigan]] and [[Torri Higginson]] in the lead roles, with [[Rainbow Francks|Rainbow Sun Francks]], [[David Hewlett]], and [[Rachel Luttrell]] alongside. Hewlett and Higginson's characters had previously appeared in ''SG-1'' (though Higginson inherited the role from actress [[Jessica Steen]]). In ''Atlantis''' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and [[Jewel Staite]] in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for season five to concentrate on ''[[Sanctuary (web series)|Sanctuary]]'', and was replaced by [[Robert Picardo]], who reprised his role as [[Richard Woolsey]] from both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''. However, in late summer 2008 it was announced that SciFi would not renew ''Atlantis''. The final episode aired on January 9, 2009.

''[[Stargate Universe]]'' is the third live-action ''Stargate'' series, and premiered on October 2, 2009. The series was pitched to the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in the fall of 2007, just before the writer's strikeâwhich put a hold on the project. &quot;The pitch was received very well,&quot; according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. Sci Fi Channel ordered ''Universe'' after announcing the cancellation of ''Stargate Atlantis''. Syfy announced on December 16, 2010 that they would not pick the show up for a third season. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/syfy-cancels-stargate-universe|title=Syfy Cancels &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;|accessdate=December 16, 2010 |date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final episode aired May 9, 2011.

With no apparent way home, the show follows the crew as they struggle to survive on board Destiny. The show was intended to have a darker tone than its predecessors as well as delve more into the humanity of the characters and their relationships with each other while also remaining true to the Stargate mythology and continuity.

According to Sci-Fi and [[Joseph Mallozzi]], a ''Stargate Atlantis'' two hour [[direct-to-DVD]] movie has been given the go ahead after the series was cancelled at the end of its fifth season.

{{main|Stargate Infinity}}
''[[Stargate Infinity]]'' is an American [[Cartoon|animated]] science fiction television series created by Eric Lewald and Michael Maliani as a spin off from its [[sister show]], ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. The [[story arc]] in ''Infinity'' is set 30 years into the future and follows [[Gus Bonner]] and his team. Bonner's team was created after he was framed for a crime he did not commit. He escaped from [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) after the hostile alien race Tlak'kahn attacked the SGC to find the chrysalis. Together with his team he escapes through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] with the chrysalis. From that point forward they go from planet to planet until they find the evidence to clear their names while learning about the unique cultures in the [[galaxy]], so that they can one day return back to [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cjar.com/cj_shows_stargate.php|title=Stargate Infinity|work=[[Cookie Jar Group|Cookie Jar Entertainment]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story arc was never resolved because of low viewership ratings, the show was cancelled in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

''Stargate Infinity'' premiered in September 2002 as part of [[4Kids Entertainment]]âs [[4Kids TV|FOX BOX]] Saturday morning line-up on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and went off the air in June 2003. Due to its lack of popularity the show is almost completely unrecognized. The series was cancelled before any of its [[story arc]]s could be resolved. The show was of [[low budget]], which was constantly noted by the media.&lt;ref name=regiontwo/&gt;&lt;ref name=shoutfactory/&gt; [[DIC Entertainment]] released a 4-episode DVD on October 7, 2003 in Region 1.

The writers and producers of ''Stargate SG-1'', ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' and the main [[canon (fiction)|canon]] of the ''Stargate'' franchise were not involved with ''Infinity'', and neither MGM, the production teams nor the fans of ''Stargate'' consider ''Infinity'' to be an official part of the ''Stargate'' universe. According to ''Stargate SG-1'' co-creator [[Brad Wright]], the animated series should not be considered official ''Stargate'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Commenting on it, he stated, &quot;I don't have a problem with it. I'm just not involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wright&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| author=Sumner, Darren | url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml|title=Brad Wright (Interview) | year=2001 |work=GateWorld | accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average viewership to ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' was around 10&amp;nbsp;million a week worldwide. According to ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' co-creator [[Brad Wright]], the show is very popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in [[homeland]] Canada.

==Literature==
{{main|Stargate literature|List of Stargate comics|List of Stargate audiobooks}}
There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film and two based in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' television shows. A series of books written by [[Bill McCay]] were published from 1995 to 1999 that were unofficial sequels to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/bill-mccay/ |title=Bill McCay |date= |work=Fantasy Fiction |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were produced by consulting the original notes made by [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]], in an attempt to envision where the film &quot;would have gone&quot;. Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite the fact that he attempted to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series ''Stargate SG-1'' (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.

Later, from 1999 to 2001, [[New American Library|ROC]] published four novels based in ''Stargate SG-1'' written by [[Ashley McConnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/ashley-mcconnell/stargate-sg1.htm |title=SG-1 by Ashley McConnell |date= |work=Fantasy Fiction |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, UK-based [[Fandemonium (publisher)|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006. The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=|url=http://titanmagazines.com/app?service=external/Product&amp;sp=l12 |title=Stargate Magazine |date= |work=Titan Magazines |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of [[comic book]]s, based on ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'', began to be published by [[Avatar Press]] in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by James Anthony and artwork by Jorge Correa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=|url=http://www.avatarpress.com/stargate/ |title=Stargate |date= |work=Avatar Press |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008 it was announced that [[Big Finish Productions]] would release officially-licensed [[audiobooks]] featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are ''[[Gift of the Gods]]'' read by [[Michael Shanks]] and ''[[A Necessary Evil (Stargate audio)|A Necessary Evil]]'' read by [[Torri Higginson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/Stargate-SG-1-and-Atlantis |title=Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis |date= |work=Big Finish Production |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
