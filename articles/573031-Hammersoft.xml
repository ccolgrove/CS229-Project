He is the final [[Boss (video games)|boss]] of most games in the series. He was first given a back-story in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]]''. The English version of the ''A Link to the Past'' instruction manual adds the surname '''Dragmire''' and the fact that his alias means &quot;Ganon of the Enchanted Thieves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganon's Name&quot;&gt;{{cite manual | author = Yoshiaki Koizumi  | title = Instruction Booklet (for ''The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past'') | section = The Legend of Hyrule | sectionurl =  | version =  | publisher = Nintendo of America | date = 1992 | url = http://www.zeldalegends.net/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=1274&amp;fullsize=1 | format = | id =  | accessdate ={{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}  | quote = &quot;The name of this king of thieves is Ganondorf Dragmire, but he is known by his alias, Mandrag Ganon, which means Ganon of the Enchanted Thieves.&quot; | page = 5 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American ''Ocarina of Time'' uses &quot;Great King of Evil Ganondorf&quot;, and the North American ''Twilight Princess'' uses &quot;Dark Lord Ganondorf&quot; and &quot;Dark Beast Ganon&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title = The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker| developer = Nintendo | publisher = Nintendo | quote = '''The King of Red Lions''': He is the very same Ganon...

His specific motives vary from game to game, but most often they include capturing Princess Zelda, and planning to achieve the domination of [[Hyrule]] (and presumably the world beyond it). To this end, he seeks the [[Triforce]], a powerful magical relic, which will grant whatever wish the bearer desires, and usually manipulates several other villains to accomplish his plans and ambitions. In most games he already possesses the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength and makes him invincible to all but certain holy weapons such as the [[Master Sword]]. However, Ganondorf's lust for power can never be satisfied, and he seeks the full [[Triforce]] to grant his wish of [[world domination]].

In general, Ganon has been well-received by critics and fans. Ganon was the runner-up in [[GameFAQs]]' &quot;Got Villains?&quot; Character Battle, losing only to ''[[Final Fantasy]]'''s [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gamefaqs.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/spr05|title=Spring 2005: Got Villains?|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]|author=GameFAQs Staff|year=2005|accessdate=2006-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept and creation==
Ganon was originally known as &quot;Hakkai&quot; during development of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', in reference to a humanoid pig character known as [[Zhu Bajie]] (''Cho Hakkai'' in Japanese) from the famed 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks - Zelda Handheld History |url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/iwata_asks_-_zelda_handheld_history_15603_15604.html#top |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the development of ''Ocarina of Time'', Ganon was conceived by character designer Satoru Takizawa. Takizawa had imagined Ganon as a &quot;crooked and complex thief, who was basically an all around abominable human being&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1101.com/nintendo/nin1/nin1-6.htm |title=æ¨¹ã®ä¸ã®ç§å¯åºå° |date=26 Nov 1998 |publisher=ã»ã¼æ¥åã¤ãã¤æ°è |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, script director Toru Osawa claimed that this image was &quot;not the case&quot;. He began to speak of how Ganondorf was meant to have &quot;parts where he is rather good&quot;, comparing him to the character of Raoh in ''[[Fist of the North Star]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ocarina Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Ki no ue no Himitsu kichi Ocarina of Time interview - Osawa and Takizawa comments |url= http://www.angelfire.com/games5/makzelda/interviews/kiootcomments.html|publisher=[[Angelfire]] |accessdate=2009-08-20 |date=1998-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this idea in mind, Takizawa created a tentative model of Ganondorf based on actor [[Christopher Lambert]]. The end result of Ganondorf was very different from this model, with three forms of the character being created: one of Ganondorf in the beginning; one of Ganondorf seven years later, with long hair; and one of Ganon in the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ocarina Interview&quot;/&gt; Since Ganon was a pig-like creature, Takizawa decided that Ganondorf should transform into such at the end of the game, despite the opinions of other staff members. He decided on making Ganon a beast &quot;with the feeling of a pig&quot; to reference ''A Link to the Past''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ocarina Interview&quot;/&gt;

Ganon is named inconsistently throughout the series. In the Japanese versions of the first three games, his name is anglicized as &quot;Gannon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Hyrule Fantasy: Zelda no Densetsu]] |developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] |publisher=[[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]] |date=1986-02-21 |platform=[[Family Computer Disk System]] |scene=title screen |quote=Many years ago prince darkness Gannon stole one of the Triforce with power.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|The Legend of Zelda 2: Link no BÅken]] |developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] |publisher=[[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]] |date=1987-01-14 |platform=[[Family Computer Disk System]] |scene=title screen |quote=Several years after Gannon was destroyed, Link learns from Impa about the another sleeping Princess Zelda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce]] |developer=[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] |publisher=[[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]] |date=1991-11-21 |platform=[[Super Famicom]] |scene=staff credits |quote=Level 8 Gannon's Tower}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling appears in only two Western releases: the original [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|game]], and the extracanonical ''[[Zelda's Adventure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Zelda's Adventure |developer=Viridis |publisher=Philips Media |date=1994-06-05 |platform=Philips CD-i |quote=Gannon, Lord of Darkness, has taken over Tolemac.

''A Link to the Past'' uses &quot;Ganondorf&quot;, as does ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'', aside from a few exceptional uses of &quot;Ganon&quot;. Nintendo's current convention is to use &quot;Ganon&quot; for his beast form and &quot;Ganondorf&quot; for the character's human form.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===Voice Actor portrayal===
Since the ''Zelda'' series presents dialogue as text, Ganon's voice actors only provide nonverbal noises like shouts, grunts and evil laughter.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} The first instance in which a voice actor was used for the part of Ganon was in the cartoon series ''[[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', with Len Carlson as Ganon.  Next was the spin-off title ''[[BS Zelda no Densetsu]]'', which was broadcast exclusively to Japanese [[Satellaview]] owners. From the game's first broadcast in August 1995 to its last in January 1997, Ganon was voiced by [[SeizÅ KatÅ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game| title = BS Zelda no Densetsu| developer = [[Nintendo]]| publisher = [[St.GIGA]]| date = 1995-08-06| platform = [[Satellaview]]| version = Aug 95| language = Japanese| isolang = ja| quote = '''Credits''': å£°ã®åºæ¼ -- å è¤ãç²¾ä¸}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next time a voice actor would be used for the part of Ganondorf would be in ''Ocarina of Time'', where he was voiced by [[Takashi Nagasako]].{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Nagasako would also go on to voice Ganondorf in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Wind Waker]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}} [[Hironori Miyata]] performs the role in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess|Twilight Princess]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Gregory Lee Kenyon played Ganondorf in the live-action Zelda trailer produced by Rainfall films. It took five hours to complete the makeup for Ganon, which included layers of latex prosthetics, a full wig, a beard, and a set of eyebrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Characteristics==
===Personality===
Ganon is depicted as the embodiment of evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;pedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/pedia/g.jsp#Ganon |author=Nintendo | title=The Great Hyrule Encyclopedia - Ganon | publisher=Zelda Universe |date=2006-01-01| accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His roles range from savage beast to Machiavellian tyrant to godlike entity,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;His status as a deity is explained in ''Ocarina of Time'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]'', and ''Twilight Princess''. Ganon has temples dedicated to him and is worshiped as a god.{{or|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes in the course of a single game.  However, he does show some knowledge of the fine arts, since he can play his own [[leitmotif]] on an organ in Ocarina of Time.

Ganondorf is portrayed in ''Ocarina of Time'' as an ambitious, cunning manipulator, gaining the king's trust before betraying him and tricking Link into opening the Door of Time, allowing Ganondorf to access the power of the gods.

In ''Twilight Princess'', Ganondorf is stated to have been known as a demon thief and an evil magic wielder renowned for his ruthlessness. When he obtains the Triforce of Power, he develops a god complex, believing himself to have been chosen by the goddesses to be the ruler of the world.

===Abilities===
Ganon is a formidable [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;He uses magic in ''A Link to the Past'', ''Ocarina of Time'', and ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link|The Adventure of Link]]'', among other titles.&lt;/ref&gt; able to use magic to attack as well as [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;He changes between human and beast forms in ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Twilight Princess''.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the king of the Gerudo is skilled enough a swordsman to combat [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Ganon acrobatically dodges Link's swings in ''The Wind Waker'' and ''Twilight Princess''. In the former, he [[Dual wield|dual-wields]] swords.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Triforce#Triforce of Power|Triforce of Power]], a magical relic of the goddess [[Recurring characters in The Legend of Zelda series#Golden Goddesses|Din]], makes Ganon stronger, also granting him powers such as [[Transvection (flying)|transvection]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Ganon flies in ''A Link to the Past'', the TV series ''[[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', and ''Ocarina of Time''. In ''Twilight Princess'', he causes [[Princess Zelda]] to fly while [[Spirit possession|possessing]] her.&lt;/ref&gt; [[teleportation]],&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Ganon can teleport himself and others by various means. He visibly uses this skill in the TV series ''The Legend of Zelda''.{{Elucidate|date=January 2011}} In ''Ocarina of Time'', he encloses Princess Zelda in a pink crystal and teleports her to his castle. In ''Twilight Princess'', while in beast form, he uses [[Portal (fiction)|portals]] to evade attack.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[superhuman strength]]. Further, the Triforce piece grants him [[immortality]]: he never shows signs of aging and can survive wounds as severe as being impaled by a sword. Once drastically injured, he can be magically imprisoned by divine intervention, but he may escape. If he is actually killed, his followers may resurrect him.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Ganon's minions fail to resurrect Ganon in ''The Adventure of Link'', but partly succeed in ''Oracle of Ages'' and ''Oracle of Seasons''.&lt;/ref&gt; Only sacred weapons such as the [[Master Sword]] can hurt Ganon at all.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''A Link to the Past'', Ganon can only be slain by Silver Arrows. In ''Ocarina of Time'' and ''Four Swords Adventure'', Light Arrows and the [[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures#Plot|Four Sword]], respectively, are necessary to defeat him.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appearance===
Ganon has two basic forms that appear throughout the series: one bestial, and one humanoid. In ''The Legend of Zelda'', ''A Link to the Past'', ''Oracle of Seasons'', ''Oracle of Ages'', and ''Four Swords Adventures'', he is a blue, porcine biped wielding a trident. In ''Ocarina of Time'', he bears more resemblance to a giant [[Minotaur]], and wields two large swords. This game also marks the first appearance of his humanoid form: an armor-clad but unarmed Gerudo with dark skin and red hair. Special traits in his human form include muscular figure, sharp canines, yellow eyes, a somewhat long nose, and elongated eyebrows connecting with the hair. Ganondorf is incredibly tall and towers over series protagonist Link and the king's guards. His human form reappears in ''The Wind Waker'' with a cloak and two swords and in ''Twilight Princess'' with thicker armor, a glowing wound in his chest, and a huge sword which he can wield with one hand. In both ''The Wind Waker'' and ''Twilight Princess'', Ganondorf also sports a [[chin curtain]].

==Appearances==
===Video games===
Ganon has been the primary antagonist of the ''Zelda'' series since its inception. As such, he has appeared in most games in the series, some of which hide his existence until late in the game.

Ganon made his first appearance in ''The Legend of Zelda'' as the main antagonist. Ganon invades Hyrule with his minions, stealing the Triforce of Power. To protect the world from Ganon, [[Princess Zelda]] breaks the [[Triforce#Triforce of Wisdom|Triforce of Wisdom]] into eight pieces and scatters them across the land, but is then captured. She sends her nursemaid, Impa, to find someone to defeat Ganon. Impa discovers [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], the protagonist of the series. He gathers the Triforce pieces and defeats Ganon, reducing him to a pile of ashes and recovering the Triforce of Power. Afterwards, he brings both the Triforces of Power and Wisdom to Zelda.

Ganon makes no major appearance in the sequel ''Zelda II: The Adventure of Link'', as it focuses on his minions' attempt to revive him by killing Link and spilling Link's blood over Ganon's ashes. If they succeed, Ganon's silhouette appears on the Game Over screen accompanied by his laugh.

He later appeared in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''A Link to the Past'', trapped in a place called the Dark Worldâformerly called the Sacred Land, before Ganon corrupted it. The game focuses on Ganon's attempt to escape from the Dark World and conquer the Light World, utilizing minions such as the wizard Agahnim to sacrifice the seven descendants of the sages who sealed him away, in order to break the seal. Zelda summons Link to rescue her, but she is captured and sent to the Dark World. Once Link defeats Agahnim, he is sent to the Dark World, where he rescues the seven maidens, defeats Agahnim yet again, and pursues Ganon into his lair, where Ganon is eventually defeated. Link finds the completed Triforce, and uses it to undo everything Ganon has done.

In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|Link's Awakening]]'', Dethl, a physical manifestation of the Wind Fish's nightmares, fills the role of the antagonist. During the final battle, Dethl assumes several forms, all of which are based on antagonists and creatures from Link's past. One of Dethl's forms is &quot;Ganon's Shadow&quot; and is constructed from Link's memories of his battle with Ganon in ''A Link to the Past''.

He makes a major appearance in ''Ocarina of Time'' in his [[humanoid]] form; in the chronology of the series's story, it is his earliest appearance. Ganon swears his allegiance to the King of Hyrule, in order to betray him and conquer Hyrule Castle. Princess Zelda asks Link to take the Master Sword, a mystical weapon used to defeat evil. After Link finds all the items necessary to take the sword, Zelda and her nursemaid Impa are chased from Hyrule Castle by Ganon. Once Link opens the door protecting the Master Sword and takes it, he falls into a deep sleep, allowing Ganon to steal the Triforce of Power from the room. Seven years later, Link awakens as an adult, and finds Hyrule corrupted by Ganon. Link collects the power of the seven sagesâincluding Zelda, who is kidnapped after she reveals herself. He encounters Ganon, defeating him and escaping from the castle with Zelda. However, Ganon uses the Triforce of Power to turn into his bestial form. Link defeats him with the help of Zelda and the other sages, and Ganon is banished to the Sacred Realm, swearing vengeance against Zelda, the Sages and Link.

Ganon does not make an appearance in the Nintendo 64 game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask|Majora's Mask]]''.

Two [[Game Boy Color]] games, [[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages|''Oracle of Seasons'' and ''Oracle of Ages'']], do not initially have anything to do with Ganon, but once both are linked together and both beaten, two of Ganon's minions, Koume and Kotake, seek to revive him by using Zelda and two [[oracle]]s called Din and Nayru. Ganon is revived in his bestial form, but since Zelda was not sacrificed, he is mindless and is defeated by Link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Ages | developer=Flagship | publisher=Nintendo | date=2001-05-14 | platform=Game Boy Color |quote='''Zelda:''' Since they could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could only revive a mindless, raging Ganon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganon does not make an appearance in the GameBoy Advance game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords|Four Swords]]''.

He appears in the [[GameCube]] game ''The Wind Waker'' as the main antagonist. Following ''Ocarina of Time'', Ganon escaped from the Sacred Realm. Link having disappeared, no one is able to defeat Ganon, forcing the Hylians to pray to the Goddesses, asking them to flood Hyrule in order to destroy Ganon.  When he is confronted in his fortress by the new incarnation of Link, Ganon reveals his motives, finding the three Triforce pieces by capturing both Link and Zelda (for the second time) who hold the Triforces of Courage and Wisdom. After Link fails to defeat Ganon in their first encounter, Link finds the Master Sword and battles Ganon in the sunken Hyrule Castle. Ganon explains his resentment of Hyrule, describing his country as one that is filled with death and despair, and that Hyrule was rich with lifeâthat being his reason for trying to conquer it. However, before Ganon can use the Triforce to revert the flood, it is used to drown Hyrule Castle by the King of Hyrule. Link thrusts the Master Sword into Ganon's head, turning him to stone and drowning him with Hyrule Castle.

Ganon makes an appearance late in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures|Four Swords Adventures]]'', where he is revealed to be the main antagonist and using the wind mage Vaati for his own means. After Vaati is defeated, Link and Zelda do battle with Ganon, sealing him away with the Four Sword.

Ganon does not make an appearance in the GameBoy Advance game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap|The Minish Cap]]''.

In ''Twilight Princess'', Ganon initially appears in a plot twist midway through the game, though he is the true antagonist behind all of the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|date=2005-08-16|url= http://cube.ign.com/articles/683/683158p1.html|title=Twilight Princess: Ganon's Return|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the events of the game, Ganon was captured by the Sages and was condemned to death, but, as he was the bearer of the Triforce of Power, the Sages were unable to kill him even with the sacred Sword of the Sages.  Subsequently, in his rage, Ganon breaks his chains and kills the Sage of water before claiming the Sword of the Sages for him self.  The Sages, desperate to stop the King of Evil, banished him to the Twilight Realm, leaving him with a glowing wound on his chest. In the Twilight Realm, Ganon presents himself as a demonic [[deity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2006-11-19 | platform=Wii |quote='''Zant:''' It was then, in the thrall of hatred and despair, that I turned my eyes to the heavens...and found a god. }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Zant]], delegating his power and persuading him to attempt conquest of the light world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2006-11-19 | platform=Wii |quote='''Zant:''' My god had only one wish....To merge shadow and light...and make darkness! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganon does not appear again until the end of the gameâin the throne of Hyrule Castle, proclaiming it as his own. He is challenged by [[Midna]], prompting Ganon to possess Princess Zelda and attack Link before changing to beast form (in a more feral style than previous appearances, mirroring Link's wolf form). Midna recovers and teleports Link and Zelda to Hyrule Field before attempting to defeat Ganon, causing the castle to explode. Ganon appears on horseback, holding Midna's fused shadow and crushing it between his hands to show his victory over Midna. After a battle on horseback, Ganon requests a final duel, using the execution sword as his weapon. Link defeats Ganon, impaling him through the wound in his chest with the Master Sword. After getting up and uttering a few words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title=The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess | developer=Nintendo EAD | publisher=Nintendo | date=2006-11-19 | platform=Wii |quote='''Ganondorf:''' Do not think this ends here... The history of Light and Shadow will be written in blood! }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Triforce symbol on his hand disappears, and Zant is shown snapping his own neck in a vision. Ganon gasps, his eyes glaze over, and he seemingly dies standing in place. However his fate is not actually disclosed.

In ''Phantom Hourglass'', Ganon appears in the opening sequence that summarizes the plot of ''The Wind Waker''.

Ganon does not make an appearance in the Nintendo DS game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks|Spirit Tracks]]''.

While Ganon does not make an appearance in the Nintendo Wii game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword|Skyward Sword]]'', his appearance in ''Ocarina of Time'' is foreshadowed. Demise, the main villain of the game, states before his ultimate destruction that his hatred will be reborn anew again and again in an endless cycle to torment Link and Zelda's descendants and attack Hyrule. This implies that Ganondorf is the physical personification and reincarnation of Demise's hatred and is the source of his demonic powers before obtaining the Triforce of Power.

===Other appearances===
Ganon appears in his &quot;green boar&quot; form in two of the three [[CD-i games from The Legend of Zelda series|CD-i ''Zelda'' titles]]: ''Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon'' and ''Link: The Faces of Evil''. In ''Zelda's Adventure'', he is a large, muscular devil-creature. In the first two of these games, he only requires one hit to defeat, and appears to be a sorcerer of some sort with features based on his cartoon incarnation.

Ganon is an unlockable character in both ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' (where he is based on his appearance in the [[Nintendo Space World]] demo, even wielding the large, cleaver-like sword in one of his victory poses though he cannot actually use it in combat)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001-11-26|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/100/100084p1.html|title=Super Smash Bros.

He is one of four characters from the ''Zelda'' series to be playable in the game. In ''Melee'' and ''Brawl'', he is referred to by his full name and is a slower, heavier, and more powerful &quot;clone&quot; of [[Captain Falcon]], performing mostly the same attacks and moves. Eiji Aonuma said that his design team submitted designs for Ganon based on ''Twilight Princess'' to the developers of ''Super Smash Bros.

His Final Smash is his &quot;Dark Beast: Ganon&quot; form from ''Twilight Princess'', in which he transforms, charges across the screen, and then warps himself back onto the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/hidden09.html|work=Smash Bros.

===Appearances in other media===
Ganon was the main villain of 1989's [[The Legend of Zelda (TV series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' cartoon]], which was shown as part of ''[[Super Mario Bros. television series|The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]'' in syndication that year. In the cartoon, Ganon was a brown-skinned [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] wild boar and a wizard. He was in possession of the Triforce of Power, andâdespite having seemingly endless abilities and magical powersâlost every chance to steal the Triforce of Wisdom. He spent most of his time living in his subterranean lair, referred to as his &quot;castle&quot;, which was located in the [[Underworld]]. He is disintegrated when attacked several times by Link's sword, Zelda's arrows, or the Triforce of Wisdom. He was voiced by [[Len Carlson]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In addition to the ''Zelda'' cartoon, Ganon (along with Link and Zelda) also appeared in ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'', as a secondary villain in the episode &quot;Quest for the Potion of Power&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Quest for the Potion of Power |series=Captain N: The Game Master |serieslink=Captain N: The Game Master |network=NBC |airdate=1990-09-29 |number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was something of a continuation of Ganon's appearance in the ''Zelda'' cartoon. The episode uses elements from ''The Legend of Zelda'' and ''The Adventure of Link''. During the episode, Ganon is revived, double-crosses [[Metroid (series)|Mother Brain]], and is killed again by the Reflect magic on Link's shield.

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode &quot;[[Imaginationland Episode III]],&quot; Ganon is seen as one of many evil characters battling the good characters.

In the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode &quot;Shoe,&quot; Ganon appears briefly but is killed by Link, who frees Zelda shortly afterward.

==Reception==
Ganon is one of the most popular video-game villains. [[GameSpot]] counted one of his appearances among the top ten boss fights of all time, stating &quot;The final battle of every Zelda game sees Link and Ganon locked in a clash of wills, and the fight at the end of Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64 was by far the most dramatic and epic one in Zelda history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/tenspot/0918boss/6.html|title=GameSpot's Top Ten Boss Fights|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar article went on to say &quot;As it is, Ganon is one of the toughest bosses around, because of his epic appearances and his tough-as-nails nature. No pushover in any sense, Ganon earns his place in the archives as one of the gaming world's greatest villains.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://replay.web.archive.org/20090413042720/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/tenspot_villains/page5.html | title = Top Ten Video Game Villains | page = 5 | work = GameSpot | publisher = CBS Interactive | accessdate = 2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganon also received an honorable mention on Impact Lab's similar list: &quot;Link's main adversary just missed the list, but that last fight with Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time (N64) still deserves a shout-out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impactlab.net/2006/04/14/top-10-video-game-bosses/|title=Top 10 Video Game Bosses|publisher=Impact Lab|date=2004-04-14|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, ''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' judged Ganon in ''Twilight Princess'' an especially disappointing final boss, writing &quot;We went into this battle expecting [[Darth Maul]], and what we got was [[C-3PO]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15712_p2.html|title=The 6 Most Disappointing Video Game End Bosses|publisher=Cracked.com|first=Andrew|last=Gordon|accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganon ranked in the second slot on [[GameDaily]]'s &quot;top ten Nintendo characters that deserve their own games&quot; list, explaining that he is the epitome of cool, and it would be enjoyable to plunder Hyrule instead of saving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Nintendo Characters That Deserve Their Own Games | page=9 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-10-nintendo-characters-that-deserve-their-own-games |work=[[Game Daily]]|publisher=AOL | date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also ranked him amongst the most persistent video game villains of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20090122195214/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/most-persistent-video-game-villains/|page=7|title=Most Persistent Video Game Villains | date=2009-01-20 | last = Buffa|first=Chris | accessdate = 2011-01-27 | work=GameDaily | publisher = AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] listed him second on their list of video game villains who will never stay dead, stating that even though he has broken free from his many seals or even killed, he never seems to change his strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Top 7... villains who never stay dead |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-top-7-villains-that-never-stay-dead/a-200904139337300060 | page=4 | last = Reparaz | first = Mikel |work=[[GamesRadar]] | publisher=Future US | date = 2009-04-13|accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] listed Ganon as one of the top 10 characters in need of a spin-off.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Spin-Off&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.games.ign.com/articles/790/790921p1.html |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Characters In Need of a Spin-Off |author=News &amp; Features Team |date=2010-05-22 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
