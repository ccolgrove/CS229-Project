Initially offering 2 million songs, the Zune Marketplace has grown to offer 14 million songs,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfKsS113nAY&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are now available in MP3 format at up to 320kbps and are [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free.

Prior to Zune Marketplaceâs music becoming DRM-free, songs were protected by a different DRM system than songs protected by Microsoftâs now-abandoned [[PlaysForSure]] initiative DRM, with the result that songs purchased from a PlaysForSure store cannot be played on any Zune-compatible device.
