The '''Wilmington Terminal Railroad''' {{reporting mark|WTRY}} is a [[shortline railroad]] serving the [[Port of Wilmington (North Carolina)]]. It began operations in 1986 over trackage owned by the [[North Carolina Ports Railway Commission]], whose other lines (at [[Morehead City, NC|Morehead City]]) were simultaneously leased to the [[Carolina Rail Services Company]]. The company is owned by [[Rail Link, Inc.]], a subsidiary of [[Genesee &amp; Wyoming Inc.]],&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Railway Association: [http://www.ncrailways.org/companies/WTRY.htm Wilmington Terminal Railroad]&lt;/ref&gt; which acquired it from the [[Rail Management Corporation]] in 2005.

The Ports Railway Commission acquired the lines&lt;!--from who?--&gt; in 1980, and expanded its property, leased to WTRY, through a purchase of spurs from [[CSX Transportation]] in 1993. In 2002, the lines were transferred to the [[North Carolina State Ports Authority]], in accordance with a recently-passed state law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stb.dot.gov/decisions/readingroom.nsf/WEBUNID/B6F6C6398CCBF76285256C5C0058536C?OpenDocument STB Finance Docket No. 34258], October 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
