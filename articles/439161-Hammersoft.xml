'''Robert Kelly Slater''' (born February 11, 1972, [[Cocoa Beach]], [[Florida|FL]], [[United States|USA]]) is an American professional [[surfer]] known for his competitive prowess and style. He has been crowned [[ASP World Tour|ASP]] World Champion a record 11 times, including 5 consecutive titles from 1994â98.  He is the youngest (at age 20) and the oldest (at age 39) to win the title. Upon winning his 5th world title in 1997, Slater passed Australian surfing legend [[Mark Richards (surfer)|Mark Richards]] to become the most successful champion in the history of the sport.  In 2007 he also became the all-time leader in career event wins by winning the Boost Mobile Pro event at [[Trestles|Lower Trestles]] near [[San Clemente]], California.  The previous record was held by Slater's childhood hero, 3-time world champion [[Tom Curren]].&lt;ref&gt;Sports Illustrated, September 24, 2007, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the ASP tour, Slater has also competed in the [[X-Games]] (in 2003 and 2004).  After earlier being awarded the title prematurely as a result of a miscalculation by the [[Association of Surfing Professionals|ASP]], on November 6, 2011 Slater officially won his eleventh ASP world title at the Rip Curl Pro Search San Francisco, by winning his 4th round heat.  In May 2005, in the final heat of the [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]] Tahiti Pro contest at [[Teahupo'o]], Slater became the first surfer ever to be awarded two perfect scores for a total 20 out of 20 points under the [[Association of Surfing Professionals|ASP]] two-wave scoring system.  (The corresponding honor under the previous three-wave system belongs to fellow American [[Shane Beschen]] who achieved the feat in 1996.)

Since 1990, Slater has been sponsored primarily by surfwear industry giant [[Quiksilver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiksilver.com/team/riders.aspx?id=7 |title=Quiksilver Rider's Gallery |accessdate=2007-10-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011134424/http://www.quiksilver.com/team/riders.aspx?id=7 |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He exclusively rides Channel Islands [[surfboard]]s equipped with his own signature series of FCS fins.
