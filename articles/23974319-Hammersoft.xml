[[Toby Gerhart]] rushed for 121 yards and two touchdowns, and redshirt freshman quarterback [[Andrew Luck]] made his collegiate debut by throwing for 193 yards and a touchdown pass to Chris Owusu as Stanford defeated Washington State in Pullman. The Cardinal dominated the first half, but as the second half began, the Cougars took the early momentum, driving 80 yards and scoring on a 5-yard pass from Kevin Lopina to Jared Karstetter. However, Owusu answered immediately for the Cardinal with an 85-yard kickoff return for a touchdown to keep the game out of reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292480265|title=Frosh Luck leads Stanford past Washington State|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Demon Deacons dominated the second half with three unanswered touchdowns: a 3-yard run from Mike Rinfrette, a 9-yard pass from quarterback [[Riley Skinner]] to Jordan Williams, and then, with 2 seconds left in the game, a one-yard keeper by Skinner to give Wake Forest its first lead in the game and the 24â17 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292550154|title=Skinner's TD in last seconds lifts Wake Forest by Stanford|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owusu also caught a touchdown pass from Andrew Luck, and Toby Gerhart rushed for two touchdowns. The Cardinal added another special teams touchdown on Richard Sherman's 48-yard punt return, and Corey Gatewood rounded out the scoring with a 23-yard interception return for a touchdown.

The Cardinal rushed for 322 yards, including a career-best 200 yards from Toby Gerhart to down the Huskies. For the second week in a row, Chris Owusu returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown to start the scoring for Stanford. Soon after, the Huskies tied the score on a dropped lateral from Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck to tight end Jim Dray; neither Luck nor Dray realized the throw was not a forward pass, but Washington's Justin Glenn picked up the ball and ran it 51 yards for the touchdown. However, on the next play from scrimmage, Gerhart ran 60 yards for a score to put Stanford ahead to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292690024|title=Stanford returns opening kick for TD, cruises by No. 24 Washington|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming into the game, the Bruins were the only undefeated team in the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10 Conference]] although they had yet to a play another Pac-10 team. [[Toby Gerhart]], the Cardinal's 237-pound tailback who had 138 yards against UCLA last year, is averaging 129 yards a game.

After UCLA recovered a fumble, Kai Forbath kicked a 29-yard field goal to give the Bruins the early lead. Gerhart rushed 5 yards for a touchdown for Stanford in the first quarter and aided by a UCLA penalty in the second quarter, scored a second touchdown. The Bruins kicked a field goal before halftime, aided by a partially-blocked punt.

With a 46-yard [[flea flicker (American football)|flea flicker]] in the third quarter to put Stanford in the red zone, Gerhart scored his third touchdown from the 5-yard line. He finished the game with 134 rushing yards. Later in the quarter, Nate Whitaker kicked a 29-yard field goal to give the Cardinal a 24â6 lead. The Bruins began the fourth quarter with a Johnathan Franklin 1-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 11, and a Forbath 35-yard field goal with about four minutes left in the game cut the lead to 24â16. UCLA took over with 3 minutes left but was unable to complete the comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292760024|title=Stanford finally takes down UCLA, keeps share of Pac-10 lead|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother [[James Rodgers (football)|James]] added the fifth touchdown and a Justin Kahut 31-yard field goal completed the scoring for the Beavers.

In a game that featured more than a thousand offensive yards, the Wildcats rallied back late to defeat the Cardinal. The quarterbacks were evenly matched: Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck threw for 423 yards and three touchdowns, while Arizona's Nick Foles also tossed three touchdown passes and had a total of 415 yards. Stanford's Toby Gerhart had 123 yards and two touchdowns. Arizona managed a total of just 138 rush yards, but 57 of those came on Nic Grigsby's go-ahead touchdown with under three minutes left. Stanford drove to the Arizona 17 with seconds to play, but a fourth-down pass to Chris Owusu was batted away and the Wildcats escaped with a victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292900012|title=Arizona erases 15-point deficit to clip Stanford|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toby Gerhart rushed for more than 100 yards for the 15th time in his college career as the Cardinal downed the Sun Devils. All four Stanford touchdowns were on rushes, but uncharacteristically for Stanford, only one  was by Gerhart. Fullback [[Owen Marecic]], who is almost exclusively used to block for Gerhart, scored on his seventh career carry; freshman Jamal-Rashad Patterson scored on a 22-yard reverse; and backup running back Stepfan Taylor had a 33-yard touchdown run. Arizona State scored on two Danny Sullivan touchdown passes, the last coming just before Sullivan left the game with a bruised knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292970024|title=Stanford uses balanced attack to top Arizona State|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cardinal surprised the Ducks, 51â42, to become bowl-eligible for the first time in eight years. Toby Gerhart ran for three touchdowns and a school-record 223 yards on 38 carries, breaking the previous record of 220 set by [[Jon Volpe]] in 1988. He also broke his single-season rushing record set last year with 1,217 yards. Andrew Luck finished 12 for 20 for 251 yards, throwing an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jim Dray in the second quarter and a 31-yarder to Chris Owusu after Oregon cut the Cardinal lead to 10 points early in the third quarter. Oregon closed within six points late in the fourth quarter following a missed Stanford field goal, but Stanford recovered the ensuing onside kick. A field goal with 11 seconds remaining put the game away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293110024|title=Stanford rides Gerhart's legs past No. 8 Oregon|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing its second top-10 opponent in as many weeks, Stanford won 55-21, handing USC a 34-point lossâits biggest loss of the [[Pete Carroll]] era and its biggest loss since 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN USC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293180030|title=Gerhart fuels Stanford's throttling of No. 9 USC|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford's 55 points was the highest number of points any team had scored against a USC Trojans football team in the 121-year history of Trojan football.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times USC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/11/14/sports/AP-FBC-College-Football-Today.html|title=College Football Today|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=November 14, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 55 points included three Toby Gerhart touchdown runs and one by Andrew Luck. Richard Sherman returned an interception of a [[Matt Barkley]] fourth-quarter pass to spark a 27-point fourth quarter to put away the Trojans and keep the Cardinal's slim [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] hopes alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293180030|title=

This was Stanford's third victory against USC in their last five games against each other at the Coliseum (Stanford winning 2001, [[2007 Stanford vs. Southern California football game|2007]], and 2009, with USC winning in 2003 and 2005).

Both teams faced each other in the 112th Big Game with seven wins each, the first time this had happened since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/news?slug=ap-t25-california-stanford&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=No. 14 Stanford flying high into Big Game vs. Cal |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cardinal had scored a combined 106 points in two previous games against higher ranked opponents, with consecutive upsets over Oregon and USC, two teams which had blown out Cal 42-3 and 30-3, respectively. Cal also played its second game without star running back [[Jahvid Best]], again starting backup Shane Vereen.

The Cardinal scored on their first possession when Toby Gerhart broke free on the game's third play for a 61-yard touchdown. After successfully blocking a punt, which gave Stanford field position on the Cal 19 yard line, Gerhart scored again on a 2-yard run. The Bears responded with a scoring drive of their own that resulted in a field goal. In the second quarter, a Cal drive was halted when Richard Sherman intercepted [[Kevin Riley]] deep in Stanford territory. The Cardinal were unable to capitalize on the turnover however, and the Bears went on a five minute scoring drive that saw Vereen score his first touchdown of the game on a 1-yard run with just over a minute left in the quarter to make it 14-10 Stanford at the half.

Cal took its first lead in the third quarter with a 92 yard scoring drive resulting in a 4 yard run by Vereen. Stanford was able to move downfield in turn, but missed a 45 yard field goal. The Bears marched downfield again and scored on a 3 yard run by Vereen. Stanford responded on the ensuing possession by scoring on a 1 yard run by Gerhart. The Bears in turn scored in the beginning of the fourth quarter with a 12 yard pass from Riley to Marvin Jones. Midway through the quarter, the Cardinal put together an 87 yard touchdown drive which resulted in Gerhart getting his fourth score of the game on a 5 yard run. After getting the ball back with just under 4 minutes left in the game, Stanford attempted a [[fourth down conversion]] which failed. The Bears took possession on the Stanford 23 yard line, but ended up settling for a field goal, making the score 34-28 and giving the Cardinal a chance to win with more than two and a half minutes left if they could score a touchdown. Stanford started out with good field position at its 42 yard line and was able to drive down to the Cal 13 yard line. Cal linebacker Mike Mohammed saved the game for the Bears when he intercepted Cardinal quarterback Andrew Luck, allowing Riley to take three straight [[Quarterback kneel|knees]] and Cal to retain the [[Stanford Axe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/boxscore?gid=200911210063&amp;page=plays |title=California 34, Stanford 28 - Play by Play |publisher=Yahoo!

The loss, as well as a double overtime win later in the day by [[2009 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] over [[2009 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona]], eliminated Stanford from [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] contention and the possibility of sharing the Pac-10 conference title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap;_ylt=AqPP8uBjpqaNpxLQwK_fdI4cvrYF?gid=200911210063 |title=Cal beats No. 14 Stanford 34-28 in Big Game |publisher=Yahoo!

In a nationally televised game, the Cardinal scored a last-minute touchdown to defeat the Fighting Irish 45â38. Cardinal running back Toby Gerhart made a strong statement for [[Heisman Trophy]] consideration, rushing for 205 yards and three touchdowns and throwing his first career touchdown pass to Ryan Whalen. The win was Stanford's first in the annual series since 2001. Notre Dame lost its sixth of the season, all six of which have been by a touchdown or less. Notre Dame quarterback [[Jimmy Clausen]] threw for 340 yards and five touchdowns, three to [[Golden Tate]] and two to [[Michael Floyd]]. The game was [[Charlie Weis]]'s final game as head coach of Notre Dame; he was fired the following Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293320024|title=

Stanford made its first bowl appearance since 2001 without starting quarterback [[Andrew Luck]], who was sidelined due to a broken finger. [[Tavita Pritchard]], who hadn't started a game at quarterback since the [[2008 Stanford Cardinal football team|2008 season]], played the entire game, and was 8 for 19 with two interceptions as the Sooners outlasted the Cardinal 31â27. Toby Gerhart, who had finished second in the closest [[Heisman Trophy]] race ever a few weeks earlier, ran for 135 on 32 carries and scored two touchdowns for Stanford. Meanwhile, Sooners wide receiver [[Ryan Broyles]] set a Sun Bowl record with three touchdown receptions and was named Sun Bowl MVP. Broyles had 156 yards receiving and set Oklahoma's single-game record with 13 receptions from quarterback [[Landry Jones]], who passed for 418 yards overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=293650024|title=Broyles' 3 TDs set Sun Bowl record as Sooners sink Cardinal|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
