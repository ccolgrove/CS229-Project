'''Office Genuine Advantage''' (OGA) was a program by [[Microsoft]] similar to [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] (WGA) which required users of the [[Microsoft Office]] software to validate their copy of [[Microsoft Office]] to download non-critical updates and other downloads such as addons, samples etc. 

This is different from [[Product activation]] in that activation is required to use the software and is enforced at the software level, whereas validation permits users to download files and updates from the Microsoft web site and is Internet-based. Validation rejects those product keys that have either been leaked widely or those which have been key-generated to pass through activation but not validation. Office Genuine Advantage covers Office XP, Office 2003, Office 2007 and the 2010 Microsoft Office System.

As of January 30, 2007, users of Office Update are required to validate the legitimacy of their Office software in order to download files and updates (but you can bypass it somehow).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,127678-pg,1-RSS,RSS/article.html PC World - Business Center: If You Dislike Microsoft's Windows Antipiracy Checks, Look Out&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2008, Microsoft released Office Genuine Advantage Notifications to [[Windows Server Update Services]] as KB949810.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/Genuine/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3193521&amp;SiteID=25 Questions Regarding KB949810]&lt;/ref&gt; The package is shown as &quot;Needed&quot; for client computers with [[Microsoft Office]] XP, 2003, 2007 or 2010 installed and is not removable after installation (but you can remove it by searching for a remover online).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The notifications can be avoided by renaming/deleting three (or only two) files (OGAAddin.dll, OGACheckControl.dll and OGAEXEC.exe) in the directory C:\WINDOWS\system32. The file OGAAddin.dll can be left, as it alone doesn't cause the notifications.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

It can also be uninstalled from either the [[command prompt]] or [[run command]] using the command: [[msiexec]] /X{B2544A03-10D0-4E5E-BA69-0362FFC20D18}

In a post on Sunday, Dec. 19, 2010, Ed Bott's Microsoft report noted that OGA had been retired by Microsoft, as of Dec. 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/microsoft-quietly-shuts-down-office-genuine-advantage-program/2798 Ed Bott's Microsoft Report @ ZDnet]&lt;/ref&gt;
