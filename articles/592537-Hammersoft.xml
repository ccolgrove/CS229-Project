The '''Premier Division''' is the top division of the '''[[Northern Premier League]]'''. It is at Step 3 (or level 7) of the [[National League System]], placing it six divisions below the [[Premier League]]. For sponsorship reasons, it is often referred to as the '''Evo-Stik League Premier Division'''.

The league was founded in [[1968 in football (soccer)|1968]], as the northern equivalent of the [[Southern League (football)|Southern League]], being the highest level [[Non-League football|non-League]] division below [[The Football League]]. In [[1979 in football (soccer)|1979]], upon the creation of the [[Football Conference|Alliance Premier League]], it became a feeder league and fell down one 'level' in the [[English football league system]]. Since then, its prestige has fallen further: there are now two levels between it and the Football League.

The division is at the same level as the Premier Divisions of the [[Southern League Premier Division|Southern League]] and the [[Isthmian League Premier Division|Isthmian League]]. At the end of each season two clubs are promoted to the [[Conference North]]: the league champions, and the winners of a play-off competition held between the 2nd through 5th placed clubs. The four lowest placed teams are relegated to the [[Northern Premier League Division One North]] or [[Northern Premier League Division One South]], to be replaced by four promoted teams.

All clubs from the Premier Division also compete in the [[Northern Premier League Challenge Cup|NPL Challenge Cup]] and the [[Peter Swales Shield]] knockout competition, but not in the other two NPL cup competitions (the [[Northern Premier League President's Cup|President's Cup]] and the [[Northern Premier League Chairman's Cup|Chairman's Cup]]). Before 2007â08 Premier Division teams did compete in the Chairman's Cup.
