'''NEN''' is an [[Australia]]n [[television station]] licensed to, and serving northern [[New South Wales]].

==History==
'''NEN9''' [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]/Upper [[Namoi River|Namoi]] commenced transmissions on 10 April 1965, with a relay in [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] (NEN1, later NEN10) on 15 July 1966. ECN8 [[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]]/[[Manning River]] began on 27 May 1966.

During 1968â69, ECN8 who at the time were facing financial difficulties approached [[NBN Television|NBN3 Newcastle]] to take the station over but the proposal was rejected by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board.   An approach was also made to [[NRN|NRN11 Coffs Harbour]] but an agreement could not be reached.  Finally, ECN approached NEN with an agreement for ECN to carry a relay broadcast of NEN's programming from the end of March 1969.   In November 1971, ECN merged with NEN, but continued to use the callsign ECN into the mid 1980s.

During the 1970s and early 1980s NEN9 was a member of the ''Great Eastland Television'' partnership with [[NRN|NRN11 Coffs Harbour]] and [[RTQ|SDQ4 Warwick, Queensland]], sharing programming and advertising.   From 1981 until 1989 the station branded itself 9-8 Television, referencing the channel numbers of both their Tamworth and Taree broadcasts.

Prime Television purchased the station in 1989, rebranding the station ''Prime Television'' and aligning it with the [[Seven Network]], similarly to [[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN]] in southern New South Wales, whilst changing ECN's call sign to NEN. At the commencement of Northern NSW market [[Regional television in Australia#Aggregation|Aggregation]] on 31 December 1991, Prime Television became the Northern NSW affiliate of the [[Seven Network]], in competition with [[NRN|NRTV]] (now [[Southern Cross Ten]]) and [[NBN Television|NBN]].

==Prime7 News==
NEN produces and broadcasts a 30-minute ''Prime7 News'' bulletins for the Tamworth and North Coast regional markets, broadcast each weeknight at 6pm presented by Elspeth Taylor.

In the Newcastle and Central Coast market, short two-minute updates are presented on a rotating basis by Natalie Forrest and Renee Bogatko with weather forecasts from Daniel Gibson and Madelaine Collignon. Weekend weather forecasts for the Newcastle and Tamworth regions are presented by Craig Moore.

It is expected that towards late 2010 and early 2011, news bulletins for the Tamworth and North Coast markets will move to Prime7's Canberra headquarters.
