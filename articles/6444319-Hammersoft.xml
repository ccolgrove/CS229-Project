In the ''[[Stargate]]'' [[fictional universe]], the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], also known as the Alterans and Lanteans, are the most advanced race known to have existed, having evolved millions of years prior to the present day and reaching their level of technology long before Human life evolved on Earth.

This is a list of the '''Ancient characters''' that have appeared so far in ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.

==Ayiana==
[[Ona Grauer]] played '''Ayiana''', the first living Ancient that modern-day humans encounter. She was left behind on the Ancient outpost in [[Antarctica]] between five and ten million years ago when her people took the city of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]]. She is seen in the opening of the Pilot episode of Stargate: Atlantis as the Ancients leave Earth for the Pegasus Galaxy.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Rising (Stargate Atlantis)|Rising]]&quot; (''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers unearth her in a block of ice millions of years later in &quot;[[Frozen (Stargate SG-1)|Frozen]]&quot;, naming her after the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] word for &quot;eternal bloom&quot; (the character's true name is never revealed). Ayiana proves alive when they defrost her, and learns the [[English language]] within hours. SG-1 deduce that the Ancients are advanced humans who evolved (not necessarily on Earth) millions of years ago and spawned [[humans]] throughout the [[Milky Way]] as their second evolution. As Ayiana is the unwitting carrier of the disease that ravaged her people millions of years ago, Ayiana infects all of the researchers, SG-1 and Dr. Fraiser. Ayiana uses her abilities to heal them, but weakened from the process, dies back at the SGC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frozen&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Frozen (Stargate SG-1)|Frozen]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; It becomes known three years later that Ayiana's virus bears similarities to the biological weapon created by the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Powers That Be&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Powers That Be (Stargate SG-1)|The Powers That Be]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ganos Lal/Morgan le Fay==
[[Sarah Strange]] played '''Ganos Lal''', an [[Ascension (Stargate)|ascended]] [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] who gave rise to the [[Arthurian legend]] of '''[[Morgan le Fay]]'''. In the ''Stargate'' mythology, she was originally an inhabitant of the Ancient city of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], where a holographic learning program based on her image taught Lantean children about Ancient technology, history and science. When it became clear that the Ancients had been defeated by the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]], she fled back to [[Tau'ri|Earth]] with the other surviving Ancients and secluded herself in meditation until her ascension. When fellow ascended Ancient [[Moros (Stargate)|Moros]] (Merlin, Myrddin) descended in order to construct a weapon to fight the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] that could be used against the Ancients themselves, Morgan le Fay was assigned to watch him and, if necessary, prevent his completion of the weapon. Like Myrddin, she eventually came to believe that the Ori could some day become a threat to the Ancients themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot; /&gt; Morgan eventually found the Sangraal and followed her orders to destroy the weapon. Having come to believe in the threat the Ori posed, She hid Merlin in stasis knowing that some day he may be needed to recreate the weapon, so kept him in an Ancient suspension pod on a planet where he would be safe. She then went about creating the legend of the Sangraal on the planet which would lead to Merlin along with Ancient riddles and challenges for anyone who went looking for the original weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quest&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[SG-1]] comes to Atlantis to search for Myrddin's weapon in &quot;[[The Pegasus Project]]&quot;, Morgan le Fay decides to covertly help [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] by posing as her own hologram. Daniel Jackson and Vala recognize her as an ascended Ancient and push her to reveal more information, but Morgan le Fay hesitates. The moment she attempts to give more information about Myrddin's weapon, her Ascended peers stop her in mid-sentence, &quot;Merlin's weapon is not...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Pegasus Project (Stargate SG-1)|The Pegasus Project]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan is banished by the Others, but she helps SG-1 in the Ori galaxy in ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth|The Ark of Truth]]''. She heals Teal'c when he lays dying and appears before Daniel in the form of Merlin after he has been tortured by a Prior. He sees through her disguise, which she then drops. She says she has done everything to help them that she can (presumably she is more free to act as the Ancients aren't in the Ori galaxy) and tells Daniel how to use the Ark to stop the Ori crusade once and for all. Morgan gives Vala the sequence to activate the Ark, and engages Adria in battle when the Ark has greatly diminished Adria's power down to the same level as any Ascended being.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth|The Ark of Truth]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==&lt;span id=&quot;Moros&quot;/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Merlin&quot;/&gt;Moros/Myrddin/Merlin==
Played by [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]], '''Moros''', also known as '''Myrddin''' or '''Merlin''', was the High Councilor of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] during the days of the first siege of the city, and one of the most influential Ancients in the series. Although most of his backstory is revealed through story reconstruction, Myrddin appears several times before SG-1 finally meet him in person. Myrddin is introduced in the ''Atlantis'' episode &quot;[[Before I Sleep (Stargate Atlantis)|Before I Sleep]]&quot;, where an alternate [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]] meets him as Moros when he was still living on Atlantis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Before I Sleep&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Before I Sleep (Stargate Atlantis)|Before I Sleep]]&quot; (''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; A visual record of him still remains in the Atlantis database.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot; /&gt; Myrddin also appears as a Merlin [[hologram]] to SG-1, giving them information about his background and his motivations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avalon&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Camelot&quot; /&gt; Moros is named after [[Moros]] from Greek legend, the personification of impending doom and destruction, while his name [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] refers to the [[Arthurian legend]]. Matthew Walker was nominated for a [[Leo Award]] in 2007 for &quot;Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series&quot; for this role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908022/awards Matthew Walker (I) - Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] threat forced the Ancient inhabitants to return to Earth, Myrddin chose to seclude himself in meditation and learned to [[Ascension (Stargate)|ascend]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot; /&gt; When he became convinced that the ascended [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] had become a threat to the humans in the Milky Way and even the Ancients, he chose to become human again while retaining most of the knowledge and powers he had gained through his ascension. Myrddin entrusted his secrets to a small number of noblemen on Earth, among them [[King Arthur]]. During this time, Myrddin also carved a tablet with an Ancient cipher leading to [[Avalon]], which set the events of seasons 9 and 10 of ''SG-1'' in motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avalon&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon Myrddin sought to construct to defeat the Ori became known as the ''[[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]]'', ''Blood Stone'' or ''[[Holy Grail]]''. However, the Ancients did not support his research to design weapons that could eventually be used against them, and sent the ascended Ancient [[Morgan le Fay (Stargate)|Morgan le Fay]] to watch him.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot; /&gt; Myrddin therefore constructed a dimension-shifting device known as [[Ancient technology in Stargate#&quot;Arthur's Mantle&quot;|Arthur's Mantle]] to conceal his work from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arthur's Mantle&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Arthur's Mantle (Stargate SG-1)|Arthur's Mantle]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; In this device he hid the address of a planet where he supposedly hid the weapon, [[Camelot]], and left more clues about the location of the Sangraal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camelot&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

On their search for the Sangraal, SG-1 finally find Myrddin in stasis in &quot;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest]]&quot; and awaken him. Myrddin attempts to build the Sangraal, but his body has deteriorated too much during the 1,000&amp;nbsp;years of stasis that he transfers his consciousness into a modified [[Repository of the Ancients|Repository of Knowledge]] for Daniel Jackson to use to complete the task. Myrddin dies shortly after reconfiguring the device,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quest&quot; /&gt; but his consciousness remains in Daniel Jackson. Merlin and Jackson hatch a plot to complete the Sangraal. Shortly after Jackson deploys the Sangraal to the Ori home galaxy through a [[Supergate]], the pre-programmed restoration Merlin encoded into Jackson's DNA activated, restoring Jackson to a state before he looked into the repository, destroying Merlin's consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Shroud&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Shroud (Stargate SG-1)|The Shroud]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oma Desala==
Played by [[Carla Boudreau]] and [[Mel Harris]], '''Oma Desala''' (&quot;Mother Nature&quot;) is an [[Ascension (Stargate)|ascended]] being who goes against the ways of the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. It is unclear if she is an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] herself, as the Ancients [[Orlin]] and [[Moros (Stargate)|Merlin]] give different accounts of knowing Oma but it is likely as Merlin has a knowledge of her actions and he's over ten thousand years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascension&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quest, Part II&quot;&gt;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest, Part II]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Although Oma once made the great mistake of helping the fallen [[System Lord]] [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] ascend and is now banished by the Ancients,&lt;ref name=&quot;Threads&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Oma is still convinced of her responsibility to guide those beneath to the &quot;Great Path&quot; of enlightenment, even if this interferes in the lower planes of existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascension&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Ascension (Stargate SG-1)|Ascension]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; She and her followers walk a fine line between going against the wishes of the other Ancients and maintaining their rules enough to not bring down their wrath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Full Circle&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Full Circle (Stargate SG-1)|Full Circle]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Oma therefore only guides individuals to the path, leaving the final decision to travel the great path to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meridian&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Meridian (Stargate SG-1)|Meridian]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SG-1]] first encounter Oma Desala in a Buddhist-style temple on the planet Kheb in their search for [[Shifu (Stargate)|Shifu]], the young son of [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] and [[Sha're]]. When a group of [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] attacks the temple, Oma Desala protects SG-1 and the temple in her non-corporeal form. Daniel decides to leave Shifu in Oma's care,&lt;ref name=&quot;Maternal Instinct&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Maternal Instinct (Stargate SG-1)|Maternal Instinct]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; and she ages Shifu to the state of a young boy within one year and teaches him to suppress his evil [[Goa'uld]] genetic memory. Shifu eventually ascends with her help.&lt;ref name=&quot;Absolute Power&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Absolute Power (Stargate SG-1)|Absolute Power]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Over a year later, Oma helps Daniel Jackson to ascend after his fatal radiation poisoning at the end of season 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meridian&quot; /&gt; At the end of season 6, Oma helps [[Skaara]] and the entire [[Abydonians (Stargate)|Abydonian]] population to ascend after [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]]'s attack, but she prevents Daniel from using his ascended powers against Anubis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Full Circle&quot; /&gt; 

As Daniel broke the ascendeds' rules, Oma is forced to de-ascend him and to take away his memories (his idea) and abandon him naked on a planet (her idea).&lt;ref name=&quot;Homecoming&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Homecoming (Stargate SG-1)|Homecoming]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; However, it later appears that Oma did not completely strip away Jackson's memories, but did in fact bury them deep in his subconscious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reckoning&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Oma Desala appears one final time to Daniel Jackson almost two years later in &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot;. Oma brings Jackson, who was killed another time, to an intermediate level between ascension and mortal existence and again attempts to convince him to ascend. After ascending Daniel for a second time, however, Oma sacrifices herself to enter into an eternal battle with Anubis to prevent him from wreaking further havoc on the galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threads&quot; /&gt;

According to Merlin, Oma focuses on the individual when she helps them out and while she has the best of intentions, Merlin counters this by saying so did the Ori when they started out.

==Orlin==
'''Orlin''', played by [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], is an outcast [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]]. He was forced to remain on the dead planet [[Velona]] for breaking the rules of the Ancients by giving advanced technology to the planet's people, who immediately abused it. When [[SG-1]] research the weapon in &quot;[[Ascension (Stargate SG-1)|Ascension]]&quot;, Orlin is immediately taken with Major Carter and leaves the planet with SG-1, concealed in an [[invisibility|invisible]] form. He shows himself to Carter the next morning at her house, but no-one at the SGC believes Carter's story. Orlin later informs Carter of his backstory, and returns to his former human state in the hope of spending the rest of his life with her, giving up his powers as an ascended. When the [[NID (Stargate)|NID]] eventually moves in on Carter's house weeks later, Orlin escapes through a [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] that he has built in Carter's basement. Back at Velona, Orlin attempts to stop the Tau'ri research of the weapon and is shot by a member of SG-16. The Ancients believe him redeemed and re-ascend him, allowing him to prevent another catastrophe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascension&quot; /&gt;

Orlin returns in the form of a human child (played by [[Cameron Bright]]) in &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot;. He chose this form as it is able to retain a fraction of the knowledge of the Ancients. He tells the SGC of the feud between Ancients and [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], false promises of ascension and [[Origin (Stargate)|Origin]], and how the Ori gain power. He succeeds in developing a line of research into a cure for the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] plague, but as his gambit with taking a child's form fails, he quickly loses his memory, suffers significant brain damage from holding on that long and is eventually interned in a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minor characters==
* &lt;span id=Amelius /&gt; '''Amelius''' (played by [[Fabrice Grover]]) is an Ancient scientist in ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''. It is implied that he is the original inventor of the Stargate system, a schematic for a Stargate in his notebook and comments &quot;I had the most amazing idea last night...&quot; and the Ark of Truth. It is implied that Amelius (possibly with help from others) created the Ark in order to brainwash people into believing the truth, that is, that the Ori are not gods. He is stopped first by other Ancients.
* &lt;span id=&quot;Aurora Captain&quot; /&gt; The '''Aurora Captain''' (played by [[Bruce Dawson]]) is the captain of the [[Aurora class battleship|Ancient warship]] ''[[Aurora (Stargate)|Aurora]]'' during the last days of the war with the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. As revealed in &quot;[[Aurora (Stargate Atlantis)|Aurora]]&quot;, he lived in the ship's stasis pod for ten thousand years until a Wraith gained access to the [[virtual reality]] they were experiencing. The Captain activates the ship's self destruct sequence and asks Sheppard and his team to keep the memory of the ''Aurora'' and its valiant crew alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurora&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Aurora (Stargate Atlantis)|Aurora]]&quot; (''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;span id=&quot;Chaya Sar&quot; /&gt; '''Chaya Sar''' (played by [[Leonor Varela]]), is an ascended Ancient living secluded on Proculus in the Pegasus Galaxy, where she poses as the [[human]] high priestess of '''Athar'''. Sheppard allows her to accompany them back to Atlantis in the hopes of using her planet as a sanctuary for refugees in &quot;[[Sanctuary (Stargate Atlantis)|Sanctuary]]&quot;. Chaya learns about the spiritual beliefs of the peoples of Earth and eventually takes a liking to Major Sheppard. McKay's discovery of her true identity coincides with a [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] attack on Proculus. Chaya Sar returns to her planet, using her powers to destroy the Wraith in orbit. She later tells Sheppard that after she first ascended, she used her powers to destroy attacking [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. The other Ancients punished her for intervening with the human plane of existence by ostracizing her and limiting her protection only to the inhabitants of Proculus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sanctuary&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Sanctuary (Stargate Atlantis)|Sanctuary]]&quot; (''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;span id=&quot;Helia&quot; /&gt; '''Helia''' (played by [[Megan Leitch]]) was the Captain of the Ancient warship [[Aurora class battleship#Tria|''Tria'']], during the last days of their war with the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. Her name is based on [[Helia]], daughter of the [[sun]] god [[Helios]] in [[Greek mythology]]. The ''[[Daedalus (Stargate)|Daedalus]]'' locates her ship thousands of years later in the episode &quot;[[The Return (Stargate Atlantis)|The Return]]&quot;, finding the crew still alive because of the relativistic effects of travelling at 99.9% the speed of light.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Return&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Return (Stargate Atlantis)|The Return]]&quot; (''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;span id=&quot;Hippaforalkus&quot; /&gt; '''Hippaforalkus''' is an Ancient general after whom the ''[[Orion (Stargate)|Orion]]'' was originally named. Hippaforalkus's name is only mentioned in &quot;[[Inferno (Stargate Atlantis)|Inferno]]&quot;.
* &lt;span id=&quot;Janus&quot; /&gt; '''Janus''' (played by Gildart Jackson) is an Ancient scientist who lived during the first siege of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] by the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago. He is named to imply that he is the being after whom [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]], the two-faced [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god that represented time and change was named. Against the orders of the Atlantean High Council, Janus created a [[time travel|time machine]] and integrated it into a [[Puddle Jumper (Stargate)|Puddle Jumper]]. An alternate Elizabeth Weir, who accidentally travels back through time in &quot;[[Before I Sleep (Stargate Atlantis)|Before I Sleep]]&quot;, encounters Janus and asks for help, but the Atlantean Council is unwilling to risk damage to the timeline. Janus disobeys his superiors and helps Weir to remain behind in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] so that she can aid her future self saving the city. Before he leaves with his fellow Ancients to Earth, he is hopeful to build another Puddle Jumper capable of [[time travel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Before I Sleep&quot; /&gt; Such a Puddle Jumper is eventually found by [[SG-1]] in the [[Milky Way galaxy]] in &quot;[[It's Good to Be King (Stargate SG-1)|It's Good to Be King]]&quot;&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;It's Good to Be King&quot;&gt;&quot;[[It's Good to Be King (Stargate SG-1)|It's Good to Be King]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; and actually used in &quot;[[Moebius (Stargate SG-1)|Moebius]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moebius&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Moebius (Stargate SG-1)|Moebius]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Janus was also responsible for the creation of the [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Other 3|Attero Device]] in his secret lab that was cleverly hidden in Atlantis. The device projects interference into subspace, rendering [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] hyperspace unstable. Any Wraith ship entering hyperspace is ripped apart. He abandoned the project when he discovered a side effect : energy begins to build up in any open gate, and prevents any attempts at shutting the gate down. Once the buildup of energy reaches a critical level, the naquadah that makes up the gate explodes, causing massive devastation.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Lost Tribe&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Lost Tribe (Stargate Atlantis)|The Lost Tribe]]&quot; (''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;span id=&quot;Melia&quot; /&gt; '''Melia''' (played by [[Melia McClure]]) was a member of the [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantean]] High Council during the first siege of Atlantis some ten millennia ago. She is first seen as a hologram in &quot;[[Rising (Stargate Atlantis)|Rising]]&quot;, describing the history of the Ancients in the Pegasus Galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising&quot; /&gt; In the episode &quot;[[Before I Sleep (Stargate Atlantis)|Before I Sleep]]&quot;, Melia explains the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] siege of Atlantis to an alternate version of [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]], who travelled back through time. While sympathetic to Weir and Janus, Melia agrees with the other members of the council to not send Dr. Weir back to her own time. Melia is last seen returning to Earth through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] with her fellow Ancients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Before I Sleep&quot; /&gt;
* &lt;span id=&quot;Trebal&quot; /&gt; '''Trebal''' (played by [[Pascale Hutton]]) was the first officer of the [[Aurora class battleship|Ancient warship]] ''Aurora'' during the last days of her people's war with the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. As revealed in &quot;[[Aurora (Stargate Atlantis)|Aurora]]&quot;, she lived in the ship's stasis pod for ten thousand years, where she experienced a [[virtual reality]]. She was eventually killed by an invading Wraith who assumed her identity to trick the ship's crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aurora&quot; /&gt;
