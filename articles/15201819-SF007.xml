The ''' Cloudbook''' is an [[x86]] [[subnotebook]], or [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] developed by [[Everex]] using a [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] processor, chipset, and [[NanoBook]] reference design. It competes with the [[ASUS Eee PC]], the [[OLPC XO-1]] and the [[Classmate PC]]. The device is categorized as a [[netbook]].

==History==
Sales of the cost effective gPC TC2502 Everex desktop&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/13/wal-mart-sells-out-of-the-200-linux-gpc Wal-Mart sells out of the $200 Linux gPC â Engadget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; left the company with inquiries from customers seeking similar additional Open Source, but mobile platforms. Everex decided to build two systems, a classic laptop, also running gOS v2, called the [[Everex green computers#gBook|gBook]], and a system based on the VIA [[Nanobook]] reference design, which is also used for [[Packard Bell]] EasyNote XS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=190236 Packard Bell Easynote XS20 â Notebook Forums and Laptop Discussion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its release was originally planned for January 25, 2008, but Everex pushed the release back citing problems with the version of [[gOS (operating system)|gOS]] it wanted to use. The delay was needed because Everex wanted to rewrite gOS v2 for the CloudBook so it would use [[GNOME]]'s [[window manager]] instead of [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment 17]], making it even more compatible with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. The E17's Dock was replaced by the [[Avant Window Navigator]] to approach the same looks and functionality as the older gOS  versions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zareason.com Site explaining the rumor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/24070 Message at tuxmachines about the gOS on gnome rumour&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cafelinux.org/gosforum/index.php/topic,308.msg1351/topicseen.html#msg1351 conformation by the development team to use Gnome&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloudbook was expected to be released in the United States of America on February 15, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=networking_and_internet&amp;articleId=9059060&amp;taxonomyId=16 computerworld.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.everex.com/ Everex website announcing the new launchdate of February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Wal-Mart]] and ZaReason, but was pushed back to February 21 for Wal-Mart (ZaReason received a part of its shipment). The price of the device was set to US$399 and it comes with one year of limited [[warranty]] with [[24/7]] [[toll free]] [[technical support]].

== Features ==
The Everex Cloudbook has a uniquely located built-in pointing device (a stamp-sized [[touchpad]]) on the upper right side of the computer instead of at the bottom of the keyboard as is common for notebook computers. The design of the Cloudbook is intended so it can be held in one hand while typing, or in two hands when using the mouse-cursor control, with the left thumb controlling the two &quot;mouse buttons&quot;, and the right thumb the small trackpad, both mousepad and keys are placed directly under the screen. This design was chosen so the system could even be used when standing and walking around, instead of only when sitting. The CloudBook is sold as an [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] (UMPC) because of this feature, even though it does not have a [[touch-screen]]. There are plans to release a version with a touch-screen in the future. 

== Software ==
The CloudBook comes with a completely new version, (compared to the version used in the [[Everex green computers#gPC|gPC]]) of the gOS [[Linux distribution]] (based on Ubuntu) and application software from [[Mozilla]], [[Skype]], [[Facebook]], [[faqly]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thinkgos.com/features.html gOS â Features web apps on a desktop&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[OpenOffice.org]] and [[Google]]. Originally gOS came with the [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] 0.17 as the [[window manager]], but the new CloudBook version V2 &quot;Rocket&quot; will be based on [[GNOME]] .  Though the pre-installed operating system is gOS, Everex has released Windows XP hardware drivers, making it more simple to install Microsoft's Windows XP.  However, Everex warns that any software outside of the original gOS will not be covered by warranty (though the hardware's warranty will be unaffected).

== Cloudbook MAX ==
The next generation of CloudBook, when available in 2009, was said to have a processor running at 1.6 GHz, a 80GB harddrive, touchpad and WiMAX. However the company has ceased operations and therefore this version is unlikely to ever be released. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everex.com/products/cloudbook_max/cloudbook_max.htm Everex â The Alternative PC Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
