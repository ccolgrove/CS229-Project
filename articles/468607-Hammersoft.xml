'''Constantine''' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ³ÙØ·ÙÙØ©}}, ''{{transl|ar|Qusaná¹­Ä«nah}}'', also spelled ''Qasentina'' also spelled as Kasantina) is the capital of [[Constantine Province]] in north-eastern [[Algeria]]. It was the capital of the same-named [[Constantine (dÃ©partement)|French dÃ©partement]] until 1962. Slightly inland, it is about 80 kilometres from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of Rhumel river. Regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the centre of its region, Constantine has a population of 448,374 (1,000,000 with the agglomeration), making it the third largest city in the country after [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]]. There are museums and important historical sites around the city (one of the most beautiful one is the Palais du Bey, in the casbah)

==History==
The city was originally created by the [[Phoenicia]]ns, who called it Sarim Batim (royal city). Later it was named [[Cirta]], which in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] means a city carved into the rock. The city was taken over by [[Numidia]], the country of the [[Berber people]], after the Phoenicians were defeated by Rome in the [[Third Punic War]]. In 112 BC the city was occupied by [[Jugurtha]] who defeated his half-brother Adherbal. The city later served as the base for Roman generals [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus]] and [[Gaius Marius]] in their war against Jugurtha. Later, with the removal of King [[Juba I of Numidia|Juba I]] and the remaining supporters of [[Pompey]] in Africa (c. 46), [[Julius Caesar]] gave special rights to the citizens of Cirta, now known as Colonia Sittlanorum.

In 311, during the civil war between emperor [[Maxentius]] and usurper [[Domitius Alexander]] (a former governor of Africa), the city was destroyed. Rebuilt in 313, it was subsequently named after emperor [[Constantine the Great]], who had defeated Maxentius. Conquered by the  [[Vandals]] in 432, Constantine returned to the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Africa]] (''i.e.'' North Africa) from 534 to 697. It was conquered by the Arabs in the 7th century, receiving the name of ''Qusantina''.

The city recovered and in 12th century was again a prosperous market, with connection to [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]. Since 1529 it was intermittently part of [[Ottoman Empire]], ruled by a Turkish [[bey]] (governor) subordinate to the [[dey]] of [[Algiers]]. [[Salah Bey]], who ruled the city in 1770â1792, greatly embellished it and built much of the Muslim architecture still visible today.

In 1826 the last Bey, [[Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed ChÃ©rif]], became the new head of state. He led a fierce resistance against French forces, which invaded Algeria four years later. By 13 October 1837, the territory was reconquered by France, and from 1848 on until 1962 it was an integral part of the French motherland and centre of the Constantine DÃ©partement.

In World War II, during the campaign in North Africa (1942â43), Constantine and the nearby city of [[SÃ©tif]] were used by the Allied forces as operational bases.

==Geography==
Constantine is situated on a plateau at {{convert|640|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. The city is very picturesque with a number of bridges over Rhumel river and a [[viaduct]] crossing the ravine.  The ravine is crossed by four bridges, including [[Pont Sidi M'Cid]]. Constantine is the railhead of a prosperous and diverse agricultural area. It also a centre of the grain trade and has flour mills, a tractor factory, and industries producing textiles, wool, linen and leather goods.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Algeria and [[Tunisia]] serve as its markets.
