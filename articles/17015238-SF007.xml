'''Nanorobotics''' is the [[emerging technology]] field of creating machines or [[robot]]s whose components are at or close to the scale of a [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;â9&lt;/sup&gt; meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Vaughn JR. |title= Over the Horizon: Potential Impact of Emerging Trends in Information and Communication Technology on Disability Policy and Practice |journal=[http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2006/emerging_trends.htm National Council on Disability], Washington DC. |pages=1â55 |year=2006}}

Nanomachines are largely in the research-and-development phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wang, J. |title=Can Man-Made Nanomachines Compete with Nature Biomotors? |journal= ACS Nano |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=4â9 |year=2009 |doi=10.1021/nn800829k |pmid=19206241}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some primitive [[molecular machine]]s have been tested. An example is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across, capable of counting specific molecules in a chemical sample. The first useful applications of nanomachines might be in medical technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amrute-Nayak, M., Diensthuber, R.âP., Steffen, W., Kathmann, D., Hartmann, F.âK., Fedorov, R., Urbanke, C., Manstein, D.âJ., Brenner, B., Tsiavaliaris, G. |title=Targeted Optimization of a Protein Nanomachine for Operation in Biohybrid Devices |journal= Angewandte Chemie |volume=122 |issue=2 |pages=322â326 |year=2010 |doi=10.1002/ange.200905200}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be used to identify and destroy cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patel, G. M., Patel, G. C., Patel, R. B., Patel, J. K., Patel, M. |title=Nanorobot: A versatile tool in nanomedicine |journal= Journal of Drug Targeting |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=63â67 |year=2010 |doi=10.1080/10611860600612862 |pmid=16608733}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wang, J. et al .|title= Micromachine Enables Capture and Isolation of Cancer Cells in Complex Media |journal= Angew Chem. Int . Ed. |volume=50 | pages=4161â4165|year=2011 |doi= 10.1002/anie.201100115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals, and the measurement of their concentrations, in the environment. Recently, [[Rice University]] has demonstrated a [[Nanocar|single-molecule car]] developed by a chemical process and including [[buckyballs]] for wheels. It is actuated by controlling the environmental temperature and by positioning a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] tip.

Another definition is a robot that allows precision interactions with nanoscale objects, or can manipulate with nanoscale resolution. Such devices are more related to [[Microscopy]] or [[Scanning probe microscopy]], instead of the description of nanorobots as [[molecular machine]]. Following the microscopy definition even a large apparatus such as an [[atomic force microscope]] can be considered a nanorobotic instrument when configured to perform nanomanipulation. For this perspective, macroscale robots or microrobots that can move with nanoscale precision can also be considered nanorobots.

==Nanorobotics theory==
Since nanorobots would be microscopic in size, it would probably be necessary for very large numbers of them to work together to perform microscopic and macroscopic tasks. These nanorobot swarms, both those incapable of [[Self-replicating machine|replication]] (as in [[utility fog]]) and those capable of unconstrained replication in the natural environment (as in [[grey goo]] and its less common variants{{clarify|date=January 2011|reason=What are these &quot;less common variants&quot; of grey goo? What does &quot;less common&quot; mean anyway in a context of non-existing stuff?}}), are found in many science fiction stories, such as the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] [[Nanoprobe (Star Trek)|nanoprobes]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' and [[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]] episode [[The New Breed (The Outer Limits)|The New Breed]].

Some proponents of nanorobotics, in reaction to the [[grey goo]] scare scenarios that they earlier helped to propagate, hold the view that nanorobots capable of replication outside of a restricted factory environment do not form a necessary part of a purported productive nanotechnology, and that the process of self-replication, if it were ever to be developed, could be made inherently safe. They further assert that their current plans for developing and using molecular manufacturing do not in fact include free-foraging replicators.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.zyvex.com/nanotech/selfRep.html Zyvex: &quot;Self replication and nanotechnology&quot;]
&quot;artificial self replicating systems will only function in carefully controlled artificial environments
...
While self replicating systems are the key to low cost, there is no need (and little desire) to have such systems function in the outside world. Instead, in an artificial and controlled environment they can manufacture simpler and more rugged systems that can then be transferred to their final destination. ... The resulting medical device will be simpler, smaller, more efficient and more precisely designed for the task at hand than a device designed to perform the same function and self replicate. ... A single device able to do [both] would be harder to design and less efficient.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/ &quot;Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development&quot;]
&quot;Autonomous self-replicating assemblers are not necessary to achieve significant manufacturing capabilities.&quot;
&quot;The simplest, most efficient, and safest approach to productive nanosystems is to make specialized nanoscale tools and put them together in factories big enough to make what is needed. ... The machines in this would work like the conveyor belts and assembly robots in a factory, doing similar jobs. If you pulled one of these machines out of the system, it would pose no risk, and be as inert as a light bulb pulled from its socket.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed theoretical discussion of nanorobotics, including specific design issues such as sensing, power communication, navigation, manipulation, locomotion, and onboard computation, has been presented in the medical context of [[nanomedicine]] by [[Robert Freitas]]. Some of these discussions remain at the level of unbuildable generality and do not approach the level of detailed engineering.

==Approaches==
===Biochip===
{{Main|Biochip}}
The joint use of [[nanoelectronics]], [[photolithography]], and new [[biomaterials]] provides a possible approach to manufacturing nanorobots for common medical applications, such as for surgical instrumentation, diagnosis and drug delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fisher, B. |title=Biological Research in the Evolution of Cancer Surgery: A Personal Perspective |journal= Cancer Research |volume=68 |issue=24 |pages=10007â10020 |year=2008 |doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0186 |pmid=19074862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalcanti, A., Shirinzadeh, B., Zhang, M. &amp; Kretly, L.C. |title=Nanorobot Hardware Architecture for Medical Defense |journal= Sensors |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=2932â2958 |year=2008 |doi=10.3390/s8052932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill, C., Amodeo, A., Joseph, J.V. &amp; Patel, H.R.H. |title=Nano- and microrobotics: how far is the reality? |journal= Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=1891â1897 |year=2008 |doi=10.1586/14737140.8.12.1891 |pmid=19046109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method for manufacturing on nanotechnology scale is currently in use in the electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cale, T.S., Lu, J.-Q. &amp; Gutmann, R.J. |title=Three-dimensional integration in microelectronics: Motivation, processing, and thermomechanical modeling |journal=Chemical Engineering Communications |volume=195 |issue=8 |pages=847â888 |year=2008|doi=10.1080/00986440801930302}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, practical nanorobots should be integrated as nanoelectronics devices, which will allow tele-operation and advanced capabilities for medical instrumentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Couvreur, P. &amp; Vauthier, C. |title=Nanotechnology: Intelligent Design to Treat Complex Disease |journal= Pharmaceutical Research |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=1417â1450 |year=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11095-006-0284-8 |pmid=16779701}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elder, J.B., Hoh, D.J., Oh, B.C., Heller, A.C., Liu, C.Y. &amp; Apuzzo, M.L. |title=The future of cerebral surgery: a kaleidoscope of opportunities |journal= Neurosurgery |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=1555â1579 |year=2008 |doi=10.1227/01.neu.0000333820.33143.0d |pmid=18695575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nubots===
{{Main|DNA machine}}

Nubot is an abbreviation for &quot;nucleic acid robots&quot;. Nubots are synthetic robotics devices at the nanoscale. Representative nubots include the several DNA walkers reported by Nadrian Seeman's group at NYU, Niles Pierce's group at Caltech, John Reif's group at Duke University, Chengde Mao's group at Purdue, and [[Andrew Turberfield]]'s group at the University of Oxford.

===Positional nanoassembly===
Nanofactory Collaboration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory Nanofactory]&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in 2000 and involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries, focuses on developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm Positional Diamondoid Molecular Manufacturing]&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at developing positionally-controlled diamond [[mechanosynthesis]] and a [[diamondoid]] nanofactory that would have the capability of building diamondoid medical nanorobots.

===Bacteria based===
This approach proposes the use of biological microorganisms, like the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martel, S., Mohammadi, M., Felfoul, O., Lu, Z., Pouponneau P. &amp; David H. |title=Flagellated Magnetotactic Bacteria as Controlled MRI-trackable Propulsion and Steering Systems for Medical Nanorobots Operating in the Human Microvasculature |journal= International Journal of Robotics Research |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=571â582 |year=2009 |doi=10.1177/0278364908100924 |pmid=19890435 |pmc=2772069}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the model uses a flagellum for propulsion purposes. The use of electromagnetic fields are normally applied to control the motion of this kind of biological integrated device.

===Open technology===
A document with a proposal on nanobiotech development using open technology approaches has been addressed to the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalcanti, A. |title=Nanorobot Invention and Linux: The Open Technology Factor - An Open Letter to UNO General Secretary |journal= CANNXS Project |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1â4 |year=2009 | url=http://www.cannxs.org/open.pdf | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the document sent to the [[UN]], in the same way that [[Open Source]] has in recent years accelerated the development of [[computer systems]], a similar approach should benefit the society at large and accelerate nanorobotics development. The use of [[nanobiotechnology]] should be established as a human heritage for the coming generations, and developed as an open technology based on [[ethical]] practices for [[peace]]ful purposes. Open technology is stated as a fundamental key for such an aim.

===Nanorobot Race===
In the same ways that [[Research and development|technology development]] had the [[space race]] and [[nuclear arms race]], a race for nanorobots is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hede, S., Huilgol, N. |title=&quot;Nano&quot;: The new nemesis of cancer |journal=Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=186â195 |year=2006 |doi=10.4103/0973-1482.29829 |pmid=17998702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Das, S., Gates, A.

and health care.

In such plans, future [[medical nanotechnology]] is expected to employ nanorobots injected into the patient to perform work at a cellular level. Such nanorobots intended for use in medicine should be non-replicating, as replication would needlessly increase device complexity, reduce reliability, and interfere with the medical mission.
