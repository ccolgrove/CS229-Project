[[Jabran Said bin al Qahtani]], [[Sufyian Barhoumi]] and [[Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi]] were captured in a [[al Qaida safe house, Faisalabad|safehouse]] in [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]], together with approximately a dozen other suspects, including a senior member of the [[Al Qaeda]] leadership, [[Abu Zubaydah]].&lt;ref name=CsrtAlShirbi&gt;[{{DoD detainees ARB|Set_30_2048-2144.pdf}} Summarized transcripts (.pdf)], from [[Ghassan Abdallah Ghazi Al Shirbi]]'s''[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]'' - pages 26-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Barhoumi, al Qahtani, and al Sharbi have all tried to decline legal representation.

[[Abdul Zahir (Guantanamo detainee 753)|Abdul Zahir]], the tenth Guantanamo detainee to face charges, was also captured in that Faisalabad safehouse.  

Faisalabad is the home of [[Salafi University]], a religious institution, supported by donations, that provides free room and board to international students â a number of these have been captured on suspicion of being tied to terrorism.

==Hamdan v. Rumsfeld ruling and the Military Commissions Act==
In the summer of 2006 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[United States President]] lacked the [[United States Constitution|constitutional authority]] to set up military commissions.  The Supreme Court ruled that only the [[United States Congress]] had the authority to set up military commissions.  All ten captives who had faced charges before the Presidentially authorized military commissions had those charges dropped.

In the fall of 2006 Congress passed the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]], which authorized commissions similar to those President [[George W. Bush]] had tried to set up.
Just three captives faced charges before the new, Congressionally authorized military commissions.

However, in 2008, the [[Office of Military Commissions]] started to accelerate the pace at which charges were laid.
Over a dozen captives who had not been charged before the Presidentially authorized commissions were charged before the Congressionally authorized commissions.  Subsequently the Office of Military Commissions started to re-charge the captives who had been faced charges during the Presidentially authorized commissions.

==New charges==
On May 29, 2008 charges were laid against Barhoumi, al Qahtani, and al Sharbi.&lt;ref name=MiamiHeraldNewCharges20080529&gt;
