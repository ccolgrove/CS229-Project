While skating as a professional, Babilonia became addicted to amphetamines and alcohol and attempted suicide via an overdose of sleeping pills in the fall of 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;People Magazine p. 159&quot;&gt;People Magazine, May 26, 2008 Vol. 69, No. 20, p. 159: &quot;Together Forever&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving treatment, she returned to the ice.
