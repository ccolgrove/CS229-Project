'''Joseph Robert &quot;Joe&quot; Theismann''' (born September 9, 1949) is a former [[quarterback]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). He achieved his most enduring fame in his 12 seasons playing for the [[Washington Redskins]], where he was a two-time Pro Bowler and quarterback of the winning team in [[Super Bowl XVII]]. He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003.

Following his retirement from football, Theismann began a career as a [[sportscaster]]. He now works for the [[NFL Network]], as a [[color analyst]] on ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', joining play-by-play voice [[Bob Papa]] and [[Matt Millen]].  He also co-hosts the network's weekly show ''[[Playbook (TV series)|Playbook]].'' 

==Early life==
Theismann was born to [[Austrians|Austrian]] Joseph John Theismann who &quot;ran a gas station and worked in his brotherâs liquor store.&quot;&lt;ref name=washingtonian&gt;{{cite web | work=[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]] | url=http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/5845.html | title=Joe Theismann Sounds Off | author=Harry Jaffe| date=2007-12-01| accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His [[Hungary|Hungarian]] mother, Olga Tobias, worked for [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] until her retirement.  Theismann was raised in [[South River, New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;Amdur, Neil.

J., yesterday.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[South River High School (New Jersey)|South River High School]], where he [[Letterman (sports)|lettered]] in [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[high school football|football]].&lt;ref name=washingtonian /&gt;

Theismann was inducted into the [[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]] Hall of Fame in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=[[New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association]] | url=http://www.njsiaa.org/NJSIAA/HOF_years.aspx | title=Hall of Fame Annual Awards, 1997 | year=1997| accessdate=2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theismann was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 39th round of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=[[The Baseball Cube]] | url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/draft/1971/June-Reg/39.shtml | title=1971 Draft Results - Round 39 - The Baseball Cube:}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
Theismann attended and played [[college football]] for the [[University of Notre Dame]].  He became the [[Starting lineup#American football|starter]] as a sophomore, after [[Terry Hanratty]] was injured late in the season.&lt;ref name=cfhof&gt;{{cite web | work=[[College Football Hall of Fame]] | url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=90051 | title=Theismann's College Football Hall of Fame profile | accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the three remaining games in the regular season, he led the Irish to two wins and a tie.  In 1969, Theismann led the Irish to a number five ranking, but lost to the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic#Game results|1970 Cotton Bowl Classic]], 21â17.  The next year, the Irish had a 10â1 record, a number two ranking, and won against Texas in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic#Game results|1971 Cotton Bowl Classic]], 24â11.&lt;ref name=cfhof /&gt;  That year, Theismann was an [[All-America]]n and an [[Academic All-America]], and was in contention for the [[Heisman Trophy]].  Notre Dame publicity man Roger Valdiserri insisted that he change the pronunciation of his name to rhyme with &quot;Heisman&quot;, Theismann recounted later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=America's Game - 1982 Redskins - Joe Theismann |people=Joe Theismann| time=0:40| publisher=NFL.com|date=2007-07-31| format=video |url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-films-americas-game/09000d5d8008f8cb/America-s-Game-1982-Redskins}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he finished second to [[Jim Plunkett]] of [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=washingtonian /&gt;&lt;ref name=cfhof /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Heisman.com| url=http://www.heisman.com/winners/j-plunkett70.php | title=Heisman Winners : 1970 - 36th Award : Jim Plunkett  |year=1970| accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theismann set school records for passing yards in a season (2,429) and touchdowns in a season (16).&lt;ref name=cfhof /&gt;  He also set a school record for passing yards in a game (526) and completions in a game (33) while playing against the [[University of Southern California]] in a torrential downpour in 1970, which they lost 38â28.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web | work=ESPN.com College Football| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1858262 | title=Green, Sanders also among inductees | date=2004-08-12|author=AP|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a starting quarterback, Theismann compiled a 20â3â2 record while throwing for 4,411 yards and 31 touchdowns.&lt;ref name=cfhof /&gt;  His 4,411 passing yards is fifth on Notre Dame's career passing list.&lt;ref name=espn /&gt;

Theismann was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=cfhof /&gt;  He was the eighth Notre Dame quarterback enshrined into the hall, joining former Heisman Trophy winners [[Angelo Bertelli]], [[John Lujack]], and [[Paul Hornung]].&lt;ref name=espn /&gt;

==Professional career==
===Canadian Football League===
Theismann was selected in the fourth round of the [[1971 NFL Draft]] by the [[Miami Dolphins]] and in the 39th round of the [[1971 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the [[Minnesota Twins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Baseball-Reference.com | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/index.cgi?year_ID=1971&amp;round=39&amp;draft_type=junreg | title=Baseball Draft: 39th Round of the 1971 June Draft | accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After prolonged negotiations with the Dolphins failed, Theismann elected to sign with the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] for $50,000 per season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=cfl-scrapbook.no-ip.org | url=http://cfl-scrapbook.no-ip.org/TheismannJoe.php | title=CFL Scrapbook }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his rookie year, Theismann quarterbacked the Argonauts to a 10-4 record, led the league's [[Canadian Football League East Division#Eastern Football Conference .281960-1980.29|Eastern Conference]] in passing statistics and won a berth in the [[Grey Cup]] championship game in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] versus the [[Calgary Stampeders]] ([[59th Grey Cup]]).  A fumble late in the fourth quarter by Argonaut [[running back]] [[Leon McQuay]] close to the goal line cost the Argonauts the Grey Cup.

In [[1971 CFL season|1971]], he completed 148 of 278 passes for 2,440 yards and 17 touchdowns (with 21 interceptions).  His [[1972 CFL season|1972]] season was shortened by injury, but he hit 77 of 127 passes for 1,157 yards and ten touchdowns.  During his last season, [[1973 CFL season|1973]], 157 of his 274 passes were complete, for 2,496 yards and both 13 touchdowns and interceptions.  He was an [[CFL All-Star Game|all-star]] in both 1971 and 1973.

===National Football League===
[[Image:JoeTheismannPractice.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Theismann at practice]]
In [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the [[National Football League]]'s [[Washington Redskins]] obtained Theismann's rights.  Theismann left the CFL and joined the Redskins, where he served as the team's [[punt returner]] during his first season.&lt;ref name=&quot;PFR&quot;&gt;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TheiJo00.htm Joe Theismann NFL &amp; AFL Statistics]. pro-football-reference.com. Pro Football Reference.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1978 NFL season|1978]], Theismann became the Redskins' starting quarterback, succeeding [[Billy Kilmer]].

Theismann led the Redskins to a win in [[Super Bowl XVII]] and an appearance in [[Super Bowl XVIII]] and would go on to set several Redskins franchise records, including most career passing attempts (3,602), most career passing completions (2,044) and most career passing yards (25,206), while also throwing 160 touchdown passes, with 138 interceptions.  On the ground, he rushed for 1,815 yards and 17 touchdowns.  He was named NFL [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] in [[1983 NFL season|1983]] by four organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PFR&quot;/&gt;  He earned the Player of the Game Award in the second of his two [[Pro Bowl]] appearances. Theismann also punted once in his career, for one yard against the [[Chicago Bears]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PFR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UPI (September 30, 1985).

[[Lodi News-Sentinel]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:joetheismannrings.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Theismann's NFL rings (2006)]]
In an era when most quarterbacks had long since used variations of a double-bar facemask (or even triple-bar facemasks) that afforded more protection, Theismann refused to use anything but a [[one-bar facemask]] throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Tim (August 11, 2009). [http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/2102/face-of-the-nfl-is-gone-an-ode-to-the-single-bar Face of the NFL is gone - an ode to the single-bar]. ESPN.go.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Injury====
Theismann's career ended on November 18, [[1985 NFL season|1985]] when he suffered a [[comminuted]] [[compound fracture]] of his leg while being [[quarterback sack|sacked]] by [[New York Giants]] [[linebacker]]s [[Lawrence Taylor]] and [[Harry Carson]] during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game telecast.  The injury was voted the NFL's &quot;Most Shocking Moment in History&quot; by viewers in an [[ESPN]] poll, and the tackle was dubbed &quot;The Hit That No One Who Saw It Can Ever Forget&quot; by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington post&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=The Hit That Changed a Career | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2005-11-18 | author=Leonard Shapiro| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/17/AR2005111701635.html | accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the Redskins had been attempting to run a [[Flea flicker (American football)|&quot;flea-flicker&quot;]] play.  The Giants' defense, however, was not fooled, and they tried to [[blitz (American football)|blitz]] Theismann. As Taylor pulled Theismann down, Taylor's knee came down and drove straight into Theismann's lower right leg, fracturing both the [[tibia]] and the [[fibula]]. Giants linebackers [[Gary Reasons]] and [[Harry Carson]] then joined Taylor in the sack.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It was at that point, I also found out what a magnificent machine the human body is&quot;, Theismann said.  &quot;Almost immediately, from the knee down, all the feeling was gone in my right leg.  The [[endorphin]]s had kicked in, and I was not in [[pain]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washington post&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Theismann lay on the field, a horrified Taylor frantically screamed and waved for [[emergency medical technician]]s.  Initially, however, many Redskins personnel thought Taylor's screaming and pointing directed at their sidelines was a taunt over the fact that he had successfully stopped their play.  Taylor has said that his animated behavior was largely a claustrophobic reaction to having been trapped at the bottom of the pile that followed his tackle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]. ''[[The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game]]''. [[W. W. Norton]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Monday Night Football'' announcer team (composed of [[Frank Gifford]], [[O. J. Simpson]] and [[Joe Namath]]) [[Abductive reasoning|inferred]] from the start that Taylor was calling for help.

While initially only the players on the field could see the extent of the damage to Theismann's leg, the reverse-angle instant replay provided a clearer view of what had actually happenedâTheismann's lower leg bones were broken midway between his knee and his ankle, such that his leg from his foot to his mid-shin was lying flat against the ground while the upper part of his shin up to his knee was at a 45-degree angle to the lower part of his leg.

The compound fracture of the tibia led to insufficient bone growth during Theismann's recovery, leaving his right leg shorter than his left. As a result, the injury forced Theismann into retirement at the age of 36. Theismann has never blamed Lawrence Taylor for his injury.  Taylor has said that he has never seen film of the play and never wants to.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--Taylor only--&gt;

This injury was highlighted in the film ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' as the reason that, after the quarterback, one of the highest paid football players is the left tackle, who protects the quarterback's blind side.&lt;!-- Moved WP:OR WP:CV extended quote and WP:CV video to Talk for discussion --~~~~ --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Broadcasting career==
In [[1985 in television|1985]], Theismann helped call [[Super Bowl XIX]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] alongside [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Don Meredith]], becoming only the second person to do commentary on a Super Bowl telecast while still an active player at the time (the first was [[Jack Kemp]] when he helped call [[Super Bowl II]] for [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]). Theismann served as a [[color commentator]] on regional CBS NFL coverage in [[1986 NFL season|1986]] and [[1987 NFL season|1987]], then worked on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[ESPN Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' telecasts from [[1988 NFL season|1988]] to [[2005 NFL season|2005]], and on their ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' coverage in [[2006 NFL season|2006]].

On March 26, 2007, ESPN announced that [[Ron Jaworski]] would replace Theismann in the ''Monday Night Football'' booth.  Theismann rejected an offer to work on the network's [[college football]] coverage.  He has since done a number of Washington Redskins pre-season games on CSN.

On September 16, 2009, the [[NFL Network]] announced that Theismann would analyze game films on the show ''[[Playbook (TV series)|Playbook]]'', airing Thursday and Friday nights at 6 p.m. Eastern.

In addition to covering football, Theismann hosted the first half of the first season of ''[[American Gladiators]]'' in [[1989 in television|1989]].

Theismann worked with [[Joe Gibbs]] and [[Tom Hammond]] on the broadcasting crew for [[NBC]]'s coverage of the early wild-card game between the [[New York Jets]] and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on January 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=USA Today | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2009-12-06-gibbs-theismann-nbc-wildcard_N.htm | title=Gibbs, Theismann to reunite for NBC wild-card game | author=Michael Hiestand| date=2009-12-06| accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2010, NFL network announced that they had added Theismann to their ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' broadcast crew alongside [[Bob Papa]] and [[Matt Millen]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Rosenthal (September 6, 2010). [http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/09/06/joe-theismann-to-join-nfl-network-booth/ &quot;Joe Theismann to join NFL Network booth&quot;]. NBCSports.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The three only announced one season (2010) together.

In January 2011, in the days leading up to the NFL Divisional Playoff between the Jets and Patriots, Theismann committed an embarrassing blunder on the show [[No Huddle]] when, while discussing the Patriots' strengths on offense, called New England running back [[Danny Woodhead]] &quot;Danny Woodcock.&quot;  This gaffe caused his co-hosts, [[Deion Sanders]], Mike Mayock and [[Steve Mariucci]] to laugh hysterically, to the point that Sanders fell out of his chair.

==Personal==
He and his first wife Shari Brown Theismann divorced in 1984. They have three children, Joe, Amy, and Patrick, all now married. Theismann was in a relationship with actress/TV host [[Cathy Lee Crosby]] for seven years. His second marriage, to former Miss Connecticut and Miss America Contestant Jeanne Caruso, ended in divorce after three years.

Theismann is now married to Robin Theismann. They have homes in [[Virginia]], [[Tennessee]], and the [[Florida Panhandle]].&lt;ref name=washingtonian/&gt; &lt;!-- removed city specificity -- too much detail --&gt;

Theismann is the owner of [http://www.joetheismanns.com/History/history.html Joe Theismann's Restaurant] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], founded 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Attner (1976-10-29) [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4J8oAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OSkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3398,6415291&amp;dq=joe+theismann+opens+restaurant Theismann Plans, but does not wait, for future] ''[[Washington Post]]'' ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' via [[Google News Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 2010, head coach Jay Gruden of the [[United Football League (2009)|UFL]]'s [[Florida Tuskers]] &quot;confirmed that Theismann introduced himself to the Tuskers as the team's new part owner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe, Jeff (August 19, 2010) [http://www.baynews9.com/article/sports/2010/august/139290/Report:-Joe-Theismann-in-talks-to-become-part-owner-of-Florida-Tuskers Joe Theismann in talks to become part owner of Florida Tuskers].
