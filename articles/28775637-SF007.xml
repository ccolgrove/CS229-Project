This is a list of software [[package management system]]s.

==Binary installation / Precompiled packages==
===Linux distributions===
* [[dpkg]], used originally by [[Debian]] and now by other systems, uses the [[deb (file format)|.deb format]] and was the first to have a widely known dependency resolution tool ([[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]).
* The [[RPM Package Manager]] was created by [[Red Hat]], and is now used by a number of other [[Linux distribution]]s. RPM is the [[Linux Standard Base]] packaging format and is the base of a large number of additional tools, including [[apt4rpm]]; Red Hat's [[up2date]]; [[Mandriva]]'s [[urpmi]]; [[openSUSE]]'s [[ZYpp]]; [[PLD Linux Distribution|PLD Linux]]'s [[poldek (software)|poldek]]; and [[Yellow dog Updater Modified|YUM]], which is used by [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Rhel|Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5]],  and [[Yellow Dog Linux]].
* A simple [[tgz]] package system combines the standard [[Tar file format|tar]] and [[gzip]]. Used by [[Slackware]] Linux and its closer derivates, there are a few higher-level tools that use the same tgz packaging format, including: [[slapt-get]], [[slackpkg]], [[zendo]], [[netpkg]], and [[swaret]].

===Cross platform===
* [[dpkg]] (mentioned above) is also used as part of [[Debian GNU/kFreeBSD]], and on [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken iOS]] as part of [[Cydia]] and [[Icy (application)|Icy]].
* [[Image Packaging System]], also known as IPS or pkg(5), is a cross platform network repository based system.  In addition to being used as the OS level package management system in [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], the pkg(5) system is available for use by layered applications on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OpenSolaris]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[IBM AIX]].

===Hybrid systems===
* The [[FreeBSD Ports]] Collection, sometimes known simply as ''ports'', uses a system of [[Makefile]]s to install software from sources or binaries. [[MacPorts]] (for Mac OS X), [[NetBSD]]'s ''[[pkgsrc]]'' and [[OpenBSD]]'s [[ports collection]] are similar.

===Meta package managers===
The following unify package management for several or all Linux and sometimes Unix variants. These, too, are based on the concept of a recipe file.
* [[Autopackage]] uses .package files.
* epm, developed by Easy Software Products (creators of [[CUPS]]), is a &quot;meta packager&quot;, that allows creation of native packages for all Linux and Unix operating systems (.deb, .rpm, .tgz for Linux, pkg for Solaris and *BSD, .dmg for OS X,...) controlled from a single *.list file.
* [[klik (packaging method)|klik]] aims to provide an easy way to get software packages for most major distributions without the dependency problems so common in many other package formats.

* [[Zero Install]] installs each package into its own directory and uses [[environment variable]]s to let each program find its libraries. Package and dependency information is downloaded directly from the software authors' pages in an XML format, similar to an [[RSS Feed]].
* [[Nix package manager]] manages packages in a [[purely functional]] way.
* [[PackageKit]] is a set of utilities and libraries for creating applications that can manage packages across multiple package managers using back-ends to call the correct program.
