'''Rede Record de TelevisÃ£o''' ({{IPA-pt|ËÊedÊi ÊeËkÉÊ}}) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[television network]], founded in [[1953]] by [[Paulo Machado de Carvalho]], also founder of [[RÃ¡dio Record]]. Currently it is owned by [[businessman]] [[Edir Macedo]], founder and [[bishop]] of the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]]. Since 2007 it is Brazil's second largest television network. With {{age|1953|09|27}} years of transmission, it is also the oldest TV network in the country.

== History ==
=== 1950s ===

TV Record started its transmissions on [[September 27]], [[1953]]. It was founded by [[:pt:Paulo Machado de Carvalho|Paulo Machado de Carvalho]] in [[SÃ£o Paulo]], as a competitor for then-dominant [[Rede Tupi]] (Network Tupi) from [[DiÃ¡rios Associados]], thus breaking the three-year old monopoly the station had in the city. It originally broadcasted shows, sports, journalism, comedies and plays. In the 1950s, TV Record became recognized by their sports broadcasts. In 1959, it started airing shows featuring international celebrities such as [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], and [[Marlene Dietrich]].

=== 1960s ===

[[Image:Logo Record TV 1970.png|thumb|left|TV Record with [[circle 7 logo]] from 1965 to 1970.]]

The 60s were considered Record's &quot;Golden Age&quot;. The peak of Record's ratings would be in the 1965&amp;ndash;1970 period, when it became well-known for its musical programs showcasing [[Bossa Nova]] and [[Jovem Guarda]] artists and its [[MÃºsica Popular Brasileira|MPB]] Music Festivals - which opened the doors to [[TropicÃ¡lia]]. It was also during the 60s that it aired its comedic series FamÃ­lia Trapo, created in 1967, the same year that it started to lead the newly founded ''Rede de Emissoras Independentes'' (Independent Broadcasting Networks), whose stations aired Record programs and were the its first affiliates. In 1968 Record's fortune started to change, because of a series of fires that handicapped its production capability and the change of Brazilian public tastes, starting to lean towards [[Rede Globo]] [[telenovelas]].

=== 1970s ===

Even with the sale of 50% of its shares to [[Silvio Santos]] in [[1972]], Record didn't manage to regain the lost ratings. It was the first television to broadcast in color in 1972, during the Festa da Uva (''Grape Party'') in [[Caxias do Sul]], together with [[TV Rio]] and [[TV Difusora (Porto Alegre)|TV Difusora]]. It would later be broadcast in full-color in 1974. Before this transmissions in color, since [[1962]], were experimental. TV Record had a programming based on [[Series television|TV series]], [[movie]]s and [[cartoon]]s, and [[TV show]]s.

=== 1980s ===

The formation of [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisao|SBT]] in [[1981]] marked the deepening of Record's decline. In most of the 80s, Record suffered from very low ratings, no stars in its cast and a lack of compelling programming due to extensive competition from other networks.

=== 1990s ===

In [[1990]], SÃ­lvio Santos and Paulo Machado de Carvalho's family sold Record to [[Edir Macedo]] and its [[Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus]]. 

On October 12, 1995, the network became infamous throughout the country because of the [[Kicking of the saint]] episode aired during the church late night program.

The new owners started an aggressive redeployment of Record's public image, using the term Rede Record to refer to itself and signing broadcasting affiliates throughout Brazil. Through most of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s, Record invested in popular programming, signing stars like [[:pt:Ana Maria Braga|Ana Maria Braga]] and [[:pt:Carlos Massa|Carlos Massa]], with some programming in sports (broadcast the World Cup 1998), journalism, series like [[Star Trek]], [[The X-Files]], [[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]] and [[The Three Stooges]], educational children's shows, and cartoons like [[Dexter's Laboratory]] and the [[anime]] [[PokÃ©mon]].

=== 2000s ===

In [[2003]], TV Record celebrated its 50th year of history; Record is the longest running Brazilian television network. In [[2004]], it began using a new slogan, &quot;A Caminho da LideranÃ§a&quot; (&quot;On the way to leadership&quot;), and released new programming.Despite the critics, the channel take a page of [[Rede Globo|Globo]]'s success, Record started to invest heavily in [[telenovelas]] and made its journalism look more like its main competitor, despite opting not to renew the contract of its anchor, [[Boris Casoy]].

In [[2007]], Record, for the first time, occupied 2nd place in [[SÃ£o Paulo]]'s ratings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u68929.shtml Ratings]&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to take over leadership in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u69434.shtml folha]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===

Also a first for Record, it signed with the [[International Olympic Committee]] for the exclusive rights for the free-to-air television to the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cidadebiz.oi.com.br/paginas/38001_39000/38546-1.html] [http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/media_centre/press_release_uk.asp?release=2106 News release]&lt;/ref&gt;
