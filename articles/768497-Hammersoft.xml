The series ran on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] from 1994 to 1998 and was one of the network's top three most watched shows,&lt;ref name=&quot;aura&quot;/&gt; becoming a favorite among teen audiences and turning Oleynik into a teen idol. Oleynik reprised the role in an ''[[All That]]'' sketch, although the name was changed to &quot;Alex Sax.&quot; Oleynik later appeared in the 100th episode of ''All That''.

She made a cameo on ''[[The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete]]'' during this time, being a nurse at the beginning of the episode ''Dance Fever''.&lt;ref name=&quot;idol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Larisa Online| work=Big Mack Attack|author=Judith Maitland|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/martin.rolph/articles/Article5.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050311222117/http://freespace.virgin.net/martin.rolph/articles/Article5.htm|archivedate=2005-03-11| accessdate=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during ''The Secret World of Alex Mack'''s run, she played one of the lead characters in the 1995 feature film ''[[The Baby-Sitters Club (film)|The Baby-Sitters Club]]'' (opposite [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] and [[Schuyler Fisk]]), appeared in several episodes of ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', wrote an advice column for ''[[Tiger Beat]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian&quot;/&gt; and was involved in ''Nickelodeon's Big Help'' charity, ''Hands Across Communication'', ''[[Surfrider Foundation]]'' and the ''Starlight Foundation''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian&quot; /&gt; She has commented that she stayed &quot;grounded&quot; during her period as a teen star, mainly through the help of a &quot;strong network of people&quot; that she is close to.&lt;ref name=&quot;friends&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Larisa Online | work=A World Of Her Own (Published in TV Guide in October 1996)| author=By Vicki Jo Radovsky | url=http://freespace.virgin.net/martin.rolph/articles/Article3.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050311221340/http://freespace.virgin.net/martin.rolph/articles/Article3.htm | archivedate=2005-03-11 | accessdate=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''The Secret World of Alex Mack'' ended its run, Oleynik had a starring role in the film ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'', a teen comedy where she played a love interest of Gordon-Levitt's character. (She also played the girlfriend of Gordon-Levitt's character in ''[[3rd Rock From the Sun]]''.)

The film was released in April 1999 and did fairly well at the box office, grossing a total of $38 million domestically.&lt;ref name=&quot;gross&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Numbers.com | work=10 Things I Hate about You | url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1999/10HAT.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060508171333/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1999/10HAT.html | archivedate=2006-05-08 | accessdate=April 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999â2000, Oleynik appeared in twenty one episodes of the [[NBC]] series ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' (alongside Gordon-Levitt). The same year, she appeared in two [[independent film]]s: ''[[100 Girls]]'' (opposite [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]], [[Katherine Heigl]] and [[Jonathan Tucker]]) and ''A Time for Dancing'' (opposite [[Shiri Appleby]]); neither film received a theatrical release in the United States. She has appeared in ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' as [[Reese Wilkerson|Reese's]] lesbian army buddy, who developed a crush on his mom, [[Lois Wilkerson|Lois]]. Next, Oleynik had a supporting role in the film ''[[An American Rhapsody]]'', which received a limited release in August 2001, and appeared in ''Bringing Rain'', a low-budget film.
