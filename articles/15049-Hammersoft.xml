The '''Indianapolis Colts''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Indianapolis]]. They are currently members of the [[AFC South|South Division]] of the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).
The club was officially founded in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] in 1953, but can trace its history to the [[Dayton Triangles]], a founding member of the NFL that was originally created in 1913. After a series of changes, it assumed the name '''Baltimore Colts''', replacing a previous [[Baltimore Colts (1947â50)|team of that name]] that folded in 1950. Playing at Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], the Colts became the first NFL team to have [[cheerleaders]]. The team then relocated to Indianapolis in 1984, first playing at the Hoosier Dome, which was then renamed the [[RCA Dome]], before moving to [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in 2008.

The Colts won four NFL championships (three [[List of NFL champions|NFL Championships]] in [[NFL Championship Game, 1958|1958]], [[NFL Championship Game, 1959|1959]], [[NFL Championship Game, 1968|1968]]; and [[Super Bowl V]] in 1971) while in Baltimore. Since moving to Indianapolis, they won [[Super Bowl XLI]] in 2007.

==Franchise history==
{{Main|History of the Indianapolis Colts}}

===Origin of the Colts===
The Colts franchise was officially created in 1953, but can trace its history to before the NFL actually began; its earliest predecessor was the [[Dayton Triangles]], a founding member of the NFL that was originally created in 1913. That team went through the following changes:

*The [[Dayton Triangles]] relocated to [[Brooklyn]] and were renamed the [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1930.
*The Brooklyn Dodgers changed their name to the Brooklyn Tigers in 1944. In the same year, the [[Boston Yanks]] were founded.
*The Brooklyn Tigers and the Boston Yanks merged on a temporary basis in 1945, becoming the wartime &quot;Yanks&quot;.
*The Brooklyn Tigers were canceled by the league as a separate franchise at the end of the 1945 season, and the team's temporary merger with the Boston Yanks was made permanent. The Tigers' former owner founded a parallel team in the rival [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC), the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]].
*The [[Miami Seahawks]] of the AAFC were purchased and relocated to Baltimore and renamed the [[Baltimore Colts (1947â1950)|Baltimore Colts]] in 1947. This version of the Colts wore green and silver and were brought into the NFL in 1950, but the franchise folded at the end of the season.
*The Boston Yanks moved to New York in 1949 and became the [[New York Yanks]]. They absorbed much of the roster of the AAFC's New York Yankees team the next year.
*The New York Yanks moved to [[Dallas]] in 1952 and were renamed the [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]].
*The Texans become a road team halfway through the 1952 season and were dissolved shortly thereafter.
*The Dallas Texans franchise was reorganized and moved to Baltimore on January 23, 1953. They adopted the name Baltimore Colts, but kept the Texans' team colors of blue and white.

===The AAFC Baltimore Colts===
{{main|Baltimore Colts (1947â1950)}}
On December 28, 1946, the bankrupt [[Miami Seahawks]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] were purchased and relocated in Baltimore by a group headed by Bob Rodenberg. As the result of a contest in Baltimore, won by Charles Evans of Middle River, Md., the team was renamed the [[Baltimore Colts (1947â50)|Colts]]. On September 7, 1947, wearing the green and silver uniforms, the [[1947 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]], under Head Coach [[Cecil Isbell]], won their initial AAFC game, 16â7, over the [[1947 Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC) season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The team concluded its inaugural season before a record Baltimore crowd of 51,583 by losing to the [[1947 New York Yankees (AAFC) season|New York Yankees]], 21â7. The Colts finished with a 2â11â1 record, good for a fourth place finish in the Eastern Division. The [[1948 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] completed the 1948 season with a 7â8 record, tying the [[1948 Buffalo Bills (AAFC) season|Buffalo Bills]] for the division title. The [[1949 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] compiled a 1â11 mark in 1949. [[Y. A. Tittle]] was the Colts starting quarterback.

The AAFC and NFL merged in [[1950 NFL season|1950]], and the Colts joined the NFL. After posting a [[1950 Baltimore Colts season|1â11 record]] for the second consecutive year, the franchise was dissolved by the league on January 18, 1951, because of its failing financial condition. Many Baltimore fans protested the loss of their team and continued to support the [[marching band]] (the second in professional football, after that of their local rivals, the [[Washington Redskins]]). Both the band and the [[fan club]] remained in operation and worked for the team's revival.

===The NFL Dallas Texans===
{{main|Dallas Texans (NFL)}}
After two seasons without professional football, NFL Commissioner [[Bert Bell]] challenged Baltimore in December 1952 to sell 15,000 season tickets within six weeks in order to re-enter the NFL. That 15,000-ticket quota was reached in four weeks and three days. On January 23, 1953, under the principal ownership of [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], the NFLâs [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] franchise was moved to Baltimore and assumed the Colts nickname while retaining the Texans' team colors of blue and white. This is the franchise that exists today in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colts.com/sub.cfm?page=football_dynamic&amp;id=174|title=A look at the history of the Indianapolis Colts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texans had a long and winding history; they started as the [[Boston Yanks]] in [[1944 NFL season|1944]] and merged with the [[Brooklyn Tigers]] (previously known as the [[Dayton Triangles]], an original NFL team established in the 1910s) for the [[1945 NFL season|1945 season]] before moving to [[New York City|New York]] as the Bulldogs in [[1949 NFL season|1949]]. The team then became the [[New York Yanks|Yanks]] in 1950, and many of the players from the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the [[All-America Football Conference]] were added to the team. The Yanks moved to Dallas after the [[1951 NFL season|1951 season]], but played their final two home games of the [[1952 NFL season|1952 season]] at the [[Rubber Bowl]] in [[Akron, Ohio]].

Note:  This team should not be confused with the Dallas Texans of the AFL; they were a founding member of the AFL in 1960 and in 1963 moved to Kansas City and became the Chiefs.

====1953â1970====
The second incarnation of the Baltimore Colts first took the field at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] on September 27, with coach [[Keith Molesworth]]. The Colts stunned the [[1953 Chicago Bears season|Bears]] that day 13â9 to get the new franchise off on the right foot. However, the Colts struggled to a 3â9 season in their inaugural year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html |title=Baltimore Colts (1953â1983) |publisher=Sportsecyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1958====
On December 28, 1958, [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore]] faced the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in the NFL Championship game at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. The Colts went to halftime with a 14â3 lead after scoring two touchdowns in the second quarter. The fourth quarter ended with the teams tied at 17, meaning the NFL would have to use sudden death overtime for the first time ever. In the overtime, [[Johnny Unitas]] hit wide receiver [[Raymond Berry]] with a pass that gave the Colts a first down in Giants territory. Baltimore continued to drive down to the 1-yard line, with first and goal. Unitas handed off to [[Alan Ameche]] who dove across the goal line to give Baltimore a 23â17 win, in what many call the [[NFL Championship Game, 1958|greatest game ever played]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Greatest Game&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The âGreatest Gameâ in Collective Memory |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/sports/football/05sandomir.html?em |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |date=2008-12-04 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Greatest Game&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/feature/index?page=greatestgame|title=No Kick, No Classic |publisher=espn.com |accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game became a launching point for the NFL's remarkable boom in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

====1959====
The next season, [[1959 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore]] had a [[NFL Championship Game, 1959|Championship Game rematch]] with the [[1959 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], with the game this time being played at Memorial Stadium. In the first three quarters the Colts fell behind 9â7. Unitas led the Colts back in the fourth quarter as Baltimore scored 24 unanswered points, and went on to claim their second straight NFL Championship with a 31â16 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

====1964====
In [[1964 NFL season|1964]], after losing the first game of the season to the [[1964 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]], the [[1964 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] went on a 10-game winning streak on the way to winning the Western Division Championship with a 12â2 record. Unitas won the NFL MVP award after amassing 2,824 yards passing.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; The Colts faced the [[1964 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1964|Championship Game]]. However, nothing would go right in Cleveland as the Colts were defeated 27â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

====1967====
Unitas won his second NFL MVP award in [[1967 NFL season|1967]] with 3,428 yards passing as the [[1967 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] went undefeated through the first 13 games of the season with a record of 11â0â2. However, the Colts still needed to beat the [[1967 Los Angeles Rams season|Rams]] in Los Angeles to claim the Coastal Division Championship. The Rams would win the game 34â10 to win the Division title and advance to the postseason, as the Colts went home despite an 11â1â2 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

====1968====
{{main|Super Bowl III}}
Unitas missed most of the [[1968 NFL season|1968 season]] with an elbow injury. Backup quarterback [[Earl Morrall]] stepped in and won the NFL MVP award, while leading the [[1968 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] to a 13â1 season. While Morrall led the offense, the Colts defense shut out three opponents and allowed a record low 144 points for the season. In the Divisional Playoff the Colts beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 24â14 before a sold out crowd at Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Ted Hendricks 2-4-05 050204-N-0874H-006.jpg|thumb|Former Colts' linebacker [[Ted Hendricks]] (1969â1973) was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1990.]]
[[Super Bowl III]] was the third AFL-NFL Championship Game in professional American football, but the first to officially bear the name Super Bowl. (The two previous AFL-NFL Championship Games would retroactively be called Super Bowls as well.) This game is regarded as one of the greatest upsets in sports history. The underdog American Football League (AFL) champion [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] (11â3) defeated the National Football League (NFL) champion Baltimore Colts (13â1) by a score of 16â7. It was the first Super Bowl victory for the AFL.

The game was played on January 12, 1969, at the [[Orange Bowl (stadium)|Orange Bowl]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] â the same location as Super Bowl II. Entering Super Bowl III, the NFL champion Colts were heavily favored to defeat the AFL champion Jets. Although the upstart AFL had successfully forced the long-established NFL into a merger agreement three years earlier, the AFL was not generally respected as having the same caliber of talent as the NFL. In addition, the NFL's [[Green Bay Packers]], coached by [[Vince Lombardi]], had easily defeated the AFL representatives ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City]] and [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]])in the first two Super Bowls.

After boldly guaranteeing a victory prior to the game, Jets quarterback [[Joe Namath]] completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards, and was named the Super Bowl's Most Valuable Player, despite not throwing a touchdown pass in the game or any passes at all in the fourth quarter.

Following the next season, coach [[Don Shula]], who fell out of favor with owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]], was allowed to resign and took the coaching job with [[Miami Dolphins]]. Assistant Coach [[Don McCafferty]] replaced Shula.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

====1970, Super Bowl V Champions====
{{main|1970 Baltimore Colts season}}

Prior to the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]], Rosenbloom, [[Art Modell]] of the [[Cleveland Browns|Browns]], and [[Art Rooney]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] agreed to have their teams join the ten AFL teams in the AFC as part of the [[AFL-NFL merger]] giving each conference an equal number of teams and divisions. The Colts won the Eastern Division while posting an 11â2â1 record. During the season the Colts got revenge for Super Bowl III by beating the [[1970 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], who were now a division rival. In the [[NFL playoffs, 1970-71|Divisional Playoffs]], the Colts defeated the [[1970 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] 17â0 at Memorial Stadium. The Colts then defeated the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] 27â17 to advance to the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

In [[Super Bowl V]] against the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], the Cowboys jumped out to a 6â0 lead on 2 field goals before Baltimore tied it on a 75-yard pass from Unitas to [[John Mackey (American football)|John Mackey]]. However, Baltimore's PAT was blocked and the game remained tied. The Cowboys regained the advantage and went into the 4th quarter holding a 13â6 lead into halftime. Earl Morrall relieved an injured Unitas in the 2nd half the game as the two teams kept fumbling the ball back-and-forth in a game that got the nickname &quot;The Blunder Bowl&quot; as both teams combined had 11 turnovers. Baltimore tied the game midway through the final period on a 2-yard plunge by running back [[Tom Nowatzke]]. With less than 2 minutes left Cowboys RB [[Dan Reeves]] fumbled the ball setting up the Colts in Dallas territory. Baltimore won the game on a 32-yard field goal from [[Jim O'Brien (American football)|Jim O'Brien]] with 5 seconds left.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

====1971â1983====
Following a 1â4 start in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], McCafferty was fired. The [[1972 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] went 4â5 in their final 9 games under [[John Sandusky]] to finish with a 5â9 record, their first losing mark in 16 years. Following the season Unitas was traded to the [[San Diego Chargers]]. However, Unitas would not leave without coming off the bench during his final game at Memorial Stadium and leading the Colts on a 55-yard touchdown pass late in the 4th quarter to help beat the [[1972 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 35â7. Memorial Stadium gave the legend a standing ovation as a small plane flying overhead carried a banner reading &quot;Unitas We Stand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; After a 4â10 season in [[1973 NFL season|1973]] and a 0â3 start in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], head coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] was fired and replaced by [[Joe Thomas (football coach)|Joe Thomas]]. The [[1974 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] did not perform any better under Thomas, compiling a miserable 2â12 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

Under new coach [[Ted Marchibroda]] the [[1975 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] got off to a 1â4 start in [[1975 NFL season|1975]]. However, the Colts started winning as quarterback [[Bert Jones]] and running back [[Lydell Mitchell]] came of age and led the Colts on a seven game winning streak. The Colts went on to win their last game of the season to claim the AFC East with a 10â4 record. However, in the [[NFL playoffs, 1975-76|Divisional Playoffs]] the young Colts were no match for the [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in Pittsburgh, suffering a season ending 28â10 loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; Marcibroda resigned as head coach but was re-hired for the 1976 season. The Colts went on to have a stellar season, led by Jones who won the NFL MVP by passing for 3,104 yards. The [[1976 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] put together a solid [[1976 NFL season|season]] and won the AFC East with an 11â3 record; however, in the [[NFL playoffs, 1976-77|Divisional Playoffs]], the Colts were defeated again by the [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], this time at Memorial Stadium, 40â14.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; In [[1977 NFL season|1977]], the Colts were again defeated in the [[NFL playoffs, 1977-78|Divisional Playoffs]] by the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]], 37â31.&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; Following the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]], Marchibroda was fired and replaced by [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

After two losing seasons, McCormack was fired and Bert Jones was traded to the [[History of the St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], attendance began to dwindle at Memorial Stadium as the [[1982 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] struggled during a season interrupted by a [[1982 NFL strike|two-month strike]]. Actually the strike provided relief for the John Elway negotiations. However, Elway refused to play for owner [[Robert Irsay]] and threatened to play minor league baseball or in the newly formed [[USFL]]. Fearful the Colts would get nothing for his rights, the Colts traded Elway to the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsEcyclopedia&quot; /&gt; On December 18, 1983, unbeknownst to the team or fans, the Colts played their final home game (against the then [[1983 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]) in the city of Baltimore. 27,934 fans showed up, 516 more fans than the crowd that had turned out for their first home game in 1947.

In May 1969 the city of Baltimore announced it would seek a âsubstantialâ increase in [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] rental fees from Carol Rosenbloom and the Colts. Rosenbloom had already called Memorial Stadium âantiquatedâ and had threatened to move all Colts home games out of the stadium unless improvements were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XsAiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VLYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3844,9811196&amp;dq=carol+rosenbloom+memorial+stadium&amp;hl=en|title= Colts Stadium Rent To Rise |publisher=google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenbloom even considered using $12â20 million of his own money to help fund the building of a new football-only stadium on land in adjoining [[Baltimore County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hMcpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xooDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2943,4634019&amp;dq=carol+rosenbloom+stadium&amp;hl=en | title=Colts May Build Own Stadium | publisher=google.com | date= | accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 1971, Rosenbloom announced that the Colts would not return to Memorial Stadium when their lease ran out following the 1972 season and that he was not interested in negotiating with the city anymore.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~bonesaw/records6.htm |title=Descendants of the Mayflower by Michael Devitt |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted out of Baltimore for several reasons&amp;nbsp;â team revenue, problems with [[Baltimore Orioles]] ownership relating to Memorial Stadium and food sales/parking fees, a running feud with the Baltimore press, and his [[Georgia Frontiere|new wife's]] desire to move to the West Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SIIrsay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=E.M.

However, Keland could not generate the funds necessary to purchase the team. His golfing buddy, [[Robert Irsay]], who originally was slated to own only 1 percent of the team, did have the money available and he moved in to make the purchase. On July 13, 1972, Irsay became the owner of the Colts. Under the terms of the arrangement, Irsay bought the [[Los Angeles Rams]] for $19 million, then traded them to Rosenbloom for the Colts and $3 million in cash. The players for each team remained in their respective cities.

In 1971, Baltimore mayor [[William Donald Schaefer]] and Maryland governor [[Marvin Mandel]] created a stadium committee to examine the city's stadium needs. Their report was a blow to Memorial Stadium. Some of the problems mentioned: 10,000 stadium's seats had views that were &quot;less than desirable&quot;; 20,000 seats were out-dated bench seats that had no back support; 7,000 so called seats were actually poorly constructed temporary bleachers that were installed for football games only. Also, there was inadequate office space for the front offices of either the Orioles or Colts by themselves, much less for both teams combined. Both teams had to share locker rooms. The upper deck of Memorial Stadium did not circle the field, ending instead at the 50-yard line, meaning that thousands of potential seats (and added revenue) were missing. Any expansion plans for the stadium had usually mentioned less attractive (and less expensive) end-zone seats, not upper deck seating. Lastly, the amount of bathroom facilities in Memorial Stadium was deemed inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;

Maryland's planners came up with an ambitious project.

The new stadium would host 70,000 fans for football games, 55,000 for baseball and 20,000 as an arena for hockey or basketball. For an estimated $78 million, the city would build a facility that would have kept all parties happy; Orioles owner Hoffberger, Colts owner Irsay, the Stadium Complex Authority (whose Chairman Edmond Rovner reiterated in 1972 that &quot;A major consideration in Mr. Irsay's trading of franchises, was the city's firm commitment to proceed with these plans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBooks&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u5sKmJItUF4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=baltodome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fTyfZd9bqB&amp;sig=0b7Cgxx4stnW-ztkq5gKF9k1IdI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2zOiS5rEKsX_lgeRw9nlCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=baltodome&amp;f=false |title= Glory For Sale |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1972-08-15 |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Baltimore Mayor Schaefer and the Maryland governor Mandel.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;

However, the proposal did not receive sufficient support to pass the [[Maryland State Legislature|Maryland legislature]], in spite of assurances that contributions from taxpayers would be limited strictly to city and state loans. On February 27, 1974  Governor Mandel pulled the plug on the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookGloryForSale&quot;/&gt; Orioles owner [[Jerrold Hoffberger]] was blunt &quot;I will bow to the will of the people. They have told us what they want to tell us. First, they don't want a new park and second, they don't want a club.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookGloryForSale&quot;/&gt; [[Robert Irsay]] was willing to wait. &quot;It's not a matter of saying that there will be no stadium. It's a matter of getting the facts together so everybody is happy when they build the stadium. I'm a patient man. I think the people of [[Baltimore]] are going to see those new stadiums in [[Louisiana Superdome|New Orleans]] and [[Kingdome|Seattle]] opening in a year or two around the country, and they are going to realize they need a stadium ... for conventions and other things besides football.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookGloryForSale&quot;/&gt;

[[Hyman Pressman]], Baltimore's comptroller, was against using any public funds to build a new stadium. During the 1974 elections, Pressman had an amendment to the city's charter placed on the fall ballot. Known as Question P,&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt; the amendment called for declaring &quot;the 33rd Street stadium as a memorial to war veterans and prohibiting use of city funds for construction of any other stadium.&quot; The measure passed 56 percent to 44 percent, and the same jingoistic ideas that had been used to upgrade the then Baltimore Stadium (originally built in 1922) in the late 1940s and rename it Memorial Stadium, effectively destroyed any chance of a new, modern sports complex being built in Baltimore.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookGloryForSale&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/booksid=u5sKmJItUF4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=baltodome&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fTv7Wkhhyu&amp;sig=4H91CQHhg2cnjz_kwDJzg6AO0So&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result ]{{dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Colts made the playoffs for three straight years from 1975â77, there had still been no progress made on a new park for the team. Robert Irsay first spoke with [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] in 1976 and then [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] in 1977 about the possibility of relocating his team to one of those cities. In 1976 he acknowledged publicly that he had received an &quot;attractive offer&quot; to move the franchise to Phoenix.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBooks&quot;/&gt; Then in 1977 said &quot;I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but when are we going to find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like [[Indianapolis]] to build me a new stadium and give me other inducements to move there. I don't want to but I'd like to see some action in Baltimore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBooks&quot;/&gt; In 1979 Jerrold Hoffberger sold the Orioles to [[Washington D.C.]] attorney [[Edward Williams]] who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had &quot;inadequate parking and inadequate access and egress. Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location,&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBooks&quot;/&gt; Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] Commission, [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SIIrsay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=E.M.

That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor [[Harry Hughes]] with a request for $25 million in renovation to the dilapidated 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookPlayingTheField&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d6ySz8psnPMC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=1s8HS-ZljZ&amp;dq=phoenix+negotiations+colts&amp;output=html |title=Playing the Field: Why Sports Teams ... â Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan would add more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improve the plumbing, and have provided both teams with better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] signing long term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term lease. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripodColts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookPlayingTheField&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d6ySz8psnPMC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=1s8HS-ZljZ&amp;dq=phoenix+negotiations+colts&amp;output=html |title=Playing the Field: Why Sports Teams ... â Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation to Indianapolis===
{{main|Baltimore Colts relocation controversy}}

Under the administration of Mayor [[Richard Lugar]] and then continuing with Mayor [[William Hudnut]], Indianapolis was making a serious effort to reinvent itself into a &quot;Great American City&quot;. In 1979, Indianapolis community leaders created the Indiana Sports Corporation to attract major sports events to central Indiana. The next year, Mayor Hudnut appointed a committee to study the feasibility of building a new stadium that could serve primarily as a boon to the city's convention business and, secondarily, as a lure for an NFL team.&lt;ref name=&quot;wthr.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wthr.com/global/story.asp?s=7579254&amp;ClientType=Printable |title=RCA Dome nears last game â 13 WTHR â Indianapolis News &amp;#124; |publisher=Wthr.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, construction on the Hoosier Dome (later renamed the [[RCA Dome]]) began. Deputy Mayor [[David Frick]], who would later lead the negotiations with the Colts and then go on to become chairman of the Indiana state commission overseeing construction of the [[RCA Dome]]'s replacement, [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], has said that the RCA Dome was a key to changing the city's image. &quot;Sports was an element in our game plan to change the image of the city back in the late 1970s, early 1980s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wthr.com&quot;/&gt;

In February 1983, after relations between Irsay and the city of Baltimore had deteriorated significantly, Baltimore Mayor Schaefer asked the Maryland General Assembly to approve $15 million for renovation to Memorial Stadium. The legislature did not approve the request until the following spring, after the Colts' lease had expired,&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_3&quot;&gt;http://www.stadiumsofnfl.com/past/MemorialStadium.htm Stadiums of the NFL&amp;nbsp;â Memorial Stadium&lt;/ref&gt; and only half of that $15 million would go towards improvements that the Colts were seeking; the other half was for the Orioles Major League Baseball team. However, Baltimore reportedly did offer Irsay a $15 million loan at 6.5%, a guarantee of at least 43,000 tickets sold per game for six years, and the purchase of the team's [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Owings Mills]] training facility for $4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIIrsay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=E.M.

On March 2, NFL owners voted to give Irsay permission to move his franchise to the city of his choosing.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19840317&amp;id=nQEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gs4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6386,5720471|title=Coltâs Irsay reportedly leaning towards Phoenix|publisher=google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irsay continued discussions with several cities hungry for an NFL franchise ([[New York City|New York]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5D61739F93BA15751C0A962948260 |title=SPORTS PEOPLE; New Talks on Colts |publisher=New York Times |date=1984-02-28 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) eventually narrowing the list of cities to two, Phoenix and Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~bonesaw/Indy_History.htm |title=Descendants of the Mayflower â A History of the Indianapolis Colts |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1984 Baltimore's Mayor Schaefer stated &quot;We're not going to build a new stadium. We do not have the bonding capacity. We don't have the voters or taxpayer who can support a $60 million stadium. One-third of the people in Baltimore pay taxes. Unless private enterprise builds it, we won't build it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBooks&quot;/&gt; The Phoenix Metropolitan Sports Foundation, headed by real estate developer Eddie Lynch, along with Arizona Governor [[Bruce Babbitt]] and other top Arizona officials, had secretly met with Irsay early in January 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;/&gt; Preliminary talks seemed promising. [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] was offering a below market rate $15,000,000.00 loan and rent free use of the 71,000 seat [[Sun Devil Stadium]] on the campus of [[Arizona State University]]. A second meeting was scheduled between Irsay and the Phoenix group. But when word of a second scheduled meeting leaked out and was reported by the media on the Friday before the [[Super Bowl]], Irsay canceled.&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_6&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, Indianapolis and local real estate developer [[Robert Welch]], were lobbying the NFL to bring an expansion team to the city, with Welch as team owner. Welch also had personal discussions with [[New Orleans Saints]] owner [[John Mecom]] about buying the team and moving it to Indianapolis. In January 1984, [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Pete Rozelle]] announced that expansion had been put on hold. As a result of that announcement, [[Indiana Pacers]]' owner [[Herb Simon]] contacted Colts officials in order to take negotiations between the club and Indianapolis to the next level. Mayor Hudnut then assigned deputy mayor David Frick to begin secret negotiations with Colts counsel Michael Chernoff. On February 13, Colts representatives came to town to look at the Hoosier Dome construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/sports/football-pro/indpls_colts/history/colts.html |title=Indianapolis Colts History |publisher=.indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colts owner Robert Irsay visited on February 23.

&quot;He [Irsay] was visibly moved,&quot; former deputy mayor Dave Frick said in commenting on Irsay's reaction to entering the brand new domed stadium. &quot;Emotionally, he was making the move.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;&gt;http://www.indystar.com/article/20080815/SPORTS03/808150305/1112/NEWS10&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in Baltimore, the situation worsened. Eventually, the [[Maryland]] legislature intervened and, on March 27, the Maryland Senate passed legislation giving the city of Baltimore the right to seize ownership of the team by [[eminent domain]]&lt;ref name=&quot;SIIrsay&quot;/&gt; â an idea first floated in a memo written by Baltimore mayoral aide Mark Wasserman.  Robert Irsay said that his move was &quot;a direct result&quot; of the eminent domain bill&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookPlayingTheField&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d6ySz8psnPMC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=1s8HS-ZljZ&amp;dq=phoenix+negotiations+colts&amp;output=html |title=Playing the Field: Why Sports Teams ... â Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Colts counsel Michael Chernoff later said of the move by the Maryland legislature: &quot;They not only threw down the gauntlet, but they put a gun to his head and cocked it and asked, 'Want to see if it's loaded?' They forced him to make a decision that day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIIrsay&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neill |first=John R. |url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/i/irsay_jim/stories/1997_0115.html |title=Robert Irsay obituary |publisher=.indystar.com |date=1997-01-15 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, Phoenix businessmen withdrew their offer citing the recent legislative moves in Maryland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_egKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zE8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3373,5705084&amp;hl=en |title= Phoenix bid to Irsay is withdrawn |publisher=google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irsay called the Indianapolis mayor that afternoon and began serious negotiations in order to move the team before the Maryland legislature's other chamber could pass similar legislation. The city of Indianapolis offered the Colts owner a $12,500,000 loan, a $4,000,000 training complex, and the use of the brand new $77.5 million, 60,127 seat Hoosier Dome.&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ackermann |first=Guy |url=http://www.siteselection.com/bonus/2001/sep/guestcolumn.htm |title=Moving the Company |publisher=Siteselection.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Irsay agreed to the deal, the Indianapolis Mayor called John B. Smith, his friend, neighbor and chief executive officer of [[Mayflower Transit]], and 15 trucks were dispatched to the team's Owings Mills, Maryland training complex at 2:00 AM on March 29 because it was feared the franchise would be seized early the following morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt; Workers loaded all of the team's belongings and the trucks left for Indianapolis. By 10:00 AM, the Colts were completely gone from Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot; documentary on ESPN, 2008-12-13&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day the Maryland House of Delegates also passed the [[Eminent Domain]] bill by a vote of 103â19 and the legislation taking control of the Colts was sent to Maryland Governor [[Harry Hughes]] and signed.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EMoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8u4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6516,7473117&amp;dq=hudnut+new+dome&amp;hl=en | title=Now theyâre the Indianapolis Colts | publisher=google.com | date= | accessdate=2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Departing Maryland, each of the Mayflower trucks took a slightly different route on the way to Indianapolis. This was done to confuse the [[Maryland State Police]], who might have been called on to put a stop to the move. Once each van was at the Indiana state line, it was met by [[Indiana State Police|Indiana State Troopers]], who escorted each van to the Colts new home in Indianapolis. Later John Moag, Jr., chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority, stated in sworn testimony before the U.S. Senate subcommittee responsible for the Fan Freedom and Community Protection Act: &quot;It was the failure of our local (Baltimore) and state elected officials in Maryland to provide the Colts with a firm proposal for a new stadium that led Mr. Irsay to accept an offer from Indianapolis to play in a new dome in that city.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heartland.org/publications/policy%20studies/article.html?articleid=9482 |title=No. 76 Should Congress Stop the Bidding War for Sports Franchises?

After the Colts left, and in spite of his earlier stance that the city of Baltimore would not build a new stadium,&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBooks&quot;/&gt; he placed the building of a new stadium at the top of his legislative agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleBookPlayingTheField&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d6ySz8psnPMC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;ots=1s8HS-ZljZ&amp;dq=phoenix+negotiations+colts&amp;output=html |title=Playing the Field: Why Sports Teams ... â Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indianapolis Mayor Hudnut held a press conference March 29 to announce that an agreement had been reached and the team was on its way to Indianapolis. The deal was sealed March 30 with approval by the Capital Improvement Board, which operated the Hoosier Dome. Two days later, 20,000 new Colts fans cheered as Mayor Hudnut proclaimed March 29, 1984, &quot;one of the greatest days in the history of this city.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wthr.com&quot;/&gt;

===Baltimore moves on===
Understandably, Colts fans in Baltimore were heartbroken. In elections that year, city voters repealed Question P by a measure of 62 percent to 38 percent. However, the amendment's author, [[Hyman Pressman]], remained as an elected City Comptroller for 28 years (7 terms in a row) until retiring in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11822 |title=The Next Mayor Is...: ...Out There Somewhere. Who Wants the Job, And Who Could Actually Win It? &amp;#124; Baltimore City Paper |publisher=Citypaper.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's move triggered a flurry of legal activity, which ultimately reached the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] and bills were filed in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate seeking to block the move. In December 1985, a [[United States district court| Federal District Court]] judge threw out the lawsuit which sought to return the team to Maryland. Later, representatives of the city of Baltimore and the Colts organization reached a settlement in March 1986 in which all lawsuits regarding the relocation were dismissed, and the Colts would endorse a new NFL team for Baltimore.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;&gt;[http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/sports/football-pro/indpls_Colts/history/Colts.html History of the Indianapolis Colts] from indystar.com . Retrieved June 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1995, [[Cleveland Browns]] owner [[Art Modell]] announced his intention to move the Browns team to Baltimore after a stadium dispute in Cleveland. The decision, which involved secret discussions with the state of Maryland, also triggered a flurry of legal activity. Ironically, Modell had previously been staunchly against the relocation of sports teams, having heavily criticized Irsay's move in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

As part of the agreement to end all litigation between Modell and Cleveland, Modell left the Browns' name, colors, and history of the franchise in Cleveland. Modell was allowed to take his players and organization to Baltimore, but it would be technically regarded as an expansion team. The new Baltimore team was named the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]] after a fan vote.

The Colts' final game in Baltimore was played on December 18, 1983 against the [[1983 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]. The Colts won 20â10. The Colts did not play another game in Baltimore until 1998. Since then, the Colts have played in Baltimore several more times during the regular season (most recently in [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009]]). The teams have had two playoff matchups during that time, one in Baltimore (2006) and one in Indianapolis (2009), where in the [[NFL playoffs, 2006-07|2006â07 playoffs]], the [[2006 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]] hosted the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] in an AFC Divisional Playoff game (2006) and Colts hosted Ravens in an AFC Divisional Playoff Game. The Colts won the 2006 game en route to their first [[Super Bowl XLI|Super Bowl]] win since moving to Indianapolis. When the Colts play a game in Baltimore the name Colts is not used. The Colts are introduced as the Indianapolis professional football team and referred to as Indy on the stadium scoreboards.{{Citation needed|August 2011|date=August 2011}}

===Early Years of the Indianapolis Colts (1984â1997)===
====1984â1989====
In 1984, the Colts' first season in Indianapolis, [[Jim Irsay]] was named general manager of the team. [[Frank Kush]] was head coach until the final game, when he was replaced by [[Hal Hunter]]. Prior to the start of the season the team received 143,000 requests in two weeks for season tickets. The Colts had two first-round draft picks in [[1984 NFL Draft|1984]]. They chose [[Leonard Coleman]] and [[Ron Solt]]. Coleman could not reach an agreement with the Colts until early in 1985, and spent 1984 playing in the [[United States Football League|USFL]]. Other notable picks that year included [[Kevin Call]] in the 5th round and [[Eugene Daniel]] in the 8th. The [[1984 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] finished the [[1984 NFL season|1984 season]] with 4 wins and 12 losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt; [[Rod Dowhower]] was named head coach in 1985, but after two losing seasons, Dowhower was replaced by [[Ron Meyer]] in December 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

Two weeks into the [[1987 NFL season|1987 regular season]] the players went on a [[1987 NFL strike|24-day strike]]. One week of games was canceled, and for three weeks the teams played with replacement players. On October 31, the Colts obtained running back [[Eric Dickerson]] from the Los Angeles Rams for six draft picks and two players. The deal also involved Buffalo, sending [[Cornelius Bennett]] from the Colts to the Bills while [[Chuck Banks]] came to Indianapolis from the Houston Oilers. The [[1987 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] finished the season 9â6 and clinched the AFC East title but lost to the [[1987 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] in the divisional playoff game.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

Because of the Dickerson trade, the Colts had no draft pick until the third round in the [[1988 NFL Draft]] when they took quarterback [[Chris Chandler]]. In the Colts' first ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' appearance they defeated [[1988 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] 55â23 before a [[Halloween]] night crowd. Dickerson became the first Colt since [[Alan Ameche]] in 1955 to win the NFL rushing title. The [[1988 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] finished the [[1988 NFL season|season]] 9â7, and did not make the [[NFL playoffs, 1988-89|playoffs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====1990â1995====
In 1990, the Colts traded [[Chris Hinton]], 1989 first-round pick [[Andre Rison]] and draft picks to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for the first pick of the [[1990 NFL Draft|1990 draft]] so they could choose Indianapolis native and quarterback [[Jeff George]]. Eric Dickerson, after boycotting training camp and refusing to take physicals, was placed on the non-football injury list for six weeks. He was subsequently suspended four weeks for conduct detrimental to the team and forfeited $750,000 in wages and fines. The [[1990 Indianapolis Colts season|team]] finished the [[1990 NFL season|season]] 7â9.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt; The team further declined into 1991 and Meyer was fired on October 1 and replaced by [[Rick Venturi]], his defensive coordinator. The [[1991 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] won only once in the [[1991 NFL season|1991 season]], scoring a total of only 146 points. Their lone win came against the playoff-bound [[1991 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in Week 11. The Colts became the third consecutive team to finish a season at 1â15 (joining the [[1989 Dallas Cowboys season|1989 Cowboys]] and [[1990 New England Patriots season|1990 Patriots]]).

On January 28, 1992, the Colts hired Ted Marchibroda, who had been serving as an assistant with the [[Buffalo Bills]] for the past five seasons, for his second stint as the team's head coach. In April, the Colts traded Eric Dickerson to the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]], ending his sometimes rocky 4Â½ years with the team. On May 3, 1992, second-year defensive end [[Shane Curry]] was shot to death outside a Cincinnati nightclub in a dispute over a car blocking the nightclub's driveway. The [[1992 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] finished the [[1992 NFL season|season]] 9â7, marking the second time that Marchibroda led the Colts to an eight-game turnaround in his first year as their coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt; It wasn't enough, however, for the Colts to make the [[NFL playoffs, 1992-93|playoffs]] as they finished one game behind two of the AFC wild card teams.

Following a 4â12 season in [[1993 NFL season|1993]], running back [[Marshall Faulk]] was drafted second overall and linebacker [[Trev Alberts]] fifth overall in the [[1994 NFL Draft]]. In March, Jeff George was traded to the Atlanta Falcons. Despite going undefeated in the preseason the [[1993 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] opened the regular season with an all-time low attendance of 47,372. The Colts, behind starting quarterback [[Jim Harbaugh]], improved to 8â8, which was good enough for second place in the AFC East but not good enough to advance to the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====1995====
{{main|1995 Indianapolis Colts season}}

For the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]], the Colts acquired Tampa Bay Buccaneers starting quarterback [[Craig Erickson]] in a trade and signed him to a long term deal, but after three weeks Harbaugh regained the starting quarterback position. The move paid off as Harbaugh ended the season as the NFL's top-rated passer. The Colts advanced to the playoffs with a 9â7 record and earned the nickname &quot;Cardiac Colts&quot; thanks to their four come from behind victories and close games.

The Colts surprised many when they defeated the defending AFC Champion [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] in their first playoff game 35â20. They then came from behind to defeat the [[1995 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], who finished the season with the NFL's best record, the following week. This advanced the Colts to their first conference championship game since 1972, when they still played in Baltimore. Having defeated the AFC's #1 seed in the Chiefs, the Colts then traveled to Pittsburgh to face the AFC's #2 seed, the [[1995 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]. Harbaugh and the Colts again were involved in a close game and held the lead three separate times in the game, but lost 20â16 after Harbaugh's attempted 29-yard [[Hail Mary pass]] on the final play of the game was dropped by [[Aaron Bailey (American football)|Aaron Bailey]] in the end zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====1996====
{{main|1996 Indianapolis Colts season}}

[[Image:Marvin Harrison in 2007 Training Camp 2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Marvin Harrison]]]]
A month after the Colts' loss in the AFC Championship Game, trouble began brewing. Team owner [[Robert Irsay]] had suffered a stroke during the season that left him incapacitated, and while he convalesced a battle ensued for control of the team between Irsay's wife Nancy and his son, Colts general manager [[Jim Irsay]]. To further complicate matters, the Colts were forced to search for a new coach after Ted Marchibroda resigned following a contract dispute with the team, who had only offered him a one year extension. The team ended up promoting offensive coordinator [[Lindy Infante]] to the position while keeping him on as coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

With the draft pick the Colts obtained in the Jeff George trade, the team selected wide receiver [[Marvin Harrison]] with the 19th pick in the [[1996 NFL Draft]]. The Colts continued their winning ways from the previous year, starting at 4â0 in [[1996 NFL season|1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonesaw.tripod.com/Indy_History.htm |title=History of the Indianapolis Colts |publisher=Bonesaw.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, injuries began to plague the team and they went 5â7 following that. Their 9â7 record was enough to get them into the [[NFL playoffs, 1996-97|playoffs]] for the second consecutive year, and they faced the [[1996 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] in the opening round. The Colts lost again, however, as Pittsburgh throttled them 42â14.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

In the offseason prior to the Colts' 1997 season, Jim Irsay won his legal battle and became sole owner of the team. Irsay, who was 37 at the time, became the youngest owner of an NFL team in history. He had been working with the team since 1982, and has become known as &quot;The best small-market owner in the NFL.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBIrsay&quot;&gt;Colts' Jim Irsay Profiled As One Of The NFL's Savviest Owners http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/123962&lt;/ref&gt; After his father died, Jim immediately began to put his own seal on the team. Other NFL team owners &quot;credit his work as an owner and his personality as a significant reason for awarding Indianapolis the 2012 Super Bowl, a rare honor for a cold-weather city.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBIrsay&quot; /&gt; Patriots Owner Robert Kraft: &quot;I voted for Indianapolis because of Jim, because I like him and respect what he's done there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SBIrsay&quot; /&gt;

Irsay's first year as sole owner did not go well, however, as the Colts finished with the worst record in the NFL. The [[1997 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] only won three times in the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] (although all three of those wins came against teams with winning records, including the defending Super Bowl champion [[Green Bay Packers]]), and wholesale changes were made following the season. Irsay hired [[Carolina Panthers]] general manager [[Bill Polian]], who had won NFL Executive of the Year four times with the Panthers and [[Buffalo Bills]], as the team's president and general manager. Polian promptly fired Infante as coach, released Harbaugh, and hired [[Jim E. Mora|Jim Mora, Sr.]] as the team's new head coach.

===The Peyton Manning Era (1998âpresent)===
Polian employed a strategy of rebuilding the Colts through the draft, and his first two first round picks as GM proved to be keys in the Colts' rise to their current status in the NFL. In [[1998 NFL Draft|1998]], Polian used the first pick in the draft to select [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee]] quarterback [[Peyton Manning]], son of former NFL quarterback [[Archie Manning]].

While the [[1998 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] finished their first [[1998 NFL season|season]] under Polian at 3â13 again, success would come quickly after that.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Manning cropped.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Peyton Manning]]]]

The Colts traded Marshall Faulk to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]] two days before the draft and used their first-round draft pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]] to select running back [[Edgerrin James]] out of [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]], a surprise to many who thought they would take [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] running back [[Ricky Williams]], the [[Heisman Trophy]] winner who was available. James caught on quickly and Manning and Marvin Harrison clicked as a potent passing combination.

====1999====
{{main|1999 Indianapolis Colts season}}

In what was the greatest one-year turnaround in NFL history, the Colts went 13â3 in [[1999 NFL season|1999]], tying a franchise record for most wins in a season, and won the AFC East. They finished tied for the second best record in the conference with the [[1999 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] (who did not win their division), the second best record in the NFL with the Titans and [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]], and earned a first-round bye. In the first ever playoff game in Indianapolis, however, the Colts fell 19â16 to the eventual AFC Champion Titans. Manning, James and Harrison earned Pro Bowl honors, while kicker [[Mike Vanderjagt]] won the NFL scoring title and James took home the Offensive Rookie of the Year award.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====2000====
{{main|2000 Indianapolis Colts season}}

Both the team and their fans entered the 2000 season with high expectations after winning the AFC East with a 13â3 record in 1999. Eight games into the [[2000 NFL season|season]] the Colts were 6â2, though some of the wins had been heart-stoppers with last-minute heroics overcoming earlier mistakes. Then they lost four of the next five games, and suddenly even making it into playoffs was in doubt. With three games left in the season the Colts only chance was to win all three, which they did. The back-to-back 10-plus victory seasons were a first for the club since 1976â77. Manning (4,413) and James (1,709, 2,303) won the NFL passing, rushing and scrimmage yards titles. They earned a wild-card spot in the [[NFL playoffs, 2000â01|playoffs]], but lost the game 23â17 to the [[2000 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. The organization entered the off-season knowing the area most in need of attention was the defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====2001====
{{main|2001 Indianapolis Colts season}}

Wide receiver [[Reggie Wayne]] was selected with the 30th pick in the [[2001 NFL Draft]]. In [[2001 NFL season|2001]], Manning passed for 4,131 yards and Harrison caught 109 passes. However, despite starting the year with two wins, the Colts finished the season 6â10 and Manning was plagued by turnovers. The team was also hurt by injuries throughout the season, the most serious occurring on October 25, when running back Edgerrin James tore his ACL in the sixth game of the 2001 season. Further, the Colts' defense ranked at or near the bottom in yards allowed (30th), takeaways (26th), and points allowed (31st). While backup [[Dominic Rhodes]] proved a capable starter in becoming the first undrafted rookie to rush for over 1000 yards the loss of James, a lack of special teams coherence, and the defense's shortcomings proved to be too much for Indianapolis to overcome. Mora was fired with one year remaining on his contract, reportedly over a disagreement with general manager Bill Polian regarding defensive coordinator [[Vic Fangio]] (although others point to his infamous rant concerning the Colts' playoff chances following a Week 11 loss to [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] where the offense turned the ball over five times including four interceptions by Manning).

====2002====
{{main|2002 Indianapolis Colts season}}

[[Image:Tony Dungy award cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former Indianapolis Colts Head Coach [[Tony Dungy]]]]
Shortly after Mora's firing, [[Tony Dungy]], who had been coaching for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], became available after he was fired for failing to advance the Buccaneers to the Super Bowl. Irsay was so committed to bringing Dungy aboard that he, not Polian, initiated the contact. Late on January 19, 2002, Irsay phoned Dungy at his home in Tampa: &quot;I just wanted him to know from the start that there was no other coach on the planet I wanted to coach my football team,&quot; Irsay said. &quot;Not [[Steve Spurrier]]. Not [[Bill Parcells]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;USA Today-Dungy inherits high-powered offense. http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/colts/2002-01-22-dungy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the draft that year the Colts selected [[Dwight Freeney]], a defensive end from Syracuse, at number 11 overall. In a continuation of Polian's building through the draft philosophy that he had employed so well with Manning, James, and Wayne, Freeney became a defensive leader for the Colts and made an immediate impact. Because of the NFL [[realignment (sports)|realignment]] that took place following the addition of the [[Houston Texans]] to the league, the Colts moved from their longtime place in the AFC East to the AFC South. Marvin Harrison had a stellar year, breaking several club and NFL records, but Edgerrin James was hampered by injuries again. Freeney set an NFL rookie record in [[2002 NFL season|2002]] with ten forced fumbles, three of which occurred in a single game against former Syracuse football teammate, [[Donovan McNabb]]. However, despite all this not all the news was positiveâManning threw 19 interceptions, most of them in games the Colts went on to lose, and in a troubling pattern, the Colts repeatedly squandered the first half of a game, often falling so far behind that despite second half rallies, they could not overcome the deficit. Still, at 10â6 the Colts qualified for the [[NFL playoffs, 2002â03|playoffs]] and faced their former division rivals, the AFC East champion New York Jets, in their first game. Although the Colts were favored in the game, the [[2002 New York Jets season|Jets]] blew them out 41â0, with Manning still having yet to win a playoff game in what was now his fifth season.
[[Image:DwightFreeneyProBowl.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dwight Freeney]]]]

====2003====
{{main|2003 Indianapolis Colts season}}

The Colts finished the [[2003 NFL season|2003]] by winning the AFC South with a regular season record of 12â4. Manning was named co-MVP of the NFL, along with [[2003 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] quarterback [[Steve McNair]]. In the [[NFL playoffs, 2003â04|playoffs]], Manning and the Colts defeated the [[2003 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 41â10, for their first playoff win since 1995 and Manning's first ever. They then defeated the [[2003 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] in Kansas City the next week in a high-scoring affair, 38â31. However, the Colts were unable to defeat the eventual Super Bowl champion [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the AFC Championship game. The Patriots won the game 24â14 putting an end to the hopes of the team and the fans that this was the season the Colts would go all the way.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====2004====
{{main|2004 Indianapolis Colts season}}

Safety [[Bob Sanders]] was selected in the 2nd round (44th overall) of the [[2004 NFL Draft]]. The [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] saw the Colts win the AFC South again with a 12â4 record, but as in 2003 the Colts' season ended at the hands of the Patriots. After a year in which the offense broke numerous team and league records, the Colts could manage to score only one field goal in their final game, losing 20â3 in the [[NFL playoffs, 2004â05|Divisional Playoffs]]. For the second year in a row, Manning was named the league's MVP and his 49 regular-season touchdowns broke a record that [[Dan Marino]] had held since 1984.  The wide receiving trio of Marvin Harrison, [[Reggie Wayne]] and [[Brandon Stokley]] each had at least 10 touchdowns and more than 1,000 yards for the seasonâalso a league first. Edgerrin James ended the season ranked fourth in the NFL with 1,548 yards, an average of 4.6 yards per carry. And although questions continued to surround the defense, Freeney led the league with 16 sacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;indystarColts&quot;/&gt;

====2005====
{{main|2005 Indianapolis Colts season}}

In [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Dungy led the Colts to a franchise-record 14 wins and a third consecutive divisional title, the fifth for the club in its 22-year Indianapolis era. Manning and [[Marvin Harrison]] broke [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and [[Jerry Rice]]'s NFL record for most touchdowns by a quarterback-receiver tandem, notching their 86th in a Monday night home game against [[2005 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in week 6. Two weeks later Peyton Manning logged his first victory at New England against the [[2005 New England Patriots season|Patriots]], ending a six game New England win streak. After defeating [[2005 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville]] in week 14 they became only the fourth team in NFL history to reach a record of 13â0 and clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs. The dream of a perfect record for the Colts ended the next week however as the [[2005 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] defeated the Colts 26â17. In Week 16, the Colts played without coach Tony Dungy following the suicide of his son James earlier in the week. With the team resting most of their key players, the Colts lost their second straight to the eventual NFC Champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. Dungy returned to the sidelines for the last regular season game as the Colts beat the [[2005 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] 17â13 while resting most of the team's usual starters. The team's final record of 14â2 marked the best 16-game season in the franchise's history.

However, the Colts failed to capitalize on their record-setting season and lost their first playoff game to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]], 21â18. Trailing 21â10 late in the game, the Colts regained possession and put 8 points on the board to make it 21â18. After a [[Jerome Bettis]] fumble on the goal line, [[Nick Harper]] picked up the fumble and almost ran it back, but was tackled at the 40 yard line by [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. The Colts then drove down the field, only to have [[Mike Vanderjagt]] miss a 46-yard field goal attempt wide right.

====2006, Super Bowl XLI Champions====
{{main|2006 Indianapolis Colts season}}
[[Image:20070423-6 p042307sc-0224jpg-515h.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[White House]] ceremony honoring the Super Bowl Champion Indianapolis Colts.]]
After becoming the first team in NFL history to begin two consecutive seasons by winning nine games to begin [[2006 NFL season|2006]], the Colts proceeded to lose three of the next four, largely because of the league's worst run defense. However, they still captured their fourth consecutive [[AFC South]] title by defeating the [[2006 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in week 15 of the season with, ironically, a strong showing from their defense. The Colts finished the season with a 12â4 record, giving them the number three seed in the [[NFL playoffs, 2006â07|playoffs]]. The record also marked their [[Active NFL playoff appearance streaks|fifth consecutive season]] with ten victories or more. In week 13, against the [[2006 Tennessee Titans season|Titans]], the quarterback-wide receiver combination of Manning to Harrison became the all time leader in touchdowns in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Colts.com/sub.cfm?page=bio&amp;player_id=8|title=Official Bio on Colts.com|accessdate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Colts' first-round playoff game, they defeated the [[2006 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] 23â8, despite Manning throwing three interceptions. The Colts defense managed to hold the Chiefs to 44 yards on the ground and 2 yards passing in the first half. The Chiefs did not earn a first down until 3:33 remained in the third quarter. The Colts then defeated the AFC's #2 seed, the [[2006 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], 15â6 in the divisional playoff round in Baltimore. Adam Vinatieri kicked five field goals and the defense did not allow a touchdown.

The Colts advanced to their second AFC Championship Game in four seasons, and thanks to their arch-rivals, the [[2006 New England Patriots season|Patriots]], defeating the AFC's top-seeded [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], the Colts would host the game in the RCA Dome. This marked the first time an AFC Championship game had taken place inside a domed stadium. After trailing 21â3 late in the first half, the Colts stormed back, defeating the arch-rival Patriots 38â34. The 18-point comeback was the largest ever in an NFL conference championship game, and tied the record for the fourth largest NFL postseason comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=2006 NFL Record and Fact Book| isbn=1-933405-32-5| page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colts defeated the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 29â17 on February 4, 2007 in [[Sun Life Stadium|Dolphin Stadium]].  Rain fell throughout the game for the first time in Super Bowl history, significantly contributing to the six turnovers committed by both teams in the first half. [[Peyton Manning]] was awarded the [[Super Bowl MVP]] after completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, caught by Wayne.

Indianapolis became the first [[List of current National Football League stadiums|dome team]] to win a Super Bowl in an outdoor stadium, the first to win in the rain, and the first to win after having the statistically worst rushing defense in the league during the regular season. [[Tony Dungy]] became only the third man to have won the Super Bowl as both a head coach ([[Super Bowl XLI]]) and a player ([[Super Bowl XIII]]) (along with [[Tom Flores]] [[Super Bowl IV|IV]]-player, [[Super Bowl XV|XV]] and [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]]-coach and [[Mike Ditka]] [[Super Bowl VI|VI]]-player, [[Super Bowl XX|XX]]-coach), as well as the first African-American Head Coach to win a Super Bowl (a distinction that would have occurred regardless of which team won, as the Bears were coached by another African-American coach, [[Lovie Smith]]). 

With the win the Colts became the first team from the AFC South to win a Super Bowl.

====2007====
{{main|2007 Indianapolis Colts season}}

In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the Colts finished 13â3, winning a club-record fifth straight division title and becoming the first NFL team with five consecutive seasons with 12+ victories and became one of four NFL teams to open three consecutive seasons with 5â0 starts in topping [[2007 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]], 33â14. Indianapolis joined [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] (1929â31), [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota]] (1973â75) and [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]] (1999â2001) with three straight 5â0 starts. And then becoming the first team in 76 years to start three consecutive seasons with 7â0 starts. [[Peyton Manning]] (288) broke the club record for career touchdown passes held by [[Johnny Unitas]] (287), while Tony Dungy notched his 74th win to break the franchise record he had shared with [[Don Shula]] (73) and [[Ted Marchibroda]] (73). The club fell in the Divisional Playoffs to the [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]], 28â24. Dungy became the only coach in Colts history to post 10+ wins and earn playoff appearances in six straight seasons.

====2008====
{{main|2008 Indianapolis Colts season}}

The 2008 season was the Colts' inaugural season playing at the newly completed [[Lucas Oil Stadium]]. Indianapolis lost its first home game ever at Lucas Oil Stadium 29â13 to the [[2008 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] on ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' on the opening weekend of the [[2008 NFL Season]]. It was the first season that the Colts did not win the AFC South title since 2002. After a 3â4 start on the season, the Colts went on a nine-game winning streak and finished the season at 12â4 and earned a wild card berth in the [[NFL playoffs, 2008â09|playoffs]]. They extended their league mark with six consecutive 12+ victory seasons. The club became the first in NFL history to win at least seven consecutive games in five consecutive seasons. Manning won his third NFL MVP award, but Indianapolis fell in the Wild Card Playoffs in overtime to the [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|Chargers]] at San Diego, 23â17.

====2009====
[[Image:Reggie Wayne.JPG|thumb|right|145px|Colts' wide receiver [[Reggie Wayne]], 2010]]
{{main|2009 Indianapolis Colts season}}
[[Tony Dungy]] retired on January 12, 2009 and on January 13, [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] who had been named his successor previously, was formally announced as the new head coach.

Under their new coach, the Colts started off the season with 14 consecutive wins. On December 13, 2009, by virtue of a win over the [[2009 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], the Colts won their 22nd consecutive regular season game, setting a new NFL record for consecutive regular season wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=291213011|title=Manning, Colts fortify legacy with 22nd straight regular-season win |accessdate=2009-12-13|date=2009-12-13|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Colts suffered their first loss to the [[New York Jets]], 29â15, a game in which Caldwell made the controversial decision to rest his starters after the team took a slim lead rather than keep them in to play for a chance at a 16â0 season. Indianapolis finished the season at 14â2 following a loss to the [[Buffalo Bills]], in which they rested their starters with the stated purpose of having their team healthy for the playoffs. The Colts locked up home-field advantage throughout the [[NFL playoffs, 2009â10|playoffs]]. They defeated the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] by the score of 20â3 on January 16, 2010. The Colts defeated the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] 30â17 on January 24, 2010 in the 2009 [[AFC Championship Game]].

On February 7, 2010 the Indianapolis Colts played in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] against the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]]. The game was played at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. All four of the Colts' Super Bowl games have been played in Miami, with their first two games in the former Miami Orange Bowl and the last two in the current Miami stadium (which has changed names several times since its opening, most recently in January 2010). The Colts moved out to an early lead and went into halftime leading 10â6. The Saints came out of the half by recovering an onsides kick, and scored the go ahead touchdown to make it 13â10. The teams would exchange blows, making the score 24â17 late in the 4th quarter. Peyton Manning was leading the potential game tying drive with just over 3 minutes to play, but threw a game ending interception that was returned for a TD to seal the upset for the Saints.

====2010====
{{main|2010 Indianapolis Colts season}}
The Colts finished the season with a record of (10â6). The 2010 season marked the end of their consecutive seasons with at least 12 wins. This was largely due to the number of injuries the Colts suffered throughout the season. As the 3rd seed in the playoffs in the AFC, they played in a Wild Card game against the 6th seeded New York Jets. They lost on a game winning field goal as time expired by a score of 17â16.

====2011====
{{main|2011 Indianapolis Colts season}}
For their first pick in the [[2011 NFL draft]], and 22nd overall, the Colts selected offensive tackle [[Anthony Castonzo]] from [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. Peyton Manning was unable to play in the 2011 season due to neck surgery. The Colts signed [[Kerry Collins]] out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. He was placed on the injured reserve on October 26, 2011. They have started the season 0-12 and were eliminated from playoff contention.

On November 29th, the Colts fired defensive coordinator Larry Coyer and promoted linebacker's coach Mike Murphy to the DC position.

After 24 years of playing at the RCA Dome, the Colts moved to their new home Lucas Oil Stadium in the fall of 2008.  In December 2004, the City of Indianapolis and Jim Irsay agreed to a new stadium deal at an estimated cost of $1 billion (Including Indianapolis Convention Center upgrades). In a deal estimated at $122 million, Lucas Oil Products won the naming rights to the stadium for 20 years.

It is a seven-level stadium which seats 63,000 for football. It can be reconfigured to seat 70,000 or more for NCAA basketball and football and concerts. It covers {{convert|1800000|sqft|m2}}. The stadium features a retractable roof allowing the Colts to play home games outdoors for the first time since arriving in Indianapolis.

==Logos and uniforms==
The Colt's helmets in 1953 were white with a blue stripe. In 1954-55 they were blue with a white stripe and a pair of horseshoes at the rear of the helmet. For 1956 the colors were reversed. white helmet, blue stripe and horseshoes at the rear. In 1957 the horseshoes moved to their current location, one per side The blue jerseys have white shoulder stripes while the white jerseys have blue stripes. The team also wears white pants with blue stripes down the sides.

From 1982 through 1986, the Colts wore gray pants with their blue jerseys. The gray pants featured a horseshoe on the top of the sides with the player's number inside the horseshoe. The Colts continued to wear white pants with their white jerseys throughout this period, and in 1987, the gray pants were retired.

The Colts wore blue pants with their white jerseys for the first three games of the [[1995 NFL season|1995]] season, but then returned to white pants with both the blue and white jerseys. The team made some minor uniform adjustments before the start of the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]], including reverting from blue to the traditional gray face masks, darkening their blue colors from a royal blue to speed blue, as well as adding two white stripes to the socks. In 2006, the stripes were removed from the socks.

In 2002, the Colts made a minor striping pattern change on their jerseys, having the stripes only on top of the shoulders then stop completely. Previously, the stripes used to go around to underneath the jersey sleeves. This was done because the Colts, like many other football teams, were beginning to manufacture the jerseys to be tighter to reduce holding calls and reduce the size of the sleeves. Although the white jerseys of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] at the time also had a similar striping pattern and continued as such (as well as the [[Throwback uniform|throwbacks]] the [[New England Patriots]] wore in the [[Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving game]] against the [[Detroit Lions]] in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], though the Patriots later wore the same throwbacks in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] with truncated stripes and in [[2010 NFL season|2010]] became their official [[Third jersey|alternate uniform]]), the Colts and most [[college football|college]] teams with this striping pattern did not make this adjustment. Replica jerseys sold for retail still have the original striping pattern, though authentic game-day worn jerseys do have the partial striping pattern of the current jerseys.

The 2010 season will see the Colts with an âupdatedâ third jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;UniWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/ |title=Thereâs No Service Like Wire Service, Vol. 6 |date= |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==
===New England Patriots===
{{Main|ColtsâPatriots rivalry}}
The rivalry between the Indianapolis Colts and [[New England Patriots]] is one of the NFL's newest rivalries. The rivalry is fueled by the quarterback comparison between [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Tom Brady]]. The Patriots owned the beginning of the series, defeating the Colts in six consecutive contests, including the 2003 AFC Championship game and a 2004 AFC Divisional game. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship game on the way to their win in [[Super Bowl XLI]]. On November 4, 2007 the Patriots defeated the Colts 24â20; in the next matchup, on November 2, 2008, the Colts won 18â15 in a game that was one of the reasons the Patriots failed to make the playoffs; in the 2009 meeting, the Colts staged a spirited comeback to beat the Patriots 35â34; in the most recent 2010 game, the Colts almost staged another comeback, pulling within 31â28 after trailing 31â14 in the fourth quarter, but fell short due to a Patriots interception of a Manning pass late in the game. The nature of this rivalry is ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were division rivals from 1970 to 2001, it did not become prominent in league circles until after Indianapolis was relocated into the [[AFC South]].

===Earliest rivalries===
In the years 1953â66 the Colts played in the NFL Western Conference (also known as division), but were never known to have a significant rivalry with any of the other franchises in that alignment, seeing as they were the eastern-most team and the rest of the division included the [[Great Lakes]] franchises [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Chicago Bears]], and after 1961, the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The closest team to Baltimore was the [[Washington Redskins]], but they were not in the same division, and they were not very competitive at that time.

====New York Giants====
In [[1958 NFL season|1958]] Baltimore played its first NFL Championship Game against the 10â3 [[New York Giants]]. The Giants qualified for the championship after a tie-breaking playoff against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Having already been defeated by the Giants in the regular season, Baltimore was not favored to win, yet proceeded to [[NFL Championship Game, 1958|take the title in sudden death overtime]]. The Colts then repeated the feat by posting an identical record and routing the Giants in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1959|1959]] final. Up until the Colts' back-to-back titles, the Giants had been the premier club in the NFL, and would continue to be post-season stalwarts the next decade losing three straight finals. The situation was reversed by the end of the decade, with Baltimore winning the [[1968 NFL season|1968 NFL title]] while New York would arrive at continuously less impressive results.The Colts starting quarterback Peyton Manning and the Giants starting quarterback Eli Manning are brothers.

====Miami Dolphins====
Baltimore's post [[NFL-AFL merger]] passage to the AFC saw them thrust into a new environment with little in common with its fellow divisional teams, the [[New York Jets]], Miami Dolphins, [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Boston Patriots]]. Powered by QB [[Earl Morrall]] Baltimore would be the first non-AFL franchise to win a division title in the conference, outlasting the Miami Dolphins by one game, and leading the division since Week 3 of [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. The two franchises were denied a playoff confrontation by Miami's first-round defeat to the [[Oakland Raiders]], whereas Baltimore would win its first Super Bowl title that year.

Yet in 1971 the teams were engaged in a heated race that went down to the final week of the season, where Miami won its first division title with a 10â3â1 title compared to the 10â4 Baltimore record after the Colts won the Week 13 matchup between them at home, but proceeded to lose the last game of the season to Boston. In the playoffs Baltimore advanced to the AFC title game after a 20â3 rout of the Cleveland Browns, whereas Miami survived a double-overtime nailbiter against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. This set up a title game that was favored for the defending league champion Colts. Yet Miami won the AFC championship with a 21â0 shutout and advanced to lose [[Super Bowl VI]] to Dallas. In 1975 Baltimore and Miami tied with 10â4 records, yet the Colts advanced to the playoffs based on a head-to-head sweep of their series. In 1977 Baltimore tied for first for the third straight year (in 1976 they tied with Boston) with Miami, and this time advanced to the playoffs on even slimmer pretences, with a conference record of 9â3 compared to Miami's 8â4, as they had split the season series. The rivalry would in the following years be virtually negated by very poor play of he Colts, including a 0â8â1 record during the NFL's strike shortened 1982 season. In 1995, now as Indianapolis, the two both posted borderline 9â7 records to tie for second against Buffalo, yet the Colts once again reached the post-season having swept the season series. The following season they edged out Miami by posting a 9â7 record and winning the ordinarily meaningless 3rd place position, but qualifying for the wild card. The last meaningful matchup between the two franchises would be in the 2000 season, when Miami edged out Indianapolis with an 11â5 record for the division championship. The two then met in the wild-card round where the Dolphins won 23â17 before being blown out by Oakland 27â0. In 2002 Indianapolis moved to the newly created [[AFC South]] division and the rivalry was effectively retired. Yet until then the two had had a lively history, based usually on Indianapolis owning slightly better regular season records, but Miami winning both post-season meetings.
