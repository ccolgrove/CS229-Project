'''MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE''' is multinational company based in Germany that produces large-bore [[diesel engine]]s for railway-locomotives, [[marine propulsion]] systems, [[power plant]] applications and [[turbocharger]]s.  The company was formed in 2010 from the merger of [[MAN Diesel]] and [[MAN Turbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.man.eu/MAN/en/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/index.html?qry=/MAN-XML-Content/Pressrelease/Aktuelle_Pressemitteilungen/20100326_Fusion_Diesel_Turbo |title=MAN SE: Pressemitteilungen |publisher=Man.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo is a subsidiary of the German multi-national [[MAN SE]] corporation.

The Danish part of the company was formed out of the [[Burmeister &amp; Wain]] ship building company, and the marketing name for the largest two-stroke engines still has &quot;B&amp;W&quot; in it.
