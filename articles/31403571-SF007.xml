The '''Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1''' series is an [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[tablet computer]] produced by Samsung, introduced on 13 February 2011 at its Samsung Unpacked event in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Samsung Mobile [http://www.samsung.com/global/microsite/samsungunpacked/press/press2_1_detail.html &quot;Galaxy Tab Press Release&quot;], ''Samsung Mobile Press'', 13 February 2011, accessed 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It belongs to the next generation of the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab]] series, which consists of two 10.1&quot; models and the 8.9&quot; model.

== History ==
Samsung first showed a new Galaxy Tab model in January 2011 at the [[Mobile World Congress]] in Barcelona. The original model features a bigger 10.1&quot; HD display with a dual-core [[Nvidia]] [[Nvidia Tegra#Tegra 2 series|Tegra 2]] [[system-on-a-chip|SoC]], running Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] Honeycomb operating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gizmag.com/samsung-announces-slimmed-down-galaxy-s-ii-smartphone-and-upsized-galaxy-tab-101-tablet/17865/picture/130201/ |title=Samsung announces slimmed down Galaxy S II smartphone and upsized Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was to be released in partnership with Vodafone. It was set for a US release in March 2011 and a European release in April. However, after the iPad 2 release, some specifications were described as &quot;inadequate&quot; by Lee Don-Joo,&lt;ref&gt;Lee Youkyoung, [http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2011/03/04/9/0601000000AEN20110304009300320F.HTML &quot;Samsung sees iPad 2's thinness, price as challenges&quot;], ''Yonhap News Agency'', 4 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung's CEO, pointing to a possible model review or a rethink of their market strategy.

This led to introducing a new, slimmer model at the Samsung Unpacked Event during [[CTIA â The Wireless Association|CTIA]] Wireless convention in March 2011, and an 8.9&quot; model, pushing the release date back to 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infosyncworld.com/reviews/cell-phones/samsung-galaxy-tab-10.1-release-date-now-official/11891.html |title=Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 Release Date Now Official |first=Sindre |last=Lia |date=22 March 2011 |publisher=infoSync World |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US and &quot;early summer&quot; for the latter. Although there was no information about a delay of the European release date, it was announced that the prior design, seen at the Mobile World Congress, would be sold, labeling it as the ''Galaxy Tab 10.1V'', and was rapidly dumped by Samsung leaving customers aghast with the lack of support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-101V/144317045638159 |title=Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1V Support Community Aghast with lack of support |first=Chris |last=Davies |date=22 March 2011 |work=Slashgear}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 16 October, no Android 3.1 update for the 10.1V has been announced or confirmed. 

At [[Google I/O]] 2011, during the Android Keynote, Hugo Barra introduced the Galaxy Tab 10.1 to the public, announcing that Samsung would give one to every attendee, estimated at 5,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/10/samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-launching-in-about-a-month-google-giv/ |title=Google gives away 5,000 Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablets to devs at I/O |first=Vlad |last=Savov |date=10 May 2011 |work=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is labeled as the &quot;Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 Limited Edition&quot;. It sports a white Android-themed back cover, Android Debug Bridge, [[Fastboot]], and a 7000&amp;nbsp;mAh battery. The rest of specifications are in line with the 32 GB version of the Galaxy Tab.

== Software ==

The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 runs Android 3.1 while the 10.1V remains on 3.0.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitney |first=Lance |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20066443-251.html |title=Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 to ship with Honeycomb 3.1 |work=CNET.com |date=26 May 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsung has begun rolling out an over-the-air update to the new [[TouchWiz]] UX interface,&lt;ref&gt;
Cha, Bonnie [http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/mobile-working/2011/03/23/samsung-touchwiz-ux-for-tablets-hands-on-40092242/ &quot;Samsung TouchWiz UX for tablets hands-on&quot;], &quot;ZDNET&quot;, 23 March 2011, accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which will consist of:

* '''L!ve Panels:''' A set of custom widgets and panels which will provide additional contents to Honeycomb, like weather, calendar, and more. The widgets and panels are resizable, following a grid pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galaxytabs.com/2011/03/explanation-and-examination-of-touchwiz-ux-aka-touchwiz-4-0/ &quot;Explanation and Examination of TouchWiz UX aka TouchWiz 4.0&quot;], &quot;GalaxyTabs.com&quot;, 23 March 2011, accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mini Apps Tray:''' An additional dock-like bar which will give access to the most commonly used applications.
* '''Social Hub:''' An integrated messaging application which aims to center the user's social life, unifying the inboxes and timelines of multiple services like [[Gmail]], Facebook, Twitter, and many others, splitting them into &quot;Feeds&quot; (updates) and &quot;Messages&quot;.
* '''Reader's Hub:''' A store that will allow the user to download [[e-book]]s to the Galaxy Tab. Samsung claims that it will feature around 2 million books, 2,000 newspapers in 49 languages, and 2,300 magazines in 22 languages.
* '''Media Hub:''' A [[video on demand]] service, which will be available only in the US.
* '''Music Hub:''' A [[music on demand]] service, which will be available only in the US.

== Hardware ==

Both models of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 feature a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz dual-core processor, 1 GB RAM, and a 3-axis MPU-3050 [[gyroscope]] from InvenSense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tech Republic|title=Cracking down the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-101/6258363?seq=45&amp;tag=content;thumbnail-view-selector}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/itdojo/samsung-galaxy-tab-101-teardown-daintiest-of-the-android-tablets/2754 |title=Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 teardown: Daintiest of the Android tablets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all Honeycomb tablets, the number of buttons has been reduced: The usual ''Home'', ''Menu'', ''Back'', and ''Search'' buttons, which are present in most Android devices, are embedded in the notification and menu bar. The only physical buttons are ''Power'', ''Volume Up'', and ''Volume Down''.

The Galaxy Tab 10.1V and its slimmer version include stereo speakers. The 10.1V has two speakers on each side, the 10.1 one on each side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/photos/samsung-galaxy-tab-8-9-and-10-1-hands-on/#3989388 &quot;Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 and 10.1 hands-on&quot;], &quot;Engadget&quot;, 23 March 2011, accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Tab 10.1 retains the Samsung [[PDMI]]-like proprietary interface connector, which is used for both charging and data transfer. There is a keyboard dock for the 10.1 only. There are no accessories available for the 10.1V.

Both models will be shipped with a 2&amp;nbsp;MP front-facing camera. However, while the Galaxy Tab 10.1V has a 8&amp;nbsp;MP rear camera, the slimmer model has a 3&amp;nbsp;MP rear camera, due to volume reduction in the new models.

As stated by Omar Khan in the Samsung Unpacked Special Episode, the slimmer model also supports 4G connectivity and dual Wi-Fi a/b/g/n antennas, which can operate at 2.4 and 5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequencies. 

A USB host adapter was made available in June 2011. The dongle plugs into the 30-pin dock connector and allows [[USB]] compatible accessories such as keyboards, mice, and thumb drives, to be connected to the tablet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Tabâ¢ Adapter (USB)|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab-accessories/EPL-1PL0BEGSTA|work=Samsung.com|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other accessories have been released by Samsung in Australia or New Zealand for the 10.1V. 10.1 Accessories are not compatible with the 10.1V due the physical design differences.

==Reviews==
Initial reviews of the product were very good. [[CNET]] said it was &quot;the sexiest Honeycomb tablet in the market&quot;. [[TechSpot]] wrote: &quot;The Galaxy Tab 10.1 features a large, wide-screen display that looks sharp and bright, and it rests inside a body that is incredibly thin and light. This 10-inch tablet weighs less than a number of smaller tablets on the market, yet it still packs a dual-core 1GHz processor and the latest version of Android 3.1 Honeycomb.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet_web&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-10/4505-3126_7-34505347.html |title=Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 |date=6 July 2011 |publisher=CNET |accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samsungtabletpc.org |title=Samsung Tablet 10.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apple patent lawsuit==
Samsung's Galaxy Tab has become the subject of [[patent]] and [[industrial design right|design]] infringement lawsuits from Apple.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Reporter, [http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/165405/20110619/apple-lawsuit-upgrade-samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-infringement-intellectual-property-rights-ipad-2.htm &quot;Apple alleges Samsung of âslavishly copyingâ its technology; questions new Galaxy Tab 10.1&quot;], ''International Business Times'', 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has concurrent intellectual property infringement claims against other manufacturers, namely [[Motorola Mobility]] (MMI) and [[HTC]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Tiernan [http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2011/08/09/apples-injunction-could-cripple-samsung-says-ticonderoga/?mod=yahoobarrons &quot;Appleâs Injunction Could âCrippleâ Samsung, Says Ticonderoga&quot;] Barrons, 9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/samsungs-surfplatta-far-saljforbud &quot;Juridiskt brÃ¥k om Androidprodukter&quot;], DN.se. 10 August 2011. accessed 10 August 2011 {{se icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galaxy Tab's alleged infringements have resulted in injunctions being granted preventing sales of the computer in Australia that forced the cancellation of its launch there.&lt;ref&gt;via TechCrunch.com, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/samsung-postpones-australian-galaxy-tab-101-media-launch-event/2011/08/03/gIQAu0ptrI_story.html Samsung Postpones Australian Galaxy Tab 10.1 Media Launch Event], ''Washington Post'', 3 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung has voluntarily withheld sales of the tablet in good faith prior to the legal resolution, hence it is not available for official sale in Australia - a [[grey import]] market exists however. The legal substance of the suit is infringement of input gestures such as 'pinching' which were innovated by Apple.

On 10 August 2011, a German court granted a preliminary injunction pending a full hearing prohibiting Galaxy Tab 10.1 sales in the European Union (except in the Netherlands, where a second action is running).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|title=Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 imports banned in most of Europe|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/samsung-galaxy-tab-101-imports-banned-in-most-of-europe/2011/08/10/gIQAmnVr6I_blog.html|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Samsung is accused of violating 10 separate patents Apple holds on transmission of data and on wireless communications technology,&lt;ref name=hindu-aug11&gt;Halliday, Josh (11 August 2011).

The Dutch magazine Webwereld reported an investigation into evidence contrasting the two devices submitted to the German court by Apple, in which the Galaxy Tab pictured does not accurately reflect the product in terms of its shape. An example from the court document shows the Samsung device with aspect dimensions much closer to Apple's device, and the Samsung logo appears to have been digitally removed. Additionally, the Galaxy Tab is shown with the Application drawer in contrast to the iPad in its home screen, which gives the impression of a similar [[user interface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webwereld.nl/nieuws/107599/apple-levert-onjuist-bewijs-in-zaak-tegen-samsung.html |title=Apple levert onjuist bewijs in zaak tegen Samsung |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=15 August 2011 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/25065/Apple_Tampered_with_Evidence_in_German_Apple_v_Samsung_Case |title=Apple Tampered with Evidence in German Apple v Samsung Case |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August the injunction had been partly suspended on the grounds that the court may not have the authority to ban sales across the EU. The injunction would not extend beyond Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Galaxy tablet ban lifted in most of Europe |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/08/16/tech-us-samsung-apple-ban-idUKTRE77F45420110816 |work=Reuters |accessdate=16 August 2011 |first=Nicola |last=Leske |date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Galaxy Tab ban is on hold |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14548895 |work=BBC |accessdate=16 August 2011 |date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September a German court has upheld a ban on the sale of Samsung's Galaxy Tab, saying it did infringe Apple designs, a decision which Samsung intended to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=German court upholds Samsung ban |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14862553 |work=BBC |accessdate=10 September 2011 |date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling, however, affects only Germany; and the device continues to be available for sale within the country. The ruling was reported as &quot;having no practical consequences&quot; for Samsung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple wins German court ruling on Samsung tablets| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/09/us-apple-samsung-idUSTRE78828820110909| work=Reuters| accessdate=12 September 2011| date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October Australian Federal Court Justice Anabelle Bennett granted Apple's bid to continue an injunction against the sale of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15285028 | title=Apple wins battle to block Samsung tablets in Australia| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction prevents Samsung from selling its popular tablet until the lawsuit between Apple and Samsung is resolved or there is another court order to lift the injunction. However, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 remains readily available through online retailers and auction sites. On the 30th of November the injunction was overturned by the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Patel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/29/2599188/apples-australian-samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-ban-overturned-for-now|title=Apple's Australian Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 ban overturned for now | The Verge|last=Patel|first=Nilay|date=30 November 2011|work=theverge.com|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2011 Samsung released a new version of the Galaxy Tab called Galaxy Tab 10.1N to get around Apple's patent lawsuit. The new device now has the metal frame extending over the sides and repositioned speakers. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15773944 | title=Samsung redesigns Galaxy Tab after Apple's sales ban| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samsung Electronics will be allowed to sell its latest Galaxy tablet computer including Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 in Australia since December 3, 2011 after it won a rare victory against Apple and overturned a sales ban in the country. There are around 20 legal disputes in 9 countries including the U.S., South korea, Japan and the U.K. between Samsung and Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/a3fe672e-1b0b-11e1-8f1e-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1fBn7XogG |title=Samsung defeats Apple in court |date=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
