'''''Hizb al-Wasat al-Jadid''''' ({{Lang-ar|Ø­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙÙØ³Ø· Ø§ÙØ¬Ø¯ÙØ¯}}), translated in [[English language|English]] as the '''New Center Party''' but more commonly known as '''al-Wasat Party''', is a moderate [[Islam]]ist political party in [[Egypt]].

== Foundation ==
It was founded by {{link-interwiki|en=Abu al-Ila Madi|lang=ar|lang_title=Ø£Ø¨Ù Ø§ÙØ¹ÙØ§ ÙØ§Ø¶Ù}} in 1996 as a splinter group of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], whom Madi accused of having &quot;narrow political horizons.&quot; The creation of al-Wasat was criticized by the Brotherhood, which said Madi was trying to split the movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=New party shows deep political change in new Egypt |author=Mikhail, Sarah |author2=Perry, Tom |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/us-egypt-idUSTRE70O3UW20110219 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also not well received by the Egyptian government, which brought its founders before a [[Military tribunal|military court]] on the charge of setting up a party as an Islamist front. Al-Wasat tried to gain an official license four times between 1996 and 2009, but its application was rejected each time by the political parties committee, which was chaired by a leading member of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt; Political parties formed on the basis of religion have been banned by the [[Constitution of Egypt|Egyptian constitution]] since an amendment to Article 5 was [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2007|approved in 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cabinet.gov.eg/AboutEgypt/HTML/Constit_update2007_e.pdf |title=Constitutional Amendments of 2007 |publisher=[[Cabinet of Egypt]] |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition ===
Al-Wasat was granted official recognition on 19 February 2011 after a court in [[Cairo]] approved its establishment. The court's ruling was handed down in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], and made al-Wasat the first new party to gain official status after the [[Resignation of Hosni Mubarak|resignation]] of [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=After 15-year wait, Egypt's Wasat Party approved |first=Tom |last=Perry |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/egypt-politics-party-idUSLDE71I06320110219 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its newly acquired official status allows al-Wasat to compete in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|next parliamentary election]], and makes it the first legal party in Egypt with an Islamic background.&lt;ref name=&quot;IANS&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Egypt court approves country's first Islamic party |url=http://www.sify.com/news/egypt-court-approves-country-s-first-islamic-party-news-international-lctu4fiafed.html |format=Reprint |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=19 February 2011 |title=Egypt licenses first moderate Islamic party |journal=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=2011-02-20 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=208916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
The party asserts that its aim is to promote a tolerant version of [[Islam]] with [[Liberal movements within Islam|liberal tendencies]]. Its founder Madi highlights as proof of this openness the fact that two [[Copts]] and three women are among the party's 24 top members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=After years of trying, moderate Islamic party gets official recognition in post-Mubarak Egypt |first=Maamoun |last=Youssef |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jqgqVZUjLjXbA31l70QPM4H-X8GQ?docId=6004567 |agency=[[Canadian Press Enterprises Inc.|CP]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], al-Wasat &quot;seeks to interpret Islamic [[sharia]] principles in a manner consistent with the values of a liberal democratic system. Although al-Wasat advocates a political system that is firmly anchored in Islamic law, it also views sharia principles as flexible and wholly compatible with the principles of pluralism and equal citizenship rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Almasry Alyoum&quot;/&gt; The party's manifesto accepts the right of a Christian to become head of state in a Muslim-majority country.&lt;ref name=&quot;IANS&quot;/&gt; Its founder Madi likens its ideology to that of the Turkish [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP).&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;/&gt;
