Of his casting Bisson commented: &quot;Jai is a bit of a charmer and has an eye for the ladies but he's also a hard worker with a good business mind. I'm delighted to be joining Emmerdale at a time when the show is going from strength to strength. I can't wait to get started.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt; The show's series producer Gavin Blyth said of the family: &quot;The Sharmas are a young, contemporary family independent of their parents and will bring the factory into the heart of the village community. They will add real vitality to life in ''Emmerdale''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt; Bisson began filming his scenes on 21 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;

==Character Development==
On July 21, 2009, it was announced that three new cast members had been added to make up the new Sharma family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a166312/three-more-added-to-emmerdale-cast.html&lt;/ref&gt; Bisson said of his new role, &quot;Jai is a bit of a charmer and has an eye for the ladies but he's also a hard worker with a good business mind.&quot; Emmerdale producer Gavin Blyth described the family as &quot;a young, contemporary family independent of their parents and will bring the factory into the heart of the village community.&quot; In an interview on September 1, 2009, Bisson explained the Sharma backstory, that &quot;Jai had left the family business and set up a chain of mobile phone shops, sold them at the top of the market, and now has a load of money... Jai will take chances, he's a bit of a maverick, he can talk people round, he can get the best out of people and that's irritating for Nikhil because he's not at all like his big brother.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a174467/chris-bisson-on-the-sharmas-charity-and-west-is-west.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Holy Soap describe Jai's most memorable moment as: &quot;Informing brother Nikhil that he now owned the factory, rather than their father.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jai holysoap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Soap &gt; Emmerdale &gt; Cast &gt; Jai Sharma|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/emmerdale/cast/jai-sharma-8715|work=[[Channel Five]]|publisher=([[RTL Group]])|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
