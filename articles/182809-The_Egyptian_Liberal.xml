'''Gush Emunim''' ({{lang-he|×××© ×××× ××}}, ''Bloc [of the] faithful'') was an [[Israel]]i [[messiah|messianic]] and political movement committed to establishing [[Jewish]] settlements in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/alabasters_archive/gush_underground.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+12:14:47 ''Fundamentalism, Terrorism, and Democracy: The Case of the Gush Emunim Underground'' by ''Ehud Sprinzak''], Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Last accessed: 9 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While not formally established as an organization until 1974 in the wake of the [[Yom Kippur War]], Gush Emunim sprang out of the conquests of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, encouraging [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlement]] of the land based on the belief that, according to the [[Torah]], [[God]] gave it to the [[Jewish people]].&lt;ref&gt;Analyses of Gush Emunim have been carried out by [[David Newman (geographer)|David Newman]].

==Political affiliations==
Gush Emunim was closely associated with, and highly influential in, the [[National Religious Party]] (NRP). Nowadays they refer to themselves âand are referred to by the [[Israeli media]] asâ '''Ne'emanei Eretz Yisrael''' × ××× × ××¨×¥ ××©×¨×× (Hebrew: &quot;Those who are loyal/faithful to the [[Land of Israel]]&quot;).

== History ==
Gush Emunim was founded by students of Rabbi [[Zvi Yehuda Kook|Tzvi Yehuda Kook]] in February 1974 in the living room of [[Haim Drukman]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Lustick]], ''For the land and the Lord: Jewish fundamentalism in Israel,'' Council on Foreign Relations, 1988 p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gershom Gorenberg]], ''The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977,'' Times Books, Henry Holt &amp; Co., 2006 p.356.&lt;/ref&gt;, who is also credited with coining the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gorenberg, ''The Accidental Empire,'' p.356.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Drukman, its ideological and political core consisted of other disciples such as [[Hanan Porat]], [[Moshe Levinger]], [[Shlomo Aviner]], Eleazar Waldman, Yoel Ben-Nun and Yaacov Ariel.&lt;ref&gt;Lustick, ''For the land and the Lord,' p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kook remained its leader until his death in 1982.

In late 1974, an affiliated group named ''Garin Elon Moreh'', led by Rabbi [[Menachem Felix]] and [[Benjamin (Beni) Katzover]], attempted to establish a settlement on the ruins of the [[Sebastia (town)|Sebastia]] train station dating from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period. After seven attempts and six removals from the site by the [[Israel Defense Forces]], an agreement was reached according to which the [[Israeli government]] allowed 25 families to settle in the [[Kadum]] army camp southwest of [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]]. The [[Sebastia]] agreement was a turning point that opened up the southern [[West Bank]] to Jewish settlement. The small mobile home site housing 25 families eventually became the municipality of [[Kedumim]], one of the major settlements in the West Bank. The Sebastia model was subsequently copied in [[Beit El]], [[Shavei Shomron]], and other settlements.

== Ideology == 
Gush Emunim's beliefs were based heavily on the teachings of Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and his son, Rabbi [[Zvi Yehuda Kook|Tzvi Yehuda Kook]], who taught that [[secular]] [[Zionist]]s, through their conquests of ''[[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]]'', had unwittingly brought about the beginning of the Messianic age, which would culminate in the coming of the [[Moshiach|messiah]], which Gush Emunim supporters believe can be hastened through Jewish settlement on land they believe God has allotted to the Jewish people as set forth in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]. The organisation supported attempts to coexist with the Arab population, rejecting the [[population transfer]]s proposed by [[Meir Kahane]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/gush_em_eng.htm|title=Gush Emunim|work=Lexicon|publisher=Knesset|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the mass [[eviction]] of Jews from [[Gaza]] by the Israeli government[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/international/middleeast/30cnd-mideast.html?ex=1120795200&amp;en=150daf33c7731d94&amp;ei=5070&amp;emc=eta1], the violent eviction of Jews from [[Amonah]], and numerous other similar events on a smaller scale in more recent years, many members of the GE community have been having second thoughts about this [[ideology]]. For a fuller discussion of this recent issue, see [[Hardal#Ideological Crisis and Political Schism|Hardal]].
