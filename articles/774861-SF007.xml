'''Spyglass, Inc.''' (former NASDAQ ticker symbol SPYG), was an Internet software company  based in [[Champaign, Illinois]].

The company, founded in 1990, was an offshoot of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and created to commercialize and support technologies from the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). For several years, it focused on data visualization tools, such as graphing packages and 3D rendering engines.&lt;ref name=&quot;eric&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|title=Memoirs From the Browser Wars|date=15 April 2003|accessdate=16 February 2011|first=Eric|last=Sink}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1994, Spyglass licensed NCSA's [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] browser, with the intent to develop their own Web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945256/0000945256-99-000011.txt|title=Spyglass, Inc. Form S-3 filed July 19, 1999|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NCSA's development effort had resulted in different features, user interfaces, and codebases for each of its major platforms: [[UNIX]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Mac OS]]. Spyglass therefore created its own Mosaic codebase in which most source code and all features were shared between platforms. Spyglass Mosaic's codebase was then licensed to [[Microsoft]] and became the basis for their [[Internet Explorer]].

[[Netscape Communications Corporation]], co-founded by [[Marc Andreessen]], released its flagship [[Netscape Navigator]] browser in October 1994, and shortly Netscape was becoming the industry leader. Microsoft recognized the potential of the web, and wanting to get into the browser game as soon as possible, decided to license an existing browser rather than build one from scratch.

After Microsoft lost out to [[AOL]] for [[BookLink]]'s browser in November 1994, their talks with Spyglass heated up.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, James (1997), Overdrive, John Wiley &amp; Sons. ISBN 0-471-18041-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, Microsoft licensed Mosaic from Spyglass as the basis of [[Internet Explorer 1|Internet Explorer 1.0]], which was released as an add-on to [[Windows 95]] in the [[Microsoft Plus!]] software package. The deal stipulated that Spyglass would receive a base quarterly fee for the Mosaic license plus a royalty from Microsoft's Internet Explorer revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/january/new0122d.htm|title=MICROSOFT'S $8 MILLION GOODBYE TO SPYGLASS|accessdate=9 February 2011|first=Peter|last=Elstrom|date=22 January 1997|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft subsequently bundled Internet Explorer with Windows, and thus (making no direct revenues on IE) paid only the minimum quarterly fee. In 1997, Spyglass threatened Microsoft with a contractual audit, in response to which Microsoft settled for US$8 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;win&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/news2/microsoft-and-spyglass-kiss-and-make-up.aspx|title=Microsoft and Spyglass kiss and make up|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Thurrott|date=22 January 1997|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All versions of the Internet Explorer created before [[Internet Explorer 7]] (released October 18, 2006) acknowledged Spyglass as the licensor for the IE browser code. The About window on these versions contained the text &quot;Distributed under a licensing agreement with Spyglass, Inc.&quot;

==Web server technology==
Spyglass created and marketed the first commercially-supported [[web server]]. This product, variously marketed as the Spyglass Server and Server SDK, became available in July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945256/0000950137-97-004112.txt|title=Spyglass, Inc. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1997|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that date, the only web servers available were free and unsupported.

The Spyglass Server was also notable for being the first web server to include an [[application programming interface]] that allowed [[server-side]] applications to run in the server's process.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Spyglass did not offer their server as a retail product, instead licensing it to [[original equipment manufacturer]]s to distribute. The largest licensee was [[Oracle Corporation]].

==End of Spyglass==
On March 26, 2000, [[OpenTV]] bought out Spyglass in a stock swap worth $2.5 billion.  The acquisition was completed July 24, 2000. In the deal, they received both Device Mosaic, an embedded web browser, and Prism, a [[content delivery]] and transformation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/327661|title=OpenTV Buys Spyglass|last=Boulton|first=Clint|date=27 March 2000|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
