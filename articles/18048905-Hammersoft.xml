[[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] '''Jerauld Wright''', [[U.S. Navy|USN]], (June 4, 1898 â April 27, 1995) served as the Commander-in-Chief of the [[United States Joint Forces Command|U.S. Atlantic Command]] (CINCLANT) and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet#Cold War|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] (CINCLANTFLT), and became the second [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT) for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]), from April 1, 1954 to March 1, 1960, serving longer in these three positions than anyone else in history.

Following [[World War I]], Wright served as a naval aide for Presidents [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]].  A recognized authority on [[naval gunnery]], Wright served in the [[European Theater of Operations|European]] and [[P.T.O.: Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific]] theaters during [[World War II]], developing expertise in [[amphibious warfare]] and [[Coalition#Military|coalition warfare planning]].  After the war, Wright was involved in the evolution of the [[NATO#Military structures|military structure of NATO]] as well as overseeing the modernization and readiness of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet during the [[Cold War]].

Upon his retirement from the U.S. Navy, Wright subsequently served on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s National Board of Estimates (NBE) and as the [[United States Ambassador to China|U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of China (Taiwan)]].

==Early years==
[[File:Hw wright 01.jpg|thumb|right|Major General William M. Wright]]
Jerauld Wright was born on June 4, 1898, in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], the second son of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[William M. Wright]], [[United States Army]], (1863â1943) and the former Marjorie R. Jerauld (1867â1954), who also had another son, William Mason Wright, Jr. (1893â1977), and a daughter, Marjorie Wright (1900â1985).&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 1 - 3, 5; [http://www.look.net/gunstonhall/masonweb/p51.htm Jerauld Wright];  [http://www.look.net/gunstonhall/masonweb/p103.htm#i5188 William Mason Wright]; [http://www.look.net/gunstonhall/masonweb/p50.htm#i2508 William Mason Wright Jr.] &amp; [http://www.look.net/gunstonhall/masonweb/p103.htm#i5188 Marjorie Wright] - 
Descendants of George Mason, 1629-1686&lt;/ref&gt;

Life for young Jerry Wright was a succession of U.S. Army posts, such as [[Fort Porter]], [[Fort Omaha]], the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Presidio]], and the [[Jefferson Barracks]], as well as overseas tours of duty in [[Spanish-American War#Aftermath|Cuba]] and the [[Philippine-American War|Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 5 - 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping the family together while his father pursued an active military career was his mother, nicknamed &quot;The Field Marshal&quot; by her husband.  Jerry remembered his mother fondly: &quot;She was a tiger with her young.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerry's father was a veteran of the [[Spanish-American War]], the [[Boxer Rebellion]], and [[World War I]], during which he commanded the [[89th Division (United States)|89th Division]] in the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel offensive]] and the Third Corps.  He was a recipient of the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 1, 5, 45 - 49; Albert Bushnell Hart. ''Harper's Pictorial Library of the World War'' (New York: [[Harper &amp; Brothers|Harper]], 1920) p. 221 - 223&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the war, General Wright commanded the Ninth Corps at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]] and the [[Philippine Department|Department of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9805E4DF1531EF33A25750C1A9679C946395D6CF online] &amp; [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9805E4DF1531EF33A25750C1A9679C946395D6CF&amp;oref=slogin pdf] - ''[[New York Times]]'' - January 13, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; While his father was assigned to the newly-created U.S. Army General Staff before World War I, Jerry met [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 7 - 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Jerry accompanied his father on inspection tours of U.S. military installations in the Philippines. During this tour, he was deeply impressed the naval squadron visiting Manila.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 18 - 21&lt;/ref&gt;  His growing interest in a naval career was further encouraged by this father, giving his son a very practical perspective:

:Take a good look at the Navy.  Soldiers have to tramp miles, sleep in the mud, eat cold rations, and live for days in wet clothes.  Sailors have warm bunks, eat hot meals, and wear dry socks every day.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to going to the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], Jerry Wright attended the Franciscan Coligio de La Salle in Malate, California, and Shadman's School at Scott's Circle in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 18, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Naval Academy===
Jerauld Wright received an appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy]] from [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Edward W. Townsend]] of the [[New Jersey's 10th congressional district|Tenth Congressional District]] from the State of [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 23 - 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright entered the academy on July 31, 1914, the youngest [[Midshipman#United States Navy and Marine Corps|midshipman]] to enter the academy since the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright graduated on June 26, 1917 as part of the Class of 1918, ranked 92nd out of 193, the youngest member in his class.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Blue'' completed its [[shakedown cruise]], transitted the [[Panama Canal]], and joined  the Destroyer Division 7 (DesRon 7) as its [[flagship]], becoming a unit of the [[Battle Force]] based at the [[San Diego Naval Base]], [[San Diego, California|California]].  The ''Blue'' participated in [[Fleet Problem#Fleet Problem XX|Fleet Problem XX]] exercises staged in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 108, 112 - 114&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wright's final pre-war sea assignment was as the executive officer of the {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|6}}, a {{sclass|New Mexico|battleship}} based at the [[Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Naval Base]] in the [[Territory of Hawaii]], from March 1941 to May 1942.  The ''Mississippi'' became a unit of Battleship Division 3 (BatDiv 3) with sister ships {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|2}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomat'', p. 116 - 118&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' incident]] and the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939â1945)#Early skirmishes .28September 1939 .E2.80.93 May 1940.29|growing U-boat threat]], Battleship Division 3 was secretly shifted to the newly-reconstituted [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet#World War II|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], under the command of Admiral [[Ernest J.

====Shore duty====
[[File:BancroftHall1.png|thumb|right|[[Bancroft Hall]] - U.S. Naval Academy]]
Lt. Wright served as a naval aide for two Presidents of the United States, including [[Calvin Coolidge]] from September 1924 to June 1926, with additional duties as a watch and division officer on board the [[Royal yacht#Other Nations|presidential yacht]] {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1|2}},&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 78 - 87&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Hoover]] during his [[President of the United States#Oath of office and term of office|pre-inaugural]] goodwill tour of Latin America in November 1928.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 91 - 93; [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m7/mayflower-ii.htm USS ''Mayflower'' (PY-1)] - [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wright also served as aide to [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Henry L. Roosevelt]] from June 1935 to March 1936.  Wright subsequently served on board {{USS|Sequoia|AG-23|2}} during its commissioning and fitting-out period.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 100 - 101, 105 - 107; [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s10/sequoia-ii.htm USS ''Sequoia'' (AG-23)] - [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright developed an interest in gunnery and ordnance after he was turned down for [[naval aviation]] because he had [[exophoria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'',  p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;  His first tour of duty at the [[Bureau of Ordnance]] (BuOrd) was as a fire control section assistant, specializing in anti-aircraft equipment, from August 1929 to August 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warrior among Diplomats, p. 94&quot;&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'',  p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's second BuOrd assignment was with its supply and allowance division, involving ammunition distribution to the fleet, from June 1936 to July 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diplomats p. 105 - 106&quot;&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'',  p. 105 - 106&lt;/ref&gt;  Bureau chief Rear Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R.

Commander Wright served two tours at the [[United States Naval Academy]] as the Battalion Commander for the First Battalion, from June 1934 to June 1935, and the Battalion Commander for the Second Battalion, from June 1939 to March 1941.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 99 - 100, 114; Official Biography&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright earned two nicknames at the Naval Academy. The first, ''Old Iron Heels'' because he wore steel wedges on his shoes to alert midshipmen of his approach.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 99 - 100&lt;/ref&gt; His second nickname, ''Old Stoneface'' originated because of his ability to elicit confessions from offending midshipmen regarding disciplinary infractions without uttering a word.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Wright also served as the staff aide to the Commander [[Atlantic Squadron]] during the Midshipman's Practice Cruise in JuneâAugust 1940.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 114 - 116; Official Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
====Pearl Harbor aftermath, COMINCH, and London====

The USS ''Mississippi'' completed its overhaul in three weeks and transited the Panama Canal to re-join the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]], visiting [[San Francisco, California]] to re-assure its citizens in the aftermath of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warrior among Diplomats, p. 126&quot;&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1942, Captain Jerauld Wright was detached from the ''Mississippi'' for temporary duty on the staff of Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], the [[COMINCH#Reorganization in 1941|Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet]] (COMINCH), before being assigned to Admiral [[Harold R. Stark|Harold R. Stark's]] staff in [[London]], effective June 3, 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warrior among Diplomats, p. 126&quot;/&gt; Captain Wright was subsequently assigned to the planning staff of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who would lead the British-American invasion of North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]).  Wright's role would be to coordinate with his British counterparts regarding the Mediterranean landings in [[Algiers]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 133 - 134&lt;/ref&gt;

One growing concern for Eisenhower and his planners was the likely reaction of local French political and military leaders toward an Allied invasion of North Africa.  Strong French resistance could cause more casualties for the landing force.  One issue coloring French attitudes was their deep-seated resentment toward the British for the [[Attack on Mers-el-KÃ©bir]] in which the Royal Navy shelled the anchored French fleet in June 1940.  Another issue was working with officials connected to the [[Vichy French|Vichy government]] which could cause serious political and security complications.&lt;ref&gt;Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 135 - 138&lt;/ref&gt; Diplomat [[Robert D. Murphy]], the U.S. consul general in Algiers, spearheaded efforts to gather pre-invasion intelligence and cultivate diplomatic contacts in French North Africa, and Wright would find himself intimately involved in his pre-invasion activities.

====North Africa, Sicily, and Italy====
=====Operation Flagpole=====
[[File:Seraph.jpg|thumb|right|HMS ''Seraph'']]
On October 16, 1942, Captain Jerauld Wright was summoned to Operation Torch's staff headquarters at Horfolk House in London for important meeting with General Eisenhower, alongside other senior officers. Eisenhower informed the group that the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] had forwarded an urgent cable from U.S. diplomat Robert D. Murphy requesting the immediate dispatch of a top-secret high-level group to meet with GÃ©nÃ©ral Charles E. Mast, the military commander of Algiers and the leader of a group of pro-Allied officials in French North Africa.

The objective of this secret mission, code-named [[Operation Flagpole (World War II)|Operation Flagpole]], was to reach an agreement through Mast and his colleagues to have GÃ©nÃ©ral [[Henri Giraud]], a key pro-Allied French army officer, step forward, take command of French military forces in North Africa, and then arrange a ceasefire with the Allied invasion force.  Other alternatives, like [[Jean Darlan]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]], had been rejected by the British and American governments for a variety of political reasons.  Clark would be Eisenhower's personal representative, with Lemnitzer as the top invasion planner, Hamblen as the invasion's logistics expert, and Holmes serving as translator.  Wright would serve as the liaison with the [[French Navy]], with the specific objective of convincing the French to have their fleet anchored in [[Toulon]] join the Allied cause.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats''. p. 138 - 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The group flew in two [[B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses bombers]] to Gibraltar, and on October 19, they boarded the British submarine {{HMS|Seraph|P219|6}}, [[Lieutenant]] Norman Limbury Auchinleck &quot;Bill&quot; Jewell, [[Royal Navy|RN]],  commanding. ''Seraph'' then transported Clark's party  to the small fishing village of [[Cherchell]], located 82 mils (132 kilometers) west of Algiers.  After midnight on the evening of October 21, the ''Seraph'' surfaced and set Clark's mission ashore, where they met with Mast and Murphy.  Wright met with [[Ship-of-the-Line Captain|''Capitaine de vaisseau'']] Jean Barjot and learned that the French Navy was opposed to U.S. entry into North Africa, although the [[French Army|army]] and [[French Air Force|air force]] supported it.

On October 24, Clark's mission returned to the ''Seraph'' and later met a seaplane that flew them back to Gibraltar, arriving back in London on October 25 where Wright briefed Admiral Stark.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats''. p. 140 - 154; [http://home.cogeco.ca/~gchalcraft/sm/seraph.html HMS ''Seraph'']- British Submarines of World War Two&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Eisenhower and Clark recommended Jerauld Wright for a [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]] in [[Jerauld Wright#Citation excerpt .281942.29|recognition for his role in Operation Flagpole]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats''. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright's DSM was personally pinned by Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], during the [[Casablanca Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats''. p. 173; Official Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Operation Kingpin=====
With the preliminaries concluded during Operation Flagpole, the next task was to free GÃ©nÃ©ral Giraud (code-named Kingpin) whom the Vichy government had under house arrest for his anti-Nazi leanings at [[Toulon]] in southern France. On October 26, 1942, Captain Jerauld Wright was directed to take part in the mission to extract Giraud, code-named Operation Kingpin.  Because of intense anti-British sentiment among French officers, the mission would present an American face.  However, because there were no American submarines operating in the Mediterranean Sea, a novel solution was conceived with Wright taking command of the British submarine [[HMS Seraph (P219)|''Seraph'']].  As [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] G. B. H. Fawkes, [[Royal Navy|RN]], the commander of 8th Submarine Flotilla in the Mediterranean, noted:

:It was, I think, unique in the history of the two nations that a United States Naval officer should be placed in nominal command of a British submarine thereby making her the only warship on active duty to be commanded by two captains.

The ''Seraph'' got underway on October 27 and arrived off Toulon on October 30.  After several delays, Giraud and his party were brought on board, and a [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat subsequently flew Wright, Giraud, and the others back to Gibraltar, the new Operation Torch headquarters, to confer with generals Eisenhower and Clark.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 153 - 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.cogeco.ca/~gchalcraft/sm/seraph.html HMS ''Seraph''] - British Submarines of World War Two&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Jerauld Wright was awarded his first [[Legion of Merit]] in recognition of [[Jerauld Wright#Citation excerpt|his participation in Operation Kingpin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Biography&quot;&gt;Official Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Operation Torch=====
[[File:Operation Torch - map.jpg|thumb|right|Operation Torch landing zones]]
D-Day for [[Operation Torch]], November 8, 1942, saw over 73,000 American and British troops landed at [[Casablanca]], [[Oran]], and Algiers.  However, the most significant development was on the diplomatic and political front when U.S. consul general [[Robert D. Murphy]] alerted the Allied high command about unexpected presence of [[Admiral of the Fleet|''Admiral de la flotte'']] [[Jean Darlan]], the head of the [[Vichy French]] military, who was visiting his ill son in Algiers. Darlan's presence complicated the pre-invasion arrangements with GÃ©nÃ©ral [[Henri Giraud]]. Darlan pointed out to Murphy that he out-ranked Giraud whom Darlan maintained had little influence within the French military.

After a ceasefire was reached in Algiers, General Eisenhower sent a delegation to resolve the situation and broker a ceasefire with all French North African forces.  Captain Jerauld Wright accompanied General Clark who concluded that Darlan could, with certain conditions, deliver the general ceasefire and oversee the post-invasion occupation, and that Giraud lacked the political ability to accomplish these goals. Eisenhower endorsed Clark's recommendation, which caused a political firestorm within the Allied governments because of Darlan's connection to Vichy.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 164 - 168&lt;/ref&gt;  About Giraud and Darlan, Wright observed:

:Unfortunately, his stubbornness prevented him [Giraud] from being any help on D-day toward negotiating a ceasefire throughout French territory.  Because of an extraordinary coincidence [Darlan], his cooperation might not have made a difference anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral [[Harold R. Stark]] noted in Wright's December 1942 fitness report that:

:An officer of great ability, whose calm, assured habit of command inspires confidence alike in seniors and subordinates.  Excellent personal and military character.  Has performed two outstanding dangerous and secret missions.... Qualified for Flag rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warrior among Diplomats, p. 174&quot;&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], and the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] (CCS) made the decision to conduct shelve plans for [[Operation Sledgehammer]], and instead progress operations in [[Sicily]] ([[Operation Husky]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Operation Avalanche]]). Finally, Admiral Darlan was assassinated on December 24, 1942, and [[Charles de Gaulle]] would ultimately out-maneuver and marginalize [[Henri Giraud]] to become the sole leader of the [[Free French Forces|Free French movement]].

=====Operation Husky=====
[[File:USS Monrovia APA-31.jpg|thumb|right|USS ''Monrovia'']]
Captain Jerauld Wright joined the staff of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[H. Kent Hewitt]], [[U.S. Navy|USN]], the [[ComNavNAW|Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Northwest Africa Waters (COMNAVNAW)]], as its assistant chief of staff.

Hewitt would command the &quot;Western Naval Task Force&quot;, which would land [[U.S. Seventh Army#Invasion of Sicily|U.S. Seventh Army]] under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton#Sicily campaign|George S. Patton]] in the Gulf of Gela near [[Palermo]] for [[Operation Husky]], the Allied invasion of Sicily. [[Vice-Admiral#United Kingdom|Vice-Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay|Sir Bertram Ramsay]], RN, would command the Eastern Naval Task Force, which would land the [[British Eighth Army#Italian Campaign|British Eighth Army]] under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein#North Africa and Italy|Sir Bernard L. Montgomery]] near [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] Sir [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope#Allied Expeditionary Force .281943.E2.80.931946.29|Andrew B. Cunningham]], [[Royal Navy|RN]], would command all Allied naval forces for Operation Husky, and [[General (United States)|General]] Dwight D. Eisenhower, [[United States Army]], would be in overall command of the Sicily invasion.

The Western Naval Task Force consisted of three subordinated forces, Task Force 80 (code name ''JOSS'') under the command of Rear Admiral [[Richard Lansing Conolly|Richard L. Conolly]] to land the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)#Narrative|3rd Infantry Division]], Major General [[Lucian Truscott]] commanding, on beaches near [[Licata]]. Task Force 82 (code name ''DIME'') under Rear Admiral  land to [[1st Infantry Division (United States)#Deployment to War|1st Infantry Division]], Major General [[Terry de la Mesa Allen, Sr.#World War II|Terry de la Mesa Allen]] commanding, on beaches near [[Gela]]. Task Force 85 (code name ''CENT'') under the command of Rear Admiral [[Alan Kirk]] was to land the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]], Major General [[Troy Middleton]] commanding, on beaches near [[Scoglitti]].

Wright worked closely with his U.S. Army counterparts, and he considered Patton &quot;a great fellow&quot; who grew to appreciate the effectiveness of naval gun support for his landing force.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 169, 186&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wright was critical of Lieutenant General [[Carl A. Spaatz#World War II|Carl A. Spaatz]], [[USAAF]], and [[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)#World War II service|Sir Arthur Coningham]], [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], regarding the lack of cooperation on [[Close air support#Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Forces|close air support]] from the Allied air forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 183 - 184, 186 - 188&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright did praise Air Vice-Marshal Sir [[Hugh Pughe Lloyd]], RAF, for providing air support from [[Malta#British rule and World War II|Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The loading of ships and landing craft of the Western Naval Task Force was completed on July 8, 1943, with Vice Admiral Hewitt and his staff embarking on the [[USS Monrovia#World War II Atlantic Service|USS ''Monrovia'']], the invasion force's flagship.  D-Day was July 10, and Patton's troops stormed ashore and began their history-making drive for [[Messina]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 185 - 186; [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m13/monrovia.htm USS ''Monrovia'' (APA-31)] - [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Operation Avalanche=====
[[File:SalernoBeachhead1943 09 11 2400.jpg|thumb|right|Operation Avalanche - Salerno bridgehead at the end of September 11, 1943]]
[[Operation Avalanche]] was the Allied invasion of the Italian mainland with amphibious landings at [[Salerno]], with additional landing at [[Calabria]] ([[Operation Baytown]]) and [[Taranto]] ([[Operation Slapstick]]).

For the Salerno landing, Captain Jerauld Wright faced two major challenges in his capacity as the assistant chief of staff for U.S. Naval Forces, Northwest Africa Waters (NAVNAW), namely the shortage of U.S. escort vessels and a shortage of landing craft. While Wright was able to secure additional British escorts, landing craft would remain a persistent problem given the competing demands from [[Operation Overlord]] and the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]], with Wright noting:  &quot;[[Landing Ship, Tank|LST's]] don't grow on trees.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diplomats p. 191 - 192&quot;&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 191 - 192&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, two developments were welcomed by Wright and his fellow invasion planners, including U.S. [[escort aircraft carriers]] (CVE) would provide much needed off-shore [[close air support]] for the landing force, and the news that Major General E. J. House would oversee tactical air support for the ground forces using aircraft from of the Northwest African Air Force. 
However, Wright felt that the Army's decision to forgo pre-invasion naval gun bombardment was ill-considered, even for the sake of maintaining the element of surprise.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The invasion force got underway, with [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[H. Kent Hewitt]], Wright, and the NAVNAW staff embarked on the [[USS Ancon (AGC-4)#Mediterranean service|USS ''Ancon'']], Hewitt's flagship for Operation Avalanche.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 191; [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/a8/ancon-ii.htm USS ''Ancon'' (AGC-4)] - [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; While en route, Wright heard the announcement about the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Armistice with Italy]] by General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the supreme allied commander, on September 9.  While this removed the Italian military from the battlefield, German Army forces in Italy under [[Field Marshal General|''Generalfeldmarschall'']] [[Albert Kesselring]] were not bound by this agreement.  The immediate objective for Operation  Avalanche was to secure the [[Gulf of Salerno]] and capture [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Diplomats p. 191 - 192&quot;/&gt;

September 9, 1943 was D-Day for Operation  Avalanche as the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]], under the command of Major General Fred L. Walker USA, stormed ashore at Salerno under heavy fire from German tanks, artillery, and machine guns.  During the landings, on the morning of September 11, Wright witnessed a radio-controlled [[Fritz X|flying bomb]] severely damage the [[USS Savannah (CL-42)|USS ''Savannah'']], a [[Brooklyn class cruiser|''Brooklyn''-class]] [[light cruiser]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 193; [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s6/savannah-iv.htm USS ''Savannah'' (Cl-42)] - [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; A powerful German counter-attack on September 13 threatened to drive a wedge into the Salerno bridgehead, but it was beaten back by a powerful Allied air-land-sea assault, forcing a German retreat.  With the [[Fifth U.S. Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Mark Wayne Clark|Mark Clark]] driving for Naples, Admiral Hewitt and Wright returned to Malta to give a full report on Operation Avalanche to General Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Jerauld Wright was awarded a second [[Legion of Merit]] for [[Jerauld Wright#Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit|his contributions on Operation Husky and Operation Avalanche]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Biography&quot;/&gt;

=====USS ''Santa Fe'' (CL-60)=====
[[File:Battle Philippine sea map-en.svg|thumb|right|Battle of the Philippine Sea]] 
In October 1943, Captain Jerauld Wright was detached from U.S. Naval Forces, Northwest Africa Waters (NAVNAW) to take command of the [[USS Santa Fe (CL-60)|USS ''Santa'' Fe (CL-60)]], a [[Cleveland class cruiser|''Cleveland''-class]] [[light cruiser]], nicknamed the &quot;Lucky Lady.&quot; Wright relieved Captain Russell Berkey on December 15, 1943.  ''Santa Fe'' was the [[flagship]] of Cruiser Division 13, [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Laurance T. DuBose]] commanding, which also included [[USS Birmingham (CL-62)|USS ''Birmingham'' (CL-62)]], [[USS Mobile (CL-63)|USS ''Mobile'' (CL-63)]], and  [[USS Reno (CL-96)|USS ''Reno'' (CL-96)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 200, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  During December 1943, ''Santa Fe'' underwent amphibious training off [[San Pedro, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s5/santa_fe.htm USS ''Santa Fe'' (CL-60)] - [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships|DANFS]] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 13, 1944, ''Santa Fe'' set sail from California for the [[Marshall Islands]], as part of the invasion force for [[Operation Flintlock]].  ''Santa Fe'' served as an escort for the Northern Attack Force (Task Force 53), Rear Admiral [[Richard Lansing Conolly|Richard L. Conolly]] commanding, which was tasked to capture Roi-Namur and the northern half of the [[Kwajalein|Kwajalein atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 202; [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-M-Marshalls/USMC-M-Marshalls-2.html Chapter 2, p. 13] - ''The Marshalls: Increasing the Tempo''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Santa Fe'' joined the bombardment force (Task Group 53.5), Rear Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]] commanding, that provided naval gunfire support for U.S. Marine landing forces at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] which was secured on February 4.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 203; [http://pacific.valka.cz/forces/tf53.htm#flint Task Force 53 -- Operation Flintlock]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a lay-over at [[Majuro]], ''Santa Fe'' participated in air raids against [[Operation Hailstone|Truk]] and [[Saipan]] as part of [[Task Force 58]] during February 1944.  Captain Wright received a [[Jerauld Wright#Letter of Commendation|Letter of Commendation]] for his actions as the commanding officer of the ''Santa Fe'' during this engagement.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 203 - 204; Official Biography&lt;/ref&gt; From March 15 through May 1, 1944, ''Santa Fe'' was part of Task Group 58.2, Rear Admiral [[Joseph J. Clark]] commanding, which provided air support for amphibious landings at [[Landing on Emirau|Emirau Island]] and [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Hollandia]] while also participating in air raids against Japanese garrisons on [[Palau]], [[Yap]], [[Wakde]], [[Woleai]], [[Sawar]], [[Satawan]], and [[Pohnpei|Ponape]],as well as major air strike against the Japanese naval base at Truk.  ''Santa Fe'' also participated in the shore bombardment of Wakde and Sawar.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 204 - 208&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 1944, ''Santa Fe'' participated in [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|landings on Saipan, Guam, and Tinian]] ([[Operation Forager]]) as a part of the [[5th Fleet|U.S. Fifth Fleet]] under the overall command of Vice Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]].  On June 19, Japanese carrier aircraft began attacking the Fifth Fleet which remained close to the beachhead on orders from Spruance.  Wright concurred that this controversial decision was the correct one given the importance of protecting the landing force.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], ''Santa Fe's'' anti-aircraft guns helped to protect the fleet during these enemy air attacks while American naval aviators counter-attacked the Japanese fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 210 - 212&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, on June 20, ''Santa Fe'' ignored possible Japanese submarine activity when she turned on her lights to help guide returning American aircraft back to their carriers during highly hazardous night landings.  After air strikes on [[Pagan Island]], ''Santa Fe'' returned to [[Eniwetok]] for reprovisioning.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 209 - 212&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, ''Santa Fe'' joined Task Group 38.3, Rear Admiral [[Frederick C. Sherman]] commanding, for the invasion of [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]] and [[Battle of Angaur|Angaur]] (Operation Stalemate II) as part of the [[U.S. Third Fleet]] under the overall command of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William F. Halsey]], and carrier air attacks to neutralize Japanese air bases on [[Babelthuap]] and [[Koro Island|Koro]] in preparation for the upcoming [[Philippines campaign (1944â45)|Philippines campaign]] led by [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 212 - 215&lt;/ref&gt; During air raids on [[Taiwan|Formosa]] in October, the [[heavy cruiser]] [[USS Canberra (CA-70)|''Canberra'']] and [[light cruiser]] [[USS Houston (CL-81)|''Houston'']] were seriously damaged by [[aerial torpedo]]es.  ''Santa Fe'' was part of a covering force (Task Force 30.3), nicknamed &quot;CripDiv 1,&quot; formed to protect the damaged cruisers as they were being towed back for Ulithi for repairs.  The final engagements that Wright participated in as the commanding officer of the USS ''Santa Fe'' were the [[Battle of Leyte|invasion of Leyte]] and the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 215 - 222&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Jerauld Wright received the [[Silver Star]] in recognition of [[Jerauld Wright#Silver Star|his participation in the towing of the ''Canberra'' and ''Houston'' back to Uliti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Biography&quot;/&gt;

=====Amphibious Group Five=====
[[File:Operation Iceberg - Kerama Retto - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Operation Iceberg - Kerama Retto (1945)]]
In November 1944, Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright took command of Amphibious Group Five, a newly-created unit of the [[Amphibious Forces Pacific|Amphibious Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], commanded by Vice Admiral [[Richmond Kelly Turner]].  Wright's group would be involved in the invasion of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] ([[Operation Iceberg]]), the island of [[Okinawa]] being the key objective.  Once taken, U.S. forces would use Okinawa as a staging area for the [[Operation Downfall|eventual invasion of Japan]], and a base for the [[B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress bombers]] of the [[Seventh Air Force#World War II|U.S. Seventh Air Force]] to attack the [[Japan|Japanese home islands]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p.222- 223; [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/Transport/transport-1.html#s5 Chapter I, Section 5] - TRANSPORT DOCTRINE, Amphibious Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet - September 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibious Group Five would transport the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], Major General [[Thomas E.

For Operation Iceberg, Wright's force was designated Demonstration Group Charlie (Task Group 51.2), whose mission was to serve as a decoy force working in conjunction with the Southern Attack Force (Task Force 55) commanded by Rear Admiral [[John L. Hall]] while the Western Islands Group (Task Group 51.1) under Rear Admiral [[Ingolf N. Kiland]] and the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)#Combat Chronicle 2|77th Infantry Division]] secured [[Kerama Retto]] and other offshore islands before landing at [[Ie Shima]].  Task Group 51.2 would subsequently serve as a floating reserve for the [[Tenth United States Army|U.S. Tenth Army]] (Task Force 56), commanded by Lieutenant General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr.|Simon B. Buckner]], [[United States Army|USA]], before returning to Saipan.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p.223- 224; [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/BBBO/BBBO-25.html Chapter 25], [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/BBBO/BBBO-26.html Chapter 26], [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/BBBO/BBBO-27.html Chapter 27] - ''Beans, Bullets and Black Oil'' by Admiral Worrall Reed Carter, USN - HyperWar; [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_okinawa1.html#usnavy Navy] - Operation Iceberg: The Assault on Okinawa - The Last Battle of World War II (Part 1) April - June 1945 - Historyof War.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright was ordered to [[Pearl Harbor]] to begin planning the invasion of the Japanese home islands, which would begin with Operation Olympic, the invasion of the southern island of [[KyÅ«shÅ«]].  Wright's Amphibious Group Five would be part of the 5th Amphibious Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Harry W. Hill, which would land the [[V Amphibious Corps]] (VAC) on the west coast in the [[Kaminokawa]] - [[Kushikino]] area.  Amphibious Group Five would consist of four old battleships, ten cruisers, fourteen destroyers, and seventy-four support craft.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p.226; [http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/arens/chap2.htm Chapter 2 - V Amphibious Corps] - ''V [Marine] Amphibious Corps Planning for Operation Olympic and the Role of Intelligence in Support of Planning'' by Major Mark P.

====Operational Readiness Division====
In October 1945, Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright joined the Office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (OPNAV) as the head of its Operational Readiness Division, helping to organize this newly-created organization.  Other OPNAV divisions created were Plans (OP-31), Combat Intelligence (OP-32), Operations (OP-33), and Anti-submarine Warfare (OP-35) within the Chief of Naval Operations.  Wright organized OP-34 into four sections, and working with his sister divisions, Wright directed the development of a host of manuals on tactical doctrine based upon experience from World War II.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 233 - 236; [http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/038.html#38.5 Record Group 38.5] - Record Group 38:  Records of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OCNO), 1875-1993 - [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archive]] - [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Wright involved civilian [[think tanks]], such as the [[Center for Naval Analyses#History|Operation Evaluation Group (OEG)]], in projects undertaken by OP-34.  CNO [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz#Post war|Chester W.

[[File:USSTaconic(AGC-17).jpg|thumb|right|220px|USS ''Taconic'' (AGC-17)]]
On November 24, 1948, Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright assumed command of Amphibious Forces U.S. Atlantic Fleet ([[ComPhibLant|COMPHIBLANT]]), a position that he held through November 1, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/guides/rosters/amphib_atl.htm List of Commanders of Amphibious Force, US Atlantic Fleet] - Naval Historical Division - U.S. Department of the Navy&lt;/ref&gt;  Based at the [[Norfolk Naval Station]], Wright would be responsible for three major subordinate commands, Amphibious Group Two, Amphibious Group Four and the [[Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base]]. COMPHIBLANT also included Amphibious Training, an Amphibious Air Control Group, a Naval Beach Group, a Detached Group, and a Mediterranean Group.  Wright's [[flagship]] was the [[USS Taconic (AGC-17)|USS ''Taconic'' (AGC-17)]],  an ''Adirondack''-class amphibious force command ship.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 240 - 24&lt;/ref&gt;  The most significant accomplishment during Wright's tour of duty as COMPHIBLANT was [[PORTREX]], a multi-service amphibious assault exercise held from February 25 to March 11, 1950.  PORTREX was the largest peacetime amphibious exercise up to that time and it was staged to evaluate joint doctrine for [[combined operations]], test new equipment under simulated combat conditions and provide training for the defense of the Caribbean.

Over 65,000 men and 160 ships were involved, and it was climaxed by a combined amphibious and [[air assault|airborne]] assault on [[Vieques Island]], a first in military history.  The success of PORTREX offered a prelude for future amphibious operations, including the [[Battle of Incheon|landings at Inchon]] during the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', pp. 240 - 249; [http://www.valerosos.com/PreludetoInchon.html ''Prelude to Inchon: The Puerto Rico Exercises of 1950'' by Col Gilberto Villahermosa, U.S. Army (July 2004)] - The 65th Infantry Regiment; [http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/avchr7.htm ''Naval Aviation Chronology 1950-1953'' - March 8, 1950] - [[Naval Historical Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jerauld Wright received his [[Vice admiral (United States)|third star]], effective September 14, 1950, at the conclusion of his tour of duty as COMPHIBLANT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Biography&quot;/&gt;

S. Armed Forces, 1945-1950,&quot; p. 11-21] in Ronald H. Cole, et al., ''The History of Unified Command 1946-1993'' (Washington, DC: Joint History Office of the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's operational control over the Sixth Fleet proved to be a source of friction with [[Admiral (United Kingdom)|Admiral]] [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], [[Royal Navy|RN]], NATO's Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Mediterranean (CINCAFMED).  Mountbatten felt that the Sixth Fleet should be assigned to his command while Wright wanted to maintain control of the fleet, particularly its nuclear-armed aircraft carriers, pursuant to both U.S. Navy policy and [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Federal law]]. The dispute tested the diplomatic skills of both men.  CINCNELM forces participated in NATO Operation Mariner and Operation Weldfast exercises during 1953, and units of the Sixth Fleet did participate in NATO exercises while staying under U.S. control.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 279, 287 - 288; [http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/9.htm Chapter 9: The increase in strength - International Exercises] - NATO the first five years 1949-1954&lt;/ref&gt;

As CINCNELM, Wright maintained strong diplomatic ties with allies within his area of responsibility.  He made a 14-day goodwill trip to the Middle East that culminated with a courtesy call with the newly-crowned [[List of kings of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|Saud bin Abdul Aziz]] in [[Jidda]], [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 279 - 280&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Wright attended the coronation ceremonies of [[List of kings of Jordan|King]] [[Hussein of Jordan|Hussein]] of [[Jordan]] in May 1953.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 279, 286&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1953, Wright served as the senior U.S. Navy representative at the coronation pageant of [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]], including flying his flag from the heavy cruiser [[USS Baltimore (CA-68)|USS ''Baltimore'']] during the [[Coronation Naval Review#Elizabeth II|Coronation Naval Review]] of [[Spithead]] on June 15.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 287 - 289&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral Wright also made the arrangements for [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] [[Winthrop Aldrich]] to present a bronze plaque of [[John Paul Jones]] from the [[Naval Historical Center|U.S. Naval Historical Center]] to the British government, initiating [[Jerauld Wright#John Paul Jones Cottage.2Fbirthplace museum|his long-time association]] with the famous naval hero of the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 290 - 291&lt;/ref&gt;

During a high-level conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] from October 20 to November 4, 1953, Wright was informed that that CINCNELM was be become a sub-ordinate command of the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet#Cold War|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] reporting directly to Admiral [[Lynde D. McCormick]], the Commander-in-Chief U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT).  Also, Wright would become the head of NATO's Eastern Atlantic Area, reporting to Admiral McCormick, the first [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warrior among Diplomats, p. 292&quot;&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; Jeruald Wright was promoted to the rank of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] effective April 1, 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Biography&quot;/&gt;

====Atlantic Command====
[[File:Eisenhower in the Oval Office.jpg|thumb|right|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]]
Admiral Wright's final command assignment proved to be the most challenging undertaking in his career as he literally took on three concurrent roles, namely Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command (CINCLANT) and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) of [[NATO|NATO's]] Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT). While his nomination to become CINCLANTFLT and CINCLANT was made by the [[President of the United States]], subject to the [[Advice and consent#United States|advice and consent]] of the [[United States Senate]], Wright's appointment to become SACLANT was subject to the approval of the [[North Atlantic Council]]. Fortunately, Wright was a known commodity since he had served Wright had served as the deputy U.S. representative to NATO's Standing Group from November 1950 to February 1952.

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] noted in his February 1, 1954 announcement: 

:I feel that Admiral Wright is extremely well qualified to perform the duties of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic. Admiral Wright has extensive background and naval command experience in positions of vital importance and he is an officer of outstanding character and ability. Admiral Wright has served as Deputy U.S. Representative to the Standing Group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is thoroughly cognizant of the duties and responsibilities of SACLANT. I feel that Admiral Wright will uphold and carry forward the fine traditions and worthy objectives sought by all the NATO nations. I have every confidence that Admiral Wright can make an outstanding contribution to our common defense effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=10161 Statement by the President on the Appointment of Admiral Jerauld Wright as Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic] dated February 17, 1954 - John Woolley and Gerhard Peters, The American Presidency Project [online]. Santa Barbara, CA: University of California (hosted), Gerhard Peters (database). Available from World Wide Web&lt;/ref&gt;

Admiral Jerauld Wright assumed command of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, the U.S. Atlantic Command, and Allied Command Atlantic on April 12, 1954, relieving Admiral [[Lynde D. McCormick]] who had been the first Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic.

=====Command structure and responsibilities=====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NATO Allied Command Atlantic - July 1954.svg|thumb|right|SACLANT organizational chart]] --&gt;
Admiral Wright's command responsibilities included acting as Commander-in-Chief U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), one of the two major fleet commands within the U.S. Navy with responsibility  for all naval operations throughout the Atlantic Ocean; Commander-in-Chief U.S. Atlantic Command (CINCLANT), a [[Unified Combatant Command|unified command]] responsible for U.S. military operation throughout the Atlantic Ocean geographical region;&lt;ref name=&quot;shsu.edu&quot;/&gt; and [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (SACLANT), one of the two [[Supreme Allied Commander#NATO|principal military commands]] for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), responsible for keeping the sea lanes open between the United States and Europe.

=====Fleet modernization=====
Admiral Jerauld Wright inherited a U.S. Atlantic Fleet in transition as the U.S. Navy was going through a modernization period to replace warships and aircraft built during World War II.

=====Fleet readiness=====
[[File:Jerauld Wright.jpg|thumb|right|Lantflex I-57: President Eisenhower, Navy Secretary Gates, Admiral Burke, and Admiral Wright (l-r)]]
For Admiral Jerauld Wright, the best method to evaluate fleet readiness for the U.S. Atlantic Fleet was the staging and execution of naval exercises like Lantflex I-57. Among the high-level observers for this naval exercise were the [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and many other members of the US cabinet. The highlight of Lantflex I-57 was the landing of two [[A3D]] Sky Warriors and two [[F8U]] Crusaders on board the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']] that had been launched from the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']] operating in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], the first carrier-to-carrier transcontinental flight in history.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 341 - 346; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,867702,00.html &quot;Victory at Sea&quot;] - [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] - Monday, June 17, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other Atlantic Fleet exercises included Operation Springboard, the annual winter naval maneuvers in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Units of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and the [[Royal Canadian Navy#Cold War|Royal Canadian Navy]] participated in Operation Sweep Clear III, a bilateral [[Naval mine|mine warfare]] exercise, between July and August 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in 1960, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet  initiated UNITAS, an annual multilateral series of exercises between the South Atlantic Force (SOLANTFOR) and [[Latin America]]n navies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciponline.org/facts/unit.htm Exercise: UNITAS] - [[Center for International Policy]]&lt;/ref&gt; As SACLANT, Wright coordinated such NATO naval exercises as Operation Sea Watch, a convoy escort exercise.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most significant naval exercise during Admiral Wright's tour of duty was [[Operation Strikeback]], a ten-day exercise involving over 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft during September 1957, which was the largest naval exercise staged by NATO up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 333 - 335, 338; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891351,00.html &quot;Emergency Call&quot;] - [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'']] - Monday, September 30, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; Under Admiral Wright, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet also took the lead on the field of operational testing and evaluation (OT&amp;E) of systems and tactics, particularly regarding anti-submarine warfare for the United States Navy, with the [[Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR)|Operational Development Force (OPDEVFOR)]], under the command of [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] William D. Irvin, serving as the lead agency for this effort.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 363 - 365&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in February 1959, when several [[Submarine communications cable|transatlantic cables]] off [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] were cut and the [[Naval trawler|Soviet fishing trawler]] [[Novorossisk Incident|MV ''Novorossisk'']] operating in the vicinity at the time of the break, the radar-picket ASW destroyer [[USS Roy O. Hale (DE-336)|USS ''Roy O. Hale'' (DER-336)]] was dispatched to enforce the 1884 Convention for the Protection of Submarine Cables. On the August 26, the ''Hale'' sent a boarding party to the ''Novorossisk'' to investigate and determined that there were no indications of intentions &quot;other than fishing.&quot;  A diplomatic protest was lodged, but there were no more breaks.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 362 - 363; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,825640,00.html &quot;Visit &amp; Search&quot;] - [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] - Monday, March 9, 1959; [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810862,00.html?promoid=googlep &quot;Strong Presumption&quot;] - [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] - Monday, April 6, 1959; James Cable.

=====Anti-submarine warfare=====
[[File:USN Photo - 1043094 - ASW Task Force ALFA 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Task Force Alfa (1959)]]
Admiral Jerauld Wright stated in a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article from 1958 that: &quot;The primary mission of every combat ship in the Atlantic Fleet is antisubmarine. Everything else is secondary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,863701,00.html &quot;The Goblin Killers&quot;] - [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] - Monday, September 1, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Given his previous exposure to [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) doctrine at OP-34, Wright was a natural fit for overseeing the anti-submarine renaissance during his tour of duty as CINCLANTFLT.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 237 - 238&lt;/ref&gt; One significant innovation was the Sound Surveillance System ([[SOSUS]]), a network of underwater hydrophones and listening posts designed to track the movement of submarines.  The first operational test of SOSUS was done during the ASDevEx 1-54 exercise from April 6 to June 7, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'' (2004), p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, 1958 news accounts about the growing threat of the Soviet [[submarine snorkel|snorkel]]-equipped diesel-electric submarine force began to gain the attention of the American public.  [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Director [[Allen Dulles]] was reported to have said that ten missile-carrying Soviet submarines could destroy 1600 square miles (4144&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of the industrial-rich eastern seaboard in a sneak attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,863224,00.html?iid=chix-sphere  &quot;Antisubmarine Boss&quot;] - [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] - Monday, April 7, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, an [[Associated Press]] dispatch, dated April 14, 1958, quoted [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Carl Durham]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[North Carolina]], who said that 184 [[Soviet Navy#Submarines|Soviet submarines]] had been sighted off the U.S. Atlantic coast during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Sontag and Drew. [[Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage|''Blind Man's Buff'']], p. 299 - 300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO) [[Arleigh Burke|Arleigh A. Burke]] had responded on April 1 by creating [[Task Force Alfa (U.S. Navy ASW/HUK)|Task Force Alfa]], a [[Hunter-killer armored-vehicle team|hunter-killer]] (HUK) flotilla under the command of [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[John S. Thach]], which would develop new ASW tactics to counter this growing Soviet submarine threat.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Unraveling and Revitalization of U.S. Navy Antisubmarine Warfare&quot; by John R.

Admiral Wright's [[Jerauld Wright#Jerauld Wright Award|personal contribution]] provided the first look at a missile-armed Soviet submarine, a [[Zulu class submarine|Project AV611/Zulu-V]] variant armed with two [[Scud missile#R-11|R-11FM/SS-1b Scud-A ballistic missiles]].&lt;ref&gt;Sontag and Drew.

=====Showing the flag=====
[[File:International Naval Review - 1957.jpg|thumb|right|International Naval Review (1957)]]
One example of [[soft power]] regarding [[sea power]] is showing the flag. In his capacity as CINCLANT/CINCLANTFLT/SACLANT, Admiral Wright and his staff participated 18 formal presentations and 62 NATO and joint military planning meetings during his six-year tour of duty in these positions.&lt;ref&gt;''Warrior among Diplomats'', p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final change of command and retirement===
The [[White House]] announced on December 31, 1959, that Admiral Jerauld Wright was stepping down as CINCLANTFLT/CINCLANT/SACLANT, with [[President of the United States|President]] Dwight D. Eisenhower reflect wider sentiment when he noted:

:I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal thanks and that of the American people for the services which you have performed over a period of the last six years. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization represents an endeavor on the part of fifteen free nations, the success of which is vital to the security and well-being of the United States. Thus, the position of Commander of one of the major commands of this organization is one of the greatest responsibility. The leadership and judgment which you have displayed in this capacity have been a source of deep satisfaction to me personally, and I know has won the great admiration not only of the nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but of all the Free World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=11657 August Letter to Admiral Jerauld Wright on His Release From the Position of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic] dated December 31, 1959 - John Woolley and Gerhard Peters, The American Presidency Project [online].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:USS Grenadier (SS-525) - 0852501.jpg|thumb|right|200px|USS ''Grenadier'']] --&gt;
In light of the growing threat of Soviet submarine activity within his command area, as well as in retaliation for the recent aggressive [[Depth charge|depth-charging]] of the {{USS|Gudgeon|SS-567|6}} near [[Vladivostok]], Admiral Wright issued the following challenge:

:''Whereas, the presence of unidentified submarines in the approaches to the United has been frequently reported, and''

:''Whereas, the submarines have been uncooperative in declaring either their identity and their intent as is required by the customs and usages of honorable seamen, and''

:''Whereas, tangible evidence that these surreptitious are being conducted would result in appropriate embarrassment to those involved.''

:''Therefore I do hereby pledge to donate one case of Jack Daniels Old No. 7 Brand of Quality Tennessee Sour Mash Corn Whiskey, made as our fathers made it for seven generations at the oldest distillery n the United States, established in 1866, to the first Scene of Action commander who evidence that a &quot;non U.S. or known friendly&quot; submarine has been worn out.''
