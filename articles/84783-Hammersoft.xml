'''Jane Mallory Birkin''', [[Order of British Empire|OBE]] (born 14 December 1946)&lt;ref name=ALLMUSIC&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p25150/biography|pure_url=yes}} Profile at Allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[England|English]]-born actress and singer who lives in [[France]]. In recent years she has written her own album, directed a film and become an outspoken proponent of [[democracy]] in [[Burma]].

== Early life ==

Jane Mallory Birkin was born on 14 December 1946, in [[Marylebone]], [[London]]. Her mother, [[Judy Campbell]], was an English actress, best known for her work on stage. Her father, David Birkin, was a [[Royal Navy]] [[lieutenant-commander]] and [[World War II]] [[espionage|spy]]. Her brother is the screenwriter and director [[Andrew Birkin]]. She was educated at Upper Chine School, [[Isle of Wight]].

== Career ==

Birkin emerged in the [[Swinging London]] scene of the 1960s, appearing briefly in the 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'', and as the fantasy-like model in the psychedelic ''[[Wonderwall (film)|Wonderwall]]'' from 1968. That same year, she auditioned in France for the lead female role in ''Slogan''. Though she did not speak [[French language|French]], she won the role. She co-starred with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], and performed with him on the film's theme song, &quot;La chanson de slogan&quot; &amp;mdash; the first of many collaborations between the two. In 1969, she and Gainsbourg released the duet &quot;[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]&quot; (&quot;I love you... me neither&quot;). Gainsbourg originally wrote the song for [[Brigitte Bardot]]. The song caused a scandal for its sexual explicitness, and was banned by radio stations in [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and the [[UK]]. 

''Je t'aime'' made UK chart history in that on 4 October 1969 and the following week on 11 October. The song was at two different chart positions even though it is the same song, the same artists, and the same recorded version. The only difference was that they were on different record labels. It was originally released on the Fontana label, but due to its controversy, Fontana withdrew the record which was then released on the Major Minor label. Because there were Fontana singles still in the shops along with the Major Minor release, on 4 October 1969 the Major Minor release was at number 3 and the Fontana single at number 16. Also at that time it was the biggest ever selling single for a completely foreign language record. She appeared on Gainsbourg's 1971 album ''[[Histoire de Melody Nelson]]'', portraying the [[Lolita]]-like protagonist in song and on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/serge-gainsbourg-histoire-de-melody-nelson.htm Serge Gainsbourg - Histoire De Melody Nelson - On Second Thought - Stylus Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jane Birkin07.JPG|thumb|225px|Birkin in 1985]]

She took a break from acting in 1971â72, but returned as Brigitte Bardot's lover in ''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]'' in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt; In 1975, she appeared in Gainsbourg's first film, ''[[Je t'aime... moi non plus (film)|Je t'aime... moi non plus]]'', which created a stir for frank examination of sexual ambiguity. For this performance she was nominated for a Best Actress [[CÃ©sar Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt;

Birkin appeared in the [[Agatha Christie]] films ''[[Death on the Nile (1978 film)|Death on the Nile]]'' (1978) and ''[[Evil Under the Sun (1982 film)|Evil Under the Sun]]'' (1982), and recorded several albums, including ''Baby Alone in Babylone'', ''Amours des Feintes'', ''Lolita Go Home'' and ''Rendez-vous''. She won Female Artist of the Year in the 1992 [[Victoires de la Musique]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt; She starred in two films directed by [[Jacques Doillon]] â as Anne in ''[[La fille prodigue]]'' (1981) and as Alma in ''[[La pirate]]'' (1984, nominated for a CÃ©sar Award). This work led to an invitation from [[Patrice ChÃ©reau]] to star on stage in ''[[La Fausse suivante]]'' by [[Marivaux]] at [[Nanterre]]. In 1980 she worked with director Herbert Vesely on ''[[Egon Schiele Exzess und Bestrafung]]'', appearing as the mistress of [[Austrian people|Austrian]] artist [[Egon Schiele]], played by [[Mathieu CarriÃ¨re]]. [[Jacques Rivette]] collaborated with her in ''[[L'Amour par terre|Love on the Ground]]'' (1983) and ''[[La Belle Noiseuse]]'' (1991, Nominated [[CÃ©sar Awards|CÃ©sars]] best supporting actress). She appeared in [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory]]'s ''[[A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (film)|A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries]]'' (1998, also used her song &quot;Di Doo Dah&quot;) and ''[[Merci Docteur Rey]]'' (2002), while ''[[Le Divorce]]''{{'}}s end title song featured her singing &quot;L'Anamour&quot;, composed by Gainsbourg. In 2006, she played the [[Electra|title role]] in ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', directed by [[Philippe Calvario]] in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt;

Birkin recorded the song &quot;Beauty&quot; on French producer [[Hector Zazou]]'s 2003 album ''Strong Currents''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt; The cover art of ''[[Have You Fed the Fish?]]'' by singer-songwriter [[Badly Drawn Boy]] features her image. The album features her daughter [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] on backing vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALLMUSIC&quot; /&gt;

== Birkin bag ==

In 1981, [[HermÃ¨s]] chief executive [[Jean-Louis Dumas]] was seated next to Birkin on a flight from Paris to London. She had just placed her straw bag in the overhead compartment of her seat, but the contents fell to the ground, leaving her to scramble to replace the contents. Birkin explained to Dumas that it had been difficult to find a leather weekend bag she liked. In 1984, he created a black supple leather bag for her: the [[Birkin bag]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1184169/Bag-lady-Victoria-Beckhams-100-strong-Birkin-bag-collection-thats-worth-1-5m.html|title=Bag lady: Victoria Beckham's 100-Strong Birkin Bag Collection That's Worth Â£1.5m|work=The Daily Mail |location=UK |date=20 May 2009|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1611284,00.html|title=In the Bag|work=Time magazine|date=17 April 2007|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an 1892 design. She used the bag for herself then later changed her mind. Nevertheless, the bag has since become an icon.

== Affiliations ==

Birkin's humanitarian interests led her to work with [[Amnesty International]] on immigrant welfare and [[AIDS]] issues. She has visited [[Bosnia]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Palestine]].

== Awards/honours ==

In 2001, Birkin was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]. She has also been awarded the French [[Ordre National du MÃ©rite]]. 

== Personal life ==

Birkin was married from 1965-68 to [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], the English composer who wrote the musical score to the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond movies]]. Their daughter, photographer Kate Barry, was born on 8 April 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfimusic.com/artist/chanson/jane-birkin/biography|title=Jane Birkin|work=RFI Music|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/article5732911.ece|title=Time and place: Jane Birkin|last=Brophy|first=Gwenda|date=15 February 2009|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She had a passionate and creative relationship with her mentor [[Serge Gainsbourg]], whom she met on the set of ''[[Slogan (film)|Slogan]]'' in 1968, a relationship that lasted 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/4568113/Jane-Birkin-marching-to-her-own-tune.html|title=Jane Birkin: marching to her own tune|last=Auld|first=Tim|date=13 February 2009|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They never married, despite rumours and misreporting to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/11/gainsbourg200711|title=The Secret World of Serge Gainsbourg|last=Robinson|first=Lisa|date=November 2007|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=3 September 2011|quote=Contrary to rumors, Jane and Serge never did marry. &quot;He said in France I'd need to be fingerprinted and have a blood sample&quot;, Jane says, &quot;and I was slightly offended and said, 'What on earth for?'

They separated in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/a-bit-twisted/2007/06/07/1181089228142.html|title=A bit twisted|last=Barlow|first=Helen|date=9 June 2007|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 1982 she gave birth to her third daughter, [[Lou Doillon]], from her relationship with the director [[Jacques Doillon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elle.fr/Personnalites/Lou-Doillon|title=Lou Doillon|work=Elle.fr|language=French|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in the 1990s. ''[[The Observer]]'' reported in 2007 that Doillon &quot;could not compete with her grief for Gainsbourg&quot; (who died in 1991), and that she had lived alone since their separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/oct/28/worldmusic.paris|title=A charmed life|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=28 October 2007|work=The Observer|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
