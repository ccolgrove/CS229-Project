:''This is a sub-article to [[Graphical user interface]].''
The '''[[graphical user interface]]''', understood as the use of graphic icons and a pointing device to control a computer, has a four decade history of incremental refinements built on some constant core principles. Several vendors have created their own windowing systems based on independent code, but with basic elements in common that define the [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] &quot;window, icon, menu, pointing device&quot; paradigm. There have been important technological achievements, and enhancements to the general interaction in small steps over previous systems. There have been a few significant breakthroughs in terms of use, but the same organizational [[interface metaphor|metaphors]] and interaction [[Programming idiom|idioms]] are still in use. Although many GUI Operating Systems are operated by using a mouse, the keyboard can also be used by using keyboard shortcuts or arrow keys.

==Initial developments==

[[File:On Line System Videoconferencing FJCC 1968.jpg|thumb|left|[[NLS (computer system)|Videoconferencing on NLS]] (1968)]]
Early dynamic information devices such as [[radar]] displays, where input devices were used for direct control of computer-created data, set the basis for later improvements of graphical interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcw.co.uk/personal-computer-world/features/2045763/men-really-invented-gui|title=The men who really invented the GUI|author=Clive Akass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a windowing system was introduced by the first real-time graphic display systems for computers: the [[SAGE Project]] and [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s [[Sketchpad]].

===Augmentation of Human Intellect (NLS)===
[[Image:firstmouseunderside.jpg|thumb|left|The first [[computer mouse]] held by Engelbart showing the wheels that directly contact the working surface.]]
[[Doug Engelbart]]'s [[Augmentation of Human Intellect#Douglas Engelbart: Augmenting Human Intellect|Augmentation of Human Intellect]] project at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] in the 1960s developed the [[NLS (computer system)|On-Line System]] (NLS), which incorporated a mouse-driven cursor and multiple windows used to work on hypertext. Engelbart had been inspired, in part, by the [[memex]] desk-based information machine suggested by [[Vannevar Bush]] in 1945. Much of the early research was based on how children learn.

===Xerox PARC===
[[Image:Xerox 8010 compound document.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Xerox Star|Xerox Star Workstation]] introduced the first GUI Operating systems.]]

Engelbart's work directly led to the advances at [[Xerox PARC]]. Several people went from SRI to Xerox PARC in the early 1970s.
In 1973 [[Xerox PARC]] developed the [[Xerox Alto|Alto]] personal computer. It had a [[Raster graphics|bitmapped]] screen, and was the first computer to demonstrate the [[desktop metaphor]] and [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). It was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, as well as other XEROX offices, and at several universities for many years.  The Alto greatly influenced the design of personal computers during the late 1970s and early 1980s, notably the [[PERQ|Three Rivers PERQ]], the Apple [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], and the first [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations.

The GUI was first developed at Xerox PARC by [[Alan Kay]], [[Larry Tesler]], [[Daniel Henry Holmes Ingalls, Jr.|Dan Ingalls]] and a number of other researchers. It used [[windowing system|windows]], [[computer icon|icons]], and [[menu (computing)|menus]] to support commands such as opening files, deleting files, moving files, etc. In 1974, work began at PARC on Gypsy, the first bitmap What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) cut &amp; paste editor. In 1975, Xerox engineers demonstrated a Graphical User Interface &quot;including icons and the first use of pop-up menus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parc.com/about/history/ History of PARC]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Xerox introduced a pioneering product, [[Xerox Star|Star]], incorporating many of PARC's innovations.  Although not commercially successful, Star greatly influenced future developments, for example at [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/5/|title=The Real History of the GUI|author=Mike Tuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early developments==
=== Xerox Alto and Xerox Star ===
The [[Xerox Alto]] (and later [[Xerox Star]] ) was an early personal computer developed at Xerox PARC in 1973. It was the first computer to use the desktop metaphor and mouse-driven graphical user interface (GUI).

It was not a commercial product, but several thousand units were built and were heavily used at PARC, other Xerox facilities, at least one government facility and at several universities for many years. The Alto greatly influenced the design of personal computers in the following decades, notably the Apple Macintosh and the first Sun workstations.
[[File:Xerox_Alto.jpg|thumb|alt=A beige, boxy computer with a small black and white screen showing a window and desktop with icons.|The [[Xerox Alto]] was the first to use a graphical user interface.]]

=== Apple Lisa and Macintosh (and later, the Apple IIgs) ===
[[File:Apple Macintosh Desktop.png|thumb|right|[[Mac OS|Macintosh]] Desktop (1984)]]
{{Main|Mac OS history}}

Beginning in 1979, started by [[Steve Jobs]] and led by [[Jef Raskin]], the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] teams at [[Apple Computer]] (which included former members of the Xerox PARC group) continued to develop such ideas. The Macintosh, released in 1984, was the first commercially successful product to use a GUI. A [[desktop metaphor]] was used, in which files looked like pieces of paper; directories looked like file folders; there were a set of [[Desk Accessory|desk accessories]] like a calculator, notepad, and alarm clock that the user could place around the screen as desired; and the user could delete files and folders by dragging them to a trash can on the screen. Drop down menus were also introduced.

There is still some controversy over the amount of influence that Xerox's [[Xerox PARC|PARC]] work, as opposed to previous academic research, had on the GUIs of Apple's [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], but it is clear that the influence was extensive, because first versions of Lisa GUIs even lacked icons. These prototype GUIs are at least mouse driven, but completely ignored the [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] ( &quot;window, icon, menu, pointing device&quot;) concept. Rare screenshots of first GUIs of Apple Lisa prototypes are shown [http://www.pegasus3d.com/apple_screens.html here] and [http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Busy_Being_Born.txt&amp;topic=User%20Interface&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium here]. Note also that Apple engineers visited the PARC facilities (Apple secured the rights for the visit by compensating Xerox with a pre-IPO purchase of Apple stock) and a number of PARC employees subsequently moved to Apple to work on the Lisa and Macintosh GUI. However, the Apple work extended PARC's considerably, adding manipulatable icons, a fixed drop-down menu bar and [[drag&amp;drop]] manipulation of objects in the file system (see [[Macintosh Finder]]) for example. A list of the improvements made by Apple to the PARC interface can be read [http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=On_Xerox,_Apple_and_Progress.txt&amp;topic=Software%20Design&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date here] (folklore.org) It's hard to say which particular features were originated in which project, though. Jef Raskin warns that many of the reported facts in the history of the PARC and Macintosh development are inaccurate, distorted or even fabricated, due to the lack of usage by historians of direct primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digibarn.com/friends/jef-raskin/writings/holes.html|title=Holes in Histories|author=Jef Raskin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AppleIIGSOS.png|left|thumb|The [[Apple GS/OS]] desktop (1986).]]
In 1986 the [[Apple IIgs]] was launched, a very advanced model of the successful [[Apple II]] series, based on [[16-bit]] technology (in fact, virtually two machines into one). It came with a new operating system, the [[Apple GS/OS]], which features a [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]]-like GUI, very similar to that of the Macintosh series, able to deal with the advanced graphic abilities of its Video Graphics Chip (VGC).

===Graphical Environment Manager (GEM)===
[[File:Atari TOS 1 0.png|thumb|right|[[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]] on the [[Atari ST]] (1985)]]

{{Main|Graphical Environment Manager}}
[[Digital Research]] (DRI) created the [[Graphical Environment Manager]] as an add-on program for personal computers. GEM was developed to work with existing [[CP/M]] and [[MS-DOS]] operating systems on business computers such as [[IBM-compatible]]s. It was developed from DRI software, known as GSX, designed by a former [[PARC (company)|PARC]] employee. The similarity to the [[Macintosh]] desktop led to a copyright lawsuit from [[Apple Computer]], and a settlement which involved some changes to GEM. This was to be the first of a series of 'look and feel' lawsuits related to GUI design in the 1980s.

GEM received widespread use in the consumer market from 1985, when it was made the default user interface built in to the [[Atari TOS|TOS]] operating system of the [[Atari ST]] line of personal computers. It was also bundled by other computer manufacturers and distributors, such as [[Amstrad]]. Later, it was distributed with the best-sold Digital Research version of DOS for [[IBM PC compatible]]s, the [[DR-DOS]] 6.0. The GEM desktop faded from the market with the withdrawal of the Atari ST line in 1992 and with the popularity of the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 3.0]] in the PC front by the same years.

===DeskMate===
[[File:DeskMate 3.02.JPG|thumb|left|[[DeskMate]] 3.02 running in VGA mode]]
{{Main|DeskMate}}
Tandy's DeskMate appeared in the early 1980s on its [[TRS-80]] machines and was ported to its [[Tandy 1000]] range in 1984.  Like most PC GUIs of the time it depended on a [[Disk operating system]] such as [[TRS-DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].  The application was popular at the time and included a number of programs like Draw, Text and Calendar as well as attracting outside investment such as Lotus 1-2-3 for DeskMate.

===Amiga Intuition and the Workbench===
[[File:Amiga Workbench 1 0.png|thumb|[[Amiga]] [[AmigaOS|Workbench]] (1985)]]
The [[Amiga]] computer was launched by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in 1985 with a GUI called [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]]. Workbench was based on an internal engine developed mostly by [[RJ Mical]], called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]], which drove all the input events. The first versions used a blue/orange/white/black default palette, which was selected for high contrast on televisions and [[composite monitor]]s. Workbench presented directories as drawers to fit in with the &quot;[[workbench]]&quot; theme.
Intuition was the [[GUI widget|widget]] and graphics library that made the GUI work. It was driven by user events through the mouse, keyboard, and other input devices.

Due to a mistake made by the Commodore sales department, the first floppies of [[AmigaOS]] (released with the Amiga1000) named the whole OS &quot;Workbench&quot;. Since then, users and CBM itself referred to &quot;Workbench&quot; as the nickname for the whole [[AmigaOS]] (including Amiga DOS, Extras, etc.). This common consent ended with release of version [[AmigaOS versions|2.0 of AmigaOS]], which re-introduced proper names to the installation floppies of [[AmigaDOS]], Workbench, Extras, etc.

Early versions of [[AmigaOS]] did treat the Workbench as just another window on top of a blank screen, but this is due to the ability of [[AmigaOS]] to have invisible screens with a [[chromakey]] or a [[genlock]] â one of the most advanced features of Amiga platform â even without losing the visibility of Workbench itself. In later [[AmigaOS]] versions Workbench could be set as a borderless desktop.

Amiga users were able to boot their computer into a [[command line interface]] (aka. CLI/[[Shell (computing)|shell]]). This was a keyboard-based environment without the Workbench GUI. Later they could invoke it with the CLI/SHELL command '''LoadWB''' which loaded Workbench GUI.

One major difference between other OS's of the time and for some time after was the Amiga's fully Multi-Tasking Operating System, a powerful built-in animation system using a hardware blitter and copper and 4 channels of 26k 8 bit sampled sound. This made the Amiga the first Multi Media computer years before other OS's.

Like most GUIs of the day, Amiga's Intuition followed Xerox's, and sometimes Apple's, lead. But a [[Command line interface|CLI]] was included which dramatically extended the functionality of the platform. However, the CLI/Shell of Amiga is not just a simple text-based interface like in [[MS-DOS]], but another graphic process driven by Intuition, and with the same gadgets included in Amiga's graphics.library. The CLI/Shell interface integrates itself with the Workbench, sharing privileges with the GUI.

The Amiga Workbench evolved over the 1990s, far beyond the official withdrawn from Commodore in 1994. See the next section.

===MS-DOS file managers and utility suites===
[[File:Norton Utilities 6.01 UI.png|thumb|left|Norton Utilities 6.01 (1991). Note the graphical widgets and the arrow pointer in [[Text mode]].]]

Because most of the very early [[IBM PC]] and compatibles lacked any common true graphical capability (they used the 80-column basic text mode compatible with the original [[IBM Monochrome Display Adapter|MDA]] display adapter), a series of [[file manager]]s arose, including [[Microsoft]]'s [[DOS Shell]], which features typical GUI elements as menus, push buttons, lists with scrollbars and mouse pointer. The name [[Text user interface]] was later invented to name this kind of interface. Many MS-DOS text mode applications, like the default text editor for MS-DOS 5.0 (and related tools, like [[QBasic]]), also used the same philosophy. The IBM DOS Shell included with IBM DOS 5.0 (circa 1992) supported both text display modes and actual graphics display modes, making it both a TUI and a GUI, depending on the chosen mode.

Advanced file managers for [[MS-DOS]] were able to redefine character shapes with [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] and better display adapters, giving some basic low resolution icons and graphical interface elements, including an arrow (instead of a coloured cell block) for the mouse pointer. When the display adapter lacks the ability to change the character's shapes, they default to the [[code page 437|CP437]] character set found in the adapter's [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. Some popular utility suites for MS-DOS, as [[Norton Utilities]] (pictured) and [[PC Tools (Central Point Software)|PC Tools]] used these techniques as well.

[[DESQview]] was a [[text mode]] multitasking program introduced in July 1985. Running on top of [[MS-DOS]], it allowed users to run multiple DOS programs concurrently in windows. It was the first program to bring multitasking and windowing capabilities to a DOS environment in which existing DOS programs could be used. DESQview was not a true GUI but offered certain components of one, such as resizable, overlapping windows and mouse pointing.

===Applications under MS-DOS with proprietary GUIs===
[[File:Snapshot DeluxePaint II MSDOS.png|thumb|right|DeluxePaint II for MS-DOS (1989)]]

Before the [[Microsoft Windows|MS-Windows]] age, and with the lack of a true common GUI under MS-DOS, most graphical applications which worked with [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]], [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] and better graphic cards had proprietary built-in GUIs. One of the best known such graphical applications was [[Deluxe Paint]], a popular painting software with a typical WIMP interface.

The original [[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Acrobat Reader]] executable file for MS-DOS was able to run on both the standard Windows 3.x GUI and the standard DOS command prompt. When it was launched from the command prompt, on a machine with a [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] graphics card, it provided its own GUI.

===Microsoft Windows (16-bit versions)===
[[File:Windows1.0.png|thumb|left|[[Windows 1.01]] (1985)]]
[[File:Windows 3.11 workspace.png|thumb|right|[[Windows 3.11]] (1993)]]
{{See also|History of Microsoft Windows}}

[[Windows 1.0]], a GUI for the [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]] was released in 1985&lt;ref name=&quot;windows1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sbp-romania.com/Articles/how-windows-came-to-be-windows-1.aspx | title=how-windows-came-to-be-windows-1 | publisher=sbp-romania.com | accessdate=October 03, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The market's response was less than stellar.&lt;ref name=&quot;history-computer.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Software/Windows.html | title=history-computer.com | publisher=http://history-computer.com | accessdate=October 03, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 2.0]] followed, but it wasn't until the 1990 launch of [[Windows 3.0]], based on [[Common User Access]] that its popularity truly exploded. The GUI has seen minor redesigns since, mainly the [[Computer networking|networking]] enabled [[Windows 3.11]] and its [[Win32s]] 32-bit patch. The [[16-bit]] line of MS Windows were discontinued with the introduction of [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]] [[32-bit]] based architecture in the 1990s. See the next section.

The main window of a given application can occupy the full screen in ''maximized'' status. The users must then to switch between maximized applications using the Alt+Tab keyboard shortcut; no alternative with the [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] except for de-maximize. When none of the running application windows is maximized, switching can be done by clicking on a partially visible window, as is the common way in other GUIs.

In 1988, [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation|Apple sued Microsoft]] for copyright infringement of the [[Apple Lisa|LISA]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] GUI. The court case lasted 4 years before almost all of Apple's claims were denied on a contractual technicality. Subsequent appeals by Apple were also denied. Microsoft and Apple apparently entered a final, private settlement of the matter in 1997.

===GEOS===
[[File:GeOS Commodore 64.gif||thumb|left|GEOS for the [[Commodore 64]] (1986).]]
{{Main|GEOS (8-bit operating system)}}

[[GEOS (8-bit operating system)|GEOS]] was launched in 1986. Originally written for the 8-bit home computer [[Commodore 64]] and shortly after, the [[Apple II]] series it was later ported to IBM PC systems. It came with several application programs like a calendar and word processor, and a cut-down version served as the basis for [[America Online]]'s DOS client. Compared to the competing Windows 3.0 GUI it could run reasonably well on simpler hardware. But it was targeted at [[8-bit]] machines and the [[16-bit]] computer age was dawning.

===The X Window System===
[[File:X-Window-System.png|thumb|right|A Unix based [[X Window System]] desktop (circa 1990).]]
The standard windowing system in the [[Unix]] world is the [[X Window System]] (commonly X11 or X), first released in the mid-1980s. The [[W Window System]] (1983) was the precursor to X; X was developed at MIT as [[Project Athena]]. Its original purpose was to allow users of the newly emerging graphic terminals to access remote graphics [[workstation]]s without regard to the workstation's operating system or the hardware. Due largely to the availability of the source code used to write X, it has become the standard layer for management of graphical and input/output devices and for the building of both local and remote graphical interfaces on virtually all Unix, [[Linux]] and other [[Unix-like]] operating systems, with the notable exception of Mac OS X.

X allows a graphical terminal user to make use of remote resources on the network as if they were all located locally to the user by running a single module of software called the X server. The software running on the remote machine is called the client application. X's network transparency protocols allow the display and input portions of any application to be separated from the remainder of the application and 'served up' to any of a large number of remote users. X is available today as free software.

===NeWS===
[[File:HyperTIESAuthoring.jpg|thumb|right|HyperTIES authoring tool under NeWS window system.]]
The [[PostScript]]-based [[NeWS]] (Network extensible Window System) was developed by [[Sun Microsystems]] in the mid-1980s. For several years [[SunOS]] included a window system combining NeWS and the [[X Window System]]. Although NeWS was considered technically elegant by some commentators, Sun eventually dropped the product. Unlike X, NeWS was always [[proprietary software]].

==The 1990s: Mainstream usage of the desktop==
The widespread adoption of the PC platform at homes and small business popularized computers among people with no formal training. This created a fast growing market, opening an opportunity for commercial exploitation and of easy-to-use interfaces and making economically viable the incremental refinement of the existing GUIs for home systems.

Also, the spreading of [[Highcolor]] and [[Truecolor]] capabilities of [[display adapter]]s providing [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|thousands]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|millions of colors]], along with faster [[CPU]]s and accelerated graphic cards, cheaper [[RAM]], [[Hard disk drive|storage devices]] up to an order of magnitude larger (from [[megabyte]]s to [[gigabyte]]s) and larger [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] for telecom [[computer networking|networking]] at lower cost helped to create an environment in which the common user was able to run complicated GUIs which began to favor aesthetics.

===Windows 95 and &quot;a computer in every home&quot; (the 32-bit versions)===
[[File:Windows 95 Desktop screenshot.png|thumb|right|[[Windows 95]] desktop (1995).]]

:''Main article: [[Windows 95]]. See also [[Windows NT]].

After Windows 3.11, Microsoft began to develop a new consumer-oriented version of the operating system. Windows 95 was intended to integrate Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Windows products and includes an enhanced version of DOS, often referred to as MS-DOS 7.0, although many people{{Who|date=July 2010}} believe that Windows 95's MS-DOS was not really DOS at all. It also featured a significant redesign of the GUI, dubbed &quot;Cairo&quot;.  While Cairo never really materialized, parts of Cairo found their way into subsequent versions of the operating system starting with Windows 95. Both Win95 and WinNT could run 32-bit applications, and could exploit the abilities of the [[Intel 80386]] [[CPU]], as the [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] and up to 4GiB of [[Flat memory model|linear address memory space]].  Windows 95 was touted as a 32-bit based operating system but it was actually based on a hybrid kernel (VWIN32.VXD) with the 16-bit user interface (USER.EXE) and graphic device interface (GDI.EXE) of Windows for Workgroups (3.11), which had 16-bit kernel components with a 32-bit subsystem (USER32.DLL and GDI32.DLL) that allowed it to run native 16 bit applications as well as 32-bit applications.  In the marketplace, Windows 95 was an unqualified success, promoting a general upgrade to 32-bit technology, and within a year or two of its release had become the most successful operating system ever produced.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Windows 95 saw the beginning of the [[Browser wars]] when the World Wide Web began receiving a great deal of attention in the popular culture and mass media. Microsoft at first did not see potential in the Web and Windows 95 was shipped with Microsoft's own online service called [[The Microsoft Network]], which was dial-up only and was used primarily for its own content, not internet access. As versions of [[Netscape Navigator]] and [[Internet Explorer]] were released at a rapid pace over the following few years, Microsoft used its desktop dominance to push its browser and shape the ecology of the web mainly as a [[monoculture#Computer science|monoculture]].

Windows 95 evolved through the years into [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows ME]].  Windows ME was the last in the line of the Windows 3.x based operating systems from Microsoft.  Windows underwent a parallel 32-bit evolutionary path, where Windows NT 3.1 was released in 1993.  Windows NT (for New Technology) was a native 32-bit operating system with a new driver model, was unicode-based, and provided for true separation between applications.  Windows NT also supported 16-bit applications in an NTVDM, but it did not support VXD based drivers.  Windows 95 was supposed to be released before 1993 as the predecessor to Windows NT.  The idea was to promote the development of 32-bit applications with backward compatibility - leading the way for more successful NT release.  After multiple delays, Windows 95 was released without unicode and used the VXD driver model. Windows NT 3.1 evolved to Windows NT 4, then Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, then Windows 7.  Windows XP and higher were also made available in 64-bit modes.  Windows server products branched off with the introduction of Windows Server 2003 (available in 32-bit and 64-bit IA64 or x64), then Windows Server 2008 and then Windows Server 2008 R2. Windows 2000 and XP shared the same basic GUI although XP introduced Visual Styles. With Windows 98, the [[Active Desktop]] theme was introduced, allowing a [[HTML]] approach for the desktop, but this feature was coldly received by customers, who frequently disabled it. At the end, Windows Vista definitively discontinued it, but has a new [[SideBar]] on the desktop.

===Mac OS===
[[File:Macintosh System 7.5.3 screenshot.png|thumb|[[System 7 (Macintosh)|Screenshot of System 7.5.3]]]]
The Macintosh's GUI has been infrequently revised since 1984, with major updates including [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]], and underwent its largest revision with the introduction of the &quot;[[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]&quot; interface in 2001's [[Mac OS X]]. It was a new operating system built primarily on technology from [[NeXTStep]] with UI elements of the original Mac OS grafted on. Mac OS X uses a technology called [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] for graphics rendering and drawing on-screen. Some interface features of Mac OS X are inherited from NeXTStep (such as the [[Dock (computing)|Dock]], the automatic wait cursor, or double-buffered windows giving a solid appearance and flicker-free window redraws), while others are inherited from the old Mac OS operating system (the single system-wide menu-bar). [[Mac OS X v10.3]] introduced features to improve usability including [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]] which is designed to make finding open windows easier.

With [[Mac OS X v10.4]], new features were added, including [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] (a virtual alternate desktop for mini specific-purpose applications) and a search tool called [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]], which provides users with an option for searching through files instead of browsing through folders.

===GUIs built on the X Window System===
[[File:KDE 4.png|thumb|left|[[KDE Plasma Workspaces|KDE Plasma 4.6]] desktop (2010)]]
[[File:Gnome-2.28.png|thumb|right|A [[GNOME]] 2.28 desktop (2010)]]
In the early days of X Window development, Sun Microsystems and AT&amp;T attempted to push for a GUI standard called [[OPEN LOOK]] in competition with [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]]. OPEN LOOK was a well-designed standard developed from scratch in conjunction with [[Xerox]], while Motif was a collective effort that fell into place, with a look and feel patterned after [[Windows 3.11]]. Many who worked on OPEN LOOK at the time appreciated its design coherence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Motif prevailed in the UNIX GUI battles and became the basis for the [[Common Desktop Environment]] (CDE). CDE was based on [[VUE]] (Visual User Environment), a proprietary desktop from [[Hewlett-Packard]] that in turn was based on the Motif look and feel.

In the late 1990s, there was significant growth in the Unix world, especially among the [[free software community]]. New graphical desktop movements grew up around Linux and similar operating systems, based on the X Window System. A new emphasis on providing an integrated and uniform interface to the user brought about new desktop environments, such as [[KDE Plasma Desktop]], [[GNOME]] and [[XFCE]] which are supplanting CDE in popularity on both Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The XFCE, KDE and GNOME look and feel each tend to undergo more rapid change and less codification than the earlier OPEN LOOK and Motif environments.

In the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century X Window GUIs such as [[Compiz Fusion]] and [[KWin]] began to incorporate translucency and [[drop shadow]] effects.

===Amiga===
[[File:Wb 20.png|thumb|left|[[Amiga]] [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] 2.0 (1990)]]
[[File:AmigaOS 4.1.png|thumb|right|[[Amiga]] [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] 4.1 (2009)]]
Later releases added improvements over the original Workbench, like support for high-color Workbench screens, context menus, and embossed 2D icons with pseudo-3D aspect. Some Amiga users preferred alternative interfaces to standard Workbench, such as [[Directory Opus|Directory Opus Magellan]].

The use of improved, third-party GUI engines became common amongst users who preferred more attractive interfaces â such as [[Magic User Interface]] (MUI), and [[ReAction GUI|ReAction]]. These object-oriented graphic engines driven by user interface classes and methods were then standardized into the Amiga environment and changed Amiga Workbench to a complete and modern guided interface, with new standard gadgets, animated buttons, true 24-bit-color icons, increased use of wallpapers for screens and windows, alpha channel, transparencies and shadows as any modern GUI requires.

Modern derivatives of Workbench are [[Ambient desktop|Ambient]] for [[MorphOS]], Scalos, Workbench for [[AmigaOS 4]] and [[Zune (GUI toolkit)|Wanderer]] for [[AROS]].
There is a brief article on Ambient and descriptions of MUI icons, menus and gadgets at [http://www.aps.fr/article/ambient.html aps.fr] and images of [[Zune (GUI toolkit)|Zune]] stay at main [http://aros.sourceforge.net/pictures/screenshots/ AROS site].

Use of [[object oriented]] graphic engines dramatically changes the look and feel of a GUI to match actual styleguides.

===RISC OS===

Early versions of what came to be called [[RISC OS]] were known as [[Arthur (operating system)|Arthur]], which was released in 1987 by Acorn Computers. RISC OS was a colour GUI operating system which used three-button mice, a taskbar (called the [[icon bar]]), and a file navigator similar to that of Mac OS. [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] created RISC OS in the 1980s for their [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-[[central processing unit|CPU]] based computers.

The GUI of RISC OS has developed over versions of RISC OS from 1987 to the present day with versions 5 and 6 having a great ability to customise the interface.

===OS/2===
[[File:OS-2 W4.png|thumb|[[OS/2]] Workplace Shell]]
Originally collaboratively developed by Microsoft and IBM to replace DOS, [[OS/2]] version 1.0 (released in 1987) had no GUI at all. Version 1.1 (released 1988) included Presentation Manager (PM), which looked a lot like the later Windows 3.0 UI. After the split with Microsoft, IBM developed the [[Workplace Shell]] (WPS) for version 2.0 (released in 1992), a quite radical, object-oriented approach to GUIs. Microsoft later imitated much of this in Windows 95{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

===NeXTSTEP===
[[File:NeXTSTEP desktop.jpg|thumb|left|[[NEXTSTEP|NeXTSTEP]] Desktop]]
The [[NEXTSTEP|NeXTSTEP]] user interface was used in the [[NeXT]] line of computers. NeXTSTEP's first major version was released in 1989. It used [[Display PostScript]] for its graphical underpinning. The NeXTSTEP interface's most significant feature was the [[Dock (computing)|Dock]], carried with some modification into [[Mac OS X]], and had other minor interface details that some found made it easier and more intuitive to use than previous GUIs. NeXTSTEP's GUI was the first to feature opaque dragging of windows in its user interface, on a comparatively weak machine by today's standards, ideally aided by [http://www.bytecellar.com/archives/000092.php high performance graphics hardware].

===BeOS===
[[File:BeOS Desktop.png|thumb|[[BeOS]] Desktop]]
[[BeOS]] was developed on custom [[AT&amp;T Hobbit]]-based computers before switching to [[PowerPC]] hardware by a team led by former Apple executive [[Jean-Louis GassÃ©e]] as an alternative to Mac OS. BeOS was later ported to Intel hardware. It used an object-oriented kernel written by Be, and did not use the [[X Window System]], but a different [[GUI]] written from scratch. Much effort was spent by the developers to make it an efficient platform for multimedia applications. Be Inc. was [http://news.com.com/2102-1040_3-271718.html?tag=st.util.print acquired] by [[PalmSource, Inc.]] (Palm Inc. at the time) in 2001. The BeOS GUI still lives in [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], an [[open source software]] reimplementation of the BeOS.

==Current trends==
=== 3D user interface ===
{{Main|3D interaction}}

[[File:Fedora-Core-6-AIGLX.png|thumb|left|[[Compiz]] running on [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core 6]] with AIGLX.]]

As of 2009, a recent trend in desktop technology is the inclusion of 3D effects in window management. It's based in experimental research in [[User Interface Design]] trying to expand the expressive power of the existing toolkits in order to enhance the physical cues that allow for [[direct manipulation]]. New effects common to several projects are scale resizing and zooming, several windows transformations and animations (wobbly windows, smooth minimization to system tray...), composition of images (used for window drop shadows and transparency) and enhancing the global organization of open windows ([[zooming user interface|zooming]] to [[virtual desktop]]s, [[compiz|desktop cube]], [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]], etc.) The proof-of-concept [[BumpTop]] desktop combines a physical representation of documents with tools for document classification possible only in the simulated environment, like instant reordering and automated grouping of related documents.

These effects are popularized thanks to the widespread use of 3D video cards (mainly due to gaming) which allow for complex visual processing with low CPU use, using the 3D acceleration in most modern graphics cards to render the application clients in a 3D scene. The application window is drawn off-screen in a pixel buffer and the graphics card renders it into the 3D scene.

This can have the advantage of moving some of the window rendering to the [[GPU]] on the graphics card and thus reducing the load on the main [[CPU]], but the facilities that allow this must be available on the graphics card to be able to take advantage of this.

Examples of 3D user interface software include [[XGL]] and [[Compiz]] from [[Novell]], and [[AIGLX]] bundled with [[Red Hat]] [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]. [[Quartz Extreme]] for [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Vista|Vista]]'s [[Windows Aero|Aero]] interface use 3D rendering for [[shading]] and transparency effects as well as [[Expose (Mac OS X)|Expose]] and [[Windows Flip 3D|Windows Flip and Flip 3D]], respectively. [[AmigaOS 4.1]] uses [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] 2D vector based interface integrated with 3D hardware accelerated [[Alpha compositing|Porter-Duff]] image composition engine, while its counterpart clone MorphOS 2.0 features [[Ambient desktop|Ambient]], a complete 3D GUI based on a subset of [[OpenGL]]. Vista uses [[Direct3D]] to accomplish this, whereas the other interfaces use [[OpenGL]].

===Portable devices===
Portable devices such as [[MP3 players]] and [[cell phones]] are a burgeoning area of deployment for GUIs in recent years. Since the mid-2000s, a vast majority of portable devices have advanced to having high screen resolutions and sizes (The [[iPhone]]'s 640x960 display for example). Because of this, these devices have their own famed user interfaces and [[operating system]]s that have large [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] communities dedicated to creating their own visual elements, such as Icons, Menus, Wallpapers, and more. [[Post-WIMP]] interfaces are often used in these [[mobile device]]s where the traditional pointing devices required by the desktop metaphor are not practical.
