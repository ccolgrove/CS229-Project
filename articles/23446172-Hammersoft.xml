'''Mozilla Firefox 3.5''' is a version of the [[Firefox]] [[web browser]] released in June 2009, adding a variety of new features to Firefox. Version 3.5 was touted as being twice as fast as 3.0 (due its [[TraceMonkey]] [[JavaScript]] engine and rendering improvements). It includes [[private browsing]], has tear-off tabs, and uses the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 1.9.1 engine.
It was codenamed ''[[Shiretoko National Park|Shiretoko]]'' during development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3.1 | title=Firefox 3.1 &quot;Shiretoko&quot; | date=2008-06-12 | accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially numbered Firefox 3.1 before Mozilla developers decided to change the version to 3.5, to reflect the inclusion of a significantly greater scope of changes than were originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|title=Shiretoko (Firefox 3.1) being renamed to Firefox 3.5|date=March 6, 2009|author=Mike Shaver |newsgroup=mozilla.dev.planning |server=news.mozilla.org |id=mailman.34.1236360325.4415.dev-planning@lists.mozilla.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current estimates of Firefox 3.5's global market share {{as of|2010|02|lc=on}} are around 15-20%&lt;ref name=&quot;Net Applications&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rose rapidly in July 2009 as users migrated from [[Firefox 3|Firefox 3.0]] although since the latter part of January 2010 it started to decline as users migrate to [[Firefox 3.6]]. Also, between mid-December 2009 and February 2010, Firefox 3.5 was the most popular browser (when counting individual browser versions) according to [[StatCounter]],&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/188906.asp?from=blog_last3 Firefox 3.5 is world's most popular browser, StatCounter says], Nick Eaton. seattlepi blogs. 2009-12-21. Retrieved 2009-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{as of|2010|02|lc=on}} is one of the top 3 browser versions according to [[Net Applications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ub-news.com/news/firefox-35-has-passed-internet-explorer-7-for-the-first-time/7840.html UB-News.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Both milestones involved passing [[Internet Explorer 7]], which previously held the #1 and #3 spots in popularity according to StatCounter and Net Applications, respectively.

Due to [[Operation Aurora#Attack analysis|the January 2010, well-publicized vulnerability]] in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, the German, French, and Australian governments had publicly issued warnings to Internet Explorer users to use alternative browsers, at least until a fix for the security hole was made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/technology-news/france-germany-warn-internet-explorer-users-3334330 France, Germany warn Internet Explorer users] TVNZ, January 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/why-you-should-change-your-internet-browser-and-how-to-choose-the-best-one-for-you-1872048.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Why you should change your internet browser and how to choose the best one for you | date=January 18, 2010 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bourke |first=Emily |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/19/2795684.htm |title=Govt issues IE security warning - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first browser they recommended was Mozilla Firefox, followed by [[Google Chrome]].

== Development ==
Even before the release of Firefox 3.0 on June 17, 2008, Firefox 3.1 was in development under the codename &quot;Shiretoko&quot;. It was planned to include new interface features such as tab previews, tag auto-completion, HTML 5 &lt;video&gt; tag support, and CSS text shadows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/06/mozilla-prepares-for-firefox-3-release-and-plans-for-3-1.ars|title= Mozilla prepares for Firefox 3 release and plans for 3.1|last=Paul|first=Ryan |date=June 15, 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpha ===
The first Alpha was released on July 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2008/07/28/firefox-31-alpha-1-now-available-for-download/|title=Firefox 3.1 Alpha 1 now available for download|first=beltzner |date=July 28, 2008|work=Developer News|publisher=Mozilla|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new tab switching behavior was implemented, that switches to the most recently used tab instead of the adjacent one. When switching thumbnails are displayed so the user can preview the tabs before switching to them. The awesome bar was also improved to have filtering by Bookmarks and history. The Gecko engine was updated to include CSS3 features and includes the HTML Canvas text API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/07/first-look-ars-reviews-firefox-3-1-alpha-1.ars|title=First look: Ars reviews Firefox 3.1 alpha 1|last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=July 30, 2008|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alpha release showed an 18% improvement in the [[Acid3]] test over Firefox 3.0, scoring 84/100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/07/first-step-to-firefox-31-alpha-1-is-here/ | title = First step to Firefox 3.1: Alpha 1 is here | accessdate = 2008-07-29 |date = 2008-07-29 | author = Percy Cabello | publisher = Mozilla Links | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.1 Alpha 2 was launched on September 5, 2008, implementing the HTML 5 video element support and preliminary support for web worker thread, enhancing the speed of some [[JavaScript]] computations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/09/first-look-firefox-3-1-alpha-2-officially-released.ars|title=First look: Firefox 3.1 alpha 2 officially released|last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=September 5, 2008|publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beta and release ===
On October 14, 2008, the first beta of Firefox 3.1 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2008/10/14/firefox-31-beta-1-now-available-for-download/ | title = Firefox 3.1 beta 1 now available for download | accessdate = 2009-11-11 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included a new TraceMonkey JavaScript engine, which is not enabled by default, and the implementation of the [[W3C Geolocation API]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/first-look-firefox-3-1-beta-1-officially-released.ars|title=First look: Firefox 3.1 beta 1 officially released|last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=October 14, 2008|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beta 2 was released on December 8, 2008 and included a new private browsing feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2008-11-04/dont-leave-trace-private-browsing-firefox | title = Don't leave a trace: Private Browsing in Firefox | accessdate = 2008-12-25 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new tab switching behavior and interface was dropped at this beta, since the developer found needed more work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/12/first-look-firefox-3-1-beta-2-now-with-private-browsing.ars|title=First look: Firefox 3.1 beta 2, now with private browsing|last=Paul |first=Ryan |date=December 8, 2008|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 was released on March 12, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2009/03/12/firefox-31-beta-3-now-available-for-download/ Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 now available for download]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/new-beta-paves-way-for-firefox-3.5/ New beta paves way for Firefox 3.5 | Webware - CNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Beta 4, the first to be labeled as version 3.5, on April 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2009/04/27/firefox-35-beta-4-now-available-for-download/ Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 now available for download]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/mozilla-releases-firefox-3.5-beta/ Mozilla releases Firefox 3.5 beta | Webware - CNET&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, 2009, Mozilla released Firefox 3.5 Preview (labeled 3.5b99) in order to receive additional testing before it became the [[release candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5b99/releasenotes/ Firefox 3.5 Preview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Release Candidate 1 was released as an update to Firefox 3.5 Preview users on June 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2009/06/17/firefox-35-beta-users-will-receive-update-to-early-release-candidate/ Firefox 3.5 beta users will receive update to early release candidate]&lt;/ref&gt; Released Candidate 2 was made more widely available on June 19, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2009/06/19/firefox-3-5-release-candidate-now-available-for-download/ Firefox 3.5 release candidate now available for download]&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a third RC on June 24, 2009.

== Features ==

Firefox 3.5 uses the Gecko 1.9.1 engine, which adds features that were not included in the 3.0 release. These include support for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;video&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&gt;&lt;/code&gt; elements defined in the [[HTML 5]] draft specification, including native support for [[Ogg]] [[Theora]] encoded video and [[Vorbis]] encoded audio.&lt;ref name=&quot;gecko191-media&quot;&gt;{{cite | title = Media formats supported by the audio and video elements | date = 2009-05-28 | author = Eric Shepherd | publisher = Mozilla developer center | url = https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Media_formats_supported_by_the_audio_and_video_elements | accessdate = 2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gecko191&quot;&gt;{{cite | title = Firefox3.5/Features | date = 2009-03-18 | author = MozillaWiki | publisher = MozillaWiki | url = https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3.5/Features | accessdate = 2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to offer video and audio playback without being encumbered by patent issues associated with most plugin and codec technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warne APC&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Other features new in Firefox 3.5 include a [[private browsing]] mode, native support for [[JSON]] and web worker threads, and many other new web technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5/releasenotes/ Firefox 3.5 Release Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multi-touch]] support was also added to the release, including gesture support like pinching for zooming and swiping for back and forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2008/12/10/latest-firefox-3-1-beta-adds-multi-touch-support/|title=Latest Firefox 3.1 Beta Adds Multi-Touch Support|last=Kim|first=Arnold |date=2008-12-10|publisher=Macrumors.com|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox 3.5 also features an updated logo from the previous releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2009/05/15/creative-brief-for-the-new-firefox-icon/ | title=Creative Brief for the New Firefox Icon | author=Alex Faaborg | date=2009-05-15 | accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minor change for Version 3.5 is the default search engine in [[Russian language]] builds, which uses the search engine [[Yandex]] rather than [[Google]], after a survey of Russian Firefox users indicated they preferred Yandex.&lt;ref name=&quot;yandexfox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10138969-2.html|title=Firefox in Russia dumps Google for Yandex|last=Shankland|first=Stephen|date=January 9, 2009|publisher=[[CNET News]]|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first update, 3.5.1, was released on July 16, 2009. It solved some vulnerabilities detected after the final release. Another update, 3.5.2, was released on August 3, 2009, followed by version 3.5.3 on September 9, 2009, version 3.5.4 on October 27, 2009, version 3.5.5 on November 5, 2009, version 3.5.6 on December 15, 2009 and version 3.5.7 on January 5, 2010.

Starting July 14, 2009, the upgrade to 3.5 was offered to users of Firefox 3.0 through the automatic internal &quot;[[Push technology|push]]&quot; update mechanism.

== End of life ==
Security and stability updates for Firefox 3.5.x were scheduled to end in August 2010. However, Firefox 3.5.12 was released on September 7, 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5.12/releasenotes/ Release notes for Mozilla Firefox 3.5.12]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mozilla has since continued shipping incremental stability and security fixes. The latest build 3.5.19 was released on April 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5.19/releasenotes/ Release notes for Mozilla Firefox 3.5.19]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mozilla now plans to terminate support of the Firefox 3.5.x series by issuing Firefox 3.6.18 as a minor update to users of versions 3.6.17 and 3.5.19 in June, with Firefox Release Manager Christian Legnitto explaining that &quot;We feel comfortable making the major update choice for users because a) the versions are very similar and b) we'd rather lose a small amount of miffed users than leave a large amount of users vulnerable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning/browse_thread/thread/6e4b5bc15e7bbc1a?pli=1|title=Firefox 3.5 EOL Plan|last=Legnitto|first=Christian|date=May 12, 2011|publisher=mozilla.dev.planning|accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Details of how the update will be implemented are currently in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases/3.5_EOL|title=Releases/3.5 EOL|date=May 11, 2011|publisher=MozillaWiki|accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
