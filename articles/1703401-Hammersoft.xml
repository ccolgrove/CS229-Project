The '''Canadian Forces Medical Service''' (CFMS, {{lang-fr|Service de santÃ© des Forces canadiennes}}) provides medical support for the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) both at home and abroad. It is also a [[personnel branch]] of the CF. The CFMS along with the [[Dental Branch|Canadian Forces Dental Service]] (CFDS) form the [[Canadian Forces Health Services Group]] (CF H Svcs Gp).

==Motto and march==
''Militi Succurrimus'' (We hasten to aid the soldiers) is the official branch motto. &quot;The Farmer's Boy&quot; is the branch march. This march was selected by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] (mother of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]).

==Roles and identification==

Medical personnel of the CF H Svcs Gp provide operational (deployed) and operational readiness (in-garrison) medical care to entitled personnel.

== Uniforms ==

CFMS personnel wear the same uniforms as other members of the CF with unique identifiers depending on which distinctive environmental uniform (DEU) they are assigned (Navy, Army, Air). Regardless of environment, all [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s and [[non-commissioned member]]s (NCMs) wear the same cap badge. The only difference between the cap badges is that the [[staff of Ãsculapius]] on NCM badge comprises a gold serpent on a gold staff whereas on the officer badge comprises a silver serpent on a gold staff.

Naval medical officers wear scarlet [[distinction cloth]] between the braids of their rank, while other health care officer classifications (non-physicians) wear a dull cherry distinction cloth. NCMs wear a trade badge on their jackets.

All army health care officer classifications and non-commissioned members wear a &quot;Medical&quot; shoulder bar on the service dress jacket, and a tab bearing either the title &quot;MEDICAL&quot; or a unit identifier (e.g. &quot;15 FD AMB&quot;) on [[slip-on]]s for other uniforms. NCMs below the rank of [[Warrant Officer#Canada|warrant officer]] wear a trade badge on the sleeve of the service dress jacket.

All air force medical branch officers and non-commissioned members wear a distinctive metal badge over their name tag on both their dress uniform jacket and short-sleeve order of dress.

==History==
It has its origins in the Dominion government's 1885 response to the [[North-West Rebellion]], with the appointment of Canada's first Surgeon General, Doctor [[Darby Bergin]] of [[Cornwall, Ontario]], and the mobilization of two [[field hospital]]s.

It suffered significant budgetary cutbacks after the 1994 [[Broadbent Report]] following the end of the [[Cold War]], with three of its six military hospitals being closed.

The former colonel-in-chief was [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] (mother of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]). The current colonel-in-chief is Princess [[Anne, Princess Royal]] (daughter of the Queen and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]])
