'''Martha Munizzi''' (mew-NIZ-ee) is an internationally acclaimed and award-winning [[Gospel music]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[author]], and [[actress]].

==Early years==
A native of central Florida, Martha Munizzi was born into a Christian musical family. The daughter of evangelists, Martha and her twin sister [[Mary Alessi]] were born in [[Lakeland, Florida]] and grew up traveling and ministering through music with her family. She began performing at age 8, touring the country with her family in concerts and crusades around the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Martha, Mary, and their older sister Marvelyne were born with their parents' talent for music and became a part of the traveling family group as kids. The family settled in [[Orlando, Florida]] when Mary and Martha were 12, so that the children could attend formal, public school.

At age 16, Mary, Martha and Marveline (age 18) helped form a praise and worship band at the urging of a church friend. That group evolved into ''Testament'' and became popular enough to travel around the state of Florida performing in churches and at conferences and other events.

One year after completing high school (1986), Martha married Dan Munizzi, who was a keyboard and bass player in the band ''Testament''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Martha Munizzi | url=http://marthamunizzi.com/bio.php | publisher=Marha Munizzi.com | accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 she and Dan became the music directors and founding members of a new, fledgling church in [[Orlando, Florida]] initially leading a congregation of 250 and a choir of about 30 people that eventually grew in 8 years into a 5000 member congregation and a 200 member music team.  They remained there until 2001. 

She led worship at [[Lakewood Church]] while [[Cindy Cruse-Ratcliff]] was on maternity leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lakewood|last=Church|url= http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/lakewood/lakeupload/wmedia_153_hour_500k.wvx|title=Lakewood Church Worship Service On-line Viewable Service # 153|publisher=Lakewood Church|date=Unknown| accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lakewood|last=Church|url= http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/lakewood/lakeupload/wmedia_154_hour_500k.wvx|title=Lakewood Church Worship Service On-line Viewable Service # 154|publisher=Lakewood Church|date=Unknown| accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Along with figures like [[Ron Kenoly]], [[CeCe Winans]], and [[Israel Houghton]],  Munizzi is pioneering cross-cultural worship music that not only connects with both black and white Christian congregations but also reaches the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Cummings|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Israel_Houghton/21248/p1/|title=Cross-cultural worship is the name of the game for pioneering ISRAEL HOUGHTON|publisher=Cross Rhythms|date=2006-04-26| accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munizzi's songs are self-published under the name Say The Name Publishing/Martha Munizzi Music. She released her first Praise &amp; Worship/Gospel album, ''Say the Name'' (2002), followed by ''The Best Is Yet to Come'' (2003) and ''When He Came'' (2004), both of which debuted high on [[Billboard charts|Billboard's Gospel chart]]. ''The Best Is Yet to Come'' peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] Music Top Gospel Album charts in 2004 and remained on the charts for more than a year. 

In 2004 Munizzi had two music albums in the top five on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Gospel charts at the same time (''The Best Is Yet to Come'' at #2 and ''When He Came'' at #5) and [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]] named her as one of the top five Gospel Artists for 2004. Additionally, her project ''The Best Is Yet to Come'' was named one of the top ten selling Gospel projects for 2004.

In 2005 she signed a distribution deal with Integrity Media, Inc. Under this agreement her previously released albums ''The Best Is Yet To Come'' and ''Say The Name'' and all future releases were to be distributed to Christian retail outlets through [[Provident-Integrity Distribution]] and to general market outlets on the Epic Records (a division of [[Sony-BMG Distribution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|url=http://christianmusic.about.com/od/musicnews/a/aamunizzisigns.htm|title=Martha Munizzi Signs With Integrity Music|publisher=|date=2005-05-28| accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Munizzi released her next CD entitled ''[[No Limits Live]]''. This CD debuted on Billboard's Top Gospel Charts at #1 and remained at the top of the charts for 6 weeks.

She was also a featured performer with [[Kirk Franklin]] at the &quot;Imagine Me&quot; all-star celebrity benefit concert on January 11, 2007 at the [[Opryland Hotel]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|url=http://www.breathecast.com/Christian.Music.lyric.Kirk.Franklin.to.Host.Benefit.Concert.for.Children's.Defense.Fund/news_1394.htm|title=Kirk Franklin to Host Benefit Concert for Children's Defense Fund|publisher=breathecast.com|date=2001-01-08|accessdate=2007-01-19|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070121044407/http://breathecast.com/Christian.Music.lyric.Kirk.Franklin.to.Host.Benefit.Concert.for.Children's.Defense.Fund/news_1394.htm |archivedate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was a benefit for the [[Children's Defense Fund]].
