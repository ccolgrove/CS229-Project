'''Carol Cleveland''' (born 13 January 1942, London) is a British actress/[[Comedian|comedienne]], most notable for her appearances as the only significant female performer on ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''.

==Early life==
Born in London, she moved to the United States with her mother and [[U.S. Air Force]] stepfather at an early age. She was raised in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania; [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], Texas; and later [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California where she attended John Marshall Junior High School and [[Pasadena High School (California)|Pasadena High School]]. She is a former Miss California Navy and appeared as Miss Teen Queen in ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' at age 15.

Cleveland returned with her family to London in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolcleveland.com/biog.htm Biography from Carol Cleveland's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].

==Career==
A stage actress who had appeared as an extra in ''[[The Persuaders!]]'' and other TV shows and films, she started to appear as an extra in [[BBC]] comedy productions, including ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'', ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'' and ''[[Spike Milligan]]''.

This brought her to the attention of the production team of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]].'' She appeared in 30 of the 45 episodes in the series. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;other Python&quot; or &quot;the seventh Python&quot; or even &quot;The Female Python,&quot; though she thinks this is too much. She played an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[blonde bombshell]]. Stage directions for her first sketch described her as &quot;a blonde buxom wench in the full bloom of womanhood.&quot; Privately called &quot;Carol Cleavage&quot; by the other Pythons, she called herself the &quot;glamour stooge.&quot; Cleveland starred in all four of the ''Monty Python'' movies, including the dual roles of Zoot and Dingo, twin leaders of the maidens in the Castle Anthrax, in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]].'' Her mother, Pat, appeared in ''Monty Python'' on several occasions, once as a mental patient with an axe embedded in her head.

Cleveland was voted number three in ''Splendor'' magazine's &quot;100 Most Beautiful Entertainers&quot; list in 1972.

In 1986, Cleveland played an American television journalist in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' episode &quot;[[The Miracle of Peckham]]&quot;.

In 1995, Cleveland had a small cameo in a ''[[Fist of Fun]]'' sketch, a [[BBC]] comedy show featuring [[Stewart Lee]] and [[Richard Herring]]. During a radio interview in [[Birmingham]] to promote a British tour of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play [[Dirty Linen and New-Found-Land|''Dirty Linen'']] in the early 1980s, Cleveland confided an embarrassing incident in dress rehearsal. One scene called for her to climb onto a table and pull off her skirt. It was only when her fellow cast members went suddenly silent that Cleveland realised she'd forgotten to put on any underwear that morning.

Cleveland now performs in a one-woman show, ''Carol Cleveland Reveals All''.

In 2010 she appeared in an advert for Pimm's.

==Personal life==
Cleveland was married to Peter Brett from 1971 to 1983.
