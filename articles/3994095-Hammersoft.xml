'''Garces Memorial High School''', commonly shortened to Garces High School, is a [[Catholic Education|Catholic]] [[high school]] in [[Bakersfield, California]]. 

Founded in 1947, the school is named after [[Francisco GarcÃ©s|Father Francisco GarcÃ©s]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]] friar and missionary who explored much of the southwestern part of [[North America]], including what is now the Bakersfield region.  The school is located near the terminus of the Panorama (aka China Grade) Bluffs on the exact site that Father Francisco Garces wrote would make a perfect place for a mission for the local Indian populace in his exploration of the Rio Bravo de San Felipe now known as the [[Kern River]]. This site overlooks central Bakersfield atop a bluff that was once the delta of the Kern River.

In the early years, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Sisters' Congregation of St. Thomas Aquinas taught the girls and handled the school's administration and the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Brothers of the Christian Schools]] (Christian Brothers) taught the boys.  The Christian Brothers, due to financial issues within their order, withdrew from the school in 1971 and the school became fully co-educational.  In 1978 the administration of the school was taken over by the laity and is currently overseen by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno Diocesan Office of Education]], who also oversees Garces' main rival, [[San Joaquin Memorial High School]] of Fresno. 

Seeing as Garces Memorial High School is a private institution, fund-raising is important for funding current and future activities; the Garces Formal and Casual Galas make up a major part of its efforts. With help from the students, parents, alumni and the Garces community, numerous items are donated and auctioned off at these events. 

The Garces curriculum offers [[college prep]], [[Honors course|honors]], and [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses in many subjects.  As a Catholic institution, the high school requires theology classes for all four years. Electives include Computer Programming, Art, Theatre, Journalism, Year Book, Psychology, and others. 

The Garces sports teams, nicknamed the Rams, compete in [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF Central Section Division III]]. Coached by David Fanucchi, the Garces Rams football team recently won the Valley Championship (2006). Garces also holds the Valley Championship in girl's volleyball (2007) and both girls and boys basketball teams (2008). Also, in boys and girls swimming (2007). The school has 106 valley championships, ranking it fourth all-time in the Central Section CIF.

Clubs and activities include [[speech and debate]], [[Mock_Trial#High_school_mock_trial|mock trial]], the [[theater company]], [[Key Club]], and others. 

Garces Memorial High School celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2007. 

On June 14, 2008, Principal Robert Garcia died from pneumonia at age 58, three years into his tenure.&lt;ref name=KGET061608&gt;[http://www.kget.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=12f04186-95e9-428a-aada-c9fb8c26858e Garces' principal dies at 58], KGET TV 17, Accessed June 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
