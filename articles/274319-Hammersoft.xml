The '''Scottish Parliament election, 2003''', was the second [[general election]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It was held on 1 May 2003 and it brought no change in terms of control of the [[Scottish Executive]]. [[Jack McConnell]], the [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP)]], remained in office as [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] and the Executive continued as a Labour and [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] [[coalition]].

The results also showed rises in support for &quot;minor parties&quot; including the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party|Scottish Socialist Party (SSP)]] and declines in support for the Labour Party and the [[Scottish National Party|Scottish National Party (SNP)]]. The [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative and Unionist Party]] and the Scottish Liberal Democrats each polled almost exactly the same percentage of the vote as they had in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|1999 election]], with each holding the same number of seats as before.

Three [[independent politician|independent]] MSPs were elected: [[Dennis Canavan]], [[Margo MacDonald]] and [[Jean Turner]].  [[John Swinburne (Member of Scottish Parliament)|John Swinburne]], leader of the [[Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party]], was also elected. This led to talk of a &quot;rainbow&quot; Parliament, but the arithmetic meant that the [[coalition]] of Labour and Scottish Liberal Democrats could continue in office, which they did until the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 election]].

The decline in support for the SNP was viewed by some as a rejection of the case for [[Scottish independence]]. Others argued against this, pointing out that the number of MSPs in favour of independence actually rose because most of the minor parties such as the SSP share this position with the SNP.

For a full list of MSPs elected or re-elected see ''[[Members of the Scottish Parliament, 2003-2007]]''.

==Party leaders in 2003==

2. Two &quot;others&quot; were elected in constituencies: [[Dennis Canavan]] and [[Jean Turner]], who both stood as [[independent politician|independent]]s.

3. Two &quot;others&quot; were elected as Additional Members: [[Margo MacDonald]] (an independent) and  [[John Swinburne (Member of Scottish Parliament)|John Swinburne]], who represented the [[SSCUP]].

4. Overall turnout was 49.4%, down on the [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|1999 election]].
