The village has long had a [[church (building)|church]] dedicated to [[St. Giles]]. However, the 13th century building was destroyed by fire in 1760, and was rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style using [[sandstone]] quarried from [[Hopwas Hayes]] wood. The church contains memorial panelling for [[Samuel Lipscomb Seckham]] (1827â1900), architect and [[High Sheriff of Staffordshire]], who lived at [[Whittington Old Hall]], a 16th century mansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-staffordshire-encyclopaedia.co.uk/view.php?id=89 Church Memorials Wheaton Aston-Winshill], ''[http://www.the-staffordshire-encyclopaedia.co.uk/ The Staffordshire Encyclopedia]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whittington Barracks {{anchor|Whittington Barracks}} ==
The military barracks were known as the Lichfield [[Army Training Regiment]]. Construction of the Barracks for the Depots of the two Regiments and for a Militia Battalion (of which there were four in the county) started in 1877. During the [[Second World War]], Whittington Barracks was essentially handed over to the [[US Army]] to serve as their 10th Replacement Depot.

To the west and south of the village lies Whittington Heath. The [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] was the originally the site of the Lichfield races which had moved from [[Fradley]] in 1702. During the 18th century they were one of the largest and well attended meeting in the Midlands &amp;ndash; in 1773 a grandstand was erected near the [[Lichfield]]-[[Tamworth]] Road. However during the course of the 19th century the popularity of the races dwindled, and military use of the heath grew. In 1875, the [[Marquess of Anglesey]] was approached by the War Department and asked if he would sell Whittington Heath for the building of a barracks, to which he agreed. October 29, 1880 was the date recorded as the formal handing over of the newly built barrack to the military. In 1895 the last race meeting was held when the war office declared it was &quot;undesirable to hold a race meeting at the gate of the barracks.&quot;. The Lichfield races are still remembered the name of a local [[pub]] in Freeford called the Horse &amp; Jockey. In Lichfield, there is another pub called &quot;The Scales&quot;  was where the race jockeys were &quot;weighed in&quot;.

The old grandstand originally became a soldiers home, although it is now the base of the Whittington Heath Golf Course. Golf had been played in the area as the Whittington Barracks Golf Course since 1910 but the land was not brought out from the area until 1994.

The barracks has been a training centre for the Army since 1881 was home to [[Army Training Regiment]] Litchfield, which trained new recruits on their Phase 1 Common Military Training (ie. becoming soldiers) from The [[Royal Signals]] and The [[Royal Engineers]], from 2002 until 2008 when Major General Andrew Farquhar CBE, General Officer Commanding the Army's 5th Division, inspected the recruits and took the salute before the [[Army Training Regiment]]'s flag was lowered for the very last time. Training for The [[Royal Engineers]] moved to the [[Army Training Regiment]] in [[Bassingbourn]], while The [[Royal Signals]] moved to the [[Army Training Regiment]] in [[Pirbright]].

The Army Development and Training Centre, the new Regional Rehabilitation Unit (West Midlands) and the Lichfield Support Unit remain at Whittington Barracks.

The site is also home to [[The Staffordshire Regiment Museum]]. As of 2007 Whittington Barracks became the home for Regimental Headquarters of the newly formed [[Mercian Regiment]].

In 2008 the Labour Government set in motion the centralisation of all planning and training of the [[Defence Medical Services]] at Whittington Barracks. The relocation of the Headquarters of the [[Surgeon-General (United Kingdom)|Surgeon-General]] (HQSG) and major components of the Joint Medical Command (JMC) is proceeding to plan in accordance with approvals given in July 2008.

The new HQ, named Coltman House, has been built and is now fully occupied. Alongside the HQSG, the elements of the JMC now at Whittington comprise the defence medical group and the JMC HQ previously at [[Fort Blockhouse]], [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]], the Director of Healthcare previously based in Whitehall, the Defence Dental Service previously located at [[RAF Halton]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and the Defence Postgraduate Medical Dean, previously located in [[Birmingham]] at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at [[Selly Oak Hospital]]. The single service medical heads, the [[Army Medical Services]], [[Royal Navy Medical Service|Royal Navy Medical Branch]] and [[RAF Medical Branch|Royal Air Force Medical Branch]]. 

A second phase at the barracks â now renamed Defence Medical Services Whittington â is also anticipated to begin in the summer of 2010. This will include new training facilities, a new learning centre, a new lecture theatre, new messes for officers, warrant officers and NCOs â and a new junior ranks dining and leisure facility.

All these moves from other parts of the country will clearly make Whittington and [[Lichfield]] the national centre for military medical training and planning in the United Kingdom.

This, combined with the nearby [[Armed Forces Memorial]], is helping to put [[Lichfield]] on the military map of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and has is good news for the local economy.
