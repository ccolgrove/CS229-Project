{{Main|History of Drexel University}}

Drexel University was founded in 1891 as the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry by Philadelphia financier and philanthropist [[Anthony J. Drexel]] to provide educational opportunities in the âpractical arts and sciencesâ for women and men of all backgrounds. Drexel became the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936, and in 1970 Drexel Institute of Technology gained university status, becoming Drexel University. Although there were many changes during its first century, the university's identity has been held constant as privately controlled, non-sectarian, coeducational center of higher learning, distinguished by a commitment to preparing both men and women for future success. Drexel's cornerstone of the career preparation, the cooperative education program, was introduced in 1919.The program became integral to the university's unique educational experience. Participating students alternate periods of classroom based study with periods of full-time [[Internship|practical work experience]] related to their academic and career interests.

From 1995 to 2009, the president of Drexel University, Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], led the institution towards significant change. President Papadakis oversaw Drexel's largest expansion ever, the endowment increased +471% to $540M, and total enrollment increased +102% to 18,466. The institution continued to climb in the rankings, became more selective, and obtained a more academically talented student body. During the expansion, Drexel was officially united with the former MCP Hahnemann University, creating the [[Drexel University College of Medicine]] in 2002; and in the fall of 2006, Drexel established its School of Law, which was fully accredited by [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earlemacklaw.drexel.edu/about/ABA_accreditation/ |title=Drexel University Earle Mack School of Law ABA Accreditation |accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Dr. [[Constantine Papadakis]], died of pneumonia. His successor is Mr. [[John Anderson Fry]], formerly the president of [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] and the Executive Vice President of [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fry&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fandm.edu/past-presidents/john-fry |title=Past Presidents: John Fry  |accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Drexel acquired [[The Academy of Natural Sciences]]. The agreement created an international powerhouse for discovery in the natural and environmental sciences.

===University City Main Campus===
The {{convert|77|acre|ha|sing=on}} University City Main Campus of Drexel University is located just west of the [[Schuylkill River]] in the [[University City]] district of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It is Drexel's largest and oldest campus and contains its administrative offices and the main academic center for students. The northern residential portion of the main campus is located in the [[Powelton Village]] section of West Philadelphia. The two prominent performing stages at Drexel University are the Mandell Theater and the Main Auditorium. The Main Auditorium dates back to the founding of Drexel and construction of its main hall. It features over 1000 seats, and a [[pipe organ]] installed in 1928. The organ was purchased by [[Saturday Evening Post]] publisher [[Cyrus H. K. Curtis]] after he had donated a similar organ, the [[Curtis Organ]], to nearby [[University of Pennsylvania]] and it was suggested that he do the same for Drexel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drexel.edu/univrel/new/alumnimagazine/fall_2004.pdf Drexel Legends and Traditions]&lt;/ref&gt; The 424-seat Mandell Theater was built in 1973 and features a more performance-oriented stage, including a full [[fly system]], modern stage lighting facilities, stadium seating, and accommodations for wheelchairs. It is used for the semiannual spring musical, as well as various plays and many events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucityphila.org/cityguide/go/294 Mandell Theater at Drexel University]{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
[[Image:North Hall.JPG|right|300px|thumb|North Hall by architect [[Michael Graves]]]]
Drexel requires all non-commuting first year students to live in one of its ten residence halls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drexel.edu/dbs/universityHousing/assignmentPolicies/ |title=Drexel University Housing Policies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly Hall, Myers Hall, Towers Hall, and Calhoun Hall are traditional residence halls (shared bedroom, community bathrooms), while North Hall, Caneris Hall, Race Street Residence Hall, and Van Rensselaer Hall are suite style residence halls (shared bedrooms, private bathrooms, kitchens, and common area within the suite). Millennium Hall, Drexel's newest residence hall, is a modified suite (shared bedrooms, and segmented, private bathrooms in the hallway). Drexel also leases several floors of the University Crossings apartment complex for upper class students.

The Residential Living Office (RLO) at Drexel has developed a Residential Experience Engagement Model which is designed to support residents of all class levels.

*The First Year Experience: Calhoun, Kelly, Towers Halls
*Living Learning Communities: Myers Hall
*Pennoni Honors College: Millennium Hall
*The Sophomore Year Experience: Race Street Residence Halls
*For Students By Students (FSBS): North Hall
*The Upper Class Experience: Caneris Hall &amp; University Crossings
*The Graduate Student Experience: Drexel Apartments (formerly Van Rensselaer Hall) and Stiles Memorial Hall

Portions of the Race Street Residence Hall formerly was reserved for students of the [[Pennoni Honors College]]. However, during the 2007 spring term, the Race Street Dormitory housed Kelly Hall residents, while Kelly Hall underwent renovation. It was recently announced that for 2010-2011 the Honors Living Learning Community will be moved to Millennium Hall and the Sophomore Year Experience moved into the Race Street Residence Hall. Van Rensselaer Hall will also be utilized by the Graduate Student Experience.

All residence halls except Caneris Hall, University Crossings, and Stiles Memorial Hall and are located north of Arch Street between 34th Street and 32nd Street in the [[Powelton Village, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Powelton Village]] area.

===Greek life===
Ten percent of Drexel's undergraduate population is a member of a social Greek organization. There are currently 11 [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|Interfraternity Council]] (IFC) chapters, five [[National Panhellenic Conference|Panhellenic Council]] (PHC) chapters and nine Multi-cultural Greek Council (MGC) chapters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drexel.edu/studentlife/fsl/chapters.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Three IFC Chapters have been awarded Top Chapters in 2008 by their respective national organizations; [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], and [[Alpha Chi Rho]].

Each year, all social Greek organizations at Drexel compete in Greek Week, a week long competition with events such as a talent show with the culminating event being the [[tug of war]].

The week after Greek Week the Dean's Cup is presented for the previous year. The Dean's Cup is the highest award for Drexel Greeks. The winners of the Dean's Cup are determined by the highest score on the Chapter Achievement Plan (CAP) which is the annual recognition process for Drexel Greeks. The Dean's Cup is reviewed by a selected committee of Student Life faculty. The Dean of Students awards the Dean's Cup, which is awarded to the top chapter in each council in the areas of academics, leadership, brother/sisterhood and service to the community.

==Student lore and traditions==

Tradition suggests that rubbing the toe of the [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] &quot;Waterboy&quot; [[statue]] located in the Main Building atrium can result in receiving good grades in exams.
