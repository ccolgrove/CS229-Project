The '''Nazi salute''', or '''Hitler salute''' ({{lang-de|link=no|HitlergruÃ}}, literally Hitler Greeting or ''Deutscher GruÃ'', German Greeting), was a [[gesture]] of greeting in [[Nazi Germany]] usually accompanied by saying, ''Heil Hitler!'' [&quot;Hail Hitler!&quot;], ''Heil, mein [[FÃ¼hrer]]'' [&quot;Hail, my leader!&quot;], or ''Sieg Heil!'' [&quot;Hail victory!&quot;]. Characteristic of a [[cult of personality]], it was adopted in the 1930s by the Nazi Party to signal obedience to the party's leader [[Adolf Hitler]] and to glorify the German nation and later the war effort. The salute was mandatory for civilians&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth60&quot; /&gt; but optional for [[Wehrmacht|military personnel]], where the traditional [[salute|military salute]] was retained until shortly after the [[20 July plot|failed assassination attempt on Hitler]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;BÃ¼chner, Alex (1991).

==Description==
To perform the salute, it was customary to extend one's right arm straight in front of oneself, raise it at least to eye level, straighten the hand so that it is parallel to the arm&lt;ref name=&quot;Grunberger&quot; /&gt; and say emphatically, ''Heil Hitler!'', or at least ''Heil!'' If one saw an acquaintance at a distance, it sufficed to simply raise the right hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grunberger&quot; /&gt; If one encountered a superior, one would also say, ''Heil Hitler''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grunberger&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Grunberger |first=Richard |title=The 12-year Reich: a social history of Nazi Germany, 1933â1945 |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995 |edition=illustrated |isbn=0306806606, 9780306806605}}&lt;/ref&gt; If physical disability prevented raising the right arm, it was acceptable to raise the left.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot; /&gt;
The form ''Heil, mein FÃ¼hrer!'' was for direct address to Hitler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lepage&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lepage |first= Jean-Denis G.

In later periods Hitler himself used a modified German salute, not stretching his full right arm, but bending it while holding an open hand towards the greeted at shoulder's height.

By autumn 1923, some members of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] were using the rigid, outstretched right arm salute to greet their leader; and the leader responded by raising his own right hand crooked back at the elbow, palm opened upwards, in a gesture of acceptance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |title=The Coming of the Third Reich |publisher=Penguin Group |year=2005 |edition=reprint, illustrated |pages=184â185 |chapter=The Rize of Nazism |isbn=0143034693, 9780143034698}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the ''Heil Hitler'' salute was made compulsory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;Kershaw (2001), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It functioned as a display of commitment to the Party and a [[declaration]] of principle to the outside world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman55&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the drive to gain acceptance did not go unchallenged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman55&quot; /&gt;

Some party members challenged the legitimacy of the so-called Roman salute employed by Fascist Italy, as not [[German folklore|Germanic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman55&quot; /&gt; In response, efforts were made to establish its pedigree by inventing a tradition after the fact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman55&quot; /&gt; In June 1928, [[Rudolph Hess]] published an article titled &quot;The Fascist Greeting&quot;, which claimed the gesture was used in Germany as early as 1921, before the Nazis had heard about the Italian Fascists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman556&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), pp.55â56&lt;/ref&gt; He admits in the article: &quot;The NSDAP's introduction of the raised-arm greeting approximately two years ago still gets some people's blood boiling.  Its opponents suspect the greeting of being un-Germanic. They accuse it of merely aping the (Italian) Fascists&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman56&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; but goes on to ask, &quot;and even if the decree from two years ago (Hess's order that all party members use it) is seen as an adaption of the Fascist gesture, is that really so terrible&quot;?&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman56&quot; /&gt; [[Ian Kershaw]] points out that Hess did not deny the likely influence from Fascist Italy, even if indeed the salute had been used sporadically in 1921 as Hess claimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kershaw |first=Ian |title=Hitler, 1889â1936: hubris |publisher=W.

I'd read the description of the sitting of the [[Diet of Worms]], in the course of which [[Martin Luther|Luther]] was greeted with the German salute.  It was to show him that he was not being confronted with arms, but with peaceful intentions.  In the days of [[Frederick the Great]], people still saluted with their hats, with pompous gestures.  In the [[Middle Ages]] the serfs humbly doffed their bonnets, whilst the noblemen gave the German salute. It was in the [[The Ratskeller in Bremen|Ratskeller at Bremen]], about the year 1921, that I first saw this style of salute.  It must be regarded as a survival of an ancient custom, which originally signified: &quot;See, I have no weapon in my hand!&quot; I introduced the salute into the Party at our first meeting in [[Weimar]].  The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] at once gave it a soldierly style.

The compulsory use of the Hitler salute for all public employees followed a directive issued by Reich [[Minister of the Interior]] [[Wilhelm Frick]] on 13 July 1933, one day before the ban on all non-Nazi parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth60&quot; &gt;Kershaw (2001) p.60&lt;/ref&gt; The decree also required the salute during the singing of the national anthem and the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth60&quot; /&gt; It stipulated that &quot;anyone not wishing to come under suspicion of behaving in a consciously negative fashion will therefore render the Hitler Greeting&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth60&quot; /&gt; A rider to the decree, added two weeks later, stipulated that if physical disability prevented raising of the right arm, &quot;then it is correct to carry out the Greeting with the left arm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot; /&gt; On 27 September, prison inmates were forbidden to use the salute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60B10FC3E541A7A93C5AB1782D85F478385F9 |title=Nazi Salute Banned in Prisons |last=Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES |date=27 September 1933 |work=The New York Times |page=12 |accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were Jews by 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wehrmacht]] refused to adopt the Hitler salute and was able for a time to maintain its own customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman80&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009) pp. 80â82.&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise edict from the Reich Defense Ministry, released on 19 September 1933, required the Hitler salute of soldiers and uniformed civil servants while singing the ''[[Horst Wessel Lied]]'' and [[Deutschlandlied|national anthem]], and in non-military encounters both within and outside the Wehrmacht (for example, when greeting members of the civilian government). At all other times they were to use their traditional salutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman80&quot; /&gt; Only after the [[20 July Plot]] in 1944 were the military forces of the Third Reich ordered to replace the standard military salute with the Hitler salute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman82&quot; /&gt; The order went into effect on 24 July 1944, four days after the attempt on Hitler's life in [[KÄtrzyn|Rastenburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman82&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 3 January 1942, Hitler stated the following about the compromise edict of 1933:&lt;ref name=&quot;tabletalk&quot; /&gt; {{quote|I imposed the German salute for the following reason. I'd given orders, at the beginning, that in the Army I should not be greeted with the German salute. But many people forgot. [[Werner von Fritsch|Fritsch]] drew his conclusions, and punished all who forgot to give me the military salute, with fourteen days' confinement to barracks. I, in turn, drew my conclusions and introduced the German salute likewise into the Army.|Adolf Hitler|''[[Hitler's Table Talk]]}}

Despite indoctrination and punishment, the salute was ridiculed by some people. Since &quot;heil&quot; is also the imperative of the German verb &quot;heilen&quot; (&quot;to heal&quot;), a common joke in Nazi Germany was to reply with &quot;Is he sick?&quot;, &quot;Am I a doctor?&quot;, or &quot;You heal him!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman44&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes were also made by distorting the phrase. So for example ''Heil Hitler'' might become ''Ein Liter'' (&quot;One liter&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman44&quot; /&gt; Cabaret performer [[Karl Valentin]] would quip, &quot;It's lucky that Hitler's name wasn't 'KrÃ¤uter'. Otherwise, we'd have to go around yelling HeilkrÃ¤uter ('medicinal herbs')&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman44&quot; /&gt;

Satirical use of the salute dates back to anti-Nazi propaganda in Germany before 1933. In 1932, [[photomontage]] artist [[John Heartfield]] used Hitler's modified version, with the hand bent over the shoulder, in a poster that linked Hitler to [[Big Business]]. A giant figure representing [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] capitalists stands behind Hitler, placing money in his hand, suggesting 'backhand' donations. The caption is, &quot;the meaning of the Hitler salute&quot; and &quot;Millions stand behind me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay&quot;&gt;

==Sieg Heil==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-04481B, Berlin, Maifeier auf dem Tempelhofer Feld.jpg|thumb|upright|A mass rally on [[Tempelhof]] field, 1 May 1935]]
''Sieg Heil'' was a ritualistic chant used at mass rallies, where enthusiastic crowds answered ''Heil'' to the call of ''Sieg'' (&quot;victory&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, Rudolf Hess ends his climactic speech with, &quot;The Party is Hitler. But Hitler is Germany, just as Germany is Hitler. Hitler! Sieg Heil!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2001), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; At his [[Sportpalast speech|total war speech]] delivered in 1943, audiences shouted ''Sieg Heil'' as [[Joseph Goebbels]] solicited from them &quot;a kind of plebiscitary 'Ja' to self destruction in a war which Germany could by now neither win nor end through negotiated peace&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw
N561&quot;&gt;Kershaw (2000), pp. 561â562.&lt;/ref&gt;
In correspondence with high-ranking nazi officials, letters were usually signed with &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klee, Kulturlexikon, S. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 1945, less than two months before the [[Victory Day (9 May)|capitulation of Nazi Germany]], a memorial for the dead of the war was held in [[Marktschellenberg]], a small town near Hitler's [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof residence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw Nemesis&quot;&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 766.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ian Kershaw]] reports, &quot;When the leader of the Wehrmacht unit at the end of his speech called for a ''Sieg Heil'' for the Fuhrer, it was returned neither by the Wehrmacht present, nor by the [[Volkssturm]], nor by the spectators of the civilian population who had turned up. This silence of the masses... probably reflects better than anything else, the attitudes of the population.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw Nemesis&quot; /&gt;

The [[Swing Kids]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Swing Jugend}}) were a group of middle-class teenagers who consciously separated themselves from Nazism and its culture, greeting each other with 'Swing-Heil!' and addressing one another as 'old-hot-boy'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willett |first=Ralph |date=May 1989|title=Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939â49 |journal=Popular Music |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume= 8 |issue=2 |page=161 |jstor=853465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This playful behaviour was dangerous for participants in the subculture; on 2 January 1942, [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered that the leaders be put in concentration camps to be drilled and beaten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willet&quot; /&gt;

In the United States, [[Charlie Chaplin]] produced and directed a [[comedy film]] called ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' that satirised Adolf Hitler and Nazism and portrayed the protagonist, Adenoid Hynkel, as ridiculously obsessed with the salute.

Because of the similarity between the [[Bellamy salute]] in the United States and the Nazi salute, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] instituted the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] and the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] in the United States, instead of the Bellamy salute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bishop&quot;&gt;

Today in Germany, Nazi salutes in written form, vocally, and even straight-extending the right arm with or without the phrase, are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Usage that is &quot;ironic and clearly critical of the Hitler Greeting&quot; is exempt, and this exemption has led to legal debates as to what constitutes ironic use of the salute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman95&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; One recent case involved [[Ernst August, Prince of Hanover (b. 1954)|Prince Albrecht of Hanover]], who was brought to court after using the gesture as a commentary on the behavior of an overly zealous airport baggage inspector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman95&quot; /&gt; On 23 November 2007, the [[Amtsgericht]] [[Cottbus]] sentenced [[Horst Mahler]] to six months of imprisonment without parole for having, according to his own claims, ironically performed the Hitler salute when reporting to prison for a nine-month term a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 2007 |title=Sechs Monate fÃ¼r HitlergruÃ |language=German|publisher=[[Die Zeit]]/[[dpa]] |url=http://www.zeit.de/online/2007/48/mahler-urteil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, a pensioner named Roland T was given a prison term of five months for, amongst other things, training his dog Adolf to raise his right paw in a Nazi salute every time the command &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot; was uttered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paterson &quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dogs-nazi-salute-lands-owner-in-jail-for-five-months-766438.html |title=Dog's Nazi salute lands owner in jail for five months |last=Paterson |first=Tony |date=21 December 2007 |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of the salute are used by [[neo-Nazis]], who also use the number '''88''' to stand for &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; (the [[8 (number)|8]] standing for [[H]], the eighth letter of the alphabet).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilman94&quot;&gt;Tilman (2009), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; One version is the so-called [[Michael KÃ¼hnen|KÃ¼hnen]] salute with extended thumb, [[index finger|index]] and [[middle finger]], also forbidden in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=27 August 2009}} Second paragraph: &quot;The KÃ¼hnengruÃ is regarded as a variation of the Hitler salute. In it the right arm is extended with three fingers spread. In Austria, unlike Germany, the salute is not prohibited&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, Neo-Nazis are usually seen to perform this salute. The Swiss [[RÃ¼tlischwur]], the traditional oath of pledge sworn at the founding of Switzerland in 1291, was also made with the three fingers extended, although the arm was not fully extended as in the Hitler pledge.

Satirical displays of the salute continued after the war. A notable example is [[Mel Brooks]]' comedy film ''[[The Producers]]'', in which the Hitler salute is performed as a [[can-can]] dance in the [[Play within a play|fictional musical]] ''[[Springtime for Hitler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The border between satirical and offensive usage of the term &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; is sometimes ambiguous. On 1 December 2003, [[DieudonnÃ© M'bala M'bala]] appeared live on a television show, disguised as a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (Orthodox) Jew making the Hitler salute and bellowing &quot;Isra-Heil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24heures.ch/actu/culture/dieudonne-promo-pire-2009-01-06 ''DieudonnÃ©, la promo par le pire''], [[24 heures]], 7 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was cleared of charges of antisemitism in a Paris court after the judge said this was not an attack against Jews in general but against a type of person &quot;distinguished by their political views&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
