==History==
[[Image:JPMorgan Chase.svg|200px|thumb|right|JPMorgan Chase logo, prior to the 2008 rebranding]]JPMorgan Chase, in its current structure, is the result of the combination of several large U.S. banking companies over the last decade including [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], [[Bank One]], [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Washington Mutual]]. Going back further, its predecessors include major banking firms among which are [[Chemical Bank]], [[Manufacturers Hanover]], [[First Chicago Bank]], [[National Bank of Detroit]], [[Texas Commerce Bank]], [[Providian Financial]] and [[Great Western Bank]].

===Chemical Banking Corporation===
{{Main|Chemical Banking Corporation}}
The New York Chemical Manufacturing Company was founded in 1823 as a maker of various chemicals. In 1824, the company amended its charter to perform banking activities and created the [[Chemical Bank of New York]]. After 1851, the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, most notably with [[Corn Exchange Bank]] in 1954, [[Texas Commerce Bank]] (a large bank in Texas) in 1986, and [[Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company]] in 1991 (the first major bank merger &quot;among equals&quot;). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of [[leveraged buyout]] transactions. In 1984, Chemical launched [[Chemical Venture Partners]] to invest in [[private equity]] transactions alongside various [[financial sponsor]]s. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a [[leveraged finance|syndicated leveraged finance]] business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker, [[James B. Lee, Jr.|Jimmy Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3522103.arc.htm Jimmy Lee's Global Chase]. New York Times, April 14, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/11/business/kingpin-of-the-big-time-loan.html Kingpin of the Big-Time Loan]. New York Times, August 11, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  At many points throughout this history, Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of [[assets]] or [[deposit market share]]).

In 1996, Chemical Bank acquired the [[Chase Manhattan Corporation]] taking the more prominent Chase name. In 2000, the combined company acquired [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]] and combined the two names to form what is today JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPMorgan Chase retains [[Chemical Bank]]'s headquarters at 270 Park Avenue and stock price history.

===Chase Manhattan Bank===
{{Main|Chase Manhattan Bank}}
[[Image:Chase logo pre historical.jpg|thumb|200px|Logo used by Chase following the merger with the Manhattan Bank in 1955.]]
The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] was formed upon the 1955 purchase of Chase National Bank (established in 1877) by the [[Bank of the Manhattan Company]] (established in 1799),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/About-JPMC/document/shorthistory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the company's oldest predecessor institution. The Bank of the Manhattan Company was the creation of [[Aaron Burr]], who transformed The Manhattan Company from a water carrier into a bank.

Led by [[David Rockefeller]] during the 1970s and the 1980s, Chase Manhattan emerged as one of the largest and most prestigious banking concerns, with leadership positions in syndicated lending, treasury and securities services, credit cards, mortgages, and retail financial services. Weakened by the real estate collapse in the early 1990s, it was acquired by [[Chemical Bank]] in 1996 retaining the prominent Chase name. Prior to its notable merger with J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., the new Chase expanded the investment and asset management groups through two acquisitions. In 1999, it acquired San Francisco-based [[Hambrecht &amp; Quist]] for $1.35&amp;nbsp;billion. In April 2000, UK-based [[Robert Fleming &amp; Co.]] was sold to the new Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7&amp;nbsp;billion.

According to page 114 of ''An Empire of Wealth'' by John Steele Gordon, the origin of this strand of JPMorgan Chase's history runs as follows:
{{quote|At the turn of the nineteenth century, obtaining a bank charter required an act of the state legislature. This of course injected a powerful element of politics into the process and invited what today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual. Hamilton's political enemyâand eventual murdererâ[[Aaron Burr]] was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company, called the Manhattan Company, to provide clean water to New York City. The innocuous-looking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise. Within six months of the company's creation, and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe, the company opened a bank, the Bank of the Manhattan Company. Still in existence, it is today J.P.Morgan Chase, the second largest bank in the United States.}}

===J.P. Morgan &amp; Company===
{{Main|J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.}}
[[Image:JP Morgan logo.jpg|200px|thumb|J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. logo before its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000]]
The heritage of the [[House of Morgan]] traces its roots to the partnership of [[Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co.]], which in 1895 was renamed [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.]] (see also: [[J. Pierpont Morgan]]). Arguably the most influential financial institution of its era, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. financed the formation of the [[United States Steel Corporation]], which took over the business of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and others and was the world's first billion-dollar corporation. In 1895, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. supplied the United States government with $62&amp;nbsp;million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the [[United States Department of the Treasury|treasury]] surplus of $100&amp;nbsp;million. In 1892, the company began to finance the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England. Although his name was big, Morgan owned only 19% of Morgan assets. The rest was owned by the [[Rothschild family]] following a series of bailouts and rescues attributed by some to Morgan's stubborn will and seemingly &quot;non-existent&quot; investment savvy.

[[Image:Wallstreetbmb.jpg|thumb|200px|September 16, 1920: a bomb exploded in front of the headquarters of J.P. Morgan Inc. at [[23 Wall Street]], injuring 400 and killing 38 people.]]
Built in 1914, [[23 Wall Street]] was known as the &quot;House of Morgan&quot;, and for decades the bank's headquarters was the most important address in American finance. At noon, on September 16, 1920, a [[Wall Street bombing|terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank]], injuring 400 and killing 38. Shortly before the bomb went off, a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The warning read: &quot;Remember we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you. American Anarchists Fighters.&quot; While theories abound about who was behind the bombing and why they did it, after 20 years of investigation the [[FBI]] rendered the case inactive without ever finding the perpetrators.

In August 1914, [[Henry P. Davison]], a Morgan partner, traveled to the UK and made a deal with the [[Bank of England]] to make J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. the monopoly underwriter of [[war bonds]] for the UK and France. The Bank of England became a &quot;[[fiscal agent]]&quot; of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and vice-versa. The company also invested in the suppliers of [[war equipment]] to Britain and France. Thus, the company profited from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments.

In the 1930s, all of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. along with all integrated banking businesses in the United States, was required by the provisions of the [[GlassâSteagall Act]] to separate its [[investment banking]] from its [[commercial banking]] operations. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. chose to operate as a [[commercial bank]], because at the time commercial lending was perceived as more profitable and prestigious. Additionally, many within J.P. Morgan believed that a change in political climate would eventually allow the company to resume its securities businesses but it would be nearly impossible to reconstitute the bank if it were disassembled.

In 1935, after being barred from securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan spun off its investment-banking operations. Led by J.P. Morgan partners, [[Henry S. Morgan]] (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of [[J. Pierpont Morgan]]) and [[Harold Stanley]], [[Morgan Stanley]] was founded on September 16, 1935 with $6.6&amp;nbsp;million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners. In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. The bank would continue to operate as Morgan Guaranty Trust until the 1980s, before beginning to migrate back toward the use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1984, the group finally purchased the Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette Indiana, uniting a history between the two figures of [[Salmon Portland Chase]] and [[John Purdue]]. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.

===Bank One Corporation===
{{Main|Bank One Corporation}}
[[File:Bank one logo.png|thumb|left]]
In 2004, JPMorgan Chase merged with Chicago based [[Bank One Corporation|Bank One Corp.]], bringing on board current chairman and CEO [[Jamie Dimon]] as president and COO and designating him as CEO [[William B. Harrison, Jr.]]'s successor. Dimon's pay was pegged at 90% of Harrison's. Dimon quickly made his influence felt by embarking on a cost-cutting strategy, and replaced former JPMorgan Chase executives in key positions with Bank One executivesâmany of whom were with Dimon at [[Citigroup]]. Dimon became CEO in January 2006 and Chairman in December 2006.

[[Bank One Corporation]] was formed upon the 1998 merger between Banc One of [[Columbus, Ohio]] and [[First Chicago Bank|First Chicago NBD]]. These two large banking companies had themselves been created through the merger of many banks. This merger was largely considered a failure until Dimonârecently ousted as President of Citigroupâtook over and reformed the new firm's practicesâespecially its disastrous technology mishmash inherited from the many mergers prior to this one. Dimon effected more than sufficient changes to make Bank One Corporation a viable merger partner for JPMorgan Chase.
[[Image:First Chicago Bank Logo.png|thumb]]
Bank One Corporation traced its roots to First Bancgroup of Ohio, founded as a holding company for City National Bank of Columbus, Ohio and several other banks in that state, all of which were renamed &quot;Bank One&quot; when the holding company was renamed Banc One Corporation. With the beginning of interstate banking they spread into other states, always renaming acquired banks &quot;Bank One&quot;, though for a long time they resisted combining them into one bank. After the [[First Chicago Bank|First Chicago NBD]] merger, adverse financial results led to the departure of CEO [[John B. McCoy]], whose father and grandfather had headed Banc One and predecessors. Dimon was brought in to head the company. JPMorgan Chase completed the acquisition of [[Bank One]] in the third quarter of 2004. The former Bank One and First Chicago headquarters in Chicago serve as the headquarters of [[Chase (bank)|Chase]], JPMorgan Chase's commercial and retail banking subsidiary.

===Bear Stearns===
{{Main|Bear Stearns}}
[[File:Bear Stearns.svg|200px|thumb|right|Bear Stearns logo]]
At the end of 2007, [[Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc.]] was the fifth largest investment bank in the United States but its market capitalization had deteriorated through the second half of 2007. On Friday, March 14, 2008 Bear Stearns lost 47% of its equity market value to close at $30.00 per share as rumors emerged that clients were withdrawing capital from the bank. Over the following weekend it emerged that Bear Stearns might prove [[insolvent]] and on or around March 15, 2008 the Federal Reserve engineered a deal to prevent a wider systemic crisis from the collapse of Bear Stearns.

On March 16, 2008, after a weekend of intense negotiations between JPMorgan, Bear, and the federal government, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had plans to acquire Bear Stearns in a [[stock swap]] worth $2.00 per share or $240&amp;nbsp;million pending shareholder approval scheduled within 90 days. In the interim, JPMorgan Chase agreed to guarantee all Bear Stearns trades and business process flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Francesco|last=Guerrera|title=Bear races to forge deal with JPMorgan|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e2206ed2-f380-11dc-b6bc-0000779fd2ac.html|work=Financial Times|date=March 16, 2008|accessdate=March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, on March 18, 2008, JPMorgan Chase formally announced the acquisition of Bear Stearns for $236&amp;nbsp;million. The stock swap agreement was signed in the late-night hours of March 18, 2008, with JPMorgan agreeing to exchange 0.05473 of each of its shares upon closure of the merger for one Bear share, valuing the Bear shares at $2 each.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Quinn|title=JP Morgan Chase bags bargain Bear Stearns|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/03/17/cnbear117.xml|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=March 19, 2008|accessdate=March 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2008, after considerable public discontent by Bear Stearns shareholders over the low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share. Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns (using newly issued shares) at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board (representing another 10% of the share capital) that its members would vote in favor of the new deal. With sufficient commitments thus in hand to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on June 2, 2008.

===Washington Mutual===
{{Main|Washington Mutual}}
[[Image:Wamu svg.svg|200px|right|thumb|The Washington Mutual logo prior to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase.]] 
On September 25, 2008, JPMorgan Chase bought most of the banking operations of [[Washington Mutual]] from the [[receivership]] of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]. That night, the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]], in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, had seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership. The FDIC sold the bank's assets, secured debt obligations and deposits to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co for $1.836&amp;nbsp;billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. As a result of the takeover, Washington Mutual shareholders lost all their [[Equity investment|equity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, David. [http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/25/news/companies/JPM_WaMu/index.htm?postversion=2008092519 &quot;JPMorgan buys WaMu&quot;], CNNMoney.com, September 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

JPMorgan Chase raised $10&amp;nbsp;billion in a stock sale to cover writedowns and losses after taking on deposits and branches of Washington Mutual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a9FHelZ13yFM&amp;refer=news JPMorgan Raises $10&amp;nbsp;billion in Stock Sale After WaMu (Update3)]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the acquisition, JPMorgan now owns the former accounts of [[Providian Financial]], a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005. The company announced plans to complete the rebranding of Washington Mutual branches to Chase by late 2009.

Chief executive Alan H. Fishman was flying from New York to Seattle on the day the bank was closed, and eventually received a $7.5&amp;nbsp;million sign-on bonus and cash severance of $11.6&amp;nbsp;million after being CEO for 17 days.

===Other recent acquisitions===
In 2006, JPMorgan Chase purchased [[Collegiate Funding Services]], a portfolio company of private equity firm [[Lightyear Capital]], for $663&amp;nbsp;million. CFS was used as the foundation for the Chase Student Loans, previously known as Chase Education Finance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Dec_15/ai_n15949015 Chase to Acquire Collegiate Funding Services]. Business Wire, Dec 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase announced it would swap its [[corporate trust]] unit for [[Bank of New York Mellon|The Bank of New York Co.]]'s retail and small business banking network. The swap valued The Bank of New York business at $3.1&amp;nbsp;billion and JPMorgan's trust unit at $2.8&amp;nbsp;billion and gave Chase access to 338 additional branches and 700,000 new customers in New York, New Jersey, and Indiana.

In March 2008, JPMorgan acquired the UK-based [[carbon offset]]ting company [[Climate Care|ClimateCare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JPMorgan acquires carbon offset firm ClimateCare|work=The Guardian |location=London |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7412890 | date=March 26, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, JPMorgan announced it would acquire the balance of JPMorgan Cazenove, an advisory and underwriting joint venture established in 2004 with the [[Cazenove (stock broker)|Cazenove Group]], for GBP1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JPMorgan Buys Rest of Cazenove for 1&amp;nbsp;billion Pounds|work=Bloomberg |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aExgpC1XyF7g | date=November 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Credit derivatives ==
The derivatives team at JP Morgan, (including [[Blythe Masters]]), was a pioneer in the invention of [[credit derivative]]s such as the [[credit default swap]]. The first CDS was created to allow [[Exxon]] to borrow money from JP Morgan while JP Morgan transferred the risk to the [[European Bank of Reconstruction and Development]]. JP Morgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the [[Synthetic CDO]]. &lt;ref&gt;Fool's Gold, by Gillian Tett, Free Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations 2nd ed, Janet Tavakoli, 2008, Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal and regulatory proceedings ==

===Conflicts of interest on investment research===
In December 2002, Chase paid fines totaling $80&amp;nbsp;million, with the amount split between the states and the federal government. The fines were part of a settlement involving charges that ten banks, including Chase, deceived investors with biased research. The total settlement with the ten banks was $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion. The settlement required that the banks separate investment banking from research, and ban any allocation of IPO shares.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-firms-to-pay-14-billion-in-probe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enron===
Chase paid out over $2&amp;nbsp;billion in fines and legal settlements for their role in financing [[Enron]] Corporation, which collapsed amid a financial scandal in 2001. In 2003, Chase paid $160&amp;nbsp;million in fines and penalties to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Manhattan district attorneyâs office. In 2005, Chase paid $2.2&amp;nbsp;billion to settle a lawsuit filed by investors in Enron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/14/AR2005061401609.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Settlement In Enron Lawsuit For Chase | first=Carrie | last=Johnson | date=June 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WorldCom ===
JPMorgan Chase, which helped [[underwrite]] $15.4&amp;nbsp;billion of [[WorldCom]]'s bonds, agreed in March 2005 to pay $2&amp;nbsp;billion; that was 46 percent, or $630&amp;nbsp;million, more than it would have paid had it accepted an investor offer in May 2004 of $1.37&amp;nbsp;billion. J.P. Morgan was the last big lender to settle. Its payment is the second largest in the case, exceeded only by the $2.6&amp;nbsp;billion accord reached in 2004 by [[Citigroup]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gretchen Morgenson|Morgenson, Gretchen]] (March 17, 2005), [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/22/business/22worldcom.html NYtimes.com &quot;Bank to Pay $2&amp;nbsp;billion to Settle WorldCom Claims&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', retrieved July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, 16 of [[WorldCom]]'s 17 former underwriters reached settlements with the investors.&lt;ref&gt;Rovella, David E. &amp; Baer, Justin (March 16, 2005), [http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=auybDoZIEQTg&amp;refer=news_index &quot;JPMorgan to Pay $2 Bln to Settle WorldCom Fraud Suit&quot;], [[Bloomberg L.P.]], retrieved July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kccllc.net/documents/0812229/0812229090624000000000002.pdf KCCLCC.net]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jefferson County, Alabama ===
In November 2009, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. agreed to a $722&amp;nbsp;million settlement with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] to end a probe into sales of *[[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] that helped push Alabamaâs most populous county to the brink of bankruptcy. The settlement came a week after Birmingham, Alabama Mayor [[Larry Langford]] was convicted on 60 counts of bribery, money laundering, and tax evasion related to bond swaps for [[Jefferson County, Alabama]]. The SEC alleged that J.P. Morgan, which had been chosen by the county commissioners to underwrite the floating-rate sewer bond deals and provide interest-rate swaps, had made undisclosed payments to close friends of the commissioners in exchange for the deal. J.P. Morgan then allegedly made up for the costs by charging higher interest rates on the swaps.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Martin Z. &amp; Selway, William (November 4, 2009), [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aKdo.y7rr1ys&amp;pos=3 &quot;JPMorgan Ends SEC Alabama Swap Probe for $722&amp;nbsp;million&quot;], [[Bloomberg L.P.]], retrieved July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial Services Authority ===
In June 2010, J.P. Morgan Securities was fined 33.32&amp;nbsp;million [[pounds sterling]] ($49.12&amp;nbsp;million) by the UK [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) for failing to protect billions of dollars of client money over almost seven years. The firm had erroneously failed to properly segregate client funds from corporate funds following the merger of Chase and J.P. Morgan, resulting in a violation of FSA regulations but no losses to clients. J.P. Morgan Securities reported the incident to the FSA, corrected the errors, and cooperated in the ensuing investigation, resulting in the fine being reduced 30% from an original amount of Â£47.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finanznachrichten.de/nachrichten-2010-06/17063389-update-2-uk-fines-jpmorgan-record-dollar-49-mln-warns-other-banks-020.htm &quot;UK fines JPMorgan record $49 mln, warns other banks&quot;], [[AFX News]], June 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortgage overcharge of active military personnel ===
In January 2011, JPMorgan Chase admitted that it wrongly overcharged several thousand military families for their mortgages, including active duty personnel in Afghanistan. The bank also admitted it improperly foreclosed on more than a dozen military families; both actions were in clear violation of the [[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]] which automatically lowers mortgage rates to 6 percent, and bars foreclosure proceedings of active duty personnel. The overcharges may have never come to light were it not for legal action taken by Marine Capt. Jonathan Rowles, a fighter pilot. Both Capt. Rowles and his spouse Julia accused Chase of violating the law and harassing the couple for nonpayment. An official stated that the situation was &quot;grim&quot;, and Chase initially stated it would be refunding up to $2,000,000 to those who were overcharged, and that families improperly foreclosed on have gotten or will get their homes back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41043127/ &quot;No. 2 bank overcharged troops on mortgages&quot;], [[msnbc.com]], January 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Chase has acknowledged that as many as 6,000 active duty military personnel were illegally overcharged, and more than 18 military families homes were wrongly foreclosed. In April, Chase agreed to pay a total of $27&amp;nbsp;million in compensation to settle the class-action suit.&lt;ref&gt;Mui, Ylan Q.
