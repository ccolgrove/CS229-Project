The functionality of the library includes support for basic 2D graphics, image manipulation, text output, audio output, midi music, input and timers, as well as additional routines for fixed-point and floating-point [[matrix (math)|matrix]] arithmetic, unicode strings, file system access, file manipulation, data files, and (limited, software-only) 3D graphics.

As of version 4.0, programs that use the library work on [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[BeOS]], [[Mac OS X]], and various [[Unix-like|Unix-like systems]] with (or without) [[X Window System]], abstracting their [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) into one portable interface. There is also an independent port of Allegro on [[AmigaOS 4]].

Version 5.0 supports [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Unix-like|Unix-like systems]], and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]].

The library is written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and designed to be used with C or [[C++]]. It comes with extensive documentation and many examples.

==Addons==

The community of Allegro users have contributed several library extensions to handle things like scrolling tile maps and import and export of various file formats (e.g. [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[JPEG]] images, [[MPEG]] video, [[Ogg]], [[MP3]], [[Impulse Tracker|IT]], [[S3M (file format)|S3M]], [[XM (mod format)|XM music]], [[TrueType|TTF]] [[typeface|fonts]], and more). There are also [[Language_binding|bindings]] for several programming languages available, such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Perl]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]] and others.

Allegro can be used in conjunction with [[OpenGL]] by using the library ''AllegroGL'' which extends Allegro's functionality into OpenGL and therefore the hardware.

==History==
Initially standing for &quot;'''A'''tari '''L'''ow-'''Le'''vel '''G'''ame '''Ro'''utines&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/573313/574083#target Forum posting by Shawn Hargreaves]&lt;/ref&gt; Allegro was originally created by [[Shawn Hargreaves]] for the [[Atari ST]] in the early 1990s. However, Shawn abandoned the Atari version as he realized the platform was dying, and reimplemented his work for the [[Borland]] C++ and [[DJGPP]] compilers in 1995. Support for Borland C++ was dropped in version 2.0, and DJGPP was the only supported compiler. As DJGPP was a [[DOS]] compiler, all games which used Allegro therefore used DOS. Around 1998, Allegro branched out into several versions. A port to [[Microsoft Windows]], WinAllegro, was created, and also during this time, a Unix port of Allegro, XwinAllegro, was created. These various ports were brought together during the Allegro 3.9 WIP versions, with Allegro 4.0 being the first stable version of Allegro to support multiple platforms. The current version of Allegro supports Unix ([[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Irix]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]), Windows ([[MSVC]], [[MinGW]], [[Cygwin]], [[Borland C++]]), [[Mac OS X]] and, up to the 4.2 version, [[BeOS]], [[QNX]], and DOS ([[DJGPP]], [[Watcom C Compiler|Watcom]]). An iPhone port is being developed too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://alleg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.9/src/iphone/ the iPhone directory in the svn repository]&lt;/ref&gt; Shawn Hargreaves is no longer involved with Allegro.

For hardware accelerated 3D and 2D acceleration on Linux, Mac OS X and DOS, AllegroGL and OpenLayer are available. They are two add-on libraries that use [[OpenGL]] for accelerated graphics routines and use Allegro for all other gaming needs. Note that, combined with [[Glide API|Glide]] and [[Mesa 3D|MesaFX]] (using [[3dfx]] hardware), AllegroGL is one of the few available opensource solutions for hardware accelerated 3D under DOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesa 3-D graphics library|author=Daniel Borca &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR --&gt;|url=http://www.geocities.com/dborca/opengl/mesa.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kmXKDZoH|archivedate=2009-10-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphic functions==

* Vector drawing:
** pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, Bezier splines
** shape fill, with or without pattern
** polygons: flat, Gouraud, textured (3D) and translucent
* Sprites:
** masked, compressed and compiled sprites
** blitting, rotation, stretching, reduction, alpha blending, Gouraud shading
** native support for BMP, LBM, PCX and TGA files (others supported with library extensions)
* Color palettes:
** color palette manipulation (reading, writing, conversion)
** conversion of color formats RGB &lt;-&gt; HSV
* Text:
** support for different encodings and conversion, default is UTF-8
** bitmap fonts (masking, colouring, alignment)
* Misc:
** draw directly on the screen or on any-size memory bitmaps
** hardware scrolling and triple buffering (where available), mode-X split screen
** animation functions for FLI/FLC format&lt;ref&gt;[http://alleg.sourceforge.net/readme.html Allegro Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegro 5==

Current development is focused on the Allegro 5 branch, with the current version 5.0.5. Allegro 5 is a complete redesign of the API and much of the internal operation of the library. An effort was made to make the API more consistent, and multi-thread safe. By default, the library will now be hardware accelerated using OpenGL or DirectX rendering backends where appropriate. Many of the addons that existed as separate projects for Allegro 4 will be rewritten to interface more seamlessly with Allegro proper and will be bundled with the default installation. Allegro 5 is intended to be event driven.
