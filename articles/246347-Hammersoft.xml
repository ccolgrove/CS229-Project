'''Southern Leyte''' ([[Filipino Language|Filipino]]:'''''Timog Leyte''''') is a [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of the [[Philippines]] located in the [[Eastern Visayas]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]]. [[Maasin City]] is the capital of the province. Southern Leyte was once a sub-province of [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] before it was divided from the latter. Limasawa, an island to the south is part of the province where the first Christian Mass was held and is said to be the birthplace of [[Christianity]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpinoy.com/travel/province/sleyte.php GlobalPinoy, Travel - Southern Leyte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The province ranks as the second least populated area in the region. According to 2007 census, the province has a population of 390,847 a 1.13% growth compared to last 2000 census with a population record of 360,160.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov.ph/data/sectordata/2007/province.pdf | Philippines 2007 Census&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern Leyte's [[Geology|geological]] features created several issues in the province after the flooding of [[Subangdaku River]] and the awful mudslide in [[2006 Southern Leyte mudslide|Guinsaugon]]. Organizations warned the province as susceptible to [[Nature|natural]] occurrences like [[landslide]]s and [[flood]]ings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haribon&quot;&gt;[http://www.haribon.org.ph/?q=taxonomy/page/and/10 Policy and Advocacy | Haribon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern Leyte contributes to the economy of the country. It forms an important part of the inter-island transportation system of the country, with ferries transporting people and goods between [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]] and [[Surigao del Norte]] in [[Mindanao]]. The province is well known for its quality [[abaca]] products and the country's major producer of abaca fiber.

==History==
===Early settlement===
As early as 1898 during the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[United States|American]] periods, there had already been existing as &quot;sub-province&quot; consisting of the municipalities from [[Palompon, Leyte|Palompon]] to [[Hinunangan, Southern Leyte|Hinunangan]], with Maasin as the center. Some government offices have already been established in Maasin on the southwestern part of Leyte to govern the area.&lt;ref name=evis&gt;[http://www.evis.net.ph/infocenter/attractions/Southern-leyte.htm Southern Leyte: Attractions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the governing city was the depository of cedula tax collections from Palompon to Hinunangan. This was administered by the office of the Administrado de Hacienda, equivalent to the Provincial Treasurer, a position under Secretario de Hacienda.

There was also established in Maasin a Court of First Instance, then known as the Promoter Fiscal, where all minor administrative and other cases from Palompon to Hinunangan were heard and disposed of.&lt;ref name=nscb&gt;http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru8/soleyte.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization, the province was sparsely populated. The continued raiding of Moro slaves discouraged the province to grow and develop. However, on 19th century, immigrants from near provinces like [[Bohol]] and [[Cebu]] populated the area.

On 1942, [[Ruperto Kangleon]] held a conference in the town of [[Sogod, Southern Leyte|Sogod]], when the first attempt in [[Malitbog, Southern Leyte|Malitbog]], a town to the east, failed to succeed due to many leaders stayed away. He was trying to unify all [[guerrilla]]s helped to the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] troops during the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=They Never Surrender |last=Villamor |first=Col. Jesus A. |year=1982 |publisher=Vera-Reyes Inc. |location=[[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]] |pages=127 |isbn=  |accessdate= 2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1944 to 1945, the Allied Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and the recognized guerrillas attacked by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial]] forces beginning to liberation in Southern Leyte, and the American troops landed in Leyte on October 20, 1944.

===Independent province===
Due to change of sovereign powers, all the offices in Maasin except the Fiscalâs Office were abolished and reverted to [[Tacloban]], the capital of Leyte. This created a major problem because of the dearth of transportation, the difficulty in managing the affairs of government in Tacloban and the language barrier between the [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]-speaking South-westerners and the [[Waray people|Waray]] Easterners. The difficulty of managing the entire island from the main city suggested the need to separate the island into two provinces.

At first there was a general movement for a Western Leyte and soon after, many prominent men and leaders rallied behind the movement. Six attempts to pass a law for the division of Leyte were made. On the sixth attempt, then Congressman Nicanor YÃ±iguez introduced into the [[Lower house|House]] a division law similar in substance to that of the Kangleon Bill, but recognizing the impossibility of creating an East-West Division, he instead opted to make his own district a province.

Abandoning the first [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], Congressman Nicanor YÃ±iguez presented House Bill No. 1318 proposing a new province of Southern Leyte comprising Third Congressional District of Leyte to include sixteen municipalities, from Maasin to [[Silago]] in the mainland, and in the [[Panaon Island]].

The bill became [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] 2227 otherwise known as an &quot;Act Creating the Province of Southern Leyte&quot; and was signed into [[Law]] by President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] on May 22, 1959. On July 1, 1960, Southern Leyte was inaugurated as a province with sixteen municipalities and Maasin as the capital town. Thus the third District of Leyte became the province of Southern Leyte and Lone District of Southern Leyte.&lt;ref name=evis/&gt;&lt;ref name=nscb/&gt;

===Political divisions===
Southern Leyte is subdivided into 18 [[Municipality of the Philippines|municipalities]] and 1 [[Cities of the Philippines|city]].

==People and culture==
===People===
While ethnicity of the province is widely [[Visayans|Bisaya]], most people of the province are farmers and fisherfolks.

In Panaon, an island situated in the southernmost part of the province, a certain [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] folks are found locally known as ''Kongking'' or variously called ''Mamanwa'' which means mountain people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/ebook_subcont.php?subcont_Id=76 About Culture and Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were believed to be migrants from [[Mindanao]], inhabiting the portions of [[Agusan River|Agusan]], after their migration from the island to evade militarization and the logging/mining corporationsâ intrusion to their ancestral domains in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=bulatlat&gt;[http://www.bulatlat.com/news/6-9/6-9-killer.htm Bulatlat - The Philippines's alternative weekly magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maasincity.com/places-of-interest.htm Places of Interest in Maasin City and Southern Leyte, Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Literally, their physical attributes are dark complexion, curly-haired and short in height. Hunting and gathering, mat weaving and rattan craft are among the main economic activities of the ''Mamanwas'', so they prefer to inhabit the forested areas in the newfound Southern Leyte mountain. However, they were again displaced by threats of the recent incidents of landslides in the province.&lt;ref name=bulatlat/&gt;

Generally, [[rice]] is the [[staple food]] of the province and also includes [[Maize|corn]]. Mountain living folks, however, prefer [[Root vegetable|root crop]]s which is abundant in the place. Native delicacies of the province includes &quot;tres marias,&quot; &quot;bocarillo,&quot; &quot;salvaro,&quot; &quot;bibingka,&quot; and &quot;starhoy.&quot; They also have their own &quot;kinilaw.&quot;

Cebuano and Waray-waray are the major language spoken in the province. The speech  used by natives has Boholano influences because of its proximity with the province [[Bohol]]. Natives also understand [[foreign language]] such as [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

===Religion===
[[Image:Carlos V Francisco First Mass in the Philippines.png|thumb|A detail of Carlos V. Francisco's First Mass in the Philippines painting]]
[[Limasawa si Jem, Southern Leyte|Limasawa]], an [[island]] [[municipality]] to the south is believed to be the site of the first [[Christianity|Christian]] [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] and the birthplace of [[Christianity|Christendom]] in the [[Philippines]], when [[Ferdinand Magellan]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[navigator]] and [[explorer]] landed on March 28, 1521. The first Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was held on March 31, 1521 led by Friar Pedro de Valderrama, the chaplain of Magellan during the expedition, and the start of the Christianity propagation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sspxasia.com/Newsletters/2001/Oct-Dec/A_short_Philippine_History.htm A short Philippine History before the 1898 Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelsmart.net/article/104889/ Sinugduan Fest recalls great historic event in Limasawa Island&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions===
====Beliefs====
Although most people are Christians, a very few who live in remote villages of the province hold on to pre-Hispanic influences and make offerings and sacrifices before planting their crops. Farmers ritually sacrifice chickens and pigs to ensure that the spirits or elementals which they believe to be the cause of good harvest will grant them one.&lt;ref name=geo&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/lppsec/pp/sleyte.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:59:34 The Provincial Profile of Southern Leyte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious events====
Fiesta, a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term which means festivity, is celebrated in the province with [[prayer]], food/drinking dance and music. Every barangay of every town in the province has its own celebration date. For instance, [[Hinunangan, Southern Leyte|Hinunangan]] celebrated town fiesta on 29 June when they highlight their celebration with the St. Peter and St. Paul Fluvial boat parade the day before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selectphilippines.com/southern-leyte-philippines.html Southern Leyte Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The kuratsa &amp;mdash; a [[courtship]] dance drama &amp;mdash;  highlights every occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about_cultarts/comarticles.php?artcl_Id=249 About Culture and Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
===Topography===
[[Image:Maasin City Green Mountains.png|thumb|Green grass covering mountains situated in Maasin City]]
Southern Leyte occupies the southern one-fourth of the island of [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]]. It is bounded by the province of [[Leyte]] to the north, by [[Surigao Strait]] to the east, [[Bohol Sea]] to the south, and [[Canigao Channel]], across from [[Bohol]], to the west. Its total [[land area]] is 173,480 hectares or 1,734.8 sq. kilometers.

The province is characterized by relatively flat lands along the coastal areas where population centers lay, but rugged and mountainous towards the interior.

The province has inland water-form features. Based on a national data, the province has an overall 93 rivers including 18 majors namely Amparo River in [[Macrohon, Southern Leyte|Macrohon]], Canturing River in [[Maasin City]], Das-ay and Pondol Rivers in [[Hinunangan, Southern Leyte|Hinunangan]], Divisoria River in [[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]], Hitungao and Lawigan Rivers in [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|San Juan]], Maag River in [[Silago, Southern Leyte|Silago]], and Subang Daku River in [[Sogod, Southern Leyte|Sogod]] which is the biggest river among others.&lt;ref name=darfu8&gt;[http://darfu8.tripod.com/rp_southernleyte.htm Southern Leyte&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The province has an [[Lake|inland lake]] called Lake Danao located in the mountains of [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|San Juan]] and [[Anahawan, Southern Leyte|Anahawan]], towns in the eastern region.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Southern Leyte Subang Daku River.png|left|thumb|The flooding [[Subangdaku River]] in Southern Leyte on 2001 destroying part of the Philippine National Road.]] --&gt;
[[Subangdaku River|Subangdaku]], the province's largest river, created an issue over the area. It can be considered a braided river composed of several [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s from near areas that divide and reunite forming an alluvial fan with very wide [[floodplain]]. As such, the river usually became hazardous during [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] after a heavy rain.&lt;ref name=Inecar&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091026230001/http://geocities.com/sogodbay/Inecar.html Inercar Paper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The river sometime overflow spilling its waters on the low-lying towns of Liloan and San Vicente and destroyed an ongoing flood control project worth millions of pesos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samarnews.com/News_clips/news5.htm Southern Leyte-News on Samar 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The river has been known to meander along its course, ever changing its way over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pia.gov.ph/Default.asp?m=11&amp;sec=archive&amp;r=ALL&amp;sp=10&amp;fi=p061004.htm&amp;no=27 PIA Information Services - Philippine Information Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the time it's flooding, it destructs every side of its course. In 2001, portion of the road and banks in Barangay San Miguel along the river have been destroyed.&lt;ref name=Inecar/&gt; It hampered the economic activities of the local residents as well as national because the destroyed portion is part of the Philippine National Road. The Local officials blamed the re[[River engineering#Channelization|channelization]] and uncontrolled [[quarry]]ing of gravel and sand at the side of river as the cause of the flood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news01_dec21_2003 Manila Standard: The Future is Ours&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting on March 18, 2002, one of the representatives of a government agency alleged that the reason of the incidents of flood and other environmental problems in the river was due to the &quot;Philippine Fault&quot; which caused rocks to rumble down. However, the reason was contended because the [[Fault (geology)|fault]] is a geological feature and environmental problems in the province just occurred that time.&lt;ref name=Inecar/&gt;

Along with other mountain forms in the province, Mount Nacolod in Hinunangan town has the highest peak with an elevation of 948 meters above [[sea level]]. Young [[volcanic rocks]] are discovered in the terrain areas, which cover the top of the southern mountain ranges of Mount Cabalian in the [[Pacific]] Area and Mount Nelangcapan in Panaon Area.&lt;ref name=nscb/&gt;

[[Image:Hinunangan bay by Kevin.JPG|thumb|View of Hinunangan Beach]]
The province lies within the [[Philippine Fault System]]. The major fault lines traverse the municipalities of Sogod, Libagon, St. Bernard and San Juan to Panaon Island. Based on MGB Region 8 data, these areas had experienced strong [[earthquake]] in 1907 and 1948 with a magnitude of 6.9 and on July 5, 1984 with a 6.4 [[Richter magnitude scale|scale]].&lt;ref name=nscb/&gt; Bureau of Mines and Geosciences warned that Southern Leyte's [[Nature|natural]] and [[Geology|geological]] features make it susceptible to landslides and floodings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2006/02/19/2003293690 Taipei Times - archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The affiliated group stated that there are four reasons why there are some incidents like these:unusually heavy rains; numerous faults and badly broken rocks; steep slopes; and absence of effective vegetative cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haribon&quot;/&gt;

The province has numerous type of [[soil]]. A special soil type within Maasin Clay, Guimbalaon Clay, Himay-angan Clay, Bolinao Clay, Quingua Clay and Malitbog Clay series is found to be a good raw materials for [[ceramic]]s and [[pottery]] activities of the local residence.

====Mudslide====
In December 2003, a landslide in [[San Francisco, Southern Leyte]] destroyed most of the town, killing 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/0312landslide/photos.shtml U.S. Pacific Command | Official Military Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The incident was caused by heavy rains in the province.

[[Image:Southern Leyte mudslide 2006 pic01.jpg|left|thumb|2006 Southern Leyte mudslide]]
{{main|2006 Southern Leyte mudslide}}
On February 17, 2006, several mudslides caused by heavy rains, amounting over {{convert|200|cm|0|abbr=on}}, and a minor [[earthquake]] destroyed at least one town and many commercial and residential infrastructures, leaving hundreds dead. The municipality of [[Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte|Saint Bernard]] was one of the worst hit areas where twenty-three are confirmed to be dead with up to 200 estimated as dead and another 1,500 missing. Barangay Guinsaugon, a mountain village on the said municipality with 2,500 people, was almost completely leveled and everything from trees to homes was destroyed killing 1,800 of its 1,857 residents.
Many rescuers from national and international responded to the incident. However, rescue efforts were greatly hampered by poor road conditions and lack of heavy equipment. Survivors reported also lack of coordination of rescue efforts. The Philippine Government again stated their inability to cope with disasters.
The few handful of Guinsaugon citizens which escaped the mudslide were put up in emergency shelters without adequate nutrition and care despite the National Government collecting millions of Dollars worth of donations for this case.

===Demographics===
[[Image:Southern Leyte Population.png|thumb|right|A graphical presentation of Southern Leyte's 1903-2000 population depicting the negative growth rate in 1999-2000 records.]]
The 1980 national [[census]] recorded the province of Southern Leyte with a population of 296,294 from the historic record in 1903 of 72,369. On 1990, the population of the province increased to 321,940 which was caused by [[Human migration|in-migration]] and increasing rate of birth over death. In 2000, number of population increased to 360,160 with a rate of 2.73 from the negative growth rate recorded on 1995 period with 317,565.&lt;ref name=census&gt;[http://www.census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2002/pr02122tx.html Southern Leyte: From Negative to a Positive Growth Rate in the Late 90âs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden decrease of the 1995 records was due to the late census in the province. While regular censuses were done in May where most of the students were at their respective places of residence, in 1995 the census on population was done in September where the students were out for schooling in nearby provinces. The decrease in population was also, theoretically, attributed to [[Urbanization|out-migration]] of the rural population to highly urbanized cities to seek for better employment and livelihood opportunities. A corresponding increase on the number of households was also recorded at 72,894 households higher by 7,327 households over the 1995 figure. Southern Leyte ranked fifth in terms of population among the six provinces in [[Eastern Visayas]] with 9.98 percent of the 3.6 million persons of the region. On the contrary, it was the fastest growing province in the region. At the national level, the province contributed 0.47 percent to the total population of the Philippines with 76.5 million.&lt;ref name=census/&gt;

In terms of [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], on 2000 survey, 80.8 percent of the people living are [[Visayan|Bisaya]] or [[Visayan|Binisaya]], 16.6 percent are [[Boholano]], 5.1 percent are [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]], and other includes [[Waray]] and other [[Foreign language|foreign]] ethnicity.

===Climate===
Southern Leyte has two types of climate according to the Coronas Classification. These are Type II and Type IV.

Type II is characterized by the absence of dry season with a very pronounced maximum rain period occurring in the months of November to January. This type prevails in the eastern half of the province that includes the municipality of Sogod, Libagon, Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan, San Ricardo, St. Bernard, San Juan, Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan and Silago. On the other hand, Type IV has a rainfall that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. This type prevails in the western part of the province that includes the City of Maasin and the municipalities of Macrohon, Padre Burgos, Limasawa, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc and little part of Sogod.

The province is located within the area of less frequent tropical [[cyclone]]s. Yearly [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]]s only affect the northern half of the island under the jurisdiction of the Province of Leyte. During passage of typhoons, the province only experienced heavy rains and occasional gusty [[wind]]s. The province is generally affected by typhoons that pass through [[Surigao City|Surigao]].

In 2004, the province has recorded [[rain]]fall data with maximum [[temperature]] of 30.95 [[Celsius|Degrees Celsius]] to minimum temperature of 24.09 Degrees Celsius.

===Vegetation and biodiversity===
[[Image:Blue-Spotted Stingray.png|thumb|A blue-spotted [[stingray]] seen in the coasts of the province]]
People in the province plant [[rice]], [[Maize|white corn]], [[banana]]s, [[Root vegetable|root crops]], [[sugar cane]], and [[coconut]] and [[abacÃ¡]] which is their major products.&lt;ref name=geo/&gt; They also planted various types of vegetable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philippinen.ded.de/cipp/ded/custom/pub/content,lang,2/oid,1738/ticket,g_u_e_s_t/~/The_potential_of_Southern_Leyte_s_Vegetable_Industry.html Deutscher Entwicklungsdienst (DED) - - The potential of Southern Leyte's Vegetable Industry - Homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A three year effort project was established in Sogod Bay conducted by the Southern Leyte Coral Reef Conservation Project (SLCRCP) to surveyed coral reefs in the area. The undertaking was to provide local residents educational opportunities to have knowledge on protecting the province's biodiversity as well as to have a long-term sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coralcay.org/archives/monthly_project_updates/southern_leyte_6.php CCC - News - Southern Leyte Coral Reef Conservation Project: July 2006 update&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Southern Leyte was originally consist of 16 [[Municipality of the Philippines|municipalities]] and 349 [[barangay]]s. It was composed of four islands namely: [[Panaon Island]], [[Limasawa, Southern Leyte|Limasawa Island]], San Pedro Island and San Pablo Island.&lt;ref name=nscb/&gt; After the inauguration of the province, three more municipalities were created subsequently, namely; San Ricardo from Pintuyan, Tomas Oppus from Malitbog and Limasawa from Padre Burgos. Currently, the province is subdivided into 18 municipalities and one [[Cities of the Philippines|city]] which is [[Maasin]]. It has an overall 501 barangays or villages around the province.

On 2000, [[Maasin City|Maasin]] was converted into a [[capital city|city]] as capital of Southern Leyte. The remaining component municipality classes ranges from 2nd to 5th level in the province. From 2nd class belongs [[Sogod, Southern Leyte|Sogod]] municipality which is the center of [[trade]], [[commerce]] and [[industry]] among municipalities within the Sogod Bay. [[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]], [[Hinunangan, Southern Leyte|Hinunangan]], which holds the distinction as the &quot;Rice Granary of the Province&quot; for its vast [[plain]] land that is entirely planted with [[rice]], [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]], [[Malitbog, Southern Leyte|Malitbog]], [[Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte|Saint Bernard]], and [[Macrohon, Southern Leyte|Macrohon]], are in the 4th level.

==Economy==
===Major Products===
====Coconut====
Most of the people in Southern Leyte go into coconut planting, a widely distributed industry, especially in mountainous and even plain regions. The GIZ of the German Development Cooperation has embarked on a value chain study on one of the most important products in Region 8 â the coconut, particularly in [[Leyte]] and Southern Leyte.&lt;ref&gt;http://visayas.wowphilippines.com/leyte/2006/11/20/german-council-embarks-on-region-8-value-chain-study-on-coconut/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2004, a beetle pest was observed and threatened the Philippine coconut industry including [[Visayas]]. ''[[Brontispa longissima]]'' causes great damage to seedlings and mature coconut trees and ornamental palms, killing the young spears and eventually the entire trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://luzon.wowphilippines.com/laguna/2007/08/17/beetle-threatens-survival-of-rp%E2%80%99s-coconut-industry/ Beetle threatens survival of RPâs coconut industry: Laguna, Philippines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abaca====
People in Southern Leyte also go into [[AbacÃ¡|abaca]] planting. The province is one of the major producer of abaca fiber in the country along with [[Catanduanes]], [[Leyte]], [[Davao Oriental]], [[Northern Samar]], [[Sorsogon]], [[Sulu Province|Sulu]], [[Davao del Sur]], and [[Surigao del Sur]]. The fibers from Leyte and the province are recognized as having the best quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/si/si002157.htm Genetic Engineering Eyed To Solve Problems Of Abaca Industry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On the year 1990 to 1999, Southern Leyte produced abaca with a rate of 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.da.gov.ph/agribiz/abaca_new.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A project, Study on the Abaca Industry Profile of Southern Leyte, was funded by [[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|DOST]] 8 GIA and implemented by the Southern Leyte State University (SLSU), one of the college universities in the province, and the Provincial Government of Southern Leyte. It was aimed to conduct a thorough assessment on the status of the abaca industry of the province being its major crop.

On 2003, a certain virus threatens the abaca industry in the province. Almost all of the abaca-producing municipalities in the area namely [[Maasin City]], [[Padre Burgos, Southern Leyte|Padre Burgos]], [[Malitbog]], [[Tomas Oppus]], [[Bontoc]], [[Sogod]], [[Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte|St. Bernard]], [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|San Juan]], [[Hinunangan]] and [[Silago]] were greatly affected by the deadly virus except from the municipalities at [[Panaon Island]]. Eighty percent of the province's abaca plantation particularly in Sogod town was greatly affected while Maasin City was estimated to suffer about 30 percent in damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;sec=reader&amp;rp=1&amp;fi=p061030.htm&amp;no=8&amp;date= PIA Information Services - Philippine Information Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industries===
Abaca fiber helps livelihood in the province. Women in the selected areas go into abaca-based handicrafts, which is widely known in the area as tagak or spooled abaca fiber. Natives usually called it as tinagak or continuous spooled abaca fiber. The half-finished product is then made into sinamay or hand woven clothe out of tinagak ready to be made into other sinamay-based products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinephilippines.blogspot.com/2005_07_01_archive.html Philippine Ventures &amp; Destinations: July 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Products are being exported by [[Leyte]] to [[Japan]]. Because of a wide distribution of an industry called tagak, provincial sectors taught farmers on how to cultivate a suitable variety locally called laylay.

In Bontoc, a project was successfully established with a mudcrab hatchery with eleven hatchery tanks at the RKKMAFTI Compound. Initially, 25 spawners are being worked-on by the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://region8.dost.gov.ph/AR-afma.htm DOST Region VIII&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from abaca-based products, ceramics and handicraft items made from coconut and [[bamboo]] are also the province's industry. Among the provinceâs economic activity includes fishing, livestock and poultry raising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livinginthephilippines.com/region8.html &quot;Region Viii&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
[[Mail|Postal communication]] is the main mode of communication of the province. There are five [[telephone]] exchange companies operating in the province and two radio stations. It has also other types of communication including SSB radios for government offices and [[Mobile phone|cellular phones]] for government and private entities.

On the western part is the Maasin-[[Mahaplag]]-[[Baybay]] and the central part by the Mahaplag-Sogod road via the Maharlika Highway. On the eastern part of the province, the opening of the new [[Abuyog]]-[[Silago]]  Road provides fast and convenient travel to the eastern towns of Southern Leyte. Maharlika road contributes to the development of Southern Leyte.

There are six designated bus terminals in Southern Leyte: [[Maasin]], [[Liloan]], [[Sogod]], [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|San Juan]], [[Hinunangan]] and [[Silago]]. However, these terminals are open spaces used by buses as parking areas and are therefore not equipped with buildings and other facilities.
