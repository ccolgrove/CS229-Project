The '''Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE)''' is the largest provider of [[higher education]] in the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and a large [[public university]] system in the [[United States]]. It is the [[World's largest universities|tenth-largest]] university system in the United States and 43rd largest in the world. The system comprises 14 state-owned schools, all of which are [[Division II (NCAA)|NCAA Division II]] members by virtue of being members of the [[Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psacsports.org/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web1.ncaa.org/memberLinks/links.jsp?div=2&lt;/ref&gt;  PASSHE institutions are the only colleges and universities in Pennsylvania that are publicly owned and governed, but they are not the only ones that receive public funding.  To this point, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education should not be confused with [[The Pennsylvania State University]] (established 1855, the state's Land Grant University and principal four-year research university) or Pennsylvania's [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]].

==History==

The ''Normal School Act of 1857'' was passed on the last day of session on 20 May 1857. &lt;ref&gt; John Edward Merryman, ''The Indiana Story 1875-1975: Pennsylvania's first state university...'' Clearfield, Pennsylvania: Kurtz Brothers, 1976(p. 18). &lt;/ref&gt; Its passage created 12 [[normal school]] districts in the state in which to establish private corporations answerable to the State Superintendent of Common Schools. &lt;ref&gt; Merryman, pp. 18-20 &lt;/ref&gt;  Afterward, the School Code of 1911 mandated that the Commonwealth purchase all the normal schools. The normal schools evolved from state normal schools, to state teacher's colleges, to state colleges.  Act 188, which was signed into law on November 12, 1982 and came into effect on July 1, 1983, established the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and converted those state colleges into universities.

==Universities and Locations==
The system is a composition of the following 14 universities in Pennsylvania:

&lt;center&gt;{{PASSHE}}&lt;/center&gt;

PASSHE universities also operate four branch campuses. The Office of the Chancellor is situated in the capital city of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] at the [[Dixon University Center]].

==Mission==
As established by the founding legislation, Act 188 of 1982, the primary mission of the State System of Higher Education &quot;is the provision of instruction for [[undergraduate student|undergraduate]] and [[graduate student]]s to and beyond the [[Master's degree]] in the [[liberal arts]] and sciences, and in the applied fields, including the teaching profession.&quot; Additionally, the purpose of PASSHE is &quot;to provide high quality education at the lowest possible cost to students.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; PASSHE Board of Governors, ''Leading the Way'', Jul 2004. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
A 20-member [[Board of Governors]] oversees the system.  Additional power is vested in the Councils of Trustees at the constituent universities.

Board of Governor's membership includes: four state [[legislator]]s, three students, the [[Governor]] of the Commonwealth (or a designee), the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education (or a designee), and 11 citizens appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate. &lt;ref&gt; Pennsylvania General Assembly, &quot;Act 188 of 1982.&quot; Available at: http://www.passhe.edu/inside/bog/Pages/Act-188.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Governors sets general policy for PASSHE.  It also appoints the [[chancellor]], who serves as the system's [[chief executive officer]], and the university presidents. The chancellor is an ex-officio member of each university's Council of Trustees.
