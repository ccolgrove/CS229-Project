'''''WWE Velocity''''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[television program]] produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE). It replaced two syndicated WWE shows, ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked/Metal]]''. Once a weekly Saturday night show on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]] and on Sky Sports 2 in the UK on Sunday mornings, Velocity became a webcast from 2005 to 2006. The newest episode would be uploaded to WWE.com on Saturdays and be available for the next week. Older webcast episodes were also archived. It was the counterpart show to ''[[WWE SmackDown]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw]]'' and was recorded before the television taping of ''SmackDown!''

==History==
[[Image:Former  Arena.jpg|right|thumb|200px|WWE Velocity  set used from May 25, 2002 -June 11, 2006.]]

''WWE Velocity'' was primarily used to summarize major occurrences on the latest episode of ''SmackDown!'', which aired Thursday and later Friday nights on [[UPN]]. Due to the [[WWE Brand Extension]], ''Velocity'' aired matches and content from the [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown brand]]. The format was set to mirror that of ''[[WWE Heat]]'' and its relation to the [[WWE Raw|Raw brand]]''.

Following ''[[WWE Raw]]'' moved from Spike TV back to the [[USA Network]] in 2005, ''Velocity'' and its Raw brand counterpart, ''Heat'', were discontinued from television broadcast in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and became [[webcast]]s  streamed on WWE.com.  Internationally, ''Velocity'' and ''Heat'' continued to be broadcast on their respective television networks due to WWE's international programming commitments.

The last episode of ''Velocity'' aired internationally on June 10, 2006. It was also the last episode to be streamed on WWE.com.
