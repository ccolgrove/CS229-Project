The [[IBM]] '''SAN File System''' is a distributed, heterogeneous file system developed by IBM to be used in [[storage area network]]s. There are many virtualization features included, such as allowing heterogeneous [[operating system]]s to access the same data and file spaces.

IBM discontinued selling the SAN File System in April 2007. It has been replaced by [[IBM General Parallel File System]] (GPFS).
