'''XHIMT''' is the callsign for the over the air [[Azteca 7]] (also known as El 7) network flagship station in Mexico City (Channel 7 analog and Channel 24 digital). XHIMT provides some [[HDTV|HD]] programming to cable and satellite viewers. 

==History==
XHIMT was one of three stations originally owned and operated by ImevisiÃ³n, a Mexican public broadcaster ([[XHDF-TV]] and [[XEIMT-TV]] were the others). At the beginning of the 1990s, this station suffered problems with its signal, resulting in being declared for sale in 1991. That year, it transmitted signal to bind with the [[XHDF-TV|Azteca 13]] as ImevisiÃ³n's sale continued.  In [[1993]] this channel, together with XHDF, were sold to became part of the new commercial TV Azteca network, when the Mexican government finally dissolved [[ImevisiÃ³n]].

==Programming==
Daytime programming consists of original news, cartoons, series and movies. Most of El 7's primetime programming consists of Spanish translated American programs and movies. Some of them are divided into themed days. An example is: 

===Tempation Tuesdays (Martes de TentaciÃ³n)===
