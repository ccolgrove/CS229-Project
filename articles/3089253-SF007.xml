'''HP Pavilion''' is a line of [[personal computer]]s produced by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and introduced in 1995. The name is applied to both [[Desktop computer|desktops]] and [[laptop]]s for the Home and Home Office product range.

When HP merged with [[Compaq]] in 2002, it took over Compaq's existing naming rights agreement. As a result, HP sells both HP and  Compaq-branded machines.
