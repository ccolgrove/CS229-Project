'''Infogrames Entertainment SA''' ('''IESA''') (pronounced ''Een - foh - grahm'') was an international [[France|French]] [[holding company]] headquartered in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It was the owner of [[Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary)|Atari, Inc.]], headquartered in [[New York City]], [[United States|U.S.]] and Atari Europe. It was founded in 1983 by [[Bruno Bonnell]] and Christophe Sapet using the proceeds from an introductory computer book. Through its subsidiaries, Infogrames [[video game developer|produced]], [[video game publisher|published]] and distributed [[video game|interactive games]] for all major [[video game console]]s and computer game platforms.

==History==
===Early history===
The founders wanted to christen the company ''Zboub SystÃ¨me'', but were dissuaded by their legal counsel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ichbiah&quot;&gt;[[Image:Symbole-fr.png|30px|Link to a French language website]] [http://ichbiah.online.fr/extraits/jeuvid.htm Author excerpt] from Daniel Ichbiah, ''La saga des jeux vidÃ©o''. Vuibert. 2004. ISBN 2-7117-4825-1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bonnell in a TV interview, they then used a mix-and-match computer program to suggest other names, one of which was &quot;Infogramme&quot;:  a [[portmanteau]] of the [[French language|French]] words &quot;informatique&quot; (information technology) and &quot;programme&quot; (a computer program).  The final choice, &quot;Infogrames&quot;, was a slightly modified version of that suggestion, and is pronounced {{IPAc-en|Ë|Éª|n|f|oÊ|Ë|É¡|r|Ã¦|m|z}} in English.

The company logo is an [[armadillo]] (''tatou'' in French), chosen when the company was moved to [[Villeurbanne]].  Bonnell commented: &quot;This dinosaur [sic] is our symbol.  The armadillo has always survived changes to its environment, from the melting of glaciers to the worst of heat waves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ichbiah&quot;/&gt;

In the late 1980s Infogrames was noted for its French computer games that often featured original game ideas and occasionally humorous content.  They had acquired several licences for popular [[Franco-Belgian comics]], such as [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]], [[Asterix]] and [[Les Tuniques Bleues]].

In 1992, they released ''[[Alone in the Dark (video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[horror (genre)|horror]] [[adventure game]] to international attention.  They also released, &quot;Fantasia&quot; for the [[Sega Genesis]], with the player controlling Mickey Mouse on a quest to locate lost musical notes.

===1996-2002 - growth through Acquisition===
In 1996, [[Bruno Bonnell]]'s Infogrames embarked on an acquisition campaign that would last seven years and cost more than $500 million; the objective was to become the world's leading interactive entertainment publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-16-2000/0001142857&amp;EDATE= |title=Infogrames Launches Infogrames.com |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2000-02-16 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the company's debt increased from $55 million in 1999 to $493 million in 2002, the company's revenue also increased from $246 million to $650 million during the same period.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/column_index.php?story=8636 |title=The Euro Vision: 'Bye-Bye Bruno' |publisher=Gamasutra |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 IESA bought [[Ocean Software]] for about $100 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukbusinesspark.co.uk/bpmerg96.htm |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions&amp;nbsp;â UK News 1996 |publisher=Ukbusinesspark.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; renaming the company as ''Infogrames UK''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/atari-uk-ltd |title=Atari UK Ltd |publisher=MobyGames |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Philips Media BV was purchased.

In 1998 IESA acquired a majority share of 62.5% in the game distributor ''OziSoft'', which became ''Infogrames Australia'',&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atari.com.au/misc/faq.do |title=Frequently Asked Questions&amp;nbsp;â Atari Australia |publisher=Atari.com.au |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 IESA bought the remaining shares of ''Infogrames Australia'' from [[Sega]] and other share holders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/soa/Ozisoft-becomes-Infogrames-Australia/0,139023166,120267724,00.htm |title=Ozisoft becomes Infogrames Australia: News&amp;nbsp;â Business&amp;nbsp;â ZDNet Australia |publisher=Zdnet.com.au |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $3.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt;  In this same year the distributors ABS Multimedia, Arcadia and the Swiss Gamecity GmbH were acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claimexam.com/links/Done/accolade.htm |title=Portail d'informations |publisher=Claimexam.com |date=1973-08-05 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;http://corporate.infogrames.com/uk/download/reports/infogrames_entertainment_annual_report_99_00.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 IESA bought [[Gremlin Interactive]] for $40 million, renaming it to ''Infogrames Sheffield House'' but it was closed in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_1999_March_25/ai_54207493 |title=Infogrames Buys UK Games Company Gremlin &amp;#124; Computergram International &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02 | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year IESA also bought [[Accolade (developer)|Accolade]] for $60 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CGN/is_1999_April_20/ai_54426666 |title=France's Infogrames Grows in US With $60m Accolade Buy &amp;#124; Computergram International &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02 | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/vidgame/vid1999.htm |title=Chronology of Video Game Systems (1999) |publisher=Islandnet.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Beam Software]], later renamed to ''Infogrames Melbourne House Pty Ltd''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/krome-studios-melbourne |title=Krome Studios Melbourne |publisher=MobyGames |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acquisition of GT Interactive====
Then in December 1999, IESA made one of the most expensive acquisitions in the company's history. Infogrames bought 70% of [[GT Interactive]] for $135 million, and assumed the new subsidiary's $75 million bank debt.  By June 2000 Infogrames had invested another $30 million in [[GT Interactive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE2D9133DF935A25752C1A96F958260 |title=Infogrames Gets Control of GT Interactive&amp;nbsp;â New York Times |publisher=New York Times |date=1999-11-16 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IESA justified the purchase by stating that [[GT Interactive]] provided Infogrames with a  &quot;distribution network for all of its products in the United States, as well as a catalog of products that includes [[Driver (game)|Driver]], [[Oddworld]], [[Unreal Tournament]] and [[Deer Hunter]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt;

Included in the [[GT Interactive]] purchase were the game development studios [[Humongous Entertainment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/GT-Interactive-Software-Company-History.html |title=GT Interactive Software&amp;nbsp;â Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legend Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1592004938 |title=Game Design, Second Edition: Bob Bates: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reflections Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atnewyork.com/news/article.php/249211 |title=Gt Interactive Hires Disney Honcho, Raises Cash |publisher=Atnewyork.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GT Interactive became '''Infogrames, Inc'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.infogrames.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/DOCDEREF05_06GB.pdf |title=Microsoft Word&amp;nbsp;â couverture_GB.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the developer [[Paradigm Entertainment]] was bought for $19.5 million and in-flight games developer Den-o-Tech Int. (DTI) , later renamed to ''Infogrames DTI'', was also acquired for $5.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt;

====Acquisition of Hasbro Interactive====
In January 2001, IESA purchased '''[[Hasbro Interactive]]''' and the [[handheld game console]] ''[[Game.com]]'' from [[Hasbro]] for $100 million; with $95 million as 4.5 million common shares of Infogrames and $5 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4DC1E3FF933A05752C0A9679C8B63&amp;n=Top/News/Business/Companies/Hasbro%20Inc |title=Company News; Hasbro Completes Sale Of Interactive Business&amp;nbsp;â New York Times |publisher=New York Times |date=2001-01-30 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=68329&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=137281&amp;highlight= |title=Press Release |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date=2000-12-06 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acquisition of Hasbro Interactive, which was renamed as '''Infogrames Interactive, Inc,'''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&amp;sql=3:23597 |title=((( Atari Interactive, Inc. &gt; Overview ))) |publisher=allgame |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/atari-8-bit/faq/section-85.html |title=11.2) What is the History of Atari? |publisher=Faqs.org |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; IESA became the owner of:

*The [[MicroProse]] brand and titles, including ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', ''[[Falcon (computer game)|Falcon]]'', and ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'';
*The legendary [[Atari]] name and properties, such as ''[[Centipede (arcade game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Missile Command]]'', and ''[[Pong]]''.

MicroProse UK studio was eventually closed on September 20, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Sam |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2880148.html |title=Infogrames closes UK MicroProse studio&amp;nbsp;â News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also under the terms of the sale agreement, Infogrames gained the exclusive rights to develop and publish games based on Hasbro properties, which included [[Dungeons and Dragons]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], [[My Little Pony]] and others, for a period of 15 years plus an option for an additional 5 years based on performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot; /&gt;

====Eden Games and Shiny Entertainment====
In 2002 IESA acquired the remaining 80% of [[game development studio]] [[Eden Games]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strohm |first=Axel |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/driving/vrally3/news.html?sid=2860904 |title=Infogrames buys Eden Studios&amp;nbsp;â PlayStation 2 News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2002-10-22 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for $4.1 million&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt; and [[Shiny Entertainment]] for $47 million.  With Eden Games, IESA would have right to publish Eden Games titles, such as [[V-Rally 3]] and later [[Test Drive Unlimited]], and with the Shiny Entertainment acquisition, IESA obtained the rights to develop and publish [[Enter the Matrix]] which was the first game based on [[The Matrix]] films and sold more than 5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/news/04_25_02_01_49PM.htm |title=Infogrames Acquires both Shiny Entertainment and Exclusive Matrix License&amp;nbsp;â PC News |publisher=Pc.gamezone.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atari Group===
In October 2001, IESA relaunched the [[Atari]] brand when [[Atari Interactive]], Inc., at that time a wholly owned subsidiary of Infogrames Interactive, Inc., released ''MXrider''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/05/07/infogrames_rechristens_itself_atari/&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 7, 2003, IESA officially reorganized its Infogrames Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.28Z7.htm |title=Atari Inc - 10-KT&amp;nbsp;â For 3/31/03 |publisher=SEC Info |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; US subsidiary as a separate [[Nasdaq]] listed company known as [[Atari, Inc (Infogrames)|Atari Inc.]], named its European operations as [[Atari]] Europe, renamed Infogrames Interactive, Inc. to [[Atari Interactive]], Inc.,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated8&quot; /&gt; (a wholly owned subsidiary of IESA),&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/e/070918/atar10-k.html Summary of ATARI INC - Yahoo!

[[Atari, Inc (Infogrames)|Atari Inc.]] is a public company that, as of 2007, has as majority stockholder the company California U.S. Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of IESA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/071008/nym115.html?.v=80 ]{{dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Atari, Inc (Infogrames)|Atari Inc.]] licences the ''[[Atari]]'' trademark from [[Atari Interactive]], Inc., a license which will expire in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

Atari's Australian subsidiary also distributes games for Konami of Europe, Codemasters UK, Eidos Interactive and SCi. Konami has an Australian headquarters but this is for Konami's Gaming Machines.

===Financial difficulties===
In the fiscal year of 2002 IESA had a net loss of $67 million on revenues of $650 million, and in 2003 the net losses increased to $89 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt;

In 2004 Infogrames sold the rights to the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' franchise to [[Take-Two Interactive]] for $22.3 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/civilizationiv/news.html?sid=6117117 |title=Take-Two takes over Civilization&amp;nbsp;â PC News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2005-10-25 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed down [[Legend Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/unrealiise/news_6086665.html |title=Atari closes Legend Entertainment&amp;nbsp;â PC News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2003-12-18 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; studios. Also that year Infogrames lost the right to publish games of the phenomenally popular [[Unreal (series)|Unreal franchise]] when the game's developer [[Epic games]] signed with [[Midway Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Game Over is a weekly column by Chris Morris |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/06/16/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm |title=The sad, slow fall of Atari&amp;nbsp;â Jun. 17, 2005 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2005-06-17 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, Infogrames sold back to [[Hasbro]] the digital rights to most Hasbro properties including [[Transformers]], [[My Little Pony]] and [[Connect Four]], but not [[Dungeons and Dragons]], for $65 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6127273.html |title=Atari locks down D&amp;D; Hasbro buys back Transformers&amp;nbsp;â PC News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2007 Infogrames' founding chairman [[Bruno Bonnell]] left the company after 24 years; on the day of the announcement of his departure IESA's shares jumped 24%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSL052812320070405 |title=Infogrames shares shine after chairman leaves &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Reuters&lt;! |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his resignation, Infogrames through the remainder of 2006 sold intellectual properties and some studios in order to raise cash and stave off the threat of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=February 17, 2006 | By: James Brightman | More |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/atari-to-sell-off-studios-in-turnaround-attempt/68582/ |title=Video Game Features, PC Game Features |publisher=Gamedaily.com |date=2006-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006 IESA sold the rights to the games [[Stuntman (video game)|Stuntman]] to [[THQ]] and [[Timeshift]] to [[Saber Interactive]].  The sales generated $13 million in revenue.  THQ also bought developer [[Paradigm Entertainment]] from IESA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=16870 |title=THQ buys Paradigm and Stuntman // News // GamesIndustry.biz |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2006 IESA sold  the game developer [[Reflections Interactive]] and the rights to the [[Driver (game)|Driver]] franchise for $21.6 million to [[Ubisoft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6161434.html |title=Cost-cutting puts Atari in black-barely&amp;nbsp;â Xbox 360 News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2006-11-09 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, Shiny Entertainment was acquired by [[Foundation 9 Entertainment]] for $1.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11093 Foundation 9 Acquires Shiny From Atari], ''GamaSutra'', October 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In November of the same year Atari Melbourne House was sold to [[Krome Studios]] and renamed to Krome Studios Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot; /&gt;

In 2007 Infogrames fired the majority of Atari's directors and laid off 20% of its workforce.   For the 2006-2007 fiscal year Atari posted a net loss of $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magrino |first=Tom |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6180598.html |title=Infogrames overhauls Atari's board&amp;nbsp;â News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2007-10-08 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atari Inc. buyout===
On March 6, 2008, Infogrames made an offer to Atari Inc. to buy out all remaining public shares for a value of US$1.68 per share or US$11 million total.

On April 30, 2008, Atari Inc. announced its intentions to accept Infogrames' buyout offer and merge with Infogrames.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyoutapproved&quot;&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080430/nyw164.html?.v=1 ]{{dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2008, Infogrames completed its takeover of Atari Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;buyoutcompleted&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.infogrames.com/infogramesgb/2008/10/infogrames_entertainment_sa_an_1.php |title=Atari GB |publisher=Corporate.infogrames.com |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With that acquisition the Atari brand was re-united under Infogrames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/infogrames-completes-atari-inc-acquisition |title=Infogrames completes Atari Inc acquisition // News |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infogrames said that it planned to reduce administrative costs and to focus on online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magrino |first=Tom |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6199366.html |title=Infogrames concludes Atari acquisition&amp;nbsp;â News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namco Bandai buyout of Atari Europe and Distribution Partners===
In December 2008, Infogrames bought [[Cryptic Studios]] for $26.7 million in cash plus performance bonuses. Cryptic Studios is a [[massively multiplayer online game]] developer and its acquisition is in line with the company's new business strategy which focuses on online games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios |title=Atari acquires Cryptic Studios // News |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Namco Bandai]] and Infogrames formed a [[joint venture]] called Distribution Partners in September 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20155 |title=News&amp;nbsp;â Infogrames And Namco Bandai Team Up For Distribution Deal |publisher=Gamasutra |date=2008-09-09 |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution Partners was defined by Infogrames as a regrouping of &quot;Infogramesâ distribution operations in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atari1&quot;&gt;http://corporate.atari.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/IESA_NBG_signing_GB_def2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This new entity consisted mainly of Infograme's distribution network in the [[PAL region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/31703/Infogrames-strikes-Namco-Bandai-deal |title=Infogrames strikes Namco Bandai deal &amp;#124; Games Industry &amp;#124; MCV |publisher=Mcvuk.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution Partners was 34% owned by Namco Bandai and 66% owned by Atari.&lt;ref name=&quot;atari1&quot;/&gt;

In May 2009 Namco Bandai acquired Atari Europe from Infogrames.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcvuk1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/34277/Goodbye-Atari-hello-Namco |title=Goodbye Atari, hello Namco &amp;#124; Games Industry &amp;#124; MCV |publisher=Mcvuk.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sale and marketing personnel were transferred to Distribution Partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcvuk1&quot;/&gt; In March 2009, Infogrames, announced that it was getting out of the distribution business in the PAL region with its decision to sell its 66% stake at Distribution Partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra1&quot;/&gt; According to an Infogrames press-release, this sale allowed &quot;Atari to focus its financial resources and creative energy exclusively on developing and publishing online-enabled games&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.atari.com/infogramesgb/actufiuk/ - Press release of 25/03/09&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, the deal valued at â¬37 million was completed;&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.atari.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/070209-signing_put_final%20GB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution Partners was renamed to Namco Bandai Partners. At that time the company had operations in 50 countries and 17 dedicated offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/namco-completes-takeover-of-atari-distribution-business |title=Namco completes takeover of Atari distribution business // News |publisher=Gamesindustry.biz |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite restructuring, Infogrames continued to struggle to become profitable. For the 2008 fiscal year the company posted â¬51.1 million ($72.17 million) in net losses and for the 2009 fiscal year, which ended in March, Infogrames posted losses of â¬226.1 million ($319.33 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23813 |title=News&amp;nbsp;â Infogrames Renames To Atari, Posts Heavy Losses, Envisages Profit |publisher=Gamasutra |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition from Infogrames Entertainment===
During their fiscal year meeting (May 2009), IESA announced that it would be changing its corporate name to an Atari branded name, in line with the use of the name for its subsidiaries. In reference to this, Atari, Inc's CEO Jim Wilson said: ''&quot;We've gotten rid of the Infogrames and Atari duality, the confusion around that. We are one simplified company, under one management team, under one brand.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3174457 |title=Atari Sheds Infogrames Branding : News from |publisher=1UP.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infogrames' May 29 earnings report stated:
:&quot;''The Board agreed to change Infogrames Entertainmentâs name to Atari. This decision will enable us to make the best use of the Atari brand, capitalizing on worldwide strong name recognition and affinity, which are keys drivers to implement the Companyâs online, product and licensing strategies.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.atari.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/052909PR_FY09_earnings_GB_FINAL2.pdf |title=p. 2 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later July 24 earnings press released further clarified a name change from the May 29th report, with a change from Infogrames, S.A. to Atari, S.A..  It additionally stated the continued use of Atari Group for its Atari branded and related subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://corporate.atari.com/MT-3.34-en/mt-static/FCKeditor/UserFiles/File/D2-072409PR_FY09_1Q_revenues_GB_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
