=== Breakthrough ===
During the early 1990s, Damon and Affleck wrote a screenplay about a young math genius, which they then pitched around Hollywood for a long time.

Damon has become known for choosing a wide variety of film roles,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT06&quot;/&gt; from his portrayal of [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s anti-hero [[Tom Ripley]] in ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;People - Bio&quot;/&gt; to a [[fallen angel]] who discusses [[pop culture]] as intellectual subject matter with Affleck in ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' (1999); from a [[conjoined twin]] in ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck on You]]'' (2003), which got a mixed critical reception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stuck_on_you/|title=Stuck on You reviews|accessdate=April 21, 2010|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the low budget experimental film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'' (2002), which he co-wrote with [[Casey Affleck]] and [[Gus Van Sant]].

== In the media ==
=== Kimmel and Damon ===
Comedian [[Jimmy Kimmel]] at some point started stating near the end of his [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television show ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', &quot;My apologies to Matt Damon; we ran out of time.&quot; The line is a gag lampooning instances where shows cannot feature their last guest due to time constraints. On September 12, 2006, after a segment highlighting the running gag and a lengthy introduction by Kimmel, Damon finally appeared on the show, only for Kimmel to apologetically cut his interview and head to credits, as Damon cursed him. This encounter was entirely planned by Kimmel and Damon.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAW&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Lorrie|publisher=''[[USA Weekend]]''|title=Who's News|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/06_issues/061217/061217whosnews.html|accessdate=April 5, 2009}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kimmel's girlfriend at the time, comedian [[Sarah Silverman]] appeared on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' on January 31, 2008 and aired a clip where she is singing a song entitled &quot;[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!#&quot;I'm Fucking Ben Affleck&quot;|I'm Fucking Matt Damon]].&quot; Damon appeared in the song with Silverman.&lt;ref name=&quot;PeopleSarahMatt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan|first=Julie|title=Behind Matt Damon's Raunchy Payback to Jimmy Kimmel|publisher=''[[People (magazine)|People]]''|date=February 2, 2008|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20175789,00.html|accessdate=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimmel responded by airing his own music video in which he announced, through song, that he is &quot;fucking [[Ben Affleck]].&quot; The video aired on February 24, 2008, and featured Affleck along with a host of celebrities, including [[Don Cheadle]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Robin Williams]]. 

Later on, Kimmel's sidekick, Guillermo, appeared in a spoof of ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon as he cursed about Kimmel being behind all this. 

The most recent encounter was titled &quot;The Handsome Men's Club&quot; which featured Kimmel, along with other &quot;Handsome Men&quot; including [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Lowe]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]].  At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by Damon stating that they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTKimmelAffleck&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Edward|title=Late-Night TV Satires Become Online Hits |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=February 27, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/arts/television/27kimm.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=April 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political views ===
Damon appeared on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'' in December 2006 and, while discussing the ongoing [[war in Iraq]], he stated: &quot;I don't think that it's fair, as I said before, that it seems like we have a fighting class in our country that's {{sic|hide=y|comprised |of}} people who have to go for either financial reasons, or&amp;nbsp;... if you're gonna send people to war, then that needs to be shared by everybody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OYE&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Press International|title=Damon: Maybe Bush twins should go to Iraq|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061215-091251-2299r |date=December 15, 2006|accessdate=April 5, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070105010500/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061215-091251-2299r |archivedate = January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2008, a video was released on [[YouTube]] by the ''[[Associated Press]]'' in which Damon criticized the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]], whom he found unready to lead the country in case [[John McCain]] were to not make it through his first term. Damon referred to Palin as a &quot;...bad [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movie... 'I'm just a hockey mom from Alaska here to take on the White House,'&quot; and added, &quot;It's absurd&amp;nbsp;... I need to know if she really thinks [[dinosaur]]s were here [[Young Earth creationism|4,000 years ago]].
