'''StartUp-Manager''' was a program to configure [[GRUB]], [[GRUB2]], Usplash and Splashy. It was originally an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] project, but was later adapted to [[Debian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/utils/startupmanager&lt;/ref&gt;
It is already included in the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] repositories. Development stopped on 6th May 2011 after the lead developer cited personal reasons for not actively developing the program. The developer is willing to let other people take over the project.
