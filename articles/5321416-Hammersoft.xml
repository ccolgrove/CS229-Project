A '''live USB''' is a [[USB flash drive]] or a USB [[external hard disk drive]] containing a full [[operating system]] that can be [[booting|booted]]. Live USBs are closely related to [[live CD]]s, but sometimes have the ability to persistently save settings and permanently install software packages back onto the USB device. Like live CDs, live USBs can be used in embedded systems for [[system administration]], [[data recovery]], or the testing of operating system distributions without committing to a permanent installation on the local [[hard disk drive]]. Many operating systems including Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, Microsoft [[Windows XP Embedded]] and many of the [[Linux distribution]]s and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] distributions can also be used from a USB flash drive. [[Windows 8]] is also planned to be able to run from a USB drive, with [[Windows To Go]].

==History==
Since 1999, [[Apple Macintosh]] computers (beginning with the [[Power Mac G4]] with AGP graphics and the slot-loading [[iMac G3]] models)&lt;ref&gt;http://support.apple.com/kb/TA25908 Legacy Apple article about USB features in Macs with AGP graphics&lt;/ref&gt; have been able to boot from USB. Intel-based Macs support booting Mac OS X from USB.

Specialized USB-based booting was proposed by IBM  in [[2004]], in the papers &quot;Reincarnating PCs with Portable SoulPads&quot; ([http://domino.watson.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/papers/577BB6B4F4A4BB7185256FF0004E578A/ PDF] &amp; [http://www.research.ibm.com/WearableComputing/SoulPad/soulpad.html Summary]) and [http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-fireboot.html Boot Linux from a FireWire device].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/IBM-brains-capture-a-PCs-soul/2100-1041_3-5830870.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and limitations==

Live USBs share many of the benefits and limitations of [[live CD]]s.

===Benefits===
*In contrast to live CDs, the data contained on the [[booting device]] can be changed and additional data stored on the same device. A user can carry their preferred operating system, applications, configuration, and personal files with them, making it easy to share a single system between multiple users.

*Live USBs provide the additional benefit of enhanced privacy because users can easily carry the USB device with them or store it in a secure location (e.g. a [[safe]]), reducing the opportunities for others to access their data. On the other hand, a USB device is easily lost or stolen, so data [[encryption]] and [[backup]] is even more important than with a typical desktop system.

*The absence of moving parts in USB flash devices allows true [[random access]] avoiding the [[rotational latency]] and [[seek time]] (see [[Latency (engineering)#Mechanical latency|mechanical latency]]) of hard drives or [[optical media]], meaning small programs will start faster from a USB flash drive than from a local hard disk or live CD. However, as USB devices typically achieve lower data transfer rates than internal hard drives, booting from a computer lacking [[USB 2.0]] support can be very slow.

===Limitations===
*Some computers, particularly older ones, may not have a [[BIOS]] that supports USB booting. Many which do support USB booting may still be unable to boot the device in question. In these cases a computer can often be &quot;redirected&quot; to boot from a USB device through use of an initial bootable CD or [[floppy disk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16822/boot-from-a-usb-drive-even-if-your-bios-wont-let-you/ Boot From a USB Drive Even if your BIOS Wonât Let You] (How-To Geek)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager.html Plop Boot Manager] (Plop)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/11/21/use-a-floppy-to-boot-usb-pendrive-linux/ boot floppy for live USB&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[AppleâIntel architecture|Intel-based Macintosh computers]] have limitations when booting from USB devices â while the [[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) [[firmware]] can recognize and boot from USB drives, it can only do this in EFI mode. When the firmware switches to &quot;legacy&quot; BIOS mode, it no longer recognizes USB drives. Non OSX systems may not be typically booted in EFI mode, notably Windows and Linux, and thus USB booting may be limited to supported hardware and software combinations, which can easily be booted via EFI&lt;ref&gt;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/EFI-Boot-Mactel#Non-Working%20Hardware&lt;/ref&gt;. This limitation could be fixed by either changing the Apple firmware to include a USB driver in BIOS mode, or changing the operating systems to remove the dependency on the BIOS.

*Due to the additional write cycles that occur on a full-blown installation, the life of the flash drive may be slightly reduced. This doesn't apply to systems particularly designed for live systems which keep all changes in [[RAM]] until the user logs off.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=16243#p141498&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sd_card#Optional_write-protect_tab|write-locked]] [[SD card]] (known as a [[Live SD]] the [[solid-state]] counterpart to a [[Live CD]] ) in a USB flash card reader adapter is an effective way to avoid any duty cycles on the flash medium from writes and circumvent this problem. The SD card as a [[Write Once Read Many|WORM]] device has an essentially unlimited life. An OS such as Linux can then run from the live USB/SD card and use conventional media for writing, such as magnetic disks, to preserve system changes (see [[Persistence (computer science)]]).

== Principle of installation ==

[[List of tools to create Live USB systems|Various applications]] exist to create live USBs; examples include the [[Fedora Live USB Creator]] and [[UNetbootin]] and [http://liveusb.info/dotclear/ MultiSystem LiveUSB MultiBoot], which works with a variety of distributions. A few [[Linux distribution]] and live CDs have ready-made scripts which perform the steps below automatically. In addition on some (Knoppix, Ubuntu), extra applications can be installed, and a [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]] [[file system]] can be used to store changes.

To set up a live USB system for commodity PC hardware, the following steps need to be done:

* A [[USB flash drive]] needs to be connected to the system, and be detected by it
* One or more partitions may need to be created on the USB flash drive
* The &quot;bootable&quot; flag must be set on the primary partition on the USB flash drive
* An [[Master boot record|MBR]] must be written to the primary partition of the USB flash drive
* The partition must be formatted (most often in [[FAT32]] format, but other [[file system]]s can be used too)
* A bootloader must be installed to the partition (most often using [[syslinux]] when installing a Linux system)
* A bootloader configuration file (if used) must be written
* The necessary files of the operating system and default applications must be copied to the USB flash drive
* Language and keyboard files (if used) must be written to the USB flash drive


(Actual use of a CD or DVD will allow the user to choose if the medium can later be written to.  [[Write Once Read Many]] discs allow certainty that the live system will be clean the next time it is re-booted.)

[[Knoppix]] live CDs have a utility that, on boot, allows users to declare their intent to write the operating system's file structures either temporarily, to a [[RAM disk]], or permanently, on disk and flash media to preserve any added configurations and security updates.  This can be easier than re-creating the USB system but may be moot since many current (circa 2010) [[live USB tools]] are simple to use.

===Full install===
The second type of live USB is closely related to a traditional operating system hard drive install with minor modifications like the elimination of swap partitions and files.

*Updating applications or the whole thing is as easy as the parent distribution used to create it.
*Full system encryption possible.
*Easier to customize with the user's preferred [[Window Manager]] and applications.
*Base install usually starts at approximately 200MB (although some can be as little as 40MB) and grows as the user adds applications.
