==History==
The Law School at the [[University of Montana]] was established as department in 1911 as the first law school in Montana.  It originally covered three academic years and gave special attention to the practice of court work, procedure, mining and irrigation law in addition to the practice of law in Montana and the Western states in general.  It was admitted to membership in the Association of American Law Schools in 1914 and by the American Bar Association (ABA)
since 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Twentieth Register of the University of Montana 1914-1915. p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==

Given Montanaâs landscape and culture, many students enroll in the natural resource and environmental law courses where Montana offers a certificate program in Environmental and Natural Resource Law, natural resource clinics, and opportunities to participate on the Public Land and Resources Law Review.

The School of Law also offers concentrations in the areas of Trial Advocacy and Dispute Resolution, Indian Law, and Business and Tax Law. As Montana is home to seven Indian
reservations the School of Lawâs Indian law courses, Indian Law Clinic, and Native American Law Student Association provide opportunities for students to learn about and participate in the administration of justice for Montanaâs
Native Americans.

The School of Law offers three joint-degree programs.
Students can combine their law degrees with a Master of Science in Environmental Studies, a Master of Business Administration, or a Master of Public Administration. These programs can lead to completion of the joint degree in as little
as four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://officialguide.lsac.org/Release/SchoolsABAData/SchoolPage/SchoolPage.aspx?sid=94 Law School Admission's Council Official Guide to ABA-Approved Law Schools p.482]&lt;/ref&gt;
