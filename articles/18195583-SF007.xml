Apple provides updates to the operating system for the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[iPod Touch]] system through [[iTunes]], similar to the way that other [[iPod]]s are updated, and touts this as an advantage compared to other mobile phones and devices.&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash&gt;Haslam, Karen. [http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=16927 Macworld Expo: Optimised OS X sits on 'versatile' flash], ''[[Macworld|Macworld UK]]'', (2007-01-12){{accessdate|2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer security|Security]] patches, as well as new and improved features, are released in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Kharif, Olga. [http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2007/07/coming_soon_iph.html Coming Soon: iPhone Software Updates], ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', (2007-07-10){{accessdate|2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the June 6, 2011 announcement of iOS version 5.0, a USB connection to iTunes is no longer needed to activate iOS devices; data synchronization happens automatically and wirelessly through Apple's new [[iCloud]] service. Apple claims that there are over 200 new features in iOS 5, including revamped notifications, a proprietary messaging app across all iOS devices and full [[Twitter]] integration are among the reported 200 new features.

== Overview ==
Apple's iOS did not have an official name until the release of the iPhone software development kit ([[iPhone SDK]]) on MarchÂ 6,Â 2008. Before then, Apple marketing literature simply stated that their iPhone runs a version of &quot;OSÂ X&quot;, a reference to iOS's parent, [[MacÂ OSÂ X]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071006005308/http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html iPhoneÂ - FeaturesÂ - OSÂ X]Â - [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], archived version from 2007-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt; When introduced, it was named ''iPhone OS''. It was renamed iOS on JuneÂ 7,Â 2010, since iPhone was no longer the only device to run iOS by then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/151812/2010/06/iphone_os_4_wwdc.html?lsrc=top_2 iPhone OS Gets New NameÂ - Macworld]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2011|11|11|df=US}}, the current versions of iOS are: 5.0.1 (9A405) for iPhone 3GS, 4, and 4S (GSM/CDMA), iPod touch 4th &amp; 3rd generation and iPad 1 &amp; 2, was released on November 10, 2011; the latest version for Apple TV (second generation), 5.0.1/4.4.3 (9A405l), was released on October 24,Â 2011; the latest iOS version for the iPhone and iPod touch 1st generation are iPhone OS 3.1.3 (7E18); and for the iPhone 3G and iPod touch 2nd generation are iOS 4.2.1 (8C148).

== Versions ==
On June 29, 2007, Apple released the first version of what became iOS - concurrently with the first iPhone. The final 1.x series release was 1.1.5, released shortly after version 2.0.

July 11, 2008 saw the public release of iPhone OS 2.0, with upgrades through version 2.2 made available to all models.

iOS 3.0 was released June 17, 2009 with updated through version 3.1.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Release Date&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â New features in the iPhone 3.0 Software Update.| publisher = Apple| date = Retrieved on 2009-06-04| url = http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first generation [[iPod touch]] and [[iPhone]] have iOS 3.1.3 as their newest available version. The iPad was introduced with 3.2, a version made specifically for the iPad.

On June 21, 2010, iOS 4.0 was released to the public and was made available only to the iPod touch and iPhone. 4.0 was announced to have over 1500 new [[API]]s for developers, with the highly anticipated [[Media multitasking|multitasking]] feature.&lt;ref name=&quot;4.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Get a sneak peak into the future of iOS 4.|publisher=Apple|date=2010-04-08|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5oqYO6thc|archivedate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation iPod touch and iPhone 3G have iOS 4.2.1 as their latest version available. iOS 4.2 is the first version to bring major feature parity to the iPhone and iPad.  The release of the CDMA iPhone for Verizon Wireless saw a branching of iOS. The 4.2 version sequence continued for the CDMA phone while 4.3 was released for all other products.

On June 6, 2011, Apple previewed iOS 5, Apple TV 4.4 beta and the iOS SDK 5 beta along with iCloud beta among other products. This update introduced [[iMessage]] chat between devices running iOS 5, a new notification system, Newsstand subscriptions, Twitter integrated into iOS, Reminders app, Enhancements to AirPlay, full integration with iCloud and over 200 new features. iOS 5.0 supports All [[iPad]] models, [[iPhone]] [[3GS]], [[iPhone 4]] [[GSM]], [[iPhone 4]] [[CDMA]], the [[iPod touch]] 3rd generation and the iPod touch 4th generation.

Apple concurrently provides the same version of iOS for the comparable model of iPod and iPhone, usually devices released in the same calendar year.  iPhone users receive all software updates for free, while iPod touch users paid for the 2.0 and 3.0 major software updates. As of iOS 4.0, Apple no longer charges for iPod touch updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowyourmobile.com/blog/502495/iphone_os_40_ios4_update_available_from_june_21.html |title=iPhone OS 4.0 (iOS4) update available from June 21 - News |publisher=Know Your Mobile |date= |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unreleased versions ===
As of  October 23, 2011 two versions of iOS were never released: iOS 1.2, that after the first beta was replaced by 2.0. (the second beta was called 2.0b1 instead of 1.2b2). The other release was iOS 4.2, that was replaced with 4.2.1, because of a Wi-Fi bug in 4.2 beta 3, which caused [[Apple inc.|Apple]] to release 2 more Golden masters (4.2 GM and 4.2.1 GM).
