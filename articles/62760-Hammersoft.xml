{{About|The Lord of the Rings character|the alternative rock band|Ãowyn (band)}}

'''Ãowyn''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], who appears in his most famous work, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. She is a noblewoman of [[Rohan]] who describes herself as a &quot;[[shieldmaiden]]&quot;.

==Literature==
In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Ãowyn, a daughter of the [[House of Eorl]] and the niece of King [[ThÃ©oden]], is introduced in [[Meduseld]], the king's hall at [[Edoras]].&lt;ref name = &quot;hall&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|ttt|&quot;The King of the Golden Hall&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of [[ThÃ©odwyn]] (sister to ThÃ©oden) and [[Ãomund]], and the sister of [[Ãomer]]. When she was only seven years old, her father was killed fighting [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and her mother died of grief. Ãowyn and Ãomer were raised in her uncle's household as if they were his own children.

Tolkien writes she fell into depression since she longed to win renown in battleâmore so because she was royalâbut being female, her duties were reckoned to be at Edoras.&lt;ref name = &quot;healing&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|&quot;The Houses of Healing&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ThÃ©oden's mind was poisoned by his adviser [[GrÃ­ma Wormtongue]], Ãowyn was obliged to care for her uncle, and his deterioration pained her deeply. To make matters worse, she was stalked by GrÃ­ma.

However, when [[Gandalf]] (along with [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]]) arrived, he healed ThÃ©oden from Wormtongue's corruption, and Ãowyn fell in love with [[Aragorn]]. It soon became clear that Aragorn could not return her love (though he did not mention his betrothal to [[Arwen]]), and would not allow her to join him in going to war.&lt;ref name = &quot;grey&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|The Passing of the Grey Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Aragorn pointed out,&lt;ref name = &quot;grey&quot; /&gt;  her duty was with her people; she had to shoulder the responsibility of ruling Rohan in ThÃ©oden's stead  when the war-host of Rohan went to war.&lt;ref name = &quot;hall&quot; /&gt; Aragorn also said her duties were no less valiant.&lt;ref name = &quot;grey&quot; /&gt; Likening her situation to a &quot;cage&quot;, Ãowyn said she feared

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''...[t]o stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.''&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;grey&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frustrated by the belief that she, as a woman, could not fight and longing for glory in battle, she disguised herself as a man and under the alias of '''Dernhelm''', travelled with the Riders of Rohan to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] outside the White City of [[Minas Tirith]] in [[Gondor]], carrying with her [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], who had also been ordered to remain behind, on her horse Windfola.

During the battle of the [[Pelennor Fields]], she confronted the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], Lord of the [[NazgÃ»l]], after ThÃ©oden was injured. The Witch-king threatened to &quot;''bear ''[her]'' away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where ''[her]'' flesh shall be devoured, and ''[her]'' shriveled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.''&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;pelennor&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|&quot;The Battle of the Pelennor Fields&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Witch-king further boasted that &quot;''[n]o living man may hinder me'',&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;pelennor&quot; /&gt; referring to the 1,000-year-old [[prophecy]] by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord [[Glorfindel]], foretelling that the Witch-king would not fall &quot;''by the hand of man''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;glorfindel&quot;&gt;&quot;''Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.''&quot; {{ME-ref|rotk|Appendices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ãowyn then removed her helmet and declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Ãowyn I am, Ãomundâs daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.''&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;pelennor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Witch-king attacked Ãowyn with his [[Fell beast|steed]], but she slew it with her sword. He then shattered her shield and broke her shield-arm with his mace, but was distracted by Merry, who stabbed him behind the knee with a [[Barrow-blade|sword enchanted with spells against him]]. Ãowyn seized the opportunity to strike the Witch-king with a killing blow &quot;between crown and mantle&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;pelennor&quot; /&gt; As her sword shattered, his clothing fell to the ground and he vanished with a wailing cry.

Unconscious, Ãowyn was believed dead until Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] realized she still lived. Ãowyn was brought to the Houses of Healing, hovering near death from the effects of having struck the Witch-king.&lt;ref name = &quot;healing&quot; /&gt; There Ãowyn met [[Faramir]], with whom she soon fell in love, understanding that her previous &quot;love&quot; for Aragorn was mainly hero-worship. Her outlook on life also changes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''Then the heart of Ãowyn changed, or else she understood it...''

''...'I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;steward&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|The Steward and the King}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the demise of [[Sauron]], the happily wedded couple settled in [[Ithilien]], of which Faramir was made the ruling Prince by King Elessar (the name with which Aragorn ascended the throne of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]). Faramir and Ãowyn had at least one son (Elboron), and their grandson was [[Barahir (Fourth Age)|Barahir]], who wrote ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]'' in the [[Fourth Age]].  Tolkien nowhere gives the cause and date of Ãowyn's death, but one can presume she died of natural causes, in peacetime.

===Characteristics===

Ãowyn is described to be very beautiful; she was tall, slim, pale, and graceful, with long golden hair and grey eyes.  In temperament she was idealistic, spirited, brave, high-minded, and lonely.

===Names and titles===

In the [[Old English language]] (the language Tolkien used to represent [[Rohirric]]) the word ''eoh'' (or ''eh'') means &quot;war-horse, charger&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oXlii1KgDngC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=eoh#PPA253,M1 Eoh: war-horse], Bosworth, Joseph, D.D., F.R.S. &amp; Toller, T. Northcote, M.A (1898, 1921). [http://books.google.com/books?id=oXlii1KgDngC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP3,M1 An Anglo-Saxon dictionary, based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth]. Oxford University Press. p. 253. Google Book Search. Retrieved on April 03, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''wyn'' means &quot;delight, pleasure&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oXlii1KgDngC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=wyn#PPA1286,M1 Wyn(n): delight], Bosworth, Joseph, D.D., F.R.S. &amp; Toller, T. Northcote, M.A (1898, 1921). [http://books.google.com/books?id=oXlii1KgDngC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP3,M1 An Anglo-Saxon dictionary, based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth]. Oxford University Press. p. 1285. Google Book Search. Retrieved on April 03, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (in addition, some sample text within ''Bosworth and Toller'' translates ''wyn'' as &quot;joy, joyous&quot;). Therefore, even though no such word appears in the lexicon of Old English, the name ''Ãowyn'' can be taken to mean &quot;delightful charger&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;peoples&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|The Peoples of Middle-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ardalambion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/mannish.htm|title=Various Mannish Tongues - the sadness of Mortal Men?|first=Helge|last=Fauskanger|publisher=''Ardalambion'' ([[Tolkien scholarship]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first syllable of ''Ãowyn'' sounds like &quot;eh-oh,&quot; with the &quot;oh&quot; just barely pronounced. As in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] or [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the y in the second syllable is the same sound as the German letter ''Ã¼'' or the French ''u''. The actors in the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|Lord of the Rings film trilogy]] consistently pronounce her name as well as the names of [[Ãomer]] and [[ThÃ©oden]] in a manner inconsistent with most reconstructions of [[Old English language|Old English]] pronunciation.

Tolkien maintained ''Ãowyn'' was not the character's actual name. Her real name in [[Rohirric]] is not given, but it, as well as ''[[Ãomer]]'' and ''[[Ãomund]]'', would have started with the element ''LÃ´-'' or ''Loh-'', meaning &quot;horse&quot;, which he represented with Old English ''Eoh-''.&lt;ref name = &quot;ardalambion&quot; /&gt;

Although she never carried the title of princess, she was a niece to one King of Rohan and sister to another, as well as the wife of a Gondorian prince.

Ãowyn's titles included the '''(White) Lady of Rohan''', '''Lady of Ithilien''' and '''Lady of [[Emyn Arnen]]'''. She was also known as the '''Lady of the Shield-arm''' in recognition of her triumph over the Witch-king.

==Concept and creation==
Originally, Tolkien intended for Ãowyn to marry Aragorn. Later, however, he decided against it because Aragorn was &quot;too old and lordly and grim.&quot; He considered making Ãowyn the twin sister of Ãomund, and having her die &quot;to avenge or save ThÃ©oden&quot;. He also considered having Aragorn truly love Ãowyn and regret never marrying after her death.&lt;ref name = &quot;treason&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|ToI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point Tolkien described Ãowyn as &quot;a stern [[Amazons|Amazon]] woman&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;treason&quot; /&gt; Later he wrote: &quot;Though not a 'dry nurse' in temper, she was also not really a soldier or 'Amazon', but like many brave women was capable of great military gallantry at a crisis.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;letter 244&quot;&gt;{{ME-ref|letters|#244}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Here he alludes to Ãowyn's statement to Aragorn: &quot;''But am I not of the House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse?''&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;grey&quot; /&gt;)

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[Image:BakshiÃowyn.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Ãowyn, as portrayed in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.]]
The voice of Ãowyn was provided by [[Nellie Bellflower]] in the 1980 [[Rankin/Bass]] animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', and by Elin Jenkins in [[BBC Radio]]'s 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|serialisation]].

Ãowyn also appears briefly in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 adaptation, but does not have any dialogue.

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s films ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), Ãowyn is played by [[Miranda Otto]]. (The role was first offered to [[Iben Hjejle]], who turned it down because she did not like the idea of being away from Denmark; [[Uma Thurman]] was slated for the role at one point.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Shawn|last=Adler|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/04/17/lord-of-the-rings-what-if-uma-thurman-as-eowyn/|title='Lord of the Rings' What If: Uma Thurman As Eowyn?|publisher=MTV Movies Blog|date=17 April 2008|accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was apparently promised to GrÃ­ma by [[Saruman]] in payment for being the wizard's spy in the royal court (as in the book). In one scene, mourning for her dead cousin, she is subjected to GrÃ­ma's obnoxious affections, which she spurns. She sang the [[dirge]] at [[ThÃ©odred]]'s funeral. In the extended edition of ''The Two Towers,'' Ãowyn is shown discovering, to her astonishment, that Aragorn is a long-lived [[DÃºnedain|DÃºnadan]].
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:LOTRTT1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Miranda Otto]] portrays Ãowyn in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films.]] --&gt;
In the original theatrical release of ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', Ãowyn's injuries after fighting the Witch-king were less severe than in the novel: she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. She plays a much larger role in the Battle of Pelennor Fields than in the book, where the only fighting mentioned is her conflict with the Witch-king.  She also replaces Merry as the person to sit with ThÃ©oden as he dies.  In scenes added in the Extended Edition of the film, she ''was'' near death:  her brother found her and screamed in anguish because he feared that she was dead. She is later seen being healed by Aragorn, and meeting Faramir in the houses of Healing.

During a quiet scene before the battle, it is also heavily implied that Ãowyn will be made heir to ThÃ©oden's throne (in the book, Ãomer becomes King of Rohan), though it is never fully stated.  It seems that ThÃ©oden's instructions are that she should take the throne if ''none'' of the Rohirrim army return from the battle, including her brother, which is actually the arrangement ThÃ©oden makes in the book.

While she did disguise herself in the film to ride into battle, she never took on the name &quot;Dernhelm,&quot; and the audience is always aware of her true identity. In the extended version, ThÃ©oden noticed her carving through the enemy but it is not clear if he realised that it is his niece. The production team stated that while in a book it was easy to disguise Ãowyn's identity, in the medium of cinema the audience could visually tell that it was she, and it would have strained the credibility of the scenes to try to make it a secret and would have made Merry look foolish.

Her final appearance occurs at Aragorn's coronation, where she is shown standing next to Faramir.  The Extended Edition restores a scene in which she is falling in love with Faramir at the Houses of Healing, though even this version never states that they eventually marry.  According to the DVD commentaries, an entire set-piece Faramir/Ãowyn wedding scene was actually filmed, which Oscar-winning costume designer [[Ngila Dickson]] states features what she feels are the best costumes she produced for the entire film trilogy.  While this scene has been described in the DVD commentaries and other interviews, it was ultimately cut and not even included in the Extended Edition, nor have any photos of the scene ever been made public.
