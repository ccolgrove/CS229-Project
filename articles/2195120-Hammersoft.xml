'''Meli'sa Morgan''' is an [[African American]] [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] [[singing|singer]] born in [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]] who had a string of [[urban contemporary]] and [[house music]] [[hit record|hits]] in the 1980s and 1990s. She got her start in the [[music industry]] whilst singing with a church [[gospel]] [[choir]] called the Starlets of Corona. She cites [[Chaka Khan]] as a major influence.

==Early successes==
Her initial chart entry was as the lead singer of the [[dance music|dance]] [[musical ensemble|group]], [[Shades of Love]]. They had a single entry on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[magazine]]'s [[Hot Dance Club Play]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1982, the #26 &quot;Body to Body (Keep in Touch)&quot;. This was re-popularized in 1994 by new [[remix]]es, &quot;Body to Body (Keep in Touch)&quot;, and reached [[chart-topper|number 1]] on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.
 
That same year, music entrepreneur [[Jacques Fred Petrus]] asked her to join his newly created studio group, High Fashion, that featured Morgan and two other New York vocalists, Eric McClinton and [[Alyson Williams]]. High Fashion's sole hit, &quot;Feelin' Lucky Lately&quot;, reached #32 on the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Black Singles]] chart. In 1983  Morgan left, and was replaced in the group by the [[jazz]] vocalist, Marcella Allen.

As a [[solo (music)|solo]] [[musician|artist]] she topped the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&amp;B]] chart with her [[cover version]]  of [[Prince (artist)|Prince]]'s &quot;Do Me, Baby&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4956|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Meli'sa Morgan|last=Wynn|first=Ron|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the title track from her debut [[album]]) which also became her only [[Billboard Hot 100]] entry, peaking at #46 in 1986. She had several solo hits on the U.S. dance chart as well, including &quot;Still in Love With You,&quot; which hit #3 in 1992.

==2005 to present==
After a lengthy hiatus, Morgan released her fifth solo album, ''I Remember''. The first single, &quot;Back Together Again&quot;, a song originally recorded by [[Roberta Flack]] and [[Donny Hathaway]], received moderate airplay on [[urban contemporary]] [[radio station]]s during early 2006 and peaked at number 46 on Billboard's R&amp;B chart. The follow-up singles included &quot;I Remember&quot;, &quot;Will You?&quot; and &quot;High Maintenance&quot; which was released in September 2006. New material by Meli'sa Morgan can be heard on a German release by Cool Million, which features Meli'sa Morgan on lead vocals on the opening track Sweet Baby. This proves she is still vocally on top condition.

==Influence==
A verse from Morgan's 1986 single &quot;Fool's Paradise&quot; was re-sung, with modified lyrics, by [[Mary J. Blige]] as the chorus to the 1996 [[Jay-Z]] single &quot;[[Can't Knock the Hustle]]&quot;.
