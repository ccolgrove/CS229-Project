There are many [[waterfall]]s in the [[Himalayas]] that are mighty tall and are fed by the numerous streams and glaciers but unlike the waterfalls from the [[Western Ghats]] they are not quite popular.
'''Amitabh Bachchan falls''' lies on the road connecting [[Chungthang]] to [[Yumthang Valley]] in [[North Sikkim district]] of [[Sikkim]].

It is certainly the tallest of the many waterfalls shown to [[tourist]]s by local tour operators and cab-drivers-cum-guide.
Like most other waterfalls in Sikkim this one does not have a local name and has been named thus because of its immense height.
It is a relatively less visited waterfall owing to its remoteness and for all practical purposes it can be assumed that legendary Indian actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] must be unaware that a waterfall by his name exists on the earth.
