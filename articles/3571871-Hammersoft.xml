'''''Stop the Express''''' (in Japan, the game was known as '''''Bousou Tokkyuu SOS''''' ('''''æ´èµ°ç¹æ¥SOS''''')) is a [[ZX Spectrum]] [[video game]] made by [[Hudson Soft]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. There were also versions for the [[Commodore 64]] and the [[MSX]].

== Gameplay ==
In ''Stage 1'', the player runs along the top of an express [[train]], jumping between carriages while avoiding enemy knives and obstacles. Half-way along the train, the player enters the train, and ''Stage 2'' begins. The player must then proceed through the carriages, towards the front of the train, so that it can be stopped.

Upon the completion of each level, the game displays the [[Engrish]] message âCongraturation! You Sucsess!â. The game then repeats from Stage 1, with more enemies. Enemies, known as &quot;redmen&quot; initially pursue from the rear on the roof of the train, and the front once inside, and will throw knives which the player must dodge by ducking under, or jumping over, them. In addition, once inside the train, the player can jump up and hang from the overhead straps out of the way of the redmen. However, ghosts flit up and down the carriages making it extremely dangerous to stay there too long. Once a few levels have been completed, redmen will approach from both front and rear. 

The player has only two weapons at his disposal. When on the roof of the train, he can catch birds that fly overhead and then release them to run along the carriage and knock the redmen off, as well as high kicking them. Whilst inside, the high kick is the only option. 

==Critical acclaim==
''Stop the Express'' was rated as the 4th best Spectrum game by ''[[Your Sinclair]]'', in their list of the [[Your Sinclair official top 100|top 100 Spectrum games]].

==Remake==
In 2004, a remake of ''Stop The Express'' by [http://www.jdgames.co.uk Jetmans Dad] took second place in the [http://www.retroremakes.com Retro Remakes] competition. The remake is faithful to the original in most respects, although some aspects of the gameplay are tweaked slightly - the player can now pick up knives discarded by the redmen to assist in his task, and the ghosts have been replaced by robot sentries which also fire lasers on higher levels. 

There was a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES/Famicom]] port being planned, but due to only having the first train level, three levels were added and became ''[[Challenger (video game)|Challenger]]'', which was released only in Japan.
