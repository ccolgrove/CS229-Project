'''LiVES (''L''iVES ''E''diting ''S''ystem)''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|l|aÉª|v|z}}) is a [[free software]] [[video editing software]] and [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] tool, released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 3 or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://lives.sourceforge.net/index.php?do=license|title=License page for LiVES}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are binary versions available for most popular [[Linux distribution]]s (including [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]], [[SUSE Linux|Suse]], [[Slackware]], [[Arch Linux]] and [[Mandriva]]). There are also ports for [[BSD]], and it will run under [[solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[IRIX]]. It has been compiled under [[Osx_leopard|OSX Leopard]], but not thoroughly tested on that platform&lt;ref&gt;http://linux.foroactivo.eu/t7-lives-1310-vj-software-on-mac-osx-unix-darwin-english&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The main developer of LiVES is Salsaman (Gabriel Finch), who is also a video artist and international VJ.

The project began in late 2002, and the 1.0.0 version was released in July 2009.

On the [[Freshmeat]] site, LiVES is listed as the most popular [[Non-linear video editor|non-linear video editing]] software.&lt;ref&gt;http://freshmeat.net/tags/non-linear-editor?sort=popularity&amp;with=&amp;without=&lt;/ref&gt;

LiVES was nominated for the category of Best Project for Multimedia in the [[Sourceforge]] Community Choice Awards 2009.

The LiVES application allows the user to manipulate video in realtime and in non-realtime. The application also has features which go beyond traditional video editing applications - for example, it can be controlled and monitored remotely over a network, and it has facilities for streaming to and from another copy of LiVES. It is [[display resolution|resolution]] and [[frame rate]] independent.

LiVES uses a system of [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]]s for effects, decoders, encoders and video playback. The [[API]]s for these are now well defined, and the application can be easily extended.

==Interface==

LiVES has two main interfaces: the clip editor, which serves as a repository of video and audio material, and the multitrack window, where multiple clips can be positioned on the timeline.

The clip editor allows free playback at variable play rates, applying of multiple realtime effects and mixing of clips. This mode is mainly used by VJs. Video editors can also use this interface to prepare the clips before entering into multitrack mode.

In multitrack mode, the individual clips can be arranged in layers on the timeline. Further effects and transitions can be applied here, and the audio can be mixed down. The entire timeline can then be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]], creating a new clip.

Rendering previews are shown in real time.

==Features==
[[Image:Livesmt.png|thumb|The LiVES Multitrack Window]]

LiVES' features include:

* Loading and editing of almost any video format (via [[mplayer]] decoder).
* Some formats can be opened instantly using decoder plugins (e.g. [[flv]], [[Advanced_Systems_Format|asf]], [[dv]] and [[ogg]]/[[theora]]).
* Smooth playback at variable frame rates, forward and in reverse. Display framerate can be controlled independently of playback framerate.
* Frame accurate cutting and pasting within and between clips.
* Saving/re-encoding of clips, selections, and individual frames.
* Lossless backup/restore.
* Streaming input and output.
* Real time blending of clips (various chroma and [[luma (video)|luma]] blends).
* Can handle in/out streams in LiVES to LiVES or yuv4mpeg format. Streams can be piped from stdout into other applications.
* Support for live [[firewire]] and TV card inputs.
* Internal support for [[RGB]]24, RGBA32, [[YUV]]A, YUV, YUV422, YUV420 (jpeg and mpeg), YUYV, YUV411, and UYVY palettes; one step conversion with chroma super and [[chroma subsampling|subsampling]] is implemented.
* Ability to edit many filetypes and sources including remotely located files (with mplayer/ffmpeg libraries), and directories of images ([[rotoscoping]]).
* Real time capture/recording of interactive (via mouseclicks) external windows.
* Encode to any of the 50+ output formats which are now supported (e.g. [[mjpeg]], [[mpeg4]], mpeg1/2, [[h264]], [[VCD]], [[SVCD]], [[DVD]], x264/[[blu-ray]], ogg/mp4 [[ogm]], [[Matroska]] mkv, dv, [[swf]], Ogg Theora, [[Dirac (codec)|Dirac]], [[MNG]], [[Snow (codec)|Snow]], [[xvid]], [[Flash Video|Flash]] and even [[animated GIF]] and [[PDF]])
* Resampling of video (time stretching) to any frame rate (1 to 200 frame/s - accurate to 8 decimal places); option to auto-resample or speed up/slow down between clips.
* Rotation, resizing and trimming of video clips.
* [[Deinterlacing]], subtitle removal. Auto deinterlacing for dv can be enabled.
* Can load [[mp3]], [[vorbis]], [[MOD (file format)|mod]], [[Impulse Tracker|it]], [[XM (file format)|xm]] and [[wav]] audio files.
* LiVES can also load audio tracks directly off CD to use with video.
* Sample accurate cutting and pasting of audio within and between clips.
* Resampling of audio (rate, channels, sample size, signedness and endianness); audio is auto-resampled between clips.
* Able to record from any external audio source.
* Fade in/fade out feature for clips.
* Audio speed and direction can be smoothly adjusted; both in real time and when rendering.
* Hundreds of effects, including random/targeted [[digital zoom|zooming]], [[Panning (camera)|panning]] of video, colour cycling and colorisation/colour filtering and colour correction.
* Merging/[[compositing]] of frames is possible: e.g. frame-in-frame, fade in/out and transparency.
* Real time previews as the effect is processing.
* Support for the [[Frei0r]] 1.1 and 1.2 effect plugin architectures.
* Multiple real time effects are possible during playback (VJ mode), these can also be rendered to frames.
* Multitrack window with drag and drop
* Intelligent screen organisation - shows you only the information which is relevant, no more and no less
* Support for an almost limitless number of tracks and effects
* [[Non-destructive editing]] in the multitrack window, with multiple levels of undo/redo.
* Full automation/[[interpolation]] of effect parameters.
* Support for stereo backing audio track + stereo audio track per video track
* Automatic gain control
* Realtime [[audio mixing (film and television)|mixing]]/previewing of audio
* Channel mixer volume control + fine grained, time variable per-channel volume and pan control.
* Auto-transitioning of audio with video.
* Auto-transitioning of video in multitrack mode (optional).
* Full crash recovery.
* Configurable multi-monitor screen placement.
* Simple and intuitive menu layout.
* Drag and drop interface.
* Remote monitoring and control (via [[Open Sound Control]]) of the application can be enabled
* VJ functions can be controlled via keyboard, joystick or [[MIDI]] controller
* [[I18N]] text support. Translations into at least French, Czech, German, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Turkish, Hungarian, Slovak, Simplified Chinese, Finnish, Ukrainian, Arabic, Estonian, Uzbek and Hebrew are included.
* Support for audio output through [[pulse audio]].
* Support for audio output through [[JACK Audio Connection Kit|jack]].
* Jack transport support (master or client)
* Support for .srt and .sub subtitle files
* Vloopback output for video (Linux only)
* Support for Unicap compatible devices.
* Full integration with upcoming videojack standard
* RFX builder allows rapid prototyping of new effects, transitions, generators, utilities and tools. Custom RFX scripts can be exported to share with others or downloaded and imported. Test scripts are run in a sandbox to allow safe testing of new plugins.
* MIDI sequence synchronisation (start/stop).
* Shuttle controls for [[firewire]] cameras/recorders. Can grab from [[DV]] and [[HDV]] formats.
