The '''[[2006 NFL season|2006]] [[San Francisco 49ers]] season''' began with the team trying to improve on their 4-12 record in [[2005 NFL season|2005]]. Despite having improved from their previous two disastrous seasons and were in the top 10 best offense in the league in 2006 ,they missed the playoffs for the fourth straight year, continuing their playoff drought. The 49ers celebrated their 60th anniversary during the 2006 season, because, although it was their 61st season, the 2006 calendar year marked the 60th anniversary of the franchise's founding in 1946.

==Off season==
Soon after the end of the 2005 season, [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]], the 49ers' offensive coordinator of one year, left for the [[Green Bay Packers]]. On January 17, 2006, the 49ers hired [[Norv Turner]] as McCarthy's replacement. Whereas McCarthy based the majority of his offense on Bill Walsh's West Coast Offense, Turner has been known to use a power running scheme and vertical passing game more often than the West Coast scheme. Turner came to the 49ers after two unsuccessful seasons as the head coach of the 49ers' crossbay rivals, the [[Oakland Raiders]].

The 49ers gained the 6th pick in the [[2006 NFL Draft]] after winning a coin toss with the [[Oakland Raiders]] at the scouting combine in Indianapolis. The 49ers used their first pick on Maryland Tight End [[Vernon Davis]]. They then used their next pick (acquired from the [[Denver Broncos]] via the [[Washington Redskins]]) on North Carolina St. Defensive End [[Manny Lawson]]. The rest of their picks were Wisconsin Wide Receiver [[Brandon Williams (wide receiver)|Brandon Williams]], Penn St. RB [[Michael Robinson (running back)|Michael Robinson]], Tennessee DE [[Parys Haralson]], Central Missouri St. Wide Receiver [[Delanie Walker]], North Carolina St. Safety [[Marcus Hudson]], Louisiana St. DE [[Melvin Oliver]], and Arkansas Safety [[Vickiel Vaughn]].

The 49ers had two major free agent acquisitions in the off season. [[Larry Allen]], a perennial [[Pro Bowl]] left guard from the [[Dallas Cowboys]], and [[Antonio Bryant]], a talented but oft-troubled wide receiver from the [[Cleveland Browns]]. The 49ers also traded [[Kevan Barlow]] to the [[New York Jets]] for what is believed to be a 2007 4th round draft pick.

''at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]]'' 

Sunday,September 10, 2006

The 49ers opened the regular season against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on September 10. Despite losing 34-27, many positives can be taken out of the game. RB [[Frank Gore]] rushed for 88 yards and caught 6 receptions for over 80 yards with two touchdowns. Rookie tight end [[Vernon Davis]] and second year quarterback [[Alex Smith]] hooked up for a touchdown pass with Smith equaling his touchdown total of the entire 2005 season and passing for an encouraging 288 yards with 23 completions out of 40 attempts. The 49ers had several chances to win it, however, many controversial non-calls were made by the officials, including a blatant pass interference in the end zone, which would have tied the game with just a little over 2 minutes to go. The 49ers would start their 60th season 0-1

Sunday, September 24, 2006

The 49ers stayed at home for a Week 3 contest against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. From the get-go, the Niners trailed as QB [[Donovan McNabb]] managed to complete two TD passes to RB [[Brian Westbrook]] (a 4-yard pass) and WR [[L.J. Smith]] (a 1-yard pass) in the first quarter. In the second quarter, San Francisco would get on the board with Kicker [[Joe Nedney]] completing a 48-yard field goal, but Philadelphia would strike hard, as RB [[Brian Westbrook]] ran 71 yards for a touchdown and Kicker [[David Akers]] completed a 21-yard field goal. In the third quarter, both sides managed to get themselves a touchdown. Eagles DT [[Mike Patterson (American football)|Mike Patterson]] returned a 49ers fumble 98 yards for a touchdown, while the Niners' rookie RB [[Michael Robinson (running back)|Michael Robinson]] got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, San Francisco tried to come back with Robinson getting another 1-yard TD run.  However, the Eagles got an 8-yard TD run by Westbrook.  The Niners would get one more score, as QB [[Alex Smith]] completed a TE [[Eric Johnson (tight end)|Eric Johnson]], but that would as far as they would get, as the 49ers fell to 1-2 on the year.

Sunday, October 1, 2006

After losing at home to the Eagles, the 49ers flew to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] for a Week 4 match-up with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Unfortunately, this match-up was one-sided from beginning to end, with the Chiefs' offense being in top form, the Niners get crushed by KC's defense, and the usual loudness of the stadium (via the Chiefs fans) also probably affected the team's ability to execute. The 49ers tried their best, but in the end, QB [[Damon Huard]] and the Kansas City Chiefs were the better team in the fight. 49ers would drop their record to 1-3

Sunday, October 8, 2006

Hoping to rebound from their loss in Kansas City, the 49ers went home for Week 5 as they played a Bay Area battle with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. The Niners drew first blood with QB [[Alex Smith]] throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR [[Arnaz Battle]], yet the Raiders would respond with kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] getting a 33-yard field goal for the first quarter. In the second quarter, things started to look grim, as Oakland took the lead with Janikowski kicking a 36-yard field goal, while QB [[Andrew Walter]] threw a 22-yard TD pass to WR [[Randy Moss]]. In the third quarter, the 49ers would rebound, as Smith hooked up with Battle again for a 6-yard TD pass. Later, Alex would throw a 33-yard TD pass to RB [[Maurice Hicks]], giving San Francisco the lead. In the fourth quarter, the 49ers continued to roll, as kicker [[Joe Nedney]] kicked a 19-yard field goal, while rookie DE [[Melvin Oliver]] returned a fumble 12 yards for a touchdown. The Niners would allow one last touchdown from the Raiders, in the form of QB [[Marques Tuiasosopo]] completing an 8-yard pass to TE [[Courtney Anderson]], but Nedney would help the Niners get win #2 with a 39-yard field goal. This beating of their Cross-bay rivals would bring the 49ers to a 2-3 record

''at [[Monster Park]], [[San Francisco, California]]''

Sunday, October 15, 2006 

Nothing RB [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] does on the ground really impresses the [[San Diego Chargers]] at this point. For that, the star running back must take to the air. Tomlinson seemed to be trying to jump out of [[Candlestick Park]] while hurdling the goal line on one of his four touchdown runsâand his elevation was the Chargers' inspiration. Tomlinson set a franchise record while seemingly spending most of the afternoon in the end zone, and QB [[Philip Rivers]] passed for a career-high 334 yards and two more scores in San Diego's 48-19 victory over San Francisco. Tomlinson got his third score 33 seconds before halftime, capping San Diego's 35-point first half and essentially finishing off the 49ers (2-4) with an astonishingly high leap over the goal-line pile. WR [[Bryan Gilmore]] and FB [[Moran Norris]] caught scoring passes as the Chargers gave up more points in the first half alone than they allowed in any of their first four games. But San Diego shut out San Francisco in the second half, with QB [[Alex Smith]] finishing 20 of 31 for 214 yards. San Francisco's offense has been better than expected heading to the club's bye week, but the defense has been just as bad as feared. Two weeks after giving up 41 points to the Chiefs, the 49ers seemed lost from the moment top CB [[Walt Harris (American football)|Walt Harris]] was ruled out with a hamstring injury. This crushing blow put the 49ers record at 2-4.

''at [[Soldier Field]], [[Chicago, Illinois]]'' 

Sunday, October 29, 2006

Wearing bright orange uniforms and showing their speed on defense and special teams, the [[Chicago Bears]] overwhelmed the 49ers who were coming off their Bye Week. They jumped to a 24-0 first-quarter lead and 41-0 halftime cushion before coasting to a 41-10 victory. [[Brian Urlacher]]'s one-handed interception was headed to the highlight reel as soon as he tumbled to the ground after somehow batting the ball to himself. Urlacher's stellar play symbolized what kind of afternoon it was for the refreshed and still unbeaten [[Chicago Bears]] -- and how frustrating the day was for the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. San Francisco entered giving up 32 points a game, but the defense wasn't to fault early on because turnovers allowed the Bears to work from short fields. Drives started at the 15, 41 and 13, and they turned all three into touchdowns to take the big opening-quarter lead. The 49ers coughed up the ball a fourth time late in the half when WR [[Antonio Bryant]] caught a pass and fumbled, with CB [[Ricky Manning Jr.]] recovering. San Francisco averted a shutout in the fourth quarter on a 23-yard field goal by K [[Joe Nedney]] and a 16-yard TD pass from Smith to WR [[Antonio Bryant]]. QB [[Alex Smith]] finished 16 of 26 for 146 yards. RB [[Frank Gore]] rushed for 111 yards on 12 carries, thanks to a 53-yard run. The 49ers now stand at 2-5.

Sunday, November 5, 2006

With just 238 total yards and a host of dropped passes and mistakes, the [[Minnesota Vikings]] showed every negative effect of its injury problems and a short week of preparation after Monday night's loss to New England. But count QB [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] among those shocked by the 49ers sudden defensive acumen. San Francisco managed just 133 total yards with its own miserable offense, but got cohesive play from the same unit that gave up 41 points by halftime last week at Chicago. The Niners simplified their game plan and hung on, stopping Minnesota's final drive with 1:04 left. QB [[Alex Smith]] passed for just 105 yards and RB [[Frank Gore]] rushed for only 41 as San Francisco hung on for its eighth straight home victory since 1988 over the Vikings, now 4-4, who'll be shaking their heads all the way back to the Twin Cities after failing to mount any significant offensive attack. QB [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] passed for 136 yards but made three turnovers for the Vikings, whose final drive ended when WR [[Troy Williamson]] dropped an on-target pass on third down before S [[Mark Roman]] and CB [[Shawntae Spencer]] prevented WR [[Bethel Johnson]] from catching a desperate pass at the goal line. K [[Joe Nedney]] left [[Monster Park]] Sunday with a game ball after accounting for all of the 49ers scoring efforts. Nedney hit from 25, 30 and 51 yards out. The 51-yarder he had to kick twice after a game clock debacle. The 49ers, now 3-5, had just enough offense to back a shocking performance by their previously pourous defense (which had allowed 150 points in its last four games), led by new starting LB and NFC Defensive Player of the Week [[Brandon Moore (linebacker)|Brandon Moore]], who finished with 14 tackles and 1 sack. With the win, the 49ers advanced to 3-5.

''at [[Ford Field]], [[Detroit, Michigan]]'' 

Sunday,November 12, 2006

San Francisco kept Detroit in the game with missed opportunities, then made just enough plays for a rare two-game winning streak and its first road win. RB [[Frank Gore]] set a franchise record with 148 yards rushing in the first half and scored on a 61-yard run before leaving with a concussion. San Francisco led 13-3 at halftime after scoring on three of its first four drives, wishing it had a bigger lead after out gaining Detroit 247-102 yards and recovering a fumble without giving up a turnover. The 49ers had chances to go ahead big in the third quarter because Detroit had two turnovers on its first three plays, but they came away with only a field goal and a 13-point lead. Gore then caught a 7-yard pass, wobbled off the field and didn't return. QB [[Alex Smith]]'s fumble midway through the third quarter set up a score that helped the Lions get back in the game. The 49ers drove down the field to set up K [[Joe Nedney]]'s fourth field goal, a key score because it made Detroit go for a TD instead of kicking a tying field goal late in the game. S [[Keith Lewis]] intercepted QB [[Jon Kitna]]'s pass at the 49ers' 2 with 2Â½ minutes left and San Francisco now 4-5 picked up the one first down it needed to seal the game, winning consecutive games for the second time since 2003. RB [[Frank Gore]] finished with career-high 159 yards rushing and San Francisco's QB [[Alex Smith]] was 14 of 20 for 136 yards with a fumble. WR [[Arnaz Battle]] caught six passes for 55 yards, and converted a third-and-4 on the final drive to allow the 49ers to run out the clock. The 49ers' defense again came up huge, allowing only 273 total offensive yards and forcing 4 turnovers. LB [[Brandon Moore (linebacker)|Brandon Moore]] was yet again the story, leading the team with 9 tackles, 2 sacks and forcing 2 turnovers. With the win, the 49ers advanced to 4-5.

Sunday, November 19, 2006

In their first match up of the season versus division-leading rival [[Seattle Seahawks]], the 49ers jumped to a 20-0 lead at halftime thanks to the combined efforts of running back Frank Gore and the defense. This was the first game back from injury for Seattle running back [[Shaun Alexander]], and he was held to just 37 rush yards. On the other side of the ball, Frank Gore ran for a career-high 212 yards on his way to topping the 1,000-yard mark for the season. The Seahawks offense turned the ball over five times during the game, including three interceptions thrown by quarterback [[Seneca Wallace]], two of which were picked off by San Francisco [[cornerback]] [[Walt Harris (American football)|Walt Harris]]. Alex Smith, 49ers quarterback, threw one touchdown pass and also rushed for a one-yard touchdown, the first rushing touchdown of his career. The win elevated the 49ers to a .500 record, and put them just one game out of first place in their division, behind the 6-4 Seahawks.

On the final play of the game, a pass to Seattle's fullback Mack Strong, the Seahawks attempted to continue the play which was similar to [[The Play]] which made the Cal-Stanford rivalry famous. However 49ers Rookie Marcus Hudson recovered the lateral attempt and the game was over. In a reference to [[The Play]], radio announcers on [[107.7 The Bone]] declared &quot;The band is NOT on the field&quot;

Sunday, November 26, 2006

Riding high from their home upset over the Seahawks, the 49ers flew to the [[Edward Jones Dome]] for an NFC West rematch with their historic rival, the [[St. Louis Rams]].  After a scoreless first quarter, the Niners trailed early.  In the second quarter, the Rams struck first with kicker [[Jeff Wilkins]] getting a 24-yard field goal, while RB [[Steven Jackson]] got a 36-yard TD run.
