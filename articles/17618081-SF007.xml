'''ESET NOD32 Antivirus''', commonly known as '''NOD32''', is an [[antivirus software|antivirus]] [[software]] package made by the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] company [[ESET]]. ESET NOD32 Antivirus is sold in two editions, Home Edition and Business Edition.  The Business Edition packages add '''ESET Remote Administrator''' allowing for server deployment and management, mirroring of threat signature database updates and the ability to install on Microsoft [[Windows Server]] operating systems.

==History==
===NOD32===
NOD32 was created in the early 1990s when [[computer virus]]es were becoming increasingly prevalent.

Initially the program gained popularity with IT workers in Eastern European countries, as ESET was based in Slovakia. Though the program's abbreviation was originally pronounced as individual letters, recent worldwide use of the program has led to the more common single-word pronunciation, sounding like the English word ''nod''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=25585 |title=NOD32 - What does it mean? - Wilders Security Forums |publisher=Wilderssecurity.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reached its 6000th update to virus definitions on March 30, 2011.

The acronym NOD stands for ''Nemocnica na Okraji Disku'' (&quot;Hospital at the [[boot sector|end of the disk]]&quot;), a pun related to the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[medical drama]] series ''[[Hospital at the End of the City|Nemocnice na okraji mÄsta]]'' (''Hospital at the End of the City'').

===Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server===
On March 10, 2010 ESET released ESET Mail Security for [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], which contains both antimalware and [[antispam]] modules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eset.eu/press-ESET-launches-ESET-Mail-Security-for-Microsoft-Exchange-Server-and-ESET-Smart-Security-4_2 ESET launches ESET Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange Server and ESET Smart Security 4.2]&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports Microsoft Exchange 5.5, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010.

===Mobile Security===
ESET Mobile Security is the replacement for ESET Mobile Antivirus, which provided anti-malware and antispam functionality.  ESET Mobile Security contains all the features of the older product and adds new anti-theft features such as SIM locking and remote wipe as well as a security audit and a firewall.  Versions for [[Windows Mobile]] and a [[Symbian OS]] version are currently available for both home and enterprise users.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eset.com/support/news/7756 |title=ESET Mobile Security released |publisher=Eset.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=NEWS141 |title=ESET Mobile Security Business Edition for Windows Mobile and Symbian has been released |publisher=Eset.com |date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote Administrator===
ESET Remote Administrator is a central management console designed to allow network administrators to manage ESET software across a corporate network.

===Smart Security===
On November 5, 2007, ESET released an Internet security suite, '''ESET Smart Security''' version 3.0, to compete with other security suites by other companies such as [[McAfee]], [[Symantec]], [[AVG (software)|AVG]] and [[Kaspersky]].  ESET Smart Security incorporates anti-spam and a bidirectional firewall along with traditional anti-malware features of ESET NOD32 Antivirus.  

On March 2, 2009, ESET Smart Security version 4.0 was released, adding integration of ESET SysInspector; support for [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Windows Live Mail]]; a new self-defense module, an updated firewall module, ESET SysRescue and a wizard for creating bootable CD and USB flash drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=225559 |title=Full changelog |publisher=Wilderssecurity.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.eset.com/ess/changelog |title=Full Changelog |publisher=Beta.eset.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were initially compatibility problems between ESET Smart Security 4.0 and [[Windows Vista]] Service Pack 2 but these were remedied by an update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN2254 |title=Why does my Protection status icon turn red after installing Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008?

On August 17, 2010, ESET Smart Security version 4.2 was released with new features, enhancements and changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderssecurity.com/showthread.php?t=261199 |title=ESET Smart Security 4.2 changelog |publisher=Wilderssecurity.com |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SysInspector===
ESET SysInspector is a diagnostic tool which allows in-depth analysis of various aspects of the operating system, including running processes, registry content, startup items and network connections. Anti-Stealth Technology is used to discover hidden objects (rootkits) in the Master Boot Record, boot sector, registry entries, drivers, services and processes.  SysInspector Logs are standard XML files and can be submitted to IT experts for further analysis.  Two logs can be compared to find a set of items not common to both logs.  A log file can be saved as a service script for removing malicious objects from a computer.

===Other programs===
ESET has released free standalone removers for malware when they are widespread, such as [[Mebroot]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
