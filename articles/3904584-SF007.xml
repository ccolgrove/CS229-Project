'''Sam Fisher''' (born 10 July 1982) is an [[Australian rules football]]er for the [[St Kilda Football Club]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL).

==Early life==
Between the ages of 17 and 19 Fisher was a promising junior [[golf]]er, and played off a [[Handicap (golf)|handicap]] of 1.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He won the Riverland Tyre and Mag Boxing Day Classic 3 times, once with father Terry and twice with brother Ben. However, Fisher gave golf away for his AFL career.

Fisher began playing Australian rules in South Australia with West Adelaide, where he was first identified by AFL scouts at the age of 21.

==AFL career==
[[File:Sam fisher.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Fisher playing for St Kilda during the [[2007 AFL Season]]]]
[[File:25. Sam Fisher, St Kilda FC 01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Fisher at training prior to the [[2009 AFL Grand Final]] under the eye of Assistant Coach [[Stephen Silvagni]]]]
The versatile defender was selected as pick number 55 in the [[2003 AFL Draft]]. He made his debut in 2004 following some [[Australian rules football injuries|injuries]] to other key defenders

In 2005, Fisher took a major step in his career and improved dramatically to hold down a regular spot in the Saints' defence. He generally played on the third best forward of the opposition and began to provide terrific run from the half-back line. In 2006 he played every match and had up 421 disposals for the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players/S/Samuel_Fisher.html|title=AFL Tables:Samuel Fisher|work=AFL Tables: AFL-VFL match and player stats, records and lists|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His run and carry from the half-back line was critical to St Kilda's 6th-place finish and he finished third in the St Kilda best and fairest award.

===2007 season===
Injuries to other key defenders at the start of the 2007 season saw Fisher assume the mantle at full-back. It is a recurring theme in Fisher's career that he is picked as a result of injuries to other players. He performed strongly against the power forwards of the competition before injuring his hamstring in Round 4. He returned in Round 7 and was able to resume his attacking position across halfback in the second half of the year. He finished off the year strongly and was nominated in the backline in the squad of 40 players for the [[All-Australian]] Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;afl-os-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/Default.aspx?tabid=208&amp;newsId=50526|title=All-Australian squad announced|date=2009-09-25|work=AFL Official Site|publisher=Australian Football League|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher was ranked 8th in total marks, 17th in kicks per game and 2nd in marks per game.

Fisher signed a two-year contract extension in September 2007 until the end of 2010. [http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/footy/common/story_page/0,8033,22386162%255E19742,00.html]

===2008 season===
Fisher got more of a chance to play as a key position backman after a season-ending injury to [[Matt Maguire]] early in the season.

He played in St Kildaâs [[2008 NAB Cup]] winning side, the club's third pre-season cup win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/st-kilda-wins-nab-cup-by-five-points/2008/03/08/1204780132457.html?s_cid=rss_news|title=St Kilda wins NAB cup|work=The Age|date=March 8, 2008&lt;!-- - 9:47PM--&gt;|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeld-wen.com.au/pr/St-Kilda-2008/20080308.php|title=Saints are NAB Cup Champions in 2008|work=Jeld-Wen|date=8 March 2008|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher had a strong season, averaging  22 disposals and 8 marks a game at the end of the regular season. He was included in the [[All-Australian]] team on the half-back flank, the first time he had been awarded that honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=67727|title=St Kilda's All-Australian duo|work=afl.com.au â Alistair Hogg|date=10:49 AM Tue 16 September 2008|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Fisher also won the Saints [[Trevor Barker Award]] for the best and fairest player in the season. He polled 680 votes to finish ahead of [[Nick Riewoldt]] who polled 643 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afl.com.au/AFLHQ/AFLPlayersSayNoToDrugs/Display/tabid/13144/Default.aspx?newsId=68655|title=Sam Fisher wins 2008 St Kilda Best &amp; Fairest|work=afl.com.au â Alistair Hogg|date=12:46 PM Sun 05 October, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.smh.com.au/sport/fisher-voted-best-saint-20081004-4tzt.html|title=Fisher voted best Saint|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 4, 2008|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 season===
Fisher again showed a strong presence in St Kilda's home and away season, playing as either a loose backman or the centre halfback. He performed strongly in the first qualifying final against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] with a career high 42 disposals.

Fisher played in 21 of 22 matches in the 2009 home and away rounds in which St Kilda qualified in first position for the finals series, winning the clubâs [[2009 AFL season|third minor premiership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/seas/2009.html#lad|title=2009 Season Scores and Results â Ladder|work=AFL Tables|year=2009|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St Kilda qualified for the [[2009 AFL Grand Final]] after qualifying and preliminary finals wins. Fisher played in the grand final in which St Kilda were defeated by 12 points.

===2010 season===
Fisher played 24 games in 2010, including four finals matches. He was one of St Kilda's best players in the drawn Grand Final, and had 16 possessions in the Grand Final replay before injuring his hamstring before half time.

As of the end of the 2010 season, Fisher had played in 12 finals matches including three grand finals.
