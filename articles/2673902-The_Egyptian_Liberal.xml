'''El Qahira El Yawm''' ([[Arabic]]: '''Ø§ÙÙØ§ÙØ±Ø© Ø§ÙÙÙÙ''', [[English language|English]]: '''Cairo Today''') is a live [[television]] [[talk show]] from [[Greater Cairo|Cairo]] (studios at [[6th of October governrate|6th of October]]) and is one of the most popular shows in the [[Middle East]]. Hosted by [[Amr Adib]], a frequent guest stars like [[Raga'a el-Geddawi]] and [[Ezzat Abu Ouf]] (previously [[Nirvana Idriss]], [[Khairy Ramadan]] and [[Moufied Fawzi]]). It covers all aspects of life in Cairo everyday. It airs on the [[Al Yawm]] channel which is part of [[Orbit Satellite and Television Network]]. Amr Adib now co-hosts with Ezat Abou Ouf and others. The show regularly includes themed episodes, the themes. The show does not broadcast on Thursdays and Fridays.

The program's coverage of the football qualifying matches between Egypt and Algeria for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa caused a great deal of controversy. The allegations made by Amr Adib regarding the incompetence of the Sudanese security forces in protecting Egyptian fans who attended the final qualifying match in Khartoum, were partly to blame for a diplomatic crisis whereby the Sudanese Foreign Ministry summoned the Egyptian Ambassador in Khartoum to object to the campaign of slander and misinformation in the strongest terms.
