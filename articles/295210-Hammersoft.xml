'''Monmouth University''' is a private university located in [[West Long Branch, New Jersey]], [[United States]].

Founded in 1933 as Monmouth Junior College, it became Monmouth College in 1956, and later Monmouth University in 1995 after receiving its [[university charter|charter]].

There are about 4,300 full-time and 444 part-time [[undergraduate]] and 1,750 [[Graduate school|graduate]] students, as well as 251 full-time faculty members. About 73% of faculty members hold [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s or other [[terminal degree]]s in their field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersons.com/ugchannel/code/IDD.asp?orderLineNum=780923-2&amp;reprjid=12&amp;inunId=7550&amp;typeVC=InstVc&amp;sponsor=1#faculty College Close-Up&quot; Monmouth University - Faculty], accessed December 21, 2006. &quot;Approximately 73 percent of the full-time instructional faculty members have doctorates or other terminal degrees in their fields.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The university's student-to-faculty ratio is about 15:1. Because of the university's relatively small student population, class sizes are capped between 20 and 35 and no classes are taught by [[teaching assistant]]s. 44% of students live on-campus. Most of Monmouth's student body is drawn from the northeastern United States, although students from 29 states and 28 foreign countries add to the school's diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petersons.com/ugchannel/code/idd.asp?sponsor=36&amp;inunId=7550 College Close-up: Monmouth University], Peterson's College Planner&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Shadow Lawn, Cedar &amp; Norwood Avenues, Long Branch (Monmouth County, New Jersey) - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Wilson Hall, previously known as Shadow Lawn]]
Monmouth College was founded in 1933 as a [[junior college]]. On January 18, 1956, Monmouth received accreditation to grant four-year [[Bachelor's degree]]s, and in March 1995, it received its university charter from the [[New Jersey Commission on Higher Education]].&lt;ref name=MonmouthHistory&gt;{{cite web

==Campus==
The centerpiece of the Monmouth University campus is [[Shadow Lawn (New Jersey)|Wilson Hall]]. Originally, it was the site of the Shadow Lawn mansion, constructed in 1903 and housed 52 rooms. United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] stayed in the mansion during his campaign in summer of 1916. 

After Shadow Lawn was destroyed by a fire in 1927, the building that would become Wilson Hall was built as a residence for Mr &amp; Mrs. Hubert Templeton Parson. Mr. Parson was the former head of [[F.W. Woolworth Company]]. The building was designed by [[Horace Trumbauer]] and [[Julian Abele]]. Abele is regarded as the first professional African American architect.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/21458 Abele, Julian (1881 - 1950)] - ''Philadelphia Architects and Buildings'' biography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Twilight of Splendor: Chronicles of the Age of American Palaces'' (1975) by James T. Maher&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Hall became [[public domain (land)|municipal property]] during the [[Great Depression]] and until Monmouth University acquired ownership, it was home to Highland Manor Junior College, a private girls' school. Today, it is a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Some classrooms and the administrative offices are inside of the building. In 1980, Wilson Hall was used as [[Oliver &quot;Daddy&quot; Warbucks|Daddy Warbucks]]' mansion in the [[Annie (film)|film version of ''Annie'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monmouth.edu/wilsonhall/default.asp History of Wilson Hall], Monmouth University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of college athletic programs in New Jersey, USA#Division I}}
Monmouth's athletic teams are known as the Hawks. The school competes as a Division I school in the [[Northeast Conference]]. Monmouth fields the following sports at the Division I level: baseball, basketball (men's and women's), bowling (women's) cross country (men's and women's), field hockey, football, golf (men's and women's), indoor track (men's and women's), lacrosse (women's), soccer (men's and women's), softball, tennis (men's and women's), and track &amp; field (men's and women's). 

Monmouth University (then still Monmouth College), added [[American football|football]] to the school's ledger of sports teams in 1993. The team's first game was played on September 25 of that year. The first points in school history were scored on a bizarre defensive play by intercepting and returning a [[two-point conversion]].

A new Multipurpose Activity Center opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on September 16, 2009. The {{convert|153200|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Center currently serves as the primary indoor athletic structure. It houses a 4,100 seat competition arena; a 200-meter; six-lane indoor track; locker rooms; educational and conference space; ground-level bookstore; and fitness center. The new facility adjoins the [[William T. Boylan Gymnasium]] a 2,500-seat arena built in 1965.
 
Monmouth has been in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1996, 2001, 2004, and 2006. Monmouth won their first NCAA men's basketball [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|tournament game]] in 2006 when they beat [[Hampton University]] in that year's [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Play-In Game|play-in game]]. It was the first time a [[Northeast Conference]] school won a game in the NCAA tournament since 1983 when [[Robert Morris University]] won in the opening round. Monmouth's men and women's soccer teams as well as baseball and women's lacrosse and men's golf team have also reached the NCAA tournament.  The Monmouth Men's Soccer team is the only sport on campus to ever advance to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament.  The men's soccer team also hosted two first round NCAA Tournament games on The Great Lawn, in 2009 and 2010. Monmouth's men's soccer team has even been ranked as one of the top teams in the country. In September 2010, Monmouth attained the #4 spot on the NSCAA/HendrickCars.com National Rankings and has been ranked in the national top 25 every single week for the past two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gomuhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=14300&amp;ATCLID=204998407|title=MENâS SOCCER MOVES UP ONE SPOT TO FOURTH IN NSCAA POLL|publisher=Monmouth University|date=September 21, 2010|accessdate=October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
