==Ratings==
Almost all of Disney's shows are rated G and usually feature low level violence. When there is a DCOM, the ratings sometimes go up to PG, being the cause of violence, action and sci-fi themes throughout the showing of the movie.
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Oflcg.png|The G rating is used for most of the sitcoms on the channel.
Image:Oflcpg.png|The PG rating is used for some DCOM's on the channel.
Image:Oflcm.png|The M rating is used very rarely on Disney Channel, but has been used for some movies.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
