[[Toby Gerhart]] rushed for 121 yards and two touchdowns, and redshirt freshman quarterback Andrew Luck made his collegiate debut by throwing for 193 yards and a touchdown pass to Chris Owusu as Stanford defeated Washington State in Pullman. The Cardinal dominated the first half, but as the second half began, the Cougars took the early momentum, driving 80 yards and scoring on a 5-yard pass from Kevin Lopina to Jared Karstetter. However, Owusu answered immediately for the Cardinal with an 85-yard kickoff return for a touchdown to keep the game out of reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292480265|title=Frosh Luck leads Stanford past Washington State|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
