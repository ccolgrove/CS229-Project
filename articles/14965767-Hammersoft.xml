====Winslow Suspended====
On October 21, the Browns suspended TE Kellen Winslow II for one game because of comments made after the Browns' loss to the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]].

Savage announce that Winslow was being suspended for the team's game against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jaguars]], without pay, for &quot;conduct detrimental to the club.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/17773602/detail.html Winslow Suspended] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winslow planned to appeal the suspension, but the hearing was not scheduled until October 28, two days after the Jaguars game.

Hoping to rebound from their season-sweeping loss to the Ravens, the Browns stayed at home for a Week 10 Thursday night game against the [[Denver Broncos]].  In the first quarter, Cleveland trailed early as Broncos RB [[Ryan Torain]] got a 1-yard TD run.  The Browns would respond as QB [[Brady Quinn]], making his first career start, completed a 5-yard TD pass to TE [[Kellen Winslow II|Kellen Winslow]].  In the second quarter, Cleveland took the lead as kicker [[Phil Dawson]] made a 24-yard field goal, along with Quinn hooking up with Winslow again on a 16-yard TD pass.  Denver would answer with kicker [[Matt Prater]] making a 35-yard field goal.  The Browns would close out the half with Dawson making a 52-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, Cleveland added onto its lead as Dawson got a 33-yard field goal.  The Broncos would reply with Prater making a 30-yard field.

Trying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Browns flew to [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] for a Week 11 MNF duel with the [[Buffalo Bills]].  In the first quarter, Cleveland took advantage of early Bills miscues as kicker [[Phil Dawson]] kicked two field goals.  In the second quarter, the Browns increased their lead as Josh Cribbs scored a 2-yard TD run.  Buffalo responded with QB [[Trent Edwards]] completing an 18-yard TD pass to RB [[Marshawn Lynch]], along with kicker [[Rian Lindell]] getting a 26-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, Cleveland answered with Dawson getting a 43-yard field goal.  The Bills would reply with Lindell making a 31-yard field goal.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''You are easily the worst GM in the NFL. [[Rob Chudzinski|Chud]], [[Romeo Crennel|Crennel]] and [[Mel Tucker|Tucker]] should NOT have jobs. How the hell do you play prevent defense the entire game? How do you NOT use [[Jerome Harrison]] more? Why the hell would you throw the ball with 6&amp;nbsp;minutes left? This is officially a regime that is worse than [[Butch Davis]]'. By the way, just like last week â this email was written while the Browns still had the lead.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://deadspin.com/5093632/browns-gm-phil-savage-responds-to-email-hecklers-swiftly-but-not-very-politely Browns' GM Phil Savage Responds To Email Hecklers Swiftly, But Not Very Politely (UPDATE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off five straight losses without a touchdown on offense, the Cleveland Browns closed out the regular season at [[Heinz Field]] in a Week 17 AFC North rematch with their hated rival, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The Steelers put up two touchdowns in the second quarter, a 34&amp;nbsp;yard run by RB [[Willie Parker]] and an 8&amp;nbsp;yard scramble by QB [[Byron Leftwich]]. The Steelers added 17 points in the second half (22-yard [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] field goal, 3-yard [[Gary Russell (American football)|Gary Russell]] touchdown run, and a 32-yard interception TD return by [[Tyrone Carter]]), but they were unnecessary as the Browns were incapable of scoring at all, marking six straight games in which the offense couldn't score a touchdown (an NFL record 24 quarters). Again, the only good news for the Browns was RB [[Jamal Lewis]], who topped 1,000 rushing yards this season.  He would become the first Browns running back since [[Mike Pruitt]] in 1980 &amp; 1981 to have back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons.
