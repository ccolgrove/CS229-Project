'''Microsoft Max''' was the codename for a prototype [[application software|software application]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. It is an application for creating virtual [[photograph album]]s and distributing them online in a [[peer-to-peer]] fashion. Features of the Max technology demo included the ability to [[annotation|annotate]] photos and arrange them in custom layouts, slideshows and a &quot;3D Mantle View&quot;. 

The longer-term goal of Max was to facilitate peer-to-peer communications of many kinds of files, not just photos. On November 1, 2006, [[Microsoft]] announced that the Max project was being discontinued, but hinted that some of the functionality may be integrated into other [[Windows Live]] applications or services in the future.

The product was named ''Max'' after a dog belonging to [[Deana Fuller]], one of the project team members.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dancre/archive/2005/10/10/479184.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In a news posting at LiveSide, it was reported that Microsoft Max was a preview of a larger project codenamed ''Project M'', which is to be a graphical front end to sharing of all kinds of files, not just pictures, as well as storage and management of the shared files. Built using [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]], it can be used manage data from various data sources including web, file system, portable devices, e-mail stores as well as share data between disparate data sources. However, it was not made clear whether the project, which was being pursued as a part of [[Windows Live]] initiative would reach the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2006/07/11/Windows-Live-Storage_3A00_-Live-Drive_2C00_-Sky-Drive_2C00_-SDrive_2C00_-Project-M_3F00_.aspx | title = Windows Live Storage: Live Drive, Sky Drive, SDrive, Project M? | author = Kip Kniskern | publisher = LiveSide | accessdate = 2007-06-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070601190129/http://www.liveside.net/blogs/main/archive/2006/07/11/Windows-Live-Storage_3A00_-Live-Drive_2C00_-Sky-Drive_2C00_-SDrive_2C00_-Project-M_3F00_.aspx |archivedate = 2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
