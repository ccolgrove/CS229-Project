'''Knoppix STD''' (Security Tools Distribution) is a [[Live CD]] [[Linux distribution]] based on [[Knoppix]] that focused on [[computer security]] tools. It included [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] licensed tools in the following categories: [[authentication]], [[password cracking]], [[encryption]], [[computer forensics|forensics]], [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]], [[Honeypot (computing)|honeypot]]s, [[intrusion detection system]], [[network utilities]], [[Penetration (telecommunications)|penetration]], [[packet sniffer]]s, [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[vulnerability assessment]] and [[wireless network]]ing. Knoppix STD version 0.1 was published January 24, 2004, on Knoppix 3.2, and therefore stagnated, lacking updated drivers and packages.  A release date for version 0.2 has not yet been announced. A list of tools is available on the official website.[http://s-t-d.org/tools.html]
