{{Canadian politics}}

The '''Chief Justice of Canada''', like the eight [[puisne Justice]]s of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], is appointed by the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] ([[Governor General of Canada]] on the advice of the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]). All nine are chosen from either sitting judges or barristers who have at least ten years' standing at the bar of a province or territory. The Chief Justice is sworn as a member of the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] prior to taking the oath of office as Chief Justice.

==Judicial Council==
The Chief Justice chairs the [[Canadian Judicial Council]], which is composed of all chief justices and associate chief justices of superior courts in Canada. This body, established by the [[Judges Act (Canada)|Judges Act]], organizes seminars for federally appointed judges, coordinates the discussion of issues of concern to the judiciary, and conducts inquiries, either on public complaint or at the request of the federal Minister of Justice or a provincial attorney general, into the conduct of any federally appointed judge.

==Assistant viceroy==
The Letters Patent of 1947 respecting the Office of [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] provide that, should the Governor General die, become incapacitated, or be absent from the country for a period of more than one month, the Chief Justice or, if that office is vacant, the Senior Puisne Justice, of the Supreme Court would become the [[Administrator of the Government|Administrator of Canada]] and exercise all the powers and duties of the Governor General. This has happened twice in the past, with Chief Justices [[Robert Taschereau]] and Sir [[Lyman Poore Duff]] acting as Governor General for brief periods following the death of a sitting Governor General. In 2005, Chief Justice [[Beverley McLachlin]] was Administrator of Canada when then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], the Right Honourable [[Adrienne Clarkson]], was hospitalized when she had a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]] installed.

The Chief Justice and the other Justices of the Court serve as [[Deputy of the Governor General of Canada|deputies of the Governor General]] for the purpose of giving [[Royal Assent]] to bills passed by [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]], signing official documents or receiving credentials of newly appointed [[High Commissioner|high commissioner]]s and [[ambassador]]s.

==Other duties==
The Chief Justice also sits on the advisory council of Canada's highest civilian order, the [[Order of Canada]]. In practice however, the Chief Justice abstains from voting on a candidate's [[Removal from the Order of Canada|removal from the order]], presumably because this process has so far only applied to individuals convicted in a lower court of a criminal offence, and could create a conflict of interest for the Chief Justice if that individual appealed their conviction to the Supreme Court.

Under the [[Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act]], each province has a three-person commission responsible for modifying that province's federal [[electoral district (Canada)|ridings]]. The chair of each such commission is appointed by the chief justice of that province; if no appointment is made by the provincial chief justice, the responsibility falls to the Chief Justice of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/E-3/index.html|title=Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act|accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Chief Justice==
The current Chief Justice is The Right Honourable [[Beverley McLachlin]], [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC]], the first woman to hold this position. She was appointed in 2000 and was previously a puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Chief Justice of the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]], and a Justice on the British Columbia Court of Appeal. A graduate of the [[University of Alberta]] [[University of Alberta Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]],  she has also practised law with various firms and taught law at the [[University of British Columbia]]. She was born in [[Pincher Creek, Alberta]], in 1943.
