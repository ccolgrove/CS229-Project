'''Rockne Lee Brubaker, II'''&lt;ref name=0102sectmen/&gt; (born June 21, 1986) is an [[United States|American]] [[Pair skating|pair skater]]. With former partner [[Keauna McLaughlin]], he is the 2008 &amp; 2009 [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships|U.S. National Champion]], the 2010 [[Four Continents Championships|Four Continents silver medalist]], and the [[2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Junior Champion]]. With current partner [[Mary Beth Marley]], he is the 2011 U.S. national pewter medalist. 

==Personal life==
Rockne Brubaker Jr was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. His younger brother Collin Brubaker is a competitive [[ice dancer]].&lt;ref name=algon010711/&gt; He was named after his father, Rockne Brubaker Sr., who had been named after [[Knute Rockne]]. 

Brubaker graduated from [[Harry D. Jacobs High School]] in [[Algonquin, Illinois]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. He is a student at the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] majoring in business administration and sports marketing.&lt;ref name=gs042009/&gt;

==Career==
=== Early years ===
Rockne Brubaker began skating at the age of five or six.&lt;ref name=usoc011410/&gt;&lt;ref name=st010307/&gt; He originally competed as a [[single skater]], reaching the level of novice. He competed as a [[pair skater]] at the same time and eventually gave up singles to focus on pairs around age 12.&lt;ref name=usoc011410/&gt; At 17, he left Chicago and moved to Colorado Springs to train with top pairs coach [[Dalilah Sappenfield]].&lt;ref name=usoc011410/&gt;

With partner Stephanie Freitag, he placed 5th at the novice level at the 2001â2002 season Midwestern Sectional Championships.&lt;ref name=0102sectpairs/&gt;

In September 2003, Brubaker began skating with Mariel Miller, with whom he competed on the junior level.&lt;ref name=st050424/&gt; They won bronze medals at the [[2004-2005 ISU Junior Grand Prix|2004â2005 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final]] and the [[2005-2006 ISU Junior Grand Prix|2005â2006 ISU Junior Grand Prix Final]]. They won the junior title at the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]]. While originally intending to compete at the senior level at the [[2006 United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Championships]], Miller &amp; Brubaker announced their split in December 2005 due to a lack of height difference that could lead to injury.&lt;ref name=st010307/&gt; They were coached by Dalilah Sappenfield and [[Tom Zakrajsek]].

=== Partnership with McLaughlin ===
Sappenfield teamed up Brubaker with [[Keauna McLaughlin]] in May 2006.&lt;ref name=st010307/&gt; They were coached by Sappenfield and Lei Ina McLaughlin in Colorado Springs.&lt;ref name=gs042009/&gt; The pair went undefeated in their first competitive season together (2006â2007). In that season, McLaughlin and Brubaker competed on the [[2006-2007 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] circuit and won both their events and the Junior Grand Prix Final. They went on to win the junior title at both the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]] and the [[2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Junior Championships]]. McLaughlin and Brubaker were the fourth American pair team in history to win the World Junior title.&lt;ref name=usfs07wj/&gt; Because of the age difference between McLaughlin and Brubaker, this was their only junior-age-eligible season.

McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2007â2008 season on the [[2007-2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] circuit at the [[2007 Cup of China]], where they won the silver medal. They won a second silver medal at the [[2007 NHK Trophy]]. Their success at these two competitions qualified them for the [[2007â2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2007â2008 Grand Prix Final]], but they withdrew after the short program due to an injury to Brubaker.

Later that season, they competed at the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]] and won the senior national title, becoming the first U.S. pairs team in 51 years to win consecutive junior and senior national titles.&lt;ref name=believe/&gt; Despite winning the U.S. title, McLaughlin and Brubaker were not assigned to the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championship]] or [[2008 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championship]] team due to ISU age restrictions. McLaughlin was too young for senior ISU championships and Brubaker was too old for the World Junior Championships. McLaughlin and Brubaker's win, combined with the wins of [[Jessica Rose Paetsch]] &amp; [[Jon Nuss]] on the junior level, and [[Brynn Carman]] &amp; [[Christopher Knierim]] on the novice level, gave their coach Dalilah Sappenfield a sweep of national pair champions for 2008, an accomplishment which led to Sappenfield being named Coach of the Year.&lt;ref name=coty/&gt;

McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2008â2009 season at the [[2008 Skate America]], where they won the silver medal. A week later they competed at the [[2008 Skate Canada International]], where they won the bronze medal. At the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]], McLaughlin and Brubaker successfully defended their national title, which resulted in them being selected to compete at the [[2009 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2009 Four Continents]] and the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 Worlds]]. They placed 5th at Four Continents and 11th at the World Championships.

In April 2009, Brubaker had [[hernia]] surgery to repair muscle tears in his lower abdomen.&lt;ref name=surgery0904/&gt;

In May 2009, McLaughlin and Brubaker changed coaches to [[John Nicks]]&lt;ref name=cctonicks/&gt; and relocated to California.&lt;ref name=vanityfair/&gt;

McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2009â2010 season at the [[2009 Cup of Russia]], where they won the bronze medal. They continued their season at the [[2009 Skate America]], where they placed 4th. As the top American pair team on the international circuit, McLaughlin and Brubaker entered the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Championships]] as the favorites to win their third consecutive national title and secure one of the two pair skating berths on the U.S. Olympic team. Despite several days of strong practices, they delivered an uncharacteristically rough short program, including falls on a triple salchow and a freak fall on a death spiral, leaving them in 7th place.&lt;ref name=vanityfair/&gt; The pair was able to move up to 5th place after the long program but it was not enough to win a place on the Olympic team.&lt;ref name=sp011710/&gt;

Determined to rebound from their national result, McLaughlin and Brubaker competed at the [[2010 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2010 Four Continents]] less than ten days later. There, they recorded a personal best score in the short program and ultimately won the silver medal.  

In June 2010, McLaughlin and Brubaker announced the end of their partnership.&lt;ref name=&quot;split&quot;/&gt;

=== Partnership with Marley ===
Brubaker was uncertain whether to continue skating competitively but his coach arranged some tryouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;icenetworkoct&quot;/&gt; In August, he had a two-day tryout with [[Mary Beth Marley]] and he was impressed enough to cancel his other tryouts,&lt;ref name=ct012211/&gt; although she had no pairs experience.&lt;ref name=algon010711/&gt; Marley relocated to Aliso Viejo, California,&lt;ref name=ct012211/&gt; and they began training together in earnest in September with coach John Nicks.&lt;ref name=algon010711/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newpartner&quot;/&gt; Their first international competition was the Nesquik Cup in [[ToruÅ]], [[Poland]], where they earned the minimum technical scores required to compete at an [[ISU Figure Skating Championships|ISU Championship]]. They placed fourth at the [[2011 United States Figure Skating Championships|2011 U.S. Nationals]] and were named as alternates for [[2011 Four Continents Championships|Four Continents]]. They were assigned to the event after the injury-induced withdrawal of [[Caydee Denney]] and [[Jeremy Barrett (figure skater)|Jeremy Barrett]].&lt;ref name=ct21311/&gt; [[Jenni Meno]] and [[Todd Sand]] became their main coaches for the 2011-12 season after Nicks decided to retire from pairs coaching.&lt;ref name=in1021/&gt;
