==Early life==
Sewell was born in [[Twickenham]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]] in [[South West (London sub region)|South West London]], the son of William, an Australian animator, and Jo Sewell, a Welsh artist and waitress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/11/Rufus-Sewell.html Rufus Sewell Biography (1967-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800021137/bio Rufus Sewell Biography - Yahoo! Movies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked on the &quot;[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]&quot; segment of animation for [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' film. His parents divorced when Sewell was five and his mother worked to support her two sons. His father died when Sewell was 10.  By his own admission, Sewell was a difficult teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1967439,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Dark star | first=Emine | last=Saner | date=8 December 2006 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Sewell was educated at [[Orleans Park School]], a state comprehensive school in Twickenham, which he left in 1984, followed by [[West Thames College]], where a drama teacher sent him to audition for drama school. He later enrolled at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London.

==Career==
After graduating, Sewell was set up with an agent by [[Judi Dench]] who had directed him in a play while at the Central School of Speech and Drama. His breakthrough year was in 1993, in which he starred in the [[BBC]] serial of [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Middlemarch (1994 TV serial)|Middlemarch]]'' and on stage in Tom Stoppard's play ''[[Arcadia (play)|Arcadia]]'' at [[Royal National Theatre|The Royal National Theatre]] (Lyttelton). His film work includes 1995's ''[[Cold Comfort Farm (film)|Cold Comfort Farm]]'', directed by [[John Schlesinger]], the lead role of John Murdoch in the science fiction film ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'' in 1998, ''[[Amazing Grace (2006 film)|Amazing Grace]]'', ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]'' and [[Nancy Meyers]]' romantic comedy ''[[The Holiday]]''. ''Amazing Grace'' deals with [[William Wilberforce]]'s political fight to abolish slavery in Britain, with Sewell playing Wilberforce's co-campaigner [[Thomas Clarkson]]. Sewell is known for his villainous roles, such as those in ''[[A Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zorro]]'', ''[[Bless the Child]]'', ''[[Helen of Troy (TV miniseries)|Helen of Troy]]'' and ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]''. He spoke of his unhappiness about this, saying that &quot;[I] don't want to play a baddie again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Tom.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/12/08/bfrufus08.xml &quot;I really don't want to play a baddie again.&quot;] ''The Telegraph''. 8 December 2006. Accessed 26 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Everyone has their thing they have to get around&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rufus Sewell: Downloading Nancy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Rufus+Sewell%3A+Downloading+Nancy/ |title = Rufus Sewell: Downloading Nancy |publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]] |date = 4 June 2009 |accessdate = 4 June 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; notes Sewell. &quot;With me, it's like okay, how can I make this upper class bad guy in the 19th century different and interesting?&quot;

In 2008 Sewell appeared in the [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[John Adams (TV miniseries)|John Adams]]'' as [[Alexander Hamilton]].
He received critical praise for his portrayal of &quot;merry monarch&quot; [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the BBC's ''[[Charles II: The Power and The Passion]]''. The series' cast included [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Helen McCrory]], [[Rupert Graves]] and [[Shirley Henderson]] and spanned the life of the king from his last days in exile to his death. He co-starred in the controversial film ''[[Downloading Nancy]]'', which hit screens on 5 June 2009. It faced a rocky road to movie theatres. At the Sundance Film Festival in 2008, audiences walked out of the screening, and as of summer 2008, any theatrical release was still uncertain. Despite the controversy, Sewell continues to staunchly support the film. &quot;It's a film I'm very proud of, whether you consider that it fails or succeeds, whether you like it or don't like it. I'm proud to be in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rufus Sewell: Downloading Nancy&quot;/&gt;

Although best known for his work in costume dramas, Sewell prefers &quot;[[cravat]]-less&quot; roles in modern pieces, such as the role of [[Petruchio]] in the BBC's 2005 version of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''. This was shown as part of the ''[[ShakespeaRe-Told]]'' season, and the role earned him a Best Actor nomination at the 2006 [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Television Awards]]. In this modern retelling of the story, the action moves from 17th Century Padua, Italy to 21st Century London. This production marked the fourth time that Sewell had acted in a work based on a Shakespeare play since becoming a professional actor: he previously portrayed [[Henry Hotspur Percy|Hotspur]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' in 1995, [[Fortinbras]] in ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' in 1996 and the title role in ''[[Macbeth]]'' in 1999. The role also reunited him with his ''Charles II'' co-star Shirley Henderson.

He appeared in the premiere and first run of Tom Stoppard's latest play ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (play)|Rock 'n' Roll]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from June to July 2006 and at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] from July until November 2006. The play was a critical and commercial success, playing to full houses and collecting several awards and nominations, including wins for Sewell in the Best Actor category at [[Evening Standard Award|The ''Evening Standard'' Awards]], [[Critics' Circle Theatre Award|The Critics' Circle Awards]] and [[Laurence Olivier Award|The Olivier Awards]].

He has recorded eleven of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] books on 36 CDs for Collins. He continues to work in film, television and theatre, he played the lead role Dr Jacob Hood in the CBS TV series ''[[Eleventh Hour (U.S. TV series)|Eleventh Hour]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rufus Sewell biography.&quot;/&gt;  He finished filming in November 2009 for a miniseries ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'', which was shown on TV in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3idbeede94114aaf4247c5aebcf4ec8fb6 &quot;Three sign on for 'Pillars of the Earth'&quot;], ''The Hollywood Reporter'', 8 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, he played the Italian detective [[Aurelio Zen]], based on the bestselling novels by [[Michael Dibdin]] for the BBC One drama series ''[[Zen (BBC TV Series)|Zen]]''. The three episodes were filmed in Rome and shown on [[BBC One]] in early January 2011.  The series was cancelled by the BBC after just one season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/02_february/18/zen.shtml Rufus Sewell confirmed to play Aurelio Zen for BBC One]&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a small part in the film ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'', which also starred [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Johnny Depp]] and was released in cinemas in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accidentalsexiness.com/2010/02/24/rufus-sewell-joins-angelina-jolie-in-paris/ Rufus Sewell joins Angelina Jolie in Paris]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, it was announced that he will play the lead vampire, Adam, in the forthcoming film ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (film)| Vampire Hunter]],''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showblitz.com/2011/04/rufus-sewell-is-top-baddie-in-vampire-hunter.html]&lt;/ref&gt; which is currently being filmed in New Orleans ''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyblam.com/news/2011/03/30/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-set-pics-offer-a-glimpse-of-benjamin-walker-dominic-c]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

His first wife was Australian fashion journalist Yasmin Abdallah; they married in 1999 and divorced a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Chloe. &quot;Cut and Thrust&quot;, ''Telegraph'' magazine, October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He and second wife, Amy Gardner, whom he married in 2004, have a son, William Douglas Sewell.
