'''Yuko Kavaguti''' (also: '''Kawaguchi''', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo|''Kawaguchi YÅ«ko''|å·å£ æ å­}}, {{lang-ru|Ð®ÐºÐ¾ ÐÐ°Ð²Ð°Ð³ÑÑÐ¸}}, born November 20, 1981 in [[Funabashi, Chiba]], [[Japan]]) is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-[[Russians|Russian]] [[Pair skating|pair skater]], who has represented Japan, the USA, and Russia in international competition. She competes with [[Alexander Smirnov (figure skater)|Alexander Smirnov]], representing Russia. They are the 2010 [[European Figure Skating Championships|European champions]], 2009 and 2010 [[World Figure Skating Championships|World bronze medalists]], and 2008-2010 [[Russian Figure Skating Championships|Russian champions]]. They have won a total of four European medals. On the Grand Prix series, they have won eleven medals, including gold medals at [[2008 Skate Canada International]], [[2010 Cup of Russia]], [[2011 Cup of China]] and [[2011 NHK Trophy]].

== Personal life ==
In addition to her native Japanese, she is also fluent in Russian and English.&lt;ref name=goldenskate&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2007/101507.shtml | title = Russian pair team ready for breakthrough | last = Flade | first = Tatjana |date = October 15, 2007 | work = GoldenSkate.com | accessdate = September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003, she studied international relations at [[St. Petersburg State University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://my.opera.com/nastavnev/blog/&lt;/ref&gt; completing her degree in June 2007.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; In December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1;992998|title=Ukaz â1832|date=2008-12-23|work=Ukaz signed by President Dmitry Medvedev|publisher=[[Presidential Administration of Russia]]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; she acquired Russian citizenship to qualify for a spot on that nation's Olympic team. Japan does not allow [[dual nationality]], so she was obliged to give up her Japanese citizenship and can only reapply to get it back after ten years.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.47news.jp/CN/200901/CN2009011701000725.html å·å£ãã­ã·ã¢å½ç±ãåå¾  ãã£ã®ã¥ã¢ã§äºè¼ªç®æã], 47NEWS, 2009/01/17&lt;/ref&gt; When her family name was transliterated from Japanese to Russian and then into Latin characters, &quot;Kawaguchi&quot; became &quot;Kavaguti&quot;.

== Early career ==
Kavaguti began skating at the age of five because her mother was a fan of ice dancing.&lt;ref name=gs021303&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2002/021303.shtml | title = Kawaguchi and Markhuntsov Give Japan a Competitive Pairs Team | first = Barry | last = Mittan |date = February 13, 2003 | work = GoldenSkate | accessdate = April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She originally competed as a singles skater for Japan, then switched to pairs after being inspired by the Russian pair skater [[Elena Berezhnaya]] at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano]], Japan.&lt;ref name=reuters091020&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/japan/idUSLR6671420091020?sp=true | title = Kawaguchi braves taunts to skate for Russia | last = Fyodorov | first = Gennady |date = October 20, 2009 | work = [[Reuters]] | accessdate = 2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kavaguti decided to write to her coach [[Tamara Moskvina]] and due to Kavaguti's persistence, the renowned coach eventually agreed to train her.&lt;ref name=reuters091020/&gt; Kavaguti moved to [[Hackensack]], [[New Jersey]] where Moskvina was coaching at the time.&lt;ref name=reuters091020/&gt;

In March 1999, Kavaguti teamed up with [[Alexander Markuntsov]] to compete for Japan.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; They were the first Japanese pair team to medal at an [[International_Skating_Union#ISU_Championships|ISU championships]] when they took silver at the [[2001 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; Kavaguti and Markuntsov split in 2003.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; Kavaguti said, &quot;We had a good working relationship but it was very difficult for Alexander to acquire Japanese citizenship, thus we couldn't represent Japan in the Olympics so after a while we decided to break up.&quot;&lt;ref name=reuters091020/&gt; 

In 2003, Kawaguchi followed her coach as Moskvina moved back to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] where she enrolled at a university in addition to skating.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; She began skating with the American skater Josh Martin but in May 2004, he was hit by a car as he rollerbladed to practice, suffering cuts and a broken elbow, and decided to return to the U.S.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; Kawaguchi then skated with another American, Devin Patrick. &quot;He taught me the quad throw (salchow). He did really good throws, but some of the other elements didn't work as well,&quot; Kawaguchi stated.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; They competed at the Japanese championships and [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], placing 15th, and decided to go their separate ways. &quot;He wanted to live in the U.S., but I didn't want to leave Tamara Nikolaevna (Moskvina). I just couldn't give up my studies, leave my coach, and go to America.&quot;&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; She worried that she might not find another partner, but was determined to at least complete her degree.&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt;

== Partnership with Alexander Smirnov ==
[[Image:Yuko KAWAGUCHI Alexander SMIRNOV Tamara Moskvina-1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Kavaguti and Smirnov with coach [[Tamara Moskvina]]]]

Kavaguti teamed up with [[Alexander Smirnov (figure skater)|Alexander Smirnov]] to compete for Russia in May 2006.&lt;ref name =st080424&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skatetoday.com/2008/04/24/a-russo-japanese-pair/ | title = A Russo-Japanese Pair | last = Mittan | first = Barry | date = April 24, 2008 | publisher = SkateToday | accessdate = July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted to skate for another country due to the difficulty in finding a good partner.&lt;ref name=reuters091020/&gt; Smirnov said, &quot;We often trained at the same rink and I could see how hard she works. I thought I was a hard worker but after watching her I was really amazed by her work level.&quot;&lt;ref name=reuters091020/&gt; They train at the [[Yubileyny Sports Palace]] in Saint Petersburg, Russia. They initially worked with [[Ludmila Velikova and Nikolai Velikov|Nikolai Velikov]] but Kavaguti had been training with [[Tamara Moskvina]] since 1998 and preferred to stay with her.&lt;ref name =st080424/&gt; They began training with Moskvina in August 2006.

=== 2006â2007 season ===
	
Their first Grand Prix competition was the [[2006 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]] where they won the bronze medal. They also competed at the [[2006 Coupe Internationale de Nice|Coupe de Nice]] in France and won gold. Kavaguti dislocated her shoulder after a fall on a quad throw in 2006 and occasionally suffered recurring problems for several years after.&lt;ref name=element&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rg.ru/2010/03/31/tamara-poln.html | title = Ð­Ð»ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ñ Ð½ÐµÐ¾Ð¶Ð¸Ð´Ð°Ð½Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸ | last = ÐÐ¾Ð·Ð¸Ð½Ð° | first = ÐÐ½Ð½Ð° |publisher = rg.ru | date = 31 March 2010 | accessdate = 14 May 2010 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During practice on December 25, 2006, Kavaguti broke her ankle,&lt;ref name=goldenskate/&gt; forcing the couple to withdraw from the 2007 Russian Championship and the 2007 European Championship. They competed at the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Championships]] in Tokyo, Japan. This was their first worlds as a pair. They came in 4th after the short program, and placed 10th in the long program and 9th overall.

=== 2007â2008 season ===

Kavaguti and Smirnov competed in the [[2007 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]] where they once again took the bronze medal. They won a bronze medal at [[2007 Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]]. At the [[2007 Coupe Internationale de Nice|Cup de Nice]] they place 1st in both the short and long program and won the gold for the second year in a row. At their first [[2007â2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] they placed 6th in the short program after having a two point deduction for an illegal element. In the finals they got a one point deduction for a fall on the throw quad salchow and came in 5th place overall. 

The pair won their first [[2008 Russian Figure Skating Championships|Russian Championship]] in 2008 by winning the short and long program. They won by 10.43 points over [[Maria Mukhortova]] and [[Maxim Trankov]] in spite of a three point deduction for stopping the program due to injury. Kavaguti fell and dislocated her shoulder after a throw quadruple salchow. She attempted to continue the program despite the pain, however Smirnov, seeing that she had trouble raising her arm, stopped the program. After the two-minute pause permitted by the rules, the pair completed the program and won their first national title, having completed two triple toeloops, a triple twist, and a throw triple loop.&lt;ref name=08rusnats&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2007/rn_3.shtml | title = 2008 Russian Nationals - Figure Skating Highlights - Free Dance, Pairs Long, and Men's Long | last = Kondakova  | first = Anna  |publisher = goldenskate.com | date = 7 January 2008 | accessdate = 24 May 2010 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first European Championships were held in Zagreb, Croatia in January 2008. During the long program they landed the throw quad Salchow but a fall on a triple jump and planned double Axel that was turned into a single was only enough for a bronze medal. The 2008 World Championship was held in Gothenburg, Sweden. Kavaguti and Smirnov received a personal best short program score of 71.42 which placed them in third place. They landed a throw quad Salchow and several elements received a level four but they dropped to fourth place only 1.45 points out of third.

=== 2008â2009 season ===

Kavaguti and Smirnov once again won their third gold at the [[2008 Coupe Internationale de Nice|Coupe de Nice]]. At [[2008 Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]] they won their first international competition at an ISU Grand Prix competition. They then competed at the [[2008 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]] where they were 2nd after the short program and 1st in the free skate. They finished 2nd overall. The pair went their 2nd [[2008â2009 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] where they placed 6th in the short program and 5th in the free skate. They once again finished in 5th place. 

Kavaguti and Smirnov defended their title at the [[2009 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2009 Russian National Championships]]. In spite of being in second place going into the free skate they easily beat the second place team of Mukhortova and Trankov by over 15 points.  At the [[2009 European Figure Skating Championships|2009 European Championship]] the pair who was in 3rd place after the short improved on last yearâs placement with a silver medal. 

At the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]] in Los Angeles, California, Kavaguti and Smirnov were in second place after the short program. In the free skate Kavaguti fell hard on her cheek after a throw quad salchow, she got up seconds later and the pair continued to skate. They earned their first world bronze medal losing the silver to [[Zhang Dan|Dan Zhang]] and [[Zhang Hao|Hao Zhang]] by 0.13.
They were selected to compete on behalf of Russia in the ISUâs first ever [[ISU World Team Trophy in Figure Skating|World Team Trophy]] in Japan. The pair was 2nd in the short program and free skate and finished 2nd overall. The Russian team finished in 5th place.

=== 2009â2010 season ===
[[Image:Kawaguchi and Smirnov at the 2010 Olympics.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Kawaguchi and Smirnov perform their short program at the 2010 Olympics]]

Kavaguti and Smirnov were chosen to compete at the [[2009 NHK Trophy|NHK Trophy]] in Japan. After the short program they were in 1st place ahead of [[Pang Qing|Qing Pang]] and [[Tong Jian|Jian Tong]]. In the free skate Kavaguti once again fell on the quad throw once again dislocating her shoulder. The program was stopped for a two minute medical break and the pair decided to continue. Even though they had a three point deduction for the fall and âInterruption in Excessâ because of the medical break, they won the silver. 

At the [[2009 Rostelecom Cup|Cup of Russia]] they got 2nd place in the short program and free skate, winning the silver medal behind Pang and Tong. They once again scored enough points in the Grand Prix series to make it to the [[2009â2010 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Finals]] where they placed 6th in short program and 5th in the free skate. For the third year in a row they won 5th place. 

[[Image:Kawaguchi and Smirnov at the 2010 Olympics (3).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Kawaguchi and Smirnov perform their long program at the 2010 Olympics]]

Kavaguti and Smirnov skated in their third [[2010 Russian Figure Skating Championships|Russian Championship]] and placed first with both programs to win their third consecutive championship over Mukhortova and Trankov by over 11 points. 
They skated at the [[2010 European Figure Skating Championships|2010 European Championships]] in Tallinn, Estonia and were second after the short with less than one point separating the top three pairs. They skated a nearly flawless free skate with Kavaguti stepping out of the triple toe loop being the only mistake. In the middle of the program Kavagutiâs shoulder dislocated, she was able to get it back in to place and carry on with the rest of the program. They won the European Championship; receiving a score of 139.29 which was a world record free skate score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isuresults.com/isujsstat/phspfs.htm | title = ISU Judging System Statistics Progression of Highest Score | publisher = [[International Skating Union]] | date = 18 September 2010 | accessdate = 20 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They competed in their first [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games]] in Vancouver, Canada. They were 3rd after the short program with a seasonâs best score of 74.16, only 2.5 points behind the 1st place team of [[Shen Xue|Shen]] and [[Zhao Hongbo|Zhao]]. During the warm-up the pair was told by their coach not to attempt the quad throw. The first throw was a triple Salchow; Kavaguti put her hand down and stumbled coming out of the jump. Smirnov stepped out of the double Axel and because there was no speed to complete the second Axel, the pair did not complete the sequence.  Kavaguti fell on the final throw dislocating her shoulder. The pair continued but failed to pull full levels on many of the elements. Although they were in 1st place, there were still three pairs left to skate. They placed 4th overall. They were the highest placing Russian pair skaters.

The [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships|2010 World championships]] were held in Torino, Italy. Much like the World Championships in 2009, they were second after the short program and after a fall they dropped to third in the free skate; less than a point out of 2nd place. This was their second consecutive world bronze medal.

=== 2010â2011 season ===
In April 2010, Kavaguti had surgery on her shoulder.&lt;ref name=injuries&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sportsdaily.ru/articles/zasluzhennyiy-trener-sssr-i-rossii-tamara-moskvina-ya-kak-posudomoyka-38628 | title = Zasluzhennyiy trener SSSR i Rossii Tamara Moskvina Ya kak posudomoyka | last = Malysheva | first = Olga |publisher = sportsdaily.ru | date = 25 August 2010 | accessdate = 25 August 2010 | language = Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smirnov was also suffering with a groin injury and received treatment in Germany.&lt;ref name=ifs060911&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ifsmagazine.com/articles/521-yuko-kavaguti-alexander-smirnov-find-new-motivation | title = Yuko Kavaguti &amp; Alexander Smirnov Find New Motivation | last = Flade | first = Tatjana  |date = June 9, 2011 | publisher = International Figure Skating | accessdate = June 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After his return he sprained his ankle. The couple was off the ice for three months. They were assigned to compete at Skate Canada and Cup of Russia during the 2010-11 Grand Prix season, but due to the injuries of the pair they withdrew from Skate Canada. 

They competed at their only Grand Prix competition at the [[2010 Cup of Russia]] where they were first in the short program and won the free skate by over 17 points. This is their 5th medal at the Cup of Russia. They have won more medals at this competition than any other pair. Although they won in Russia they did not have enough points to compete at the Grand Prix Finals because of their withdrawal from Skate Canada.

At the [[2011 Russian Figure Skating Championships|2011 Russian Championships]] they were second after the short. A mistake on the side by side jumps and an awkward lift left them  almost 4.50 points out of first place. In the long program they skated last and held on to second place.

In Bern Switzerland at the [[2011 European Figure Skating Championships|2011 European Championships]], Kavaguti and Smirnov were in second place behind [[Aliona Savchenko|Savchenko]] and [[Robin Szolkowy|Szolkowy]] after the short program. In the free skate they skated last; even though they had a flawless program and won the free skate they couldnât make up the 2.82 point deficit to win the gold and settled for silver. Both of their programs earned them seasonâs best scores.

The [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 World Championships]] were originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo in March but due to the devastating earthquake and tsunami, the competition was moved to Moscow in late April. Kavaguti and Smirnov skated last out of 22 teams in the short program; but a fall by Smirnov on a step sequence left them in 5th place going into the free skate. During the free skate they received a score of 124.82 with a fall on a throw being the only mistake. They finished in 4th place.

=== 2011â2012 season ===
For the [[2011â2012 figure skating season|2011â2012 season]], Kavaguti and Smirnov took up the new option to compete at three [[2011â12 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] events. They easily won their first event at the [[2011 Cup of China]] finishing first in both the short program and free skate to win the event with a score of 186.74. 
Their next event was at the [[2011 NHK Trophy]] in Sapporo, Japan. They skated the short program but Yuko falling on an under rotated triple toe loop was a costly mistake. Several elements didnât receive high levels and the pair finished this segment of the competition in 5th place with a score of 55.02. The free skate was nearly flawless and they won over reigning World Champions [[Aliona Savchenko]] and [[Robin Szolkowy]] with a score of 177.51; and have qualified for the [[2011-2012 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final | Grand Prix Final]]. At the [[2011 Cup of Russia]], the pair were second after the short program with a score of 65.17. They performed a near flawless free skate and finished second with a score of 197.84. This is their sixth consecutive medal at the Cup of Russia.
