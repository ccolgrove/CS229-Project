'''Teresa Teng''' (born January 29, 1953 â May 8, 1995) ({{zh|t={{linktext|é§|éº|å}}|s={{linktext|é|ä¸½|å}}|p=DÃ¨ng LÃ¬jÅ«n|w=Teng Li-chun|poj=TÄng LÄ-kun|first=t}}, Japanese: ãã¬ãµã»ãã³), was an immensely popular and influential [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[mandopop|pop singer]] from [[Taiwan]]. Teresa Teng's voice and songs are instantly recognized throughout [[East Asia]] and in areas with large Asian populations. It is often said, &quot;Wherever there are Chinese people, the songs of Teresa Teng can be heard.&quot; Her songs enjoy popularity among [[Korea]]n, [[Japan]]ese, [[Thailand|Thai]], [[Vietnam]]ese, [[Malaysia]]n and [[Indonesia]]n listeners as well.

Teng was known for her [[folk song]]s and romantic [[ballad]]s. Many became standards in her lifetime, such as &quot;[[When Will You Return?]]&quot; (ä½æ¥ååä¾) and &quot;[[The Moon Represents My Heart]]&quot; (æäº®ä»£è¡¨æçå¿).&lt;ref name=nyt-obit/&gt; She recorded songs not only in her native [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] but also in [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]], [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], and [[English language|English]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Teng, a lifelong sufferer from [[asthma]], died in 1995 from a severe respiratory attack while on holiday in Thailand. She was 42.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Teresa Teng was born in [[Baozhong, Yunlin|Baozhong]], [[Yunlin County]], [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]], to a [[waishengren|mainland Chinese]] family from [[Hebei]]. She was educated at Ginling Girls High School. As a young child, Teresa won awards for her singing at talent competitions. Her first major prize was in 1964 when she sang &quot;Visiting Yingtai&quot; from [[Shaw Brothers]]' [[Huangmei opera]] movie, &quot;[[The Love Eterne]]&quot; (æ¢å±±ä¼¯èç¥è±å°), at an event hosted by [[Broadcasting Corporation of China]]. She was soon able to support her family with her singing. Taiwan's rising manufacturing economy in the 1960s made the purchase of records easier for more families. With her father's approval she quit high school to pursue singing professionally.

===Career===
Teng's singing style conveyed simplicity and sincerity. Yeh Yueh-Yu, a professor of Cultural Theory at the [[University of Southern California]] said, &quot;It was the sweetness in her voice that made her famous. She had a perfect voice for folk songs and ballads, and she added traditional folk song stylings into Western-style compositions.&quot; Her voice was also described as being &quot;like weeping and pleading, but with strength, capable of drawing in and hypnotizing listeners.&quot; Songwriter Tsuo Hung-yun said Teng's voice was &quot;seven parts sweetness, three parts tears.&quot;

Teng gained her first taste of fame in 1968 when a performance on a popular Taiwanese music program led to a record contract. She released several albums within the next few years under the Life Records label. In 1973 she attempted to crack the Japanese market by signing with the [[Polydor]] Japan label and taking part in Japan's [[KÅhaku Uta Gassen]], a year-round singing match of the most successful artists. She was named &quot;Best New Singing Star&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Pop diva Teresa Teng lives on in Chinese hearts|publisher = China Daily |date = 2005-05-12 | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/12/content_441430.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her success in Japan, Teresa sang many Japanese songs, including original hits such as {{nihongo|&quot;Give yourself to the flow of Time&quot;|æã®æµãã«èº«ãã¾ãã|Toki no Nagare ni Mi wo Makase}} which was later covered in Chinese as &quot;I Only Care About You&quot; (æåªå¨ä¹ä½ ).

In 1974 the song &quot;Airport&quot; (ç©ºæ¸¯) became a hit in Japan. Teng remained popular in Japan despite being barred from the country briefly in 1979 for having a fake Indonesian passport she purchased for US$20,000. The subterfuge had seemed necessary due to the official break in [[Republic of China â Japan relations|relations between Taiwan and Japan]] that occurred shortly after the [[People's Republic of China]] replaced the ROC in the [[China and the United Nations|United Nations]].

Teng's popularity boomed worldwide in the 1970s after her debut in Japan. Singing by now in Cantonese, Japanese and English besides her native Mandarin, Teng's popularity quickly grew in Malaysia and Indonesia. In Taiwan she was known not only as the island's most popular export, but as &quot;the soldier's sweetheart&quot; because of her frequent performances for servicemen. Teng was herself the child of a military family. Her concerts for troops featured popular music and Taiwanese folk songs that appealed to [[Taiwanese people|natives of the island]] as well as Chinese folk songs that appealed to homesick refugees of the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]].

In the early 1980s, continuing political tension between mainland China and Taiwan led to her music, along with that of other singers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, being banned for several years in mainland China as too &quot;bourgeois&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD153CF93AA25751C0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=A Taiwan Pop Singer Sways the Mainland | first=Nicholas D. | last=Kristof | date=February 19, 1991 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her popularity in China continued to grow nonetheless thanks to the black market. As Teng songs continued to be played everywhere, from nightclubs to government buildings, the ban on her music was soon lifted. Her Chinese fans nicknamed her &quot;Little Deng&quot; because she had the same family name as [[Deng Xiaoping]]; it was said that Deng the Communist leader ruled China by day, but that Deng the singer ruled China by night.&lt;ref name=nyt-obit&gt;Wudunn, Sheryl. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFDA1339F933A25756C0A963958260 Teresa Teng, Singer, 40, Dies; Famed in Asia for Love Songs].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 10, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teng's contract with Polydor ended in 1981. She signed a contract with Taurus Records in 1983 and made a successful comeback appearance in Japan. In 1983 Taurus released her most-acclaimed album, ''Light Exquisite Feeling'' (æ·¡æ·¡å¹½æ). This album consisted of settings of twelve poems from the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties. The music, written by composers of her earlier hits, blended modern and traditional styles of East and West. The most popular single from the album today is &quot;[[Wishing We Last Forever]]&quot; (ä½é¡äººé·ä¹). The number of hits released in the years from 1984â1989 make them &quot;Teresa Teng's Golden Years&quot; in the views of her fans. She was the first singer to win the All-Japan Record Awards for four consecutive years (1984â1988).

Teng performed in Paris during the 1989 [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen student protests]] on behalf of the students and proclaimed her support for democracy. On May 27, 1989, over 300,000 people attended the concert called &quot;Democratic songs dedicated to China&quot; (æ°ä¸»æ­è²ç»ä¸­è¯) at the [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] in Hong Kong. One of the highlights was her rendition of &quot;My Home Is on the Other Side of the Mountain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P49M1VJlt74 Video at YouTube.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Teng performed in many countries around the world during her career, her hopes of performing one day in mainland China never materialized. The [[Communist Party of China]] eventually invited her to do so in the 1990s but she died before the opportunity came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Why Teresa Teng Could Not Visit Mainland China|publisher = Southern Weekend (via Sina.com) |last = Zhao |first = Lei| date = August 3, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.zonaeuropa.com/culture/c20060805_1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and commemorations==
Teng died from a severe [[asthma]] attack while on holiday in [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]] at the age of 42 (43 by [[East Asian age reckoning|Chinese reckoning]]) on May 8, 1995. She was an asthmatic throughout her adult life. Teng was given [[state funeral|state honors]] at her funeral in Taiwan, with the [[flag of the Republic of China]] draped over her casket and then president [[Lee Teng-hui]] in attendance among thousands in mourning.

She was buried in a mountainside tomb at [[Chin Pao San]], a cemetery in [[Jinshan District, New Taipei|Jinshan]], [[Taipei County]] (now New Taipei City) in northern Taiwan. The grave site features a statue of Teng and a large electronic piano keyboard set in the ground that can be played by visitors who step on the keys. The memorial is often visited by her fans. (This represents a noteworthy departure from the traditional Chinese practice of shunning grave sites.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northguan-nsa.gov.tw/en/view_detail.php?id=13 Teresa Teng's grave]. North Coast &amp; Guanyinshang official website. Retrieved 2 Jan 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house she bought in 1986 in [[Hong Kong]] at No. 18 Carmel Street has also become a site of pilgrimage for her fans soon after her death. Plans to sell the home to finance a museum in [[Shanghai]] were made known in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2159548.stm Taiwanese diva's home 'for sale']. BBC news, 29 July 2002. Retrieved 2 Jan 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently sold for [[HK$]] 32 million. It closed on what would have been her 51st birthday on January 29, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080227001327/http://www.hkvpradio.com/newsletters/2004december.html A Retrospective Look at 2004]. HKVP Radio, Dec 2004. Retrieved 2 Jan 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the 10th anniversary of her death, Teresa Teng Culture and Education Foundation launched a campaign entitled &quot;Feel Teresa Teng&quot;. In addition to organizing an anniversary concert in Hong Kong and Taiwan, music fans paid homage at her shrine at Chin Pao San Cemetery. Additionally, some of her dresses, jewelry and personal items were placed on exhibition at [http://www.yuzile.com Yuzi Paradise], an art park outside [[Guilin]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Teresa Teng in loving memory forever|publisher = China Daily |date = 2005-05-08 | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-05/08/content_440103.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002, the wax figure of Teng was unveiled at [[Madame Tussauds Hong Kong]].
