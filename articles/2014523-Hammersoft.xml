'''Micheline Bernardini''' (born 1927) is a former nude dancer at the [[Casino de Paris]] before being chosen by [[Louis RÃ©ard]] to model the first modern-day [[bikini]] on July 5, 1946 at [[Piscine Molitor]] in Paris.

==The first bikini==
RÃ©ard could not find a model who would dare to wear his design. He ended up hiring Bernardini, a 19 year old [[striptease|nude dancer]] from the [[Casino de Paris]] as his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bikiniscience.com/chronology/1945-1950_SS/LR4601_S/LR4601.html |title= Michele Bernadini: The First Bikini |first = Judson |last = Rosebush | work=Bikini Science | accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EMILY MITCHELL, [http://www.time.com/time/international/1996/960701/fashion.html THE BIKINI TURNS 50], July 1, 1996 Volume 148, No. 1, [[Time Magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt; That bikini, a string bikini with a [[g-string]] back made out of {{convert|30|sqin|cm2|0}} of cloth with newspaper type printed across, was &quot;officially&quot; introduced at a fashion event at [[Piscine Molitor]], a popular public pool in Paris.
