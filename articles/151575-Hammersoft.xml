'''Cathay Pacific''' ({{zh|t=åæ³°èªç©ºå¬å¸|j=gwok&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; taai&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hong&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; hung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; gung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; si&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|p=GuÃ³tÃ i HÃ¡ngkÅnggÅngsÄ«}}, {{sehk|0293}}) is the [[flag carrier]] of Hong Kong, with its [[head office]] and main hub located at [[Hong Kong International Airport]], although the airline's registered office is on the 33rd floor of [[Pacific Place|One Pacific Place]].&lt;!--Cited below--&gt; The airline's operations include scheduled [[passenger]] and cargo services to 114 destinations in 36 countries worldwide, including [[codeshare agreement|codeshares]] and joint ventures, with a fleet of 132 [[wide-body aircraft]], consisting of [[Airbus A330]]s and [[Airbus A340|A340s]], [[Boeing 747]]s and [[Boeing 777|777s]].  The airline also operates [[Freedoms of the air#Fifth freedom|fifth freedom]] flights from [[Bangkok]] and [[Taipei]], its major [[focus city|focus cities]].  Its wholly owned subsidiary, [[Dragonair]], operates to 30 destinations in the Asia-Pacific region from its Hong Kong base.  In 2009, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair operated 56,000 flights, carrying nearly 25 million passengers and over 1.52&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of cargo and mail.

The airline was founded on September 24 1946 by American [[Roy Farrell|Roy C. Farrell]] and Australian [[Sydney de Kantzow|Sydney H. de Kantzow]], with each man putting up [[HK$]]1 to register the airline.  The airline made the world's first [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] [[Polar route|transpolar]] flight flying over the [[North Pole]] in July 1998, and it also operated the [[maiden flight]] to arrive at the new Hong Kong International Airport. The airline celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2006; and {{as of|2009|10|lc=on}}, its major shareholders are [[Swire Group|Swire Pacific]] and [[Air China]].  It is reciprocally one of the major shareholders of Air China.  Cathay Pacific currently holds the title of the world's third largest airline, measured in terms of market capitalization, according to the [[International Air Transport Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2010/12/worlds-biggest-airlines/134876/1 | title=U.S., European airlines no longer world's biggest, IATA says | publisher=USA Today | date=December 14, 2010 | accessdate=November 15, 2011 | author=Mutzabaugh, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Cathay Pacific became the world's largest international cargo airline, along with main hub Hong Kong International Airport as the world's busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-01-26/cathay-pacific-hong-kong-airport-become-biggest-for-freight.html Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airport Become Biggest for Freight â Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathay Pacific is a founding member of the [[Oneworld]] [[airline alliance|alliance]], with its subsidiary, Dragonair, as an affiliate member.  The airline was awarded the title 2009 ''Airline of the Year'' by independent research consultancy firm [[Skytrax]].  Cathay Pacific is one of the seven airlines to be ranked as a 5-star airline by Skytrax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Official 5-Star Airlinesâ¢|publisher=Airlinequality.com|url=http://www.airlinequality.com/StarRanking/5star.htm|accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early years===
Cathay Pacific was founded in Hong Kong on September 24 1946 by American [[Roy Farrell]] and Australian [[Sydney de Kantzow]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/cxbackground/history|title=History â Those Were the Days|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men were ex-air force pilots who had flown [[the Hump]], a route over the [[Himalaya]]n mountains.&lt;ref name=hump&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathay Pacific Airways Limited|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cathay-Pacific-Airways-Limited-Company-History.html|publisher=FundingUniverse|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each man put up [[HK$]]1 to register the airline.&lt;ref name=HKD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Airline Profile â Cathay Pacific|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/landingpage/cathay%20pacific.html|work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Business Information|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially based in Shanghai, the two men moved to Hong Kong where they formally began Cathay Pacific.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; They named it ''[[Cathay]]'', the ancient name given to [[names of China|China]], derived from &quot;Khitan&quot;, and ''Pacific'' because Farrell speculated that they would one day fly across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] (which happened in the 1970s). The Chinese name for the company &quot;åæ³°&quot; comes from a Chinese idiom meaning &quot;Grand and Peaceful State&quot;.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airhighways.com/cathay_pacific.htm|title=Cathay Pacific sees opportunity in Shenzhen|publisher=, Air Highways|accessdate=8 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, the airline was conceived by Farrell and some foreign correspondents at the bar of the [[Manila Hotel]].&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; On Cathay Pacific's maiden voyage, Farrell and de Kantzow flew from Hong Kong to [[Manila]], and later on to Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathay Pacific chief executive meets President Arroyo as airline celebrates 60 years of serving the Philippines|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2006/10/12/life/cathay.pacific.chief.executive.meets.president.arroyo.as.airline.celebrates.60.years.of.serving.the.philippines..html|date=12 October 2006|publisher=Sun.Star Cebu|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a single [[Douglas DC-3]], nicknamed ''Betsy''. The airline initially flew routes between Hong Kong, Sydney, Manila, [[Singapore]], Shanghai, and [[Guangzhou|Canton]], while scheduled service was limited to [[Bangkok]], Manila, and Singapore only.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

In 1948 Butterfield &amp; Swire (now known as [[Swire Group]]) bought 45% of Cathay Pacific, with [[Australian National Airways]] taking 35% and Farrell and de Kantzow taking 10% each.&lt;ref name=HKD1/&gt; The new company began operations on 1 July 1948 and was registered as Cathay Pacific (1948) Ltd on 18 October 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;FI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= Directory: World Airlines|publisher=[[Flight International]]|page=62|date=3 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swire later acquired 52% of Cathay Pacific and today the airline is still 40% owned by the Swire Group through Swire Pacific Limited.&lt;ref name=Swire&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet â Major Shareholders|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/cxbackground/factsheet?refID=e8a30e56ef7cf010VgnVCM32000011d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s===
{{expand-section|more in-depth information about these decades, especially about the 1950s and 1960s.|date=November 2011}}
The airline prospered in late 1950s and into the 1960s by buying its archrival, [[Hong Kong Airways]], on 1 July 1959.&lt;ref name=HKA&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Lion Rock|last=Young|first=Gavin|authorlink=Gavin Young|year=1988|publisher=Hutchinson|isbn=978-0091737245|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1967, the airline recorded double digit growth on average every year and the world's first to operate international services to [[Fukuoka]], [[Nagoya]] and [[Osaka]] in Japan.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; Eighteen years after the airline was founded, it carried its one millionth passenger and acquired its first jet engine aircraft [[Convair 880]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=hump/&gt;&lt;ref name=Horizon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/cxbackground/history?refID=9cf4b9b4b92eb010VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|title=History â New Horizons|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Cathay Pacific installed a computerised reservation system and flight simulators. In 1979, the airline acquired its first [[Boeing 747]] and applied for traffic rights to begin flying to London in 1980. Expansion continued into the 1980s, with nonstop service to [[Vancouver]] in 1983, with continuing service on to San Francisco in 1986 when an industry-wide boom encouraged route growth to many European and North American centres.&lt;ref name=Horizon/&gt; On 15 May 1986, the airline went public and listed in the Main Board of the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of listed companies on Main Board|url=http://www.hkex.com.hk/data/factbook/2006/e/32.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]]|page=225|year=2006|accessdate=9 July 2009}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1990s===
[[File:CX333 TPE.JPG|thumb|[[Airbus A330-300]] at [[Taipei Taoyuan International Airport]]|alt=A Cathay Pacific Airbus A330-300 at [[Chennai International Airport]]]]

In January 1990, Cathay Pacific and its parent company, [[Swire Pacific]], acquired a significant shareholding in [[Dragonair]], and a 75% stake in cargo airline [[Air Hong Kong]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History â Year 1990 â 1994|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_INTL/aboutus/aboutdragonair/history?refID=b1c01dfcac000110VgnVCM10000021d21c39____|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History â Air Hong Kong|url=http://www.airhongkong.com.hk/ahk/en/F300/History/index.jsp|publisher=Air Hong Kong|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1990s, the airline launched a programme to upgrade its passenger service. Also, the green and white striped livery was replaced with the current &quot;brushwing&quot; livery. Later, the airline began a US$9&amp;nbsp;billion fleet replacement program during the mid-1990s that resulted with it having one of the youngest airline fleets in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History â A Change of Image|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/cxbackground/history?refID=0555b9b4b92eb010VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[CITIC Pacific]] increased its holdings in Cathay Pacific from 10% to 25%, while the Swire Group holding was reduced to 44% as two other Chinese companies, [[China National Aviation Corporation|CNAC]] and CTS also bought substantial holdings.&lt;ref name=hump/&gt;

On 1 July 1997, administration of Hong Kong was transferred from the UK to the People's Republic of China. Most of the airline's aircraft were registered in Hong Kong and bore a registration beginning with &quot;VR&quot;. Under the terms of an agreement within the [[Sino-British Joint Liaison Group]] (JLG), all registrations were changed to the prefix &quot;B&quot; by December 1997 , which is used by the People's Republic of China and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/1997/ch15/e15v.htm|title=Hong Kong â A New Era â Civil Aviation|publisher=[[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR Government]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathay Pacific aircraft formerly carried a painted Union Jack on the tail but these were removed several years prior to the 1997 takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cathay-Pacific-Airways/Boeing-747-267B/0000646/L/|title=Cathay Pacific â Picture of the Boeing 747-267B aircraft at Vancouver|publisher=Airliners.net|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cathay-Pacific-Airways/Boeing-747-267B/0815216/L/|publisher=Airliners.net|title=Cathay Pacific â Picture of the Boeing 747-267B aircraft at Hong Kong|accessdate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1999, Cathay Pacific co-founded the [[Oneworld]] Alliance.&lt;ref name=OW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/cxbackground/factsheet?refID=2105cd5d499cf010VgnVCM32000011d21c39____|title=Fact Sheet â Oneworld|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The airline was hurt by the [[Asian financial crisis]] of the late 1990s, but recorded a record [[HK$]]5&amp;nbsp;billion profit in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific posts record annual profit for 2000|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=e2ed4e786c29a010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=7 March 2001|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hong Kong airport and transpolar flights===
On 5 July 1998, [[Kai Tak Airport|Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport]] witnessed its last commercial departing flight, Cathay Pacific Flight 251 to [[London Heathrow Airport]], after over 73 years of operation. The next day, Cathay Pacific Flight 889, from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York John F. Kennedy International Airport]], piloted by Captain Mike Lowes and First Officer Kelvin Ma, was the maiden flight to arrive at the new [[Hong Kong International Airport]], located at [[Chek Lap Kok]], west of Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Commemorative certificate for first-day passengers|url=http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/media/press-releases/ex_128.html|publisher=[[Airport Authority Hong Kong]]|date=5 July 1998|accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This flight was also the world's first [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] [[Polar route|transpolar]] flight from New York to Hong Kong. The flight, dubbed ''Polar One'', takes approximately 16 hours to travel between Hong Kong and New York, saving about three to four hours on journey time, compared to the one stop service via [[Vancouver]]. It is Cathay Pacific's longest non-stop flight, as well as one of the longest non-stop flights by distance in the world at {{convert|8055|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=PolarOne&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific's non-stop New York flight 'strengthens Hong Kong's hub'|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=aa24e27ed1faa010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline operated the first commercial non-stop transpolar flight from Canada on 19 May 2000, with Cathay Pacific Flight 829 from Toronto to Hong Kong. The flight flew directly over [[Hudson Bay]] and passed within {{convert|50|nmi|km mi}} of the North Pole, it took just 14 hours and 59 minutes and saved almost three hours from the normal route, which included a technical stop in [[Anchorage]]. It is Cathay Pacific's second longest non-stop flight with a distance of {{convert|7809|mi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=PolarYYZ&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific operates first transpolar flight from Canada|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=cfff110706caa010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=19 May 2000|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 49ers â industrial troubles===
In 2001, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association (HKAOA) launched a &quot;work to rule&quot; campaign to further its campaign for pay improvements and changes to roster scheduling practices. The action involved pilots refusing to work flights that were not scheduled on their roster. Although this alone did not cause extensive disruption, rostered pilots began calling in sick for their flights. Combined with the work to rule campaign, the airline was unable to cover all of its scheduled flights and cancellations resulted. Cathay Pacific steadfastly refused to negotiate with the HKAOA under threat of industrial action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pilots' work-to-rule causing delays at Cathay Pacific|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WDP/is_2001_July_9/ai_76664432/|publisher=Kyodo News International, Inc.|date=4 July 2001|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2001, reportedly following a comprehensive review of the employment histories of all its pilots, the company fired 49 of its 1,500 pilots. This group became known colloquially as &quot;the 49ers&quot;. Nearly half of the fired pilots were captains, representing five percent of the total pilot group. Of the 21 officers of the HKAOA, nine were fired, including four of the seven union negotiators.&lt;ref name=Hopkins&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins|first=George E.|title=Cathay Pacific Pilots on the Brink|url=http://www.cathaypilotsunion.org/generaldocs/USalpaarticle02.pdf|format=PDF|date=May/June 2002|publisher=Air Line Pilot|page=20|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:cathay b747-400 b-hua takeoff arp.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 747-400]] takes off.|alt=A Cathay Pacific Boeing 747â400 taking off]]

Then-HKAOA president Captain Nigel Demery took the view that &quot;the firing was pure intimidation, a union-bust straight up, designed to be random enough to put the fear in all pilots that they might be next, no reason given&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hopkins/&gt; The dismissals were challenged in a number of legal proceedings, but none were reinstated. The airline later offered the 49 pilots it terminated in 2001 the chance to reapply for pilot positions with its cargo division, guaranteeing such applicants first interviews, subject to passing psychometric testing. Nineteen former employees applied and twelve were offered jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parry|first=Simon|title=Sacked pilots win back Cathay jobs after 4-year break|url=http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?s=21c6a887a8f684e25aeaecb446f2ed0f&amp;p=4715707&amp;postcount=425|date=10 July 2005|work=South China Morning Post |location=Hong Kong|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current relations between the company and the HKAOA are cordial. The replacement of Captain Demery by Captain Murray Gardner is said to have had a lot to do with this change in relationship. Captain Gardner favoured a more diplomatic and conciliatory approach to dealing with management, and workplace relations between the two groups have been largely conciliatory since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Murray|title=Formal Offer on the 49ers|url=http://www.cathaypilotsunion.org/ILO/2186RefE1-FormalOfferonthe49ers.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cathay Pilot Union|date=16 December 2004|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2009, 18 of The 49ers succeeded in the Hong Kong Court of First Instance concerning their joint claims for breach of contract, breach of the Employment Ordinance and defamation.

Judge Anselmo Reyes ruled the airline had contravened the Employment Ordinance by dismissing the pilots without a valid reason, adding that they had been sacked primarily because of union activities. He also held that remarks by then chief operating officer Philip Chen Nanlok and current chief executive Tony Tyler after the sackings were defamatory. The judge handed the pilots a victory in their long-running legal battle, with individual awards of HK$3.3&amp;nbsp;million for defamation together with a month's pay and HK$150,000 for the sackings.

On 24 December 2010, judges Frank Stock, Susan Kwan and Johnson Lam of the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment of the lower court to the extent that the claim for wrongful termination of contract was dismissed.  The finding that Cathay Pacific wrongly sacked the 18 pilots for their union activities was upheld.  The court upheld the defamation claim but reduced the damages for the defamatory comments made by Cathay Pacific management. The judges also modified the judgment awarding payment of legal costs to the pilots and instead said that they should now pay some of Cathayâs costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cathaypilotsunion.org/proceedings/CACV000268_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the 49er Plaintiffs, Captain John Warham, launched a book titled &quot;The 49ers - The True Story&quot; on 25 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/49ers-True-Story-John-Warham/dp/1846245877/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilots were awarded leave on 26 October 2011 to take their case to the Court of Final Appeal. The matter was heard before Hon. Mr. Justices Bokhary, Chan &amp; Ribeiro who are all Permanent Judges of the Court of Final Appeal.  The matters to be decided upon by the Court will concern wrongful termination of contract and the level of damages for defamation. The case is expected to be heard by the Court of Final Appeal in 2012.

===Acquisition and downsizing of Dragonair===
On 9 June 2006, the airline underwent a shareholding realignment under which [[Dragonair]] became a wholly owned subsidiary but continued to operate under its own brand. By acquiring Dragonair, this meant gaining more access to the restricted, yet rapidly growing, Mainland China market and more opportunities for sharing of resources. [[China National Aviation Corporation|CNAC]], and its subsidiary, Air China, acquired a 17.5 percent stake in Cathay Pacific, and the airline doubled its shareholding in Air China to 17.5 percent. [[CITIC Pacific]] reduced its shareholding to 17.5 percent and [[Swire Group]] reduced its shareholding to 40 percent.&lt;ref name=Swire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History â Into the New Millennium|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/cxbackground/history?refID=f5b5b9b4b92eb010VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KAmerge&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathay, Air China Deal Enables Dragonair Purchase|url=http://www.btnonline.com/businesstravelnews/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002840345|publisher=Business Travel News|accessdate=28 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragonair had originally planned significant international expansion. It was already operating services to [[Bangkok]] and Tokyo, and was to have a dedicated cargo fleet of nine [[Boeing 747-400]]BCF aircraft by 2009 operating to New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_INTL/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=66cc5b81f2510110VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|title=Dragonair to more than double size of cargo fleet by end-2008|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|date=6 May 2004|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had also acquired three [[Airbus A330-300]] aircraft to commence services to Sydney and [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.travelweekly.com.au/articles/14/0c01f914.asp|title=Dragonair gets green light for Sydney/Hong Kong services|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|work=Travel Weekly|date=19 April 2004|accessdate=4 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the acquisition by Cathay Pacific, Dragonair's proposed expansion plans underwent a comprehensive route compatibility analysis with the Cathay network, in an effort to reduce duplication. Dragonair services to Bangkok and Tokyo were terminated, and new services launched to Sendai, Phuket, Manila and Kathmandu. With the merging of similar departments at the two previously separate airlines, some Dragonair staff have had their employment contracts transferred to Cathay Pacific, and others made redundant due to the efficiencies gained in the merger. This has resulted in an approximately 37 percent decrease in the number of staff contractually employed by Dragonair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_INTL/aboutus/aboutdragonair/fastfacts?refID=4418ebe4f0bef010VgnVCM10000021d21c39____|title=Fast Facts â Number of Staff|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has been speculation that Dragonair will cease as a brand and be fully absorbed into Cathay Pacific, this is unlikely as Dragonair enjoys significant market awareness in regional Chinese markets.&lt;ref name=KAmerge/&gt;

To celebrate the airline's 60th anniversary in 2006, a year of road shows named the &quot;Cathay Pacific 60th Anniversary Skyshow&quot; was held where the public could see the developments of the airline, play games, meet some of the airline's staff, and view vintage uniforms. Cathay Pacific also introduced anniversary merchandise and in-flight meals served by famous restaurants in Hong Kong in collaboration with the celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific takes 60th Anniversary Skyshow On the road|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=abb9f0b86b9ab010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=20 May 2006|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Cathay Pacific entered into a [[plea bargain]] with the [[United States Department of Justice]] in respect of antitrust investigations over air cargo price fixing agreements. It was fined US$60&amp;nbsp;million. The airline has subsequently set up an internal Competition Compliance Office, reporting to Chief Operating Officer John Slosar, to ensure that the Group complies with all relevant competition and antitrust laws in the jurisdiction in which it operates. The breaches for which Cathay Pacific Cargo were being investigated in the U.S. were not illegal under Hong Kong competition law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Major International Airlines Agree to Plead Guilty and Pay Criminal Fines Totaling More Than $500&amp;nbsp;Million for Fixing Prices on Air Cargo Rates|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2008/June/08-at-570.html|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Announcement Plea Agreement with United States Department of Justice|url=http://downloads.cathaypacific.com/cx/investor/20080626CX_Announcement%28B%29_en.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, the airline reported a record full-year loss of [[HK$]]8.56&amp;nbsp;billion for 2008, which was also the carrier's first since the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]]. The record loss included fuel-hedging losses of HK$7.6&amp;nbsp;billion and a HK$468&amp;nbsp;million charge for a price-fixing fine in the U.S. It had to scrap its final dividend. The hedging losses were a result of locking in fuel prices at higher than prevailing market price. As of the end of 2008, Cathay Pacific has hedged about half of its fuel needs until the end of 2011. The airline at the time estimated that it would face no further cash costs from the hedges if the average market price stood at US$75, enabling it recoup provisions it made in 2008.&lt;ref name=2008loss&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Wendy|title=Cathay Pacific to delay planes, review routes on loss|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aCGfshxczTzM|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flattening out of fuel prices resulted in Cathay Pacific recording a paper fuel hedging gain for its half year reports for 2009. However, as a result of the global economic situation, the Group reported an operating loss. Given the current economic climate, and in line with the steps being taken by other major airlines around the world, the airline has undertaken a comprehensive review of all its routes and operations. This has resulted in frequencies being reduced to certain destinations, ad hoc cancellations on other routes, deferred capital expenditure, parked aircraft and introduced a Special Leave Scheme for staff to conserve money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chan|first=Sue Ling|title=Cathay, Singapore Face Tough Decisions|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aVooYceFNyjc|publisher=Bloomberg L.

In 2010, the airline set another record high profit, amounting to [[HK$]]14.048&amp;nbsp;billion despite record losses set in the same decade. At the same time, Cathay Pacific had ordered several new aircraft types, including the Airbus A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinahourly.com/bizchina/12953/ |title=Cathay Pacific last year, a record profit of 14&amp;nbsp;billion Hong Kong dollars |publisher=Chinahourly |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Tyler left his position as CEO at the airline on 31 March 2010 to pursue his new job at the IATA.

Prior to 1997, all Cathay Pacific aircraft carried they British flag on the [[empennage]]. After the handover, aircraft carry the [[Brand Hong Kong]] logo and with ''HONG KONG'' or in Chinese ''é¦æ¸¯'' under or beside the [[Brand Hong Kong]] logo instead of using the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) flag. In fact, the HKSAR flag has never appeared on any aircraft.

On 21 May 1998, Cathay Pacific became the launch carrier when it took the first delivery of the [[Boeing 777-300]], the newest member of the [[Boeing 777]] family, at a ceremony in [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Boeing and Cathay Pacific Airways Celebrate First 777-300 Delivery|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/1998/news_release_980521b.html|publisher=[[Boeing]]|date=21 May 1998|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2002, the airline took delivery of its first [[Airbus A340-600]] aircraft at a ceremony at the [[Airbus]] factory in [[Toulouse]]. Cathay Pacific is the launch customer in Asia for the A340-600 and this aircraft is the first of three leased from [[International Lease Finance Corporation]] (ILFC).&lt;ref name=A346&gt;{{cite press release|title=Hon Antony Leung tours 1st Cathay Pacific Airbus A340-600|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=9a4f22298339a010VgnVCM22000022d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=28 November 2002|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2005, Cathay Pacific announced an order for 16 [[777-300ER|Boeing 777-300ER]] aircraft, four on lease from ILFC, to be delivered between September 2007 and July 2010, plus [[Option (aircraft purchasing)|options]] on 20 more of the type, two of which were converted to orders on 1 June 2006.

On 29 August 2006, the airline took delivery of its 100th aircraft, an [[Airbus A330-300]] with the registration B-LAD. For the aircraft acceptance ceremony in Toulouse, the aircraft was painted in a 100th aircraft livery with a 60th anniversary sticker behind the second doors (2L and 2R). The aircraft was named ''Progress Hong Kong'', a name that was chosen from a competition by the staff.&lt;ref name=100thAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathay Pacific B-LAD Picture of the Airbus A330-343X aircraft|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Cathay-Pacific-Airways/Airbus-A330-343X/1107544/L/|publisher=Airliners.net|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 August 2007, Cathay Pacific announced that it had placed an additional order for five more wide-body Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for a total price of about US$1.4&amp;nbsp;billion, increasing its commitment to a total of 23 of the aircraft type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific Airways Orders Five Additional Boeing 777-300ERs|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q3/070807a_nr.html|publisher=[[Boeing]]|date=7 August 2007|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October 2007, the airline's CEO, Tony Tyler, stated that the carrier has no plans regarding the purchase of either the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] or the [[Airbus A380]] for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cathay Pacific: no plans for 787 or A380|url=http://www.abcmoney.co.uk/news/302007155134.htm|publisher=ABCmoney. co. uk|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 November 2007, the airline announced that it had placed an order for seven additional Boeing 777-300ERs and 10 747-8F freighters with a list price of US$5.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Boeing and Cathay Pacific Announce Order for 10 747-8Fs and Seven 777-300ERs|url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q4/071108c_nr.html|publisher=[[Boeing]]|date=8 November 2007|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has also took 14 options for the new freighter at that time.

Together with the commitment for 17 long-haul passenger aircraft and freighters announced the previous month, the new aircraft will take the Cathay Pacific Group's fleet size to 200 by 2012. From that 200 aircraft, the airline will operate 155 itself, and the rest will be used by its subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cathay Pacific Group fleet to number 200 in five years with latest aircraft order|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=6bdd51169eea6110VgnVCM32000011d21c39____|date=6 December 2007|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 2009, it was reported that the delivery of two aircraft due in 2008 was delayed after a strike at [[Boeing]]. Additionally, the delivery of two Boeing 747â8 freighters due this year have been pushed back to 2010 amid delays at the planemaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008loss&quot;/&gt;

The delivery positions on new [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ER]] have been deferred due to the [[Late-2000s recession|economic recession]]. Cathay Pacific has also sent four [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300]] and two [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747â400]] to [[Southern California Logistics Airport|Victorville Airport]] for storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/flottecie/Cathay%20Pacific-stored-a340.htm Cathay Pacific Fleet of A340 (Stored) | Airfleets aviation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2010, it was reported that Cathay Pacific was in talks with both Boeing and Airbus about adding the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] and/or the [[Airbus A350]] to their fleet.  Tony Tyler, Cathay Pacific's CEO, was reported to have said that the airline is more interested in acquiring smaller, long-range jets that are better suited for carrying cargo, than it is in acquiring either the [[Boeing 747-8]]I or the [[Airbus A380]].  Acquisition of the Boeing 787 and/or the Airbus A350 would allow Cathay Pacific to both add new destinations to its network, and to replace those [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-400s]] and [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300s]] that currently operate on its long-haul routes alongside [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ERs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-07/cathay-pacific-is-in-talks-to-purchase-long-range-jets-shuns-super-jumbos.html Cathay, Air France-KLM Embrace Airbags as Safety Rules Tighten â Bloomberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 2010, it was confirmed that Cathay Pacific will buy 30 [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350-900s]] and have 6 more [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ERs]] on order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheng&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=Cheng| first=Wing-Gar| title=Cathay Pacific Orders 36 Planes After Profit Beats Expectations| publisher=Bloomberg| date=4/8/10| url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-08-04/cathay-pacific-orders-36-planes-after-profit-beats-expectations.html| accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathay Pacific has remained open on potential purchase of the [[Airbus A380]] for long-haul and ultra long-haul routes to Australia, the US and Europe. On 25 November 2010, outgoing Cathay Pacific CEO Tony Tyler said &quot;I wouldn't rule out the airline becoming a customer (for the A380) at some point.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-25/cathay-pacific-to-boost-capacity-11-next-year-on-rebound-in-global-travel.html Cathay Pacific to Boost Capacity 11% Next Year on Global Travel Pickup â Bloomberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 March 2011, it was reported that the airline has ordered another 15 Airbus A330-300s and 10 [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ER]]s. The deal also included 2 more [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350-900s]] which will be leased from [[ILFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iGs9L1sHzPHFyjcgTLM4j4P6BM5Q?docId=CNG.2e731c43441cb963374752d290ede3ea.5a1 |title=AFP: Cathay Pacific orders 27 Airbus and Boeing planes |publisher=Google  |date=8 March 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an airline, Cathay Pacific is the biggest operator of the [[Airbus A330]].

On 10 August 2011, Cathay Pacific entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company to purchase four [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300ER]] passenger aircraft and eight [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777F]] Freighters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_INTL/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=cb27041f9c1b1310VgnVCM1000000ad21c39____&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 2011, it was identified that Cathay Pacific would be launching a Premium Economy Class on its new Boeing 777-300ERs from March 2012. The aircraft will feature 40 Business Class, 32 Premium Economy Class and 268 Economy Class with the absence of a First Class cabin.&lt;ref name=&quot;airlineroute&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cathay Pacific to launch Premium Economy on 777-300ER from Mar 2012|url=http://airlineroute.net/2011/08/20/cx-77g-mar12/|publisher=Airline Route|accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cargo fleet notes'''

On 5 October 2005, the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 747â400 Boeing Converted Freighter (Boeing 747-400BCF) aircraft that was converted from a passenger plane to a freighter in [[Xiamen]], China. Cathay Pacific Cargo is the launch customer for this aircraft type and it was also the first time Boeing had conducted a major flight test programme outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2005/q4/nr_051005h.html Boeing: First 747-400 Boeing Converted Freighter Takes Flight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2006, the airline announced an order of six [[Boeing 747-400ERF]] freighters, delivered in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Major Transaction â Purchase of 6 Boeing 747-400ERF Freighters|url=http://downloads.cathaypacific.com/cx/investor/EW_00293.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=29 June 2006|accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2008, [[Airport Authority Hong Kong]] (HKAA) awarded Cathay Pacific Services Ltd (CPSL), a wholly owned subsidiary, a non-exclusive 20-year franchise to invest in, design, construct and operate a new air cargo terminal at [[Hong Kong International Airport]] (HKIA). The new cargo terminal will be built in the cargo area at the airport, close to the existing cargo servicing facilities, with a site area of approximately 10 hectares. The new cargo terminal will be operated by a separate management team in CPSL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Airport Authority Awards New Cargo Terminal Franchise to Cathay Pacific Services Limited|url=http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/media/press-releases/pr_920.html|publisher=[[Airport Authority Hong Kong]]|date=18 March 2008|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 January 2009, CPSL signed a supplementary agreement with the HKAA to defer the completion of its new cargo terminal by a maximum of 24 months to mid-2013, in response to the current market conditions. A non disclosed compensation amount for the deferral is included in the supplementary agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Agreement on deferral of completion of third cargo terminal|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=a5354d44549de110VgnVCM1000000ad21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its conception in 1946, the airline had operated many types of aircraft. The first two aircraft were two World War II surplus Douglas DC-3s named ''Betsy'' and ''Niki''. ''Betsy'' (VR-HDB), the first aircraft for Cathay Pacific, is now a permanent exhibit in the [[Hong Kong Science Museum]]. ''Niki'' (VR-HDA) was lost, but a similar DC-3 was purchased as a replacement. It was refurbished and repainted by the airline's Engineering Department and maintenance provider, [[Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company]], and it now wears the second Cathay Pacific livery from the late 1940s. This aircraft received ''Niki'''s old VR-HDA aircraft registration and is now on public view in the car park outside the Flight Training Centre of Cathay City.&lt;ref name=DC3&gt;{{cite press release|title=Vintage Aircraft Brings the Past Alive at Cathay Pacific Headquarter's in Airlines 60th Anniversary Year|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_NZ/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=45b8001674c7d010VgnVCM32000011d21c39____|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=5 September 2006|accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
On 22 January 2007 and 18 December 2008 respectively, Cathay Pacific launched more methods to check-in for flights. Among them were self-check in utilizing a kiosk at [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and select destinations globally. Another checking in via a mobile phone. Worldwide, only a limited number of other airlines offer these options. Cathay Pacific later announced, on April&amp;nbsp;17, 2009, the airline's first ever Mobile Boarding Pass application, dubbed CX Mobile, was launched. Passengers can use the application to check flight arrivals and departures, check-in for their flights, read about the destination they are flying to using City Guides. CX Mobile has become a hit with passengers, making Cathay Pacific into one of the industry leaders in offering mobile services to users of smart phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Mobile Check-In|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/manageyourtrip/mobileservices/mobilecheckin|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ko|first=Carol|title=Check-in on Cathay Pacific with mobile phones|url=http://www.mis-asia.com/news/articles/check-in-on-cathay-pacific-with-mobile-phones|publisher=MIS Asia|date=22 January 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.cathaypacific.com/cpa/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=f8140f06c6473210VgnVCM62000007d21c39____|title=Cathay Pacific emerges as industry leader with new mobile application|publisher=Cathay Pacific|date=1 September 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cathay Pacific is also now following a trend among many airlines to improve its brand image to customers and shareholders with [[social media]], and is ranked fourth worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ex-united.com/social-media/clickable-data-airline-social-media-all-stars/|title=Clickable Data: Airline Social Media All-Stars|publisher=Stephen Michaelson|accessdate=17 September 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The airline now utilizes range of social media tools including Facebook, [[Flickr]], Twitter, Youtube and [[blogging]] to share ideas with customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathaypacifichost.com/blog/|title=Cathay Pacific Blog|publisher=Cathay Pacific|accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has launched a virtual tour to enable passengers to experience Cathay Pacific's new cabins and services without even having to step aboard the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simpliflying.com/2008/experience-cathay-pacific-without-even-stepping-on-the-plane/|title=Experience Cathay Pacific without stepping on the plane|publisher=Shashank Nigam|accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 4 January 2011, the cargo division of the airline, Cathay Pacific Cargo, has become the first airline operating out of Hong Kong to fully switch to e-[[air waybill]].

====Business class====

[[File:Herringbonecabin CX.jpg|thumb|Business Class seats in herring-bone configuration on the 777-300ER]]

After receiving extensive criticism for its high-walled [[Herringbone seating|herring-bone configuration]] business class seating on long-haul flights, which many passengers felt was too narrow and confined, Cathay Pacific embarked on a total redesign of business class seating. The new design is more conventional, emphasising the passenger's sense of personal space while also retaining privacy. 

The new business class seats will be fitted into all new [[Airbus A330-300]] and [[777-300ER|Boeing 777-300ER]] deliveries, with existing [[Airbus A330|A330-300]] and [[Boeing 777|777-300ER]] aircraft to be upgraded to the new seating and cabin by February 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://downloads.cathaypacific.com/cx/press/cxw/pdf/New%20Business%20Class%20backgrounder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However,the current [[Boeing 747-400]] and [[Airbus A340]] aircraft will not be upgraded to the new seating and cabin due to the impending retirement of those planes.

The existing Regional Business Class is provided on Cathay Pacific's [[Boeing 777]]s (excluding the [[Boeing 777|777-300ER]]) and selected [[Airbus A330-300]]s. Regional Business Class seats have {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} width and recline to {{convert|45|in|cm|abbr=on}} of pitch and feature electrical recline and leg rest.

The new Economy Class seats, offered on aircraft outfitted with the refurbished long-haul interiors, were designed by [[BE Aerospace|B/E Aerospace]]. New features of these seats include a fixed back design (shell) that allows passengers to recline without intruding on those seated behind, a {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} PTV providing AVOD, AC power located behind a larger tray table, a coat hook and a literature pocket that has been relocated to below the seat cushion to create more leg room.
