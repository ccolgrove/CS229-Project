The '''New York State Thruway''' is a system of [[limited-access highway]]s located within the state of [[New York]] in the United States. The system, known officially as the '''Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway''' for former New York Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], is operated by the '''New York State Thruway Authority''' (NYSTA) and comprises {{convert|569.83|mi|2}} of highway. The [[toll road|tolled]] mainline of the Thruway extends for {{convert|496.00|mi|2}} from the [[New York City]] line at [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] to the [[New York â Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] at [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] by way of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. According to the [[International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association]], the Thruway is the fifth busiest toll road in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-01-27-tolls_N.htm |title=Drivers to see major toll hikes |first=Dennis |last=Cauchon |accessdate=May 31, 2010 |date=February 5, 2008 |newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tolled highway connecting the major cities of New York was first proposed as early as the 1940s. The first section of the Thruway, between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], opened on June&amp;nbsp;24, 1954. The remainder of the mainline and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and provinces were built in the 1950s. When the [[Interstate Highway System]] was created in 1957, much of the Thruway system was included as portions of [[Interstate&amp;nbsp;87]] (I-87), [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]], and [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]. Other segments became part of [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]] shortly afterward. Today, the system comprises six highways: the New York&amp;nbsp;â Ripley mainline, the Berkshire Connector, the Garden State Parkway Connector, the [[New England Thruway]] (I-95), the [[Niagara Thruway]] (I-190), and the [[Cross Westchester Expressway]] (I-287). The portion of [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84 in New York]] was part of the Thruway system from 1991 to 2010.

The Thruway utilizes both open ([[barrier toll system|barrier-based]]) tolling and closed (ticket-based) tolling. Tickets are used on the Thruway mainline between [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]] and the eastern suburbs of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and from the southern suburbs of Buffalo to the Pennsylvania state line. The Berkshire Connector also utilizes a ticket-based tolling system. The portion of the mainline south of Harriman, the New England Thruway, and the Niagara Thruway have open tolling systems, with all three highways containing at least one [[toll barrier]]. The last two componentsâthe Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross Westchester Expresswayâand the section of the mainline in and around Buffalo are toll-free.

The New York State Thruway system is a collection of six individual components across the state of [[New York]] that connect the state to four neighboring states ([[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Pennsylvania]]) as well as the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. Together, the highways extend for {{convert|569.83|mi|2}},&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt; making the Thruway system one of the largest toll highway systems in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thruway.ny.gov/index.shtml |title=New York State Thruway Authority |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest of the six components is the {{convert|496|mi|0|adj=on}} mainline. Of the 570&amp;nbsp;miles in the Thruway system, {{convert|560.85|mi|2}} (98.4%) carries at least one [[Interstate Highway]] designation.&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt; Only three sections of the system are not part of the Interstate Highway System; these are the Garden State Parkway Connector in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], a {{convert|6|mi|0|sing=on}} portion of the Berkshire Connector between exit&amp;nbsp;21A on the mainline near [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]] and exit&amp;nbsp;B1 in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], and a short section of the mainline within exit&amp;nbsp;24 in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] that is located between where [[Interstate 87|I-87]] departs the roadway and [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] enters it. They are designated as New York State Route&amp;nbsp;982L (NY&amp;nbsp;982L), NY&amp;nbsp;912M, and NY&amp;nbsp;915H, respectively, all unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009log&quot; /&gt;

I-90, which comprises the bulk of the mainline and the Berkshire Connector, runs for {{convert|365.55|mi|2}} along the Thruway: {{convert|17.70|mi|2}} as part of the Berkshire Connector and {{convert|347.85|mi|2}} on the mainline. I-87 comprises the remaining {{convert|148.15|mi|2}} of the mainline, including an {{convert|18.86|mi|2|adj=on}} [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Interstate 287|I-287]] north of New York City. I-287 covers another {{convert|29.76|mi|2}} (including the {{convert|18.86|mi|2}} shared with I-87), while [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] spans {{convert|21.24|mi|2}} and [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]] covers {{convert|15.01|mi|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt;

All highways maintained by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) lack the [[reference marker (New York)|reference marker]]s that exist on all [[New York State Department of Transportation]]-maintained roads, as would be expected. In their place, NYSTA-controlled roadways use small, square tenth-mile markers with a white background and blue numbering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/signshop58.shtml |title=Improved Thruway Guidance, Part 2: Coinciding with the Interstate Designations |last=Wing |first=J.P. |date=September 8, 2009 |work=Upstate N.Y. Roads |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These markers differ from the white-on-green reference markers used by NYSDOT on state-maintained highways, which are {{convert|10|in|0}} high and {{convert|8|in|0}} wide and display a limited amount of mileage information on their third row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reference Marker Manual |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/engineering/design/dqab/dqab-repository/RefMarkerManual.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |month=January |year=1996 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |pages=3â5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainline===
{{See also|Interstate 87|Interstate 90 in New York}}

====South of Albany====
The mainline of the Thruway begins, both in terms of [[exit number]]s and mileposts, at the boundary between the [[Borough (New York City)|New York City borough]] of [[the Bronx]] and the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] city of [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt; Here, I-87 changes from the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] to the Thruway as the mainline proceeds northward through Yonkers and southern Westchester County. It connects with Central Park Avenue ([[New York State Route 100|NY&amp;nbsp;100]]) at exit&amp;nbsp;1, the first of 12 exits within the county. The Thruway generally parallels the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] north to [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]], where it meets I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). I-287 joins the Thruway here, following I-87 west across the [[Hudson River]] into [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot;&gt;{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&amp;lat=42.005649&amp;lon=-76.77026&amp;zoom=9&amp;q1=40.905778%2C-73.878039&amp;q2=42.632699%2C-73.780986&amp;q3=42.252738%2C-79.761894 |title=overview map of the New York State Thruway mainline |accessdate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TappanZeeBridgeFromBelow.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Tappan Zee Bridge (I-87 and I-287)]]

I-87 and I-287 remain [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped through the densely populated southern portion of Rockland County, meeting the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] and the New York segment of the [[Garden State Parkway]] at exits&amp;nbsp;13 and&amp;nbsp;14, respectively, before separating at a large [[semi-directional T interchange]] (exit&amp;nbsp;15) near the [[New Jersey]] border. At this point, I-287 heads south into New Jersey while I-87 and the Thruway turn northward into the valley of the [[Ramapo River]]. The highway continues north through the river valley toward [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]], where it encounters the [[Woodbury, Orange County, New York|Woodbury]] toll barrier, the southeastern end of the mainline's major closed ticket system. The barrier is located on the mainline within exit&amp;nbsp;16 ([[New York State Route 17|NY&amp;nbsp;17]]), a [[trumpet interchange]]. Along with the mainline barrier in Harriman, a separate toll plaza exists on the exit&amp;nbsp;16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY&amp;nbsp;17 exit&amp;nbsp;131 ([[New York State Route 32|NY&amp;nbsp;32]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

Now a completely [[toll road|tolled]] highway, the Thruway heads northward, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river's west as it serves the [[Newburgh (city), New York|city of Newburgh]], the [[New Paltz (village), New York|village of New Paltz]], and the city of [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], indirectly connecting to the short [[Interstate 587|I-587]] in the latter. Past Kingston, the highway runs closer to the river as it parallels [[U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;9W]] (US&amp;nbsp;9W) through the vicinity of the villages of [[Catskill (village), New York|Catskill]], [[Coxsackie (village), New York|Coxsackie]], and [[Ravena, New York|Ravena]]. Just north of Ravena, the Thruway meets the west end of the Berkshire Connector, a spur linking the Thruway mainline to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] {{convert|25|mi|0}} to the east. The highway continues into [[Albany, New York|Albany]], where it connects to [[Troy, New York|Troy]] via [[Interstate 787|I-787]] at exit&amp;nbsp;23 and intersects [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] at exit&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt; The latter of the two junctions is the busiest of the Thruway's exits, serving an estimated 27&amp;nbsp;million vehicles a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=At a transportation crossroad |newspaper=[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]] |location=[[Albany, New York]] |date=October 26, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010 |page=56 |url=http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=6428652}}&lt;/ref&gt; I-87 leaves the Thruway mainline here while I-90 merges into it, following the Thruway northwestward toward [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:NewYorkStateThruway(I-87).jpg|thumb|300px|right|The New York State Thruway ([[Interstate 87|I-87]]) looking east from Nordkop Mountain in [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]].]]

====Albany to Syracuse====
South of Schenectady, but still in [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], the Thruway and I-90 meet [[Interstate 890|I-890]], a loop route of I-90 that directly serves the downtown district of Schenectady, at exit&amp;nbsp;25. The Thruway, meanwhile, bypasses the city to the south and west, intersecting [[Interstate 88 (east)|I-88]] at exit&amp;nbsp;25A in [[Rotterdam (town), New York|Rotterdam]] before reuniting with I-890 at exit&amp;nbsp;26 west of [[Scotia, New York|Scotia]]. From this point west to [[Utica, New York|Utica]], the mainline of the Thruway parallels the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Mohawk River]], crossing over the waterbodies at [[Mohawk, Herkimer County, New York|Mohawk]]. In between Schenectady and Utica, I-90 and the Thruway serve several riverside communities, including the cities of [[Amsterdam, New York|Amsterdam]] (exit&amp;nbsp;27 via [[New York State Route 30|NY&amp;nbsp;30]]) and [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls]] (exit&amp;nbsp;29A, [[New York State Route 169|NY&amp;nbsp;169]]) and the villages of [[Fonda, New York|Fonda]] (exit&amp;nbsp;28, [[New York State Route 30A|NY&amp;nbsp;30A]]), [[Canajoharie (village), New York|Canajoharie]] (exit&amp;nbsp;29, [[New York State Route 5S|NY&amp;nbsp;5S]] and [[New York State Route 10|NY&amp;nbsp;10]]), and Mohawk (exit&amp;nbsp;30, [[New York State Route 28|NY&amp;nbsp;28]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

Like Schenectady before it, the Thruway bypasses downtown Utica, following an alignment north of the city while [[Interstate 790|I-790]] serves it directly. I-790 breaks from the Thruway at exit&amp;nbsp;31 and runs along two carriageways flanking the mainline on both sides for {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} before turning southward onto the NorthâSouth Arterial. The adjacent highways become [[New York State Route 49|NY&amp;nbsp;49]], which parallel the Thruway for another {{convert|2|mi|1}} northwestward. At the end of this stretch, the Thruway turns slightly southwestward, crossing over the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal while NY&amp;nbsp;49 continues northwestward along the northern bank of the waterbodies toward [[Rome, New York|Rome]]. On the other side of the river, the Thruway curves back to the west, proceeding to exit&amp;nbsp;32 in [[Westmoreland, New York|Westmoreland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Interstate 90 Looking East.jpg|thumb|left|250px|I-90, part of the New York State Thruway, looking east near Syracuse]]

Not far to the west, the Thruway has a junction with [[New York State Route 365|NY&amp;nbsp;365]] at exit&amp;nbsp;33 in [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Here, the Thruway connects to the cities of Rome and [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]] and serves the [[Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino]] via NY&amp;nbsp;365. The highway continues onward through a sparsely populated area between Verona and Syracuse, passing roughly {{convert|5|mi|0}} south of [[Oneida Lake]] as it connects to the village of [[Canastota, New York|Canastota]] by way of [[New York State Route 13|NY&amp;nbsp;13]] at exit&amp;nbsp;34. As the highway approaches exit&amp;nbsp;34A ([[Interstate 481|I-481]]) outside of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], the surroundings become more developed. The level of development rises sharply west of I-481 as the Thruway enters [[Salina, New York|Salina]], a northern suburb of Syracuse. Within Salina, I-90 and the Thruway intersect [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]], which connects the Thruway to both [[downtown Syracuse]] and [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

====Syracuse to Buffalo====
West of Salina, the Thruway passes north of [[Liverpool, New York|Liverpool]] and [[Onondaga Lake]] before intersecting [[Interstate 690|I-690]] and its northern continuation, [[New York State Route 690|NY&amp;nbsp;690]], at exit&amp;nbsp;39 in [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]]. At this point, the amount of development along the Thruway sharply declines as it heads generally westward through a [[marsh]]y area of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]]. I-90 and the Thruway reconnect to the Erie Canal (here part of the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]]) at the western county line. Now in [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]], the highway serves [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]] via exit&amp;nbsp;40 and [[New York State Route 34|NY&amp;nbsp;34]] and passes north of [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]] prior to entering [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] and the [[Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge]]. Here, the canal leaves the Thruway for good, turning northwestward to follow the [[New York State Route 31|NY&amp;nbsp;31]] corridor to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and beyond.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

The portion of the Thruway between [[Montezuma, New York|Montezuma]] and the Rochester area is one of mostly rural nature, with the highway passing through remote, open fields, and for the most part avoiding highly-populated areas. Along this stretch, it connects to two cities, both located well to the south of the Thruway: [[Geneva (city), New York|Geneva]] by way of exit&amp;nbsp;42 for [[New York State Route 14|NY&amp;nbsp;14]] and [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]] by way of exit&amp;nbsp;43 via [[New York State Route 21|NY&amp;nbsp;21]]. The next exit along the highway, exit&amp;nbsp;44 for [[New York State Route 332|NY&amp;nbsp;332]], also serves Canandaigua; the junction is the primary exit for Canandaigua-bound travelers from the Rochester area. Here, the Thruway temporarily widens from four to six lanes as it continues generally westward to meet [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] at exit&amp;nbsp;45 near [[Victor (village), New York|Victor]]. Like in the vicinity of Schenectady and Utica, an auxiliary route of I-90âhere I-490âdirectly serves a city (Rochester) while the Thruway bypasses it.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:I-90 exit 45 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Advance signage for exit&amp;nbsp;45 (I-490)]]

It heads northwestward through the city's southern, mostly rural suburbs to [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]], where it meets [[Interstate 390|I-390]] at exit&amp;nbsp;46. Henrietta is as close as the Thruway gets to downtown as it proceeds west to [[Le Roy (town), New York|Le Roy]], where I-490 reconnects to I-90 at exit&amp;nbsp;47. I-90 continues onward into [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee County]], intersecting with [[New York State Route 98|NY&amp;nbsp;98]] at exit&amp;nbsp;48 north of [[Batavia (city), New York|Batavia]] and [[New York State Route 77|NY&amp;nbsp;77]] at exit&amp;nbsp;48A in [[Pembroke, New York|Pembroke]]. The latter exit provides access to [[Darien Lake]], a large amusement park located in the town of [[Darien, New York|Darien]]. I-90 and the Thruway continue into [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] area. It meets [[New York State Route 78|NY&amp;nbsp;78]] at exit&amp;nbsp;49 near [[Depew, New York|Depew]] before passing through the [[Williamsville, New York|Williamsville]] toll barrier, the northwestern end of the major closed ticket system.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

====West of Buffalo====
Just west of the toll barrier, I-90 and the Thruwayânow toll-freeâconnect to [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]] via exit&amp;nbsp;50, a semi-directional T interchange. At this point, the Thruway turns southward, passing through the immediate eastern suburbs of Buffalo. As it heads south, it meets the [[Kensington Expressway]] ([[New York State Route 33|NY&amp;nbsp;33]]) at exit&amp;nbsp;51 and Walden Avenue at exit&amp;nbsp;52, both [[cloverleaf interchange]]s. At exit&amp;nbsp;52, it passes to the west of the [[Walden Galleria]], a shopping mall situated at the nearby junction of Walden Avenue and [[New York State Route 277|NY&amp;nbsp;277]]. Two exits later in southern [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]], I-90 meets [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]], a spur route leading to downtown Buffalo and [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], at exit&amp;nbsp;53.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

South of the city, the Thruway meets the [[Aurora Expressway]] ([[New York State Route 400|NY&amp;nbsp;400]]) and the [[Southern Expressway (New York)|Southern Expressway]] ([[U.S. Route 219 (New York)|US&amp;nbsp;219]]) at exits&amp;nbsp;54 and&amp;nbsp;55, respectively, in [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]]. Just southwest of exit&amp;nbsp;55, I-90 and the Thruway pass through the [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] toll barrier, which serves as the northeast end of the minor closed ticket system. Once again a toll road, the Thruway heads southwestward, roughly paralleling the shoreline of [[Lake Erie]] to [[Blasdell, New York|Blasdell]], where it connects to [[New York State Route 179|NY&amp;nbsp;179]] (the Milestrip Expressway). Farther southwestward, the Thruway is joined by [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&amp;nbsp;20]], which follows a parallel routing to that of the Thruway to the [[New York â Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

As the route passes from Erie County to [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], the last on its routing, it cuts through the northwestern portion of the [[Cattaraugus Indian Reservation]], situated on [[Cattaraugus Creek]]. The Thruway continues alongside US&amp;nbsp;20 past [[Dunkirk (city), New York|Dunkirk]] and [[Westfield (village), New York|Westfield]] to the [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] toll barrier, the southwestern end of the minor closed ticket system just northeast of exit&amp;nbsp;61 for Shortman Road. The Thruway ends about {{convert|1|mi|1}} after exit&amp;nbsp;61 at the Pennsylvania state line. I-90, however, [[Interstate 90 (Pennsylvania)|continues onward]] into Pennsylvania as a toll-free highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-main&quot; /&gt;

===Berkshire Connector===
{{See also|Interstate 90 in New York}}
The Berkshire Connector is a {{convert|24.28|mi|2|adj=on}} east&amp;ndash;west spur connecting the Thruway mainline in [[Coeymans, New York|Coeymans]] to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] at the [[Massachusetts]] state line in [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt; It is tolled as part of the closed ticket system in place on the mainline between exits&amp;nbsp;16 and&amp;nbsp;50. The highway begins at exit&amp;nbsp;21A off the Thruway southwest of [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]] in the town of Coeymans (south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]])&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-berks&quot;&gt;{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&amp;lat=42.43105&amp;lon=-73.60159&amp;zoom=12&amp;q1=42.509224%2C-73.790975&amp;q2=42.347958%2C-73.412236 |title=overview map of the Berkshire Connector |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as NY&amp;nbsp;912M, an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2009log&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/2009%20tour-bk.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Bicycling Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, &amp; Commemorative/Memorial Designations in New York State |author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |month=January |year=2009 |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proceeds eastward over the [[Hudson River]] and into [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]] by way of the [[Castleton-on-Hudson Bridge]]. It navigates through the southern, rural portion of the county to exit&amp;nbsp;B1 in [[Schodack, New York|Schodack]], where the connector meets I-90.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-berks&quot; /&gt; The [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] NY&amp;nbsp;912M designation terminates here while I-90 joins the Berkshire Connector and follows the spur east into [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2009log&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-berks&quot; /&gt;

While the Rensselaer County segment follows a mostly east&amp;ndash;west routing, the Berkshire Connector in Columbia County takes on a northwest-southeast alignment as the roadway heads towards exit&amp;nbsp;B2 in [[East Chatham, New York|East Chatham]]. The junction serves as the northern terminus of the [[Taconic State Parkway]], which connects the spur to the [[New York City]] area. About {{convert|2|mi|1}} to the southeast is the [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]] toll barrier, which marks the end of the Thruway ticket system. The last exit on the Berkshire Connector is exit&amp;nbsp;B3 for [[New York State Route 22|NY&amp;nbsp;22]] just west of the [[Massachusetts]] state line in [[Canaan, New York|Canaan]]. The spur continues east to the state line, where it becomes the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-berks&quot; /&gt;

===Garden State Parkway Connector===
The Garden State Parkway Connector is a {{convert|2.40|mi|2|adj=on}} highway that connects the Thruway mainline with the [[Garden State Parkway]] at the [[New Jersey]] state line at [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] via exit&amp;nbsp;14A.&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt; It is designated as NY&amp;nbsp;982L, an unsigned reference route.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009log&quot; /&gt; The highway begins, in terms of mileposts, at Thruway ([[Interstate 87|I-87]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]]) exit&amp;nbsp;14A in Ramapo and heads generally southwestward as a toll-free highway toward the state line. Just north of the state line, the southbound connector meets Red Schoolhouse Road ([[County Route 41 (Rockland County, New York)|County Route&amp;nbsp;41]] or CR&amp;nbsp;41) at a partial [[diamond interchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-gsp&quot;&gt;{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&amp;lat=41.083825&amp;lon=-74.044625&amp;zoom=15&amp;q1=41.100956%2C-74.032353&amp;q2=41.066619%2C-74.056922 |title=overview map of the Garden State Parkway Connector |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All commercial traffic is forced to exit here as the Garden State Parkway prohibits commercial traffic north of exit&amp;nbsp;105. Thus, the final {{convert|0.31|mi|2}} of the road south of the Schoolhouse Road exit is the only part of the Thruway system that prohibits commercial vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commercial Services: TOPS: Invalid Routes |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |date=February 15, 2002 |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/commercial/tops/invalid-routes.html |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connector continues to the state line, where it becomes the tolled Garden State Parkway.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo-gsp&quot; /&gt;

===Other components===
The New York State Thruway system also consists of three other components: the [[Cross Westchester Expressway]], the [[New England Thruway]], and the [[Niagara Thruway]]. The Cross Westchester Expressway, part of I-287, begins at I-87 exit&amp;nbsp;8 in [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]], where I-287 splits from the Thruway mainline, and travels east across [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]], with connections to both the New England Thruway and the [[Connecticut Turnpike]] at exit&amp;nbsp;12 in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]]. The New England Thruway (NET) is a {{convert|15.01|mi|2|adj=on}} section of I-95 under the operation and maintenance of the New York State Thruway Authority. It begins at the [[Pelham Parkway]] interchange (exit&amp;nbsp;8) in the [[Co-Op City]] section of the [[Bronx]] and continues northeastward into [[Westchester County]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line, where it connects to the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]. The Niagara Thruway comprises the first {{convert|21.24|mi|2}} of [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] from I-90 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to [[New York State Route 384|NY&amp;nbsp;384]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mileage&quot; /&gt;

==History==
===Origins and construction===
A toll [[superhighway]] connecting the major cities of the state of [[New York]] that would become part of a larger nationwide highway network was proposed as early as 1949. The following year, the [[New York State Legislature]] passed the [[Thruway Authority Act]] creating the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), an independent [[public corporation]], which would build and manage the turnpike. The project was to be financed through [[toll revenue bond]]s and self-liquidating by receipt of tolls, rents, concessions, and other income. The act also stipulated NYSTA adopt a hybrid system of tolls, with barrier tolls collected in urban areas, and long-distance tickets issued in rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;nycr-nyst&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/thruway/ |title=New York State Thruway |last=Anderson |first=Steve |work=NYCRoads |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the Thruway, between [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], opened on June&amp;nbsp;24, 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;opening&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Across The Map |last=Dales |first=Douglas |date=June 20, 1954 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |pages=XX21 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sections of the {{convert|426|mi|0|sing=on}} mainline between [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[the Bronx]] were completed and opened throughout 1954 and 1955. The last segment, from [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] south to the Bronx, was completed on August&amp;nbsp;31, 1956. The total cost was $600&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|600000000|1956|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), financed by the sale of $972 million in bonds (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|972000000|1956|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;nycr-nyst&quot; /&gt;{{Inflation-fn|US}} At the time, it was the longest toll road in the world. In 1957, the mainline was extended {{convert|70|mi|0}} west from Buffalo along [[Lake Erie]] to the [[New York â Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]]. From 1957 to 1960, several spurs of the road were built to connect the road to turnpikes in adjacent states. These were the Berkshire Connector, which linked to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], the [[New England Thruway]], which connected to the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], and the [[Niagara Thruway]], a spur leading to [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nycr-nyst&quot; /&gt;

On August&amp;nbsp;14, 1957, the [[Interstate Highway System]] was established. The segment of the mainline between the Pennsylvania border and the [[Adirondack Northway]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] became part of [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] while the portions from the Northway south to [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] and from [[Elmsford, New York|Elmsford]] south to the [[New York City]] line were included in [[Interstate 87|I-87]]. The eastern half of the Berkshire Connector also became part of I-90, creating a gap in the I-90 designation around Albany. The entirety of the New England Thruway became part of [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]] while the Niagara Thruway became [[Interstate 90N|I-90N]], and later [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1957map&quot;&gt;{{cite map |publisher=[[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |title=[[:File:Interstate Highway plan August 14, 1957.jpg|Official route numbering for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways]] |date=August 14, 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1960map&quot;&gt;{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide&lt;!--sic--&gt; Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elmsfordâ[[Suffern, New York|Suffern]] section of the mainline was designated as part of [[Interstate 287|I-287]] by 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;1960map&quot; /&gt; The last section of the mainline to receive a designationâfrom Suffern to Newburghâfinally received one on January&amp;nbsp;1, 1970, when I-87 was realigned to follow the Thruway between the two locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf |title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State |date=January 1, 1970 |author=[[State of New York Department of Transportation]] |format=PDF |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highway was unique in that original signage utilized dark blue backgrounds, the same color blue as displayed on the [[Flag of New York|New York state flag]]. Over time, these signs were replaced with [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA)-approved green backgrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;nycr-nyst&quot; /&gt;

===System expansion===
After the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] was built in 1952, the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]] (NJTA) and NYSTA proposed a {{convert|13|mi|0|adj=on}} extension of the New Jersey Turnpike that would go from its end (at [[U.S. Route 46|US&amp;nbsp;46]] in [[Ridgefield Park, New Jersey]], at the time) up to [[West Nyack, New York|West Nyack]] at the Thruway. The portion through New Jersey was to be constructed and maintained by NJTA, while the portion in New York was to be built and maintained by NYSTA. The purpose of this extension was to give motorists a &quot;more direct bypass of the New York City area&quot; to [[New England]] by using the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]]. The extension was to parallel [[New York State Route 303|NY&amp;nbsp;303]] and the [[Conrail]]-owned [[River Line (Conrail)|River Line]], and have limited interchanges, one of which would be with the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. By 1970, it became too expensive to buy right-of-way access, and community opposition was fierce. Therefore, NJTA and NYSTA cancelled the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/nj-turnpike/ |title=New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) |first=Steve |last=Anderson |work=NYCRoads |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the state of New York sold the [[Cross Westchester Expressway]] (part of I-287) to NYSTA for $20&amp;nbsp;million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|20000000|1990|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in an effort to balance the state's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/01/nyregion/panel-studies-new-role-for-thruway-authority.html |title=Panel Studies New Role For Thruway Authority |date=May 1, 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/07/nyregion/political-talk.html |title=Political Talk |last=Lynn |first=Frank |date=April 7, 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Inflation-fn|US}} Similarly, in 1991, the Authority was directed to assume the cost of operating and maintaining the {{convert|71|mi|0|adj=on}} segment of [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84 in New York]], which runs east&amp;ndash;west from the Pennsylvania state line at Port Jervis to the Connecticut state line at Brewster.&lt;ref name=&quot;upkeep&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070920/BIZ/709200321/-1/NEWS03 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |location=[[Middletown, Orange County, New York]] |first=Judy |last=Rife |title=Thruway retains I-84 upkeep |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement made at this time between NYSTA and the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) allowed NYSTA to transfer I-84 back to the state at any point after 1996 provided that the Thruway Authority gave NYSDOT a one-year notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061030/BIZ/610300338 |title=I-84 maintenance could be at stake |last=Rife |first=Judy |date=October 30, 2006 |newspaper=Times Herald-Record |location=Middletown, Orange County, New York |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, state officials also investigated the possibility of having NYSTA take over ownership and maintenance of all or part of New York's [[Interstate Highway]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-panel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/01/nyregion/panel-studies-new-role-for-thruway-authority.html |title=Panel Studies New Role For Thruway Authority |date=May 1, 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toll elimination and I-84===
All tolls along the Thruway were supposed to be abolished when the construction [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s used to build it had been paid off.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-panel&quot; /&gt; The last of the bonds were paid off in 1996; however, the tolls remained in place after the [[New York State Legislature]] transferred ownership of the [[New York State Canal System]] to NYSTA in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/opinions/1996/08/20/1996-08-20_highway_robbery_on_the_thruw.html |title=Highway Robbery on the Thruway |date=August 20, 1996 |newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location=[[New York City]] |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:I-84 NYSTA maintenance sign.jpg|left|thumb|Thruway Authority maintenance sign at onramps on I-84]]
Roughly one week before the November 2006 elections, NYSTA accepted $14&amp;nbsp;million from the [[New York State Senate|State Senate]] in exchange for agreeing to cease the collection of tolls at the Black Rock and City Line toll barriers on the Niagara Thruway (I-190) in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] for one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rife&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070106/BIZ/701060310 |title=Senator Bonacic fights move on I-84 maintenance |last=Rife |first=Judy |date=January 6, 2007 |newspaper=Times Herald-Record |location=Middletown, Orange County, New York |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October&amp;nbsp;30, 2006, NYSTA voted to permanently remove the tolls. Both major candidates in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 gubernatorial election]], Democrat and eventual victor [[Eliot Spitzer]] and Republican [[John Faso]], had pledged to remove the tolls on I-190 if elected. In order to offset the lost toll revenue, NYSTA also voted to return maintenance of I-84 to NYSDOT,&lt;ref name=&quot;buff-toll&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://buffalo.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2006/10/30/daily8.html |title=I-190 tolls in rear-view mirror |newspaper=[[Business First of Buffalo]] |first=James |last=Fink |date=October 30, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the annual maintenance cost of I-84 was considered to be equal to the amount of annual revenue generated from the Buffalo toll barriersâapproximately $14&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061027/BIZ/610270374/-1/NEWS |title=Don't mince words on I-84 deal |date=October 27, 2006 |newspaper=Times Herald-Record |location=Middletown, Orange County, New York |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the 1991 agreement between NYSTA and NYSDOT, maintenance of I-84 would become the responsibility of the DOT on October&amp;nbsp;30, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;upkeep&quot; /&gt;

In January 2007, State Senator [[John Bonacic]] of [[Mount Hope, New York|Mount Hope]] began drafting legislation to halt the planned transfer of maintenance of I-84. Bonacic asserted that the Thruway Authority had better maintenance practices than NYSDOT, most notably in the field of snow removal. He also claimed that the DOT lacked the time and money needed to match the quality of maintenance that NYSTA performed on I-84.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rife&quot;/&gt; The senator eventually prevailed as the 2007â2008 budget was modified to allocate additional funding to NYSDOT, which would then pay the Thruway Authority to maintain I-84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070331/BIZ/703310325/-1/NEWS |title=Bonacic wins war over I-84; Thruway Authority to remain in charge |last=Rife |first=Judy |date=March 31, 2007 |newspaper=Times Herald-Record |location=Middletown, Orange County, New York |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal agreement between the two agencies was reached on September&amp;nbsp;19.

===Other developments===
[[Image:I90metric.gif|thumb|upright|In the late 1970s, NYSTA experimented with all-metric signage in the [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] area, such as these signs at exit&amp;nbsp;35.]]
In 1964, the New York State Legislature officially renamed the Thruway in honor of [[Thomas E. Dewey]], the [[Governor of New York]] at the time of the Thruway's opening. The official designation is, however, rarely used in reference to the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thruway Named for Gov.

In August 1993, NYSTA became the first agency to implement the [[E-ZPass]] electronic toll collection system.&lt;ref name=&quot;nycr-nyst&quot; /&gt; By December 1996, it was implemented at all of the Thruway's fixed-toll barriers and at exits along the Berkshire Connector and the New York City&amp;nbsp;â Buffalo section of the mainline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thruway Chronology |url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history6.shtml |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |year=2002 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |chapter=The New York State Thruway: 1991â2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-ZPass was installed at all of the mainline exits by March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/12/nyregion/installation-e-z-pass-system-turnpike-parkway-expected-take-2-years.html |title=Installation of E-Z Pass System on Turnpike and Parkway Is Expected to Take 2 Years |last=Preston |first=Jennifer |date=March 12, 1998 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2010, a new E-ZPass configuration, consisting of two highway speed E-ZPass lanes in each direction, became operational at the Woodbury toll plaza, with concrete barriers separating the faster traffic from the staffed toll lanes necessary for vehicles not equipped for E-ZPass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/projectsandstudies/projects/woodbury/index.html |title=Woodbury Mobility Improvement Project |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar project is in development at the Williamsville toll plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thruway.ny.gov/projectsandstudies/projects/williamsville/about.html |title=About the Project |work=Williamsville Toll Barrier Improvement Project |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 NYSDOT, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] and NYSTA discussed redesignating the Berkshire Connector as I-90 and redesignating the non-toll part of I-90 from Thruway exit&amp;nbsp;24 to exit&amp;nbsp;B1 as [[Interstate 88 (east)|I-88]]. The section of the Thruway between exit&amp;nbsp;25 and&amp;nbsp;24 would then be designated as both I-90 and I-88. This was never implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |page=22 |title=Hudson River Crossing Study |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=December 25, 2009 |publisher=Capital District Transportation Committee and New York State Department of Transportation |author=Bergman Assocatiates |url=http://www.cdtcmpo.org/linkage/hudson/final.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NYSTA also operates the Thruway Authority [[highway advisory radio|Highway Advisory Radio]] (HAR) system, a network of radio stations across the state that broadcast information on traffic conditions along the Thruway. The system broadcasts at 1610&amp;nbsp;AM in the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], and [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] areas, 1620&amp;nbsp;AM in the [[Finger Lakes]] and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] areas, 530&amp;nbsp;AM in the [[New York City metropolitan area]], 540&amp;nbsp;AM in the vicinity of [[Utica, New York|Utica]], and at 98.7&amp;nbsp;FM in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]]. HAR is also used to broadcast [[Amber Alert]]s if one is issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/travelers/har/index.html |title=Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) Coverage |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

[[Image:New York Thruway Toll Ticket.jpg|thumb|upright|A New York State Thruway toll ticket obtained at exit&amp;nbsp;25A]]
All components of the New York State Thruway system except for the Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross Westchester Expressway are tolled in some capacity. The [[New York City|New York]]&amp;nbsp;â [[Ripley, New York|Ripley]] mainline employs both an open, [[barrier toll system|barrier-based]] tolling system and a closed, ticket-based tolling system. From the New York City line to the [[New York State Route 17|NY&amp;nbsp;17]] exit near [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]], there are three [[toll barrier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-sch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/tolls/tollschedules/scheduleacash.pdf |title=New York State Thruway Toll Schedule |year=2010 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-barr&quot; /&gt; From there northward, a closed system is employed where drivers must obtain tickets which show their point of entry and the cost of traveling from there to their desired point of exit. Upon exiting the Thruway, the ticket must be surrendered and the appropriate toll must be paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-sch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-tolls&quot; /&gt; Two separate closed systems are used on the Thruway mainline, encompassing all of the mainline between Harriman and the [[New York â Pennsylvania border|Pennsylvania state line]] except for a section in and around [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-sch&quot; /&gt;

The southernmost of the three toll barriers is the [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] toll barrier, a bi-directional barrier between exits&amp;nbsp;6A and&amp;nbsp;7 in Yonkers. In [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]], there is a southbound-only barrier for the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]]. Lastly, there is a northbound, commercial traffic-only barrier in [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-barr&quot; /&gt; The closed ticket system originally began at the Spring Valley toll barrier&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-tolls&quot; /&gt; but was moved to exit&amp;nbsp;16 on March&amp;nbsp;3, 1974, allowing interchanges along the Thruway in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] to be free of tolls. The toll plaza at Suffern was dismantled along with this change.&lt;ref name=&quot;thru-hist4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Thruway Chronology |url=http://www.upstatenyroads.com/thruway-history4.shtml |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |year=2002 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |chapter=The New York State Thruway: 1971â1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Harriman, the longer of the two closed, ticket-based systems begins and extends from NY&amp;nbsp;17 to just east of exit&amp;nbsp;50 in [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]]. The Berkshire Connector is enclosed within this ticket system, so traveling between the mainline and the connector via exit&amp;nbsp;21A does not involve crossing a toll barrier, and the connector's exits up to the toll barrier at exit&amp;nbsp;B3 are listed with the mainline exits on tickets for the major closed system. The other system encompasses the portion of the mainline between exit&amp;nbsp;56 south of Buffalo and exit&amp;nbsp;61 near the Pennsylvania state line.&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-sch&quot; /&gt;

To distinguish between exit&amp;nbsp;16 and the Woodbury toll barrier, Thruway tickets list the NY&amp;nbsp;17 interchange as exit&amp;nbsp;16 and the Woodbury toll plaza as exit&amp;nbsp;15, although the actual exit&amp;nbsp;15 is situated almost {{convert|15|mi|0}} to the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-sch&quot; /&gt; Northbound traffic on I-87 traveling through the Woodbury toll barrier is given a ticket while travelers on southbound I-87 must surrender their ticket and pay the appropriate toll. Traffic heading south on I-87 and exiting at exit&amp;nbsp;16 must pay the appropriate toll for exit&amp;nbsp;16 at the Harriman toll plaza. Similarly, traffic heading north on I-87 and exiting at exit&amp;nbsp;16 must pay a fixed-rate toll at the Harriman plaza. Traffic entering the Thruway from NY&amp;nbsp;17 east must pay a fixed-rate toll at the Harriman barrier and, if traveling north, collect a ticket at the Woodbury barrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;thru-hist4&quot; /&gt; The ticket is identical to that given for exit&amp;nbsp;15 with the exception that the toll for exit&amp;nbsp;16 is subtracted from all of the prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thruway.ny.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&amp;Entry=m15a&amp;Exit=m19x&amp;is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |title=Toll and Distance Calculator â From Exit 15A to Exit 19 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thruway.ny.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&amp;Entry=m16x&amp;Exit=m19x&amp;is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |title=Toll and Distance Calculator â From Exit 16 to Exit 19 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thruway toll barrier at Williamsville NY.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching the Williamsville toll barrier on I-90&amp;nbsp;/ Thruway westbound]]
The other components of the system that are tolled have far fewer tolls. On the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]), there is a single, fixed-rate toll barrier on I-95 northbound in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]]. Meanwhile, the only tolls along the [[Niagara Thruway]] ([[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]) are those for major bridges along the highway, namely the [[North Grand Island Bridge|North]] and [[South Grand Island Bridge]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-barr&quot; /&gt;

===Cost===
When the Thruway opened in the mid-1950s, the cost to travel from Buffalo to New York City was $5.60 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|5.60|1954|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). The closed ticket system, which at the time extended from Spring Valley to [[Williamsville, New York|Williamsville]], accounted for $5 of the toll, while the remaining $0.60 was charged at the Yonkers ($0.10) and Tappan Zee ($0.50) toll barriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-tolls&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Collecting The Tolls |date=June 20, 1954 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=XX10 |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Inflation-fn|US}} As of April 2010, this trip costs $24.60: $18.35 for the closed ticket system from Williamsville to Woodbury, $5 for the Tappan Zee Bridge, and $1.25 for the Yonkers toll barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&amp;Entry=m50x&amp;Exit=m00x&amp;is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |title=Toll and Distance Calculator â From Exit 50 to New York City Line |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the south end of the major closed ticket system was moved from Spring Valley to Woodbury, the Spring Valley toll barrier became a fixed-rate toll for both cars and trucks.&lt;ref name=&quot;thru-hist4&quot; /&gt; The toll for cars was removed in July 1997. At the time, the toll was $0.40 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|0.40|1997|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tappan Zee Car Toll To Rise to $3 in July |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/28/nyregion/tappan-zee-car-toll-to-rise-to-3-in-july.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 28, 1997 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2010, the Berkshire Connector costs $0.85 to travel between the [[Massachusetts]] state line and exit&amp;nbsp;B1. Tolls west of exit&amp;nbsp;B1 vary based on which direction a motorist travels on I-87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&amp;Entry=bXx&amp;Exit=b1x&amp;is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |title=Toll and Distance Calculator â From Massachusetts State Line to Exit B1 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toll on the minor closed ticket system from Pennsylvania to exit&amp;nbsp;55 south of Buffalo is $3.15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/tolls/calc/trip.cgi?class=1&amp;Entry=mPAx&amp;Exit=m55x&amp;is_mc_mh=non_mh_mc |title=Toll and Distance Calculator â From Pennsylvania State Line to Exit 55 |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On I-190, the Grand Island Bridges cost $1 to cross while the New Rochelle toll barrier on I-95 costs $1.75 to pass through.&lt;ref name=&quot;nysta-barr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysthruway.gov/tolls/barrier.html |title=Schedule Of Cash Tolls at Fixed Toll Barriers |publisher=New York State Thruway Authority |accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Rock and City Line toll barriers on the Niagara Thruway in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] charged $0.75 at the time of their removal on October&amp;nbsp;30, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;buff-toll&quot; /&gt;
