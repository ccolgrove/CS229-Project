'''''Android 2''''' is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[List of maze video games|maze]] [[video game]] written by [[Costa Panayi]] and published by [[Vortex Software]] [[1983 in video gaming|in 1983]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[1985 in video gaming|in 1985]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000192 ''Android 2''] at [[World of Spectrum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the sequel to ''[[Android 1: The Reactor Run]]'', released earlier in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0000190 ''Android 1: The Reactor Run''] at [[World of Spectrum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The aim of the game is to destroy five Millitoids â large [[worm]]-like creatures â which roam a white-walled [[maze]]. The maze is also filled with other enemies, landmines, trees and other features. The Millitoids are destroyed with three shots to the head. When all five are destroyed, the player moves onto the next of three mazes.

The maze is presented in a scrolling top-down view, using the same 3D effect Costa Panayi would later use in games like ''[[Tornado Low Level]]''.

==Critical reaction==
''[[Sinclair User]]'' found the graphics to be an outstanding feature, the 3D effect being novel for an early ZX Spectrum game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/023/softwreb.htm Android 2 review] from ''Sinclair User'' issue 23; retrieved from Sinclair User Magazine Online&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' awarded 90%, also impressed with the graphics. The reviewer was also commented on the design of the maze, which includes both open spaces and tight corridors, challenging difficulty and the overall polished feel. Comparisons with ''[[3D Ant Attack]]'' were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crashonline.org.uk/02/android.htm ''Android 2'' review] from ''CRASH'' issue 2; retrieved from Crash Online&lt;/ref&gt;
