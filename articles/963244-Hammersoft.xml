The '''Iowa Hawkeyes football''' team is the interscholastic [[American football|football]] team at the [[University of Iowa]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Iowa]].  The Hawkeyes have competed in the [[Big Ten Conference]] since 1900, and are currently a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). Beginning in 2011, Iowa will compete in the Big Ten's Legends Division.

== History ==
{{main|History of Iowa Hawkeyes football}}

Football was first played as a club sport at Iowa in 1872, with intramural games against other colleges played as early as 1882, but it was not until 1889 that the [[University of Iowa]] first officially recognized a varsity football team.  In 1899, [[1899 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] completed its first undefeated football season, which led to an invitation to join the Western Conference, now known as the [[Big Ten Conference]], the following year.  In [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1900]], the [[1990 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Hawkeyes]] secured another undefeated season and won a share of the Western Conference title in their first year in the league.

Iowa claimed consecutive Big Ten titles in 1921 and 1922.  The Hawkeyes won 20 straight games in the early 1920s under the guidance of [[College Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Howard Jones (American football coach)|Howard Jones]].  Jones soon left Iowa and established a powerhouse at [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]], and the Hawkeyes were abysmal for most of the 1930s.  As a result, little was expected of Iowaâs 1939 team, led by new coach [[Eddie Anderson (American football coach)|Eddie Anderson]].  Nicknamed the âIronmenâ, the 1939 Hawkeyes scored several upset victories and vaulted into the national rankings.  Though Iowa fell a game short of the Big Ten title, team MVP [[Nile Kinnick]] won almost every major national award, including the 1939 [[Heisman Trophy]].

[[Forest Evashevski]] was hired as Iowaâs head coach in 1952.  He lured [[Cal Jones|Calvin Jones]] to Iowa, where Jones became the first Hawkeye â and the first African-American â to win the [[Outland Trophy]] in 1955.  From 1956 to 1960, Evashevski led Iowa to four finishes in the top five of the national rankings, three Big Ten Conference titles, two Rose Bowl victories, and the 1958 [[Football Writers Association of America|FWAA]] national championship.  After the 1960 season, Evashevski left coaching to become Iowaâs athletic director.  The result was nineteen consecutive non-winning seasons for the Hawkeyes from 1962 to 1980.

Four head coaches after Evashevski were hired and left without success.  [[College Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Hayden Fry]] was hired after the 1978 season to try to reverse Iowaâs fortunes.  After decades of losing, Fry revived the Iowa program.  In 20 years at Iowa, he led the Hawks to 14 bowl games, three Big Ten titles, and three Rose Bowl appearances.  Fry retired in 1998, turning the program over to former assistant [[Kirk Ferentz]].  Ferentz led Iowa to three consecutive top ten finishes from 2002 to 2004 and two Big Ten titles.  The Hawkeyes have played in eight bowl games in the past nine seasons and in 22 bowl games over the last 29 seasons. Iowa has cracked the top 25 at the end of the season five times during the Kirk Ferentz era - No. 8 in 2002&amp;ndash;04, No. 20 in 2008, and No. 7 in 2009. Iowa will begin its 122nd season of football, and its 111th season in the Big Ten, in 2010. Among the legends that Fry left behind is the iconic pink visitors locker room, as well as a statement he made the day he started as Iowa Head Coach that he would take the team to a bowl game within four years, or he would step down. He would not only succeed in his boast, by sending Iowa to the 1982 [[1982 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], he would do it in three years, coming in one year under his statement.

== The &quot;Lean&quot; years ==

Iowa has had several successful coaches.  Forest Evashevski won the Rose Bowl twice when he coached from the late 1950s until 1961, when he retired.  Hayden Fry came to Iowa in 1978.  Kirk Ferentz coached after Hayden Fry retired.  In the interim years though, there were eighteen years without a winning season.  

Jerry Burns coached after Evashevski retired.  He had a 16-27-2 record.  Ray Nagel followed from 1966-1970 with a 16-32-2 record.  Frank Lauterbur followed, coaching from 1971 -1973 with a 4-28-1 record, with a 0-11 record in 1973.  Bob Commings coached the Hawkeyes from 1974-1978.  His record was 17 wins and 38 losses. 

Ray Nagel finally won a game in his last year of coaching.  He was quoted, âYou can beat an egg, you can beat a rug, but you canât beat a win.â  This quote probably showed the sense of relief the coach felt for finally winning a game.

== Notable Games ==
=== 1953 #20 Iowa vs #9 Notre Dame ===
On Nov. 21, 1953 undefeated and #1 Notre Dame were set to face the Hawkeyes in South Bend. The score was 0-0 when, in the first quarter, Iowa DB Dusty Rice intercepted the Irish. The Hawkeyes drove the ball 72-yards for an Iowa touchdown and a 7-0 lead. With only 2 seconds left in the first half, Irish tackle [[Frank Varrichione]] fell down with an 'injury'. This stopped the clock (Notre Dame had no time outs left). Varrichione went in that same play and the Irish scored on a touchdown pass to Dan Shannon, to tie the game 7-7 at the half. With the score still deadlocked late into the fourth quarter, Iowa intercepted a pass on their own 48-yard line. The Hawkeyes then scored on a touchdown pass to end [[Frank Gilliam]] to give the Hawkeyes a 14-7 lead with only 2:06 left in the game. Notre Dame, having no time outs, was certainly 'up against it' and 'the breaks' were most definitely 'beating the boys'. However, without the Gipper's magic, Notre Dame was forced to use questionable tactics. With only 6 seconds left and the clock ticking away [[Frank Varrichione]] came down with another 'injury' which stopped the clock (again he went back in that very same play). Notre Dame then scored a touchdown to tie the game up and stay unbeaten. After the game, sportswriters such as [[Grantland Rice]] and others were infuriated calling it unfair, and The Irish earned the label: &quot;The Fainting Irish of Notre Dame&quot;. Iowa head coach Forest Evashevski said after the game: &quot;When the One Great Scorer comes to write against our name, He won't write whether we won or lost, but how come we got gypped at Notre Dame&quot;. The Hawkeyes, before the game ranked 20th, jumped teams with better records, to gain the #9 ranking.  What is more, Varrichione has since admitted that the injuries were fake, in Steve Delsohnâs book, TALKING IRISH. In addition, Notre Dame Heisman winner [[Johnny Lattner]] praised his team's tactics calling it &quot;Pretty smart thinking, wasn't it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leatherhelmetillus.com/v_four_fainting/faint.html&lt;/ref&gt;. While, Lattner may be correct in saying that it was 'smart', he failed to acknowledge the 'minor' problem that it was illegal. In college football, an injury timeout has always been reserved for actual injuries. Because of the game, the NCAA changed the rules making players sit out at least one down before returning to the game.

=== 1958 Rose Bowl ===
With the conclusion of this game, Iowa won its first, and only, National Championship. The game was lopsided and by the end of the third quarter, with a 22-6 advantage over the California Golden Bears, Iowa could smell victory. The championship, however, is disputed. The AP, whose poll came out after the bowl games, had picked LSU as their National Champion. However, the 1958 LSU team refused to play teams with any African Americans, leaving few and inferior available opponents. Because of this fact, as well as the AP not choosing after the bowl games, many feel the Iowa Hawkeyes rightfully own the 1958 National Championship&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hawkeyenation.com/forum/football/29381-iowa-1958-national-champion.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 1985 #2 Michigan vs #1 Iowa ===
The Hawkeyes trailed 10-9 late in the fourth quarter, in what may be considered the greatest game ever played at Kinnick Stadium. Iowa got the ball, with 5:27 left, on their own 22 yard line. Led by their All-American Quarterback, [[Chuck Long]], Iowa drove the ball to the Michigan 12 yard line. As the clock expired, kicker Rob Houghtlin sent one through the uprights, to give Iowa the win. The Hawkeyes would go on to accept an invatation to the Rose Bowl&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLzSpaEnA64&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 2003 #15 Miami (OH) vs #12 Iowa ===
RedHawks were led by their Heisman hopeful, and future two time Super Bowl Champion, quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. The Hawkeyes crushed the Redhawks, 21-3. However, the game is significant in that the Hawkeyes held Roethlisberger to no touchdown passes. In addition, the Hawkeyes, intercepted this future NFL great a total of 4 times. The RedHawkes went unbeaten after the loss to Iowa. However, that loss kept them out of a [[BCS]] Bowl Game and Roethlisberger out of Heisman contention&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=232422294&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 2005 Capital One Bowl Iowa vs. LSU (&quot;The Catch&quot;)===
The game has gone down in Hawkeye history known simply as &quot;The Catch&quot;. Iowa was set to play the defending National Champion LSU Tigers. Despite leading the entire game, Iowa found itself down 24-25 and got the ball with only 46 seconds left on the clock. With only a few seconds left in the game, Iowa found itself on their own 44 yard line facing a 2nd and 6. Iowa Quarterback [[Drew Tate]] was not fazed, for on the play he threw the ball 56 yards to Warren Holloway for an Iowa touchdown that gave the Hawkeyes a 30-25 victory over [[Nick Saban]]'s defending champion Tigers. The touchdown was Holloway's first and only career touchdown&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=250012294&amp;period=4&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Iowa vs Penn State 2008===
The Nittany Lions came into Kinnick Stadium boasting a 9-0 record and a #3 ranking. With 3:55 to go in the fourth quarter, Iowa found itself down 21-23, while Penn State was facing a 3rd and 24. On ensuing play  Penn State quarterback [[Daryll Clark]] was picked-off by Iowa's [[Tyler Sash]]. Iowa drove the ball to the Penn State 14 yard line, setting up a 31 yard Daniel Murray field goal to give the Hawks the win&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=283132294&amp;period=4&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Notable seasons ==
=== Season records ===

{{main|List of Iowa Hawkeyes football seasons}}

The Hawkeyes began playing [[American football|football]] as a club sport in 1872, and began playing [[Intramural sports|intramural]] games against other colleges in 1882, but it was not until 1889 when [[University of Iowa|Iowa]] challenged [[Grinnell College]] to an interscholastic [[Varsity team|varsity]] football game. Since then, the Hawkeyes have played over 1,000 games, including 24 [[bowl game]]s.

=== Last Season ===
{{main|2010 Iowa Hawkeyes football team}}

The 2010 season began with Iowa in the top ten in the national rankings.  Despite a non-conference road loss to [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]] and a 31-30 defeat by [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], the Hawkeyes were in Big Ten title contention until November.  Iowa began the season with a 7-2 record, highlighted by a 37-6 victory over previously unbeaten and #5 ranked [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]].  But the Hawkeyes faded down the stretch, losing their last three games and dropping out of the national rankings.  Iowa completed the 2010 regular season with a 7-5 record and are bowl eligible for the tenth straight season. The Hawkeyes defeated the [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri Tigers]] 27-24 in the [[2010 Insight Bowl]] on December 28 in Tempe, AZ.  In the victory Hawkeye true freshman Marcus Coker set an Iowa bowl record with 219 yards rushing.

=== National championships ===

Iowa finished the 1958 regular season ranked #2 in the AP poll, behind 11&amp;ndash;0 LSU, although that vote was taken before the bowl games. Iowa convincingly won the 1959 Rose Bowl, 38&amp;ndash;12, setting or tying six Rose Bowl records.  The [[Football Writers Association of America]], arguably the most prestigious organization at the time to vote on a national champion after the bowls were played, gave their national championship trophy, the [[Grantland Rice Award]], to Iowa.

== Kinnick Stadium ==
{{main|Kinnick Stadium}}

'''[[Kinnick Stadium]]''', formerly known as '''Iowa Stadium''', is the home stadium of the [[University of Iowa]] Hawkeyes in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Iowa]]. It opened as Iowa Stadium in 1929; prior to that time, Iowa played its home games at Iowa Field. Iowa Stadium was renamed ''Kinnick Stadium'' in 1972 in honor of [[Nile Kinnick]], the 1939 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during [[World War II]]. It currently holds up to 70,585 people, making it the 27th largest college football stadium in America and the 86th largest sports stadium in the world.

== Traditions ==
=== Rivalries ===

The Hawkeyes play two annual rivalry trophy games. Iowa's oldest rivalry trophy is [[Floyd of Rosedale]], which has been awarded to the winner of the Iowa-[[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] game every season since 1935.

Iowa plays [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] for the [[Cy-Hawk Trophy]], which was created when the Iowa-Iowa State series resumed in 1977. 

Iowa has played [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]] for the [[Heartland Trophy]] since 2004. Starting in 2011, the Hawkeyes and Badgers will no longer compete every year since they are in opposite divisions.

=== Songs ===
Iowa's official fight song is the [[Iowa Fight Song]] which is sung by the marching band and the fans. Iowa's school song is [[On Iowa]]. Iowa also plays a third fight song, entitled [[Roll Along Iowa]]. After victories the band plays &quot;In Heaven There Is No Beer&quot;.

=== Mascot ===
Iowa's mascot is [[Herky the Hawk]], a black and gold caricature of a Hawk. Herky was created as a cartoon in 1948, and first appeared at a sporting event in 1959.  Herky was actually named after the Greek God Hercules. The term &quot;Hawkeye&quot; originally appeared in the book The Last of the Mohicans and was later used in its plural form to describe the people of Iowa. The University of Iowa adopted this as the nickname for its athletic teams.

=== Hawkeye Marching Band ===
Originally founded in 1881, the [[Hawkeye Marching Band]] now performs at all Iowa Hawkeye home football games. The band also travels with the team to usually one away game per year and any post-season bowl games.

=== Logos and uniforms ===
In 1979, [[Hayden Fry]] helped to create the Tiger hawk, the logo seen on Iowa's football helmets. Since both teams shared the colors of black and gold, Fry gained permission from the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the dominant NFL program of the 1970s, to overhaul Iowaâs uniforms in the Steelersâ image. Fry's idea was that if the team were going to act like winners, they first needed to dress like winners. Fry had originally asked Steelers Defensive Tackle [[Joe Greene (American football)|&quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene]] for a replica helmet and home jersey; Greene was able to send Fry to one of the team owners, and three days later, the owners sent Fry reproduction copies of the home and away uniform of Steeler Quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]], making Iowa one of only a few schools to use the uniform scheme of an NFL team. Although the uniforms appear the same, there are subtle differences, mainly in the scheme of the white away jerseys, the Steeler jerseys have the players names in yellow, while the Hawkeyes use black.

The Hawkeyes have twice removed the Tiger hawks, and the single gold stripe from their game helmets as a symbolic gesture of mourning.  The first instance was on November 2, 1991, in recognition of the six victims of a [[University of Iowa shooting|fatal campus shooting]].  The second occasion was for a December 29, 1996, appearance in the [[1996 Alamo Bowl|Alamo Bowl]].  It served to commemorate the family of linebacker Mark Mitchell, who were involved in a fatal vehicle accident while en route to the game.  The accident resulted in the death of Mitchell's mother and severe injuries to his father and two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valeroalamobowl.com/main/bowl_history_detail.php?uid=4 1996 Alamo Bowl]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both games resulted in Iowa victories.

The Iowa Athletic Director has okayed only three stickers on the helmets over the last thirty years, the first, in 1984, when a gold disk appeared, with the black letters &quot;'''''ANF''''',&quot; Which stands for America Needs Farmers, this sticker has remained in place since it was first placed onto the helmet.  The second was a small black sticker on the back of the helmet, with white letters that spelled out &quot;'''EVY''',&quot; the nickname of legendary Iowa head coach, and Athletic Director, Forest Evasheski, to commemorate his passing in 2009.  The third was in memory of Iowa high school football coaching legend Ed Thomas, who was tragically killed in his team's weight room by a former player.  A small gold sticker with the black letters &quot;'''''FFF'''''&quot; placed near the crown of the helmet represents Faith, Family, Football, a motto Coach Thomas preached to his players to represent what his players priorities should be not only through the season, but throughout life.

=== Gameday traditions ===

*'''Herky Plants the Flag'''
Before the game is about to start, Herky, Iowa's mascot, &quot;surfs&quot; on a platform carried onto the field by four cheerleaders.  Herky jumps off the platform and runs around the field waving the Iowa flag before planting it firmly in the turf. This draws a very enthusiastic reaction from the crowd.

*'''The Swarm'''
[[Hayden Fry]] introduced &quot;the swarm&quot; upon his arrival at Iowa in 1979. When entering Kinnick Stadium, players jog slowly onto the field, hands locked and with the captains in front. It is designed to show the team's unity as they take the field as a group.

*'''I-O-W-A'''
The Hawkeye team is led onto the field by four giant black and gold flags, spelling I-O-W-A. Each flag then moves to the four corners of the field. After every Hawkeye touchdown, fans in the four corners of the field, initially aided by the flags, spell out I-O-W-A.

*'''Hawkeye Victory Polka'''
After every Hawkeye victory, the Hawkeye Marching Band plays the [[Hawkeye Victory Polka]], the band's adaptation of the polka song, &quot;In Heaven There Is No Beer&quot;. Many Hawkeye fans sing along as well. After losses, only the Iowa Fight Song is played.

*'''Back In Black'''
Before the Hawkeyes enter the field, the stadium plays &quot;[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]]&quot; by [[AC/DC]] and the video board shows the Hawkeye football players walking from the locker room to the field entrance.

*'''Enter Sandman'''
The Hawkeyes enter the field to the song [[Enter Sandman]] by [[Metallica]]. The big screen shows Iowa's equipment semi running into the opposing team's logo as the Hawks swarm onto the field.

*'''Imperial March'''
The Hawkeye Marching Band will perform the [[Imperial March]] after the Iowa defense forces a 4th down, while the fans clap in an up and down motion, imitating the beak of a Hawk chomping.

*'''Hell's Bells'''
When the Iowa defense forces a third down, the ominous gong sounds from the beginning of AC/DC's [[Hells Bells (song)|Hell's Bells]] are played to incite a reaction from the fans.

*'''SHOES'''
A recent tradition started by three, at the time, sophomores, Eric Gilmour, Mitch Ahrendsen, and Patrick Riley, students take off their shoes for kickoff (instead of taking out their keys)&lt;ref&gt;http://iowahawksnest.com/traditions/&lt;/ref&gt;.
