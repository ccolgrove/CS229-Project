==Ladder==
{{AFL Ladder/1995}}

==Awards==

* The [[Brownlow Medal]] was awarded to [[Paul Kelly (footballer)|Paul Kelly]] of {{AFL Syd}}. 
* The [[Leigh Matthews Trophy]] was awarded to [[Wayne Carey]] of {{AFL Nor}}. 
* The [[Coleman Medal]] was awarded to [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Gary Ablett]] of {{AFL Gee}}. 
* The [[Norm Smith Medal]] was awarded to [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]] of {{AFL Car}}. 
* The [[AFL Rising Star]] award was awarded to [[Nick Holland]] of {{AFL Haw}}. 
* The Wooden Spoon was &quot;awarded&quot; to {{AFL Fit}}.

==Notable events==
*The [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] made their debut in the competition.
**They played their first game against {{AFL Ric}} at the [[MCG]] and won their first game against {{AFL Fit}} at [[Whitten Oval]].
*The first [[The ANZAC Day clash|ANZAC Day clash]] between {{AFL Col}} and {{AFL Ess}} was held in round 4 which famously ended in a draw.
*{{AFL Car}} won a record 16th premiership, winning twenty games for the home-and-away season, also a new record (subsequently surpassed by Essendon in 2000). They won their 16th consecutive match in the grand final, comfortably beating {{AFL Gee}} 21.15 (141) to 11.14 (80).
**Amidst these records, they also suffered the rare ignominy of losing to the bottom team ({{AFL StK}}) while atop the ladder in their Round 9 game. In this game, they failed to score a goal in the first half and became the fifth (and to date last) premier team to have kicked a season's lowest score (also in [[1923 VFL season|1923]], [[1968 VFL season|1968]], [[1970 VFL season|1970]] and [[1992 AFL season|1992]]).
*{{AFL Ric}} reached the finals for the first time since 1982, finishing 4th and making the preliminary finals.
**They won their first 7 games, winning their first five games for the first time since the early 1980s.
**They were on top of the ladder for the first time since 1982 (from rounds 9 to 12).
*{{AFL BB}} made an exceptional late season charge to reach the finals for the first time in team history.
**The Bears sat 14th after 15 rounds with a win/loss record of 4-11 and a percentage of 83.2%.
**In Round 16 at the Gabba against Hawthorn, the Bears trailed Hawthorn by 45 points at three-quarter time, but scored nine goals to one in the final quarter to pull off a seven point victory. It remains the largest three-quarter time deficit ever overcome in [[List of VFL/AFL records|VFL/AFL]] history. The Bears were still in 14th place at the end of the game.
**Brisbane won its next two games against bottom eight opposition to reach 12th place, but were to face Carlton, Richmond and Essendon (who then held the top three places respectively) in the following three weeks. Against all odds, Brisbane lost to Carlton by only 14 points, then thrashed the Tigers by 77 points and beat Essendon by 32 points.
**At the start of the final round, Melbourne, Collingwood and Brisbane sat 8th, 9th and 10th respectively, all on nine wins. Brisbane needed to beat Melbourne, and rely on Sydney (12th place) beating Collingwood to reach the finals. Brisbane beat Melbourne by 21 points of Friday night, then watched on Sunday as Sydney scored eight final quarter goals to overhaul Collingwood by 23 points.
**The Bears finals appearance was short-lived, as the eventual priemers Carlton beat them by 13 points in the first week of the finals in a very high standard gamehttp://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afl.com.au%2F&amp;ei=VLj2TeacGaft0gGK8IWoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHufLhKmtAcU8oMvPLCoeN1GbcroA.
**It must be noted though, that the 10 wins and 12 losses of Brisbane in 1995, remains the worst record of a team in VFL/AFL history which qualified a team for the finals (excluding those seasons where more than half of teams qualified for the finals).
*[[Tony Lockett]] transferred from [[St. Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] to {{AFL Syd}}.
*{{AFL Foo}}, [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] and [[Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football#State_of_Origin|State of Origin]] legend [[Ted Whitten]] died.
**He had been given a &quot;lap of honour&quot; during the 1995 State of Origin match between Victoria and South Australia.
*{{AFL Haw}} missed out on the finals for the first time since the early 1980s.
**The team finished second last, failing to register a win for its last seven matches.
*{{AFL Fit}} continued to decline, failing to register a win from round 9 and finished on the bottom of the ladder with just 2 wins.
*There were many significant changes to incumbent AFL team coaches:
*After round 19, the {{AFL Fit}} coach [[Bernie Quinlan]] was sacked and replaced by caretaker coach [[Alan McConnell]] for the remaining three games of their season ([[Michael Nunan]] later was signed as coach for 1996). 
*[[Peter Knights]] was sacked as coach of {{AFL Haw}}.
*[[John Northey]] resigned from {{AFL Ric}} (he became coach of {{AFL BB}} in 1996).
*[[Robert Walls]] resigned as coach of {{AFL BB}} and joined {{AFL Ric}} as coach in 1996.
*[[Ron Barassi]] coached his last [[VFL/AFL]] match, resigning as coach of {{AFL Syd}} at the end of 1995.
