''Command &amp; Conquer'' (often abbreviated as ''C&amp;C'' or ''CNC'') is a [[video game]] [[media franchise|franchise]], mostly of the [[real-time strategy]] style as well as a [[first-person shooter]] game based on the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/013/013180.html|title=Command and conquer:Renegade, on IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Command &amp; Conquer'' series was initially developed by [[Westwood Studios]] between 1995 and 2003, with development being taken over by [[Electronic Arts]] with the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003.

The '''music of the''' '''''Command &amp; Conquer''''' '''series''' refers to the soundtracks of the [[Command &amp; Conquer (series)|Command &amp; Conquer]] video games, as well as soundtrack and compilation albums. Much of the music for the series was composed and produced by [[Westwood Studios]]' former sound director and [[video game music]] [[composer]] [[Frank Klepacki]] for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 however to assist with the soundtrack for [[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3|Red Alert 3]].

The music has been received positively by critics, although praise was higher with earlier entries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

''The Music of Command &amp; Conquer'' is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the video game ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (video game)|Command &amp; Conquer]]'', composed by [[Frank Klepacki]] and produced by [[Westwood Studios|Westwood]]. It was originally released in 1995. The soundtrack spans two discs and 22 tracks with combined duration of approximately 72 minutes. The soundtrack was bundled with some of the game's [[Collecting|collector's editions]], which feature tracks from both the original ''Command &amp; Conquer'' and the expansion. Though it was never released through retail, Westwood Studios sold this official soundtrack by special order through its website and in game catalogues.&lt;ref name=&quot;westwoodcatalogue&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was packaged with a simple brushed aluminium design and featuring the official Command &amp; Conquer logo.
With the release of the album many of the tracks were thought to have been updated to include vocals which could previously only be heard on the [[PlayStation]] version of the game. However, these were actually the original versions of the songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wogan review&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt; Because of the vocal tracks conflicting with the voice sound effects in the game they were removed for the in game soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt;

The original soundtrack can be listened to on the [http://www.frankklepacki.com/ web site] of composer Frank Klepacki, along with various cues that were cut from the game, most of which are also present on the discs of the [[DOS]] version and the [[expansion pack]].

Note that some track titles differ from the in-game versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wogan review&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.altpop.com/stc/reviews/cac.htm | author=Gwilym Wogan | title= Review of ''The Music of Command and Conquer'' | publisher= Soundtrack Central | date=2000-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the in-game track title is mentioned behind the original title. Also, some track titles differ from the versions on Frank Klepacki's website. In these cases, the website's track titles are mentioned behind the original in-game track title. The first seven in-game tracks are only available with the &quot;''The Covert Operations''&quot; expansion pack.

The soundtrack to Command &amp; Conquer was the first video game produced by Westwood to feature streaming music as opposed to [[MIDI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=119522869602|title=Frank Klepacki: Behind the music of the first command &amp; conquer|last=Klepacki|first=Frank|date=July 27, 2009|publisher=FaceBook.com|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22k mono tracks where produced using an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland]] S760 sampler and a Roland JD-990 synth module.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt; Klepacki has credited influences from dozens of artists including [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] in the production of the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt; Klepacki stated he wrote the songs in &quot;batches&quot;, each with different themes. Songs such as ''Prepare for Battle'' where written in an orchestral style while others such as ''C&amp;C Thang'' touched on [[Hip Hop]] or [[metal (music)|metal]] in ''Deception''.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt; Certain songs such as ''Hold on'', a chilling art piece in the style of [[Laurie Anderson]], were cut from the game because they did not fit the style Klepacki was aiming for in the overall soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt;
With the release of the ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (video game)#Expansion packs|Covert Operations]]'' expansion pack Klepacki composed many of the ambient songs having been asked to do so by Westwood for the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt;

The track &quot;No Mercy&quot; as well as &quot;Deception&quot; feature voice samples of the character Chuck De Nomolos from the film ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey]]''. &quot;In Trouble&quot; contains voice samples of Maverick from ''[[Top Gun]]'' and the track &quot;I Remember Now&quot; from the [[QueensrÃ¿che]] album ''[[Operation: Mindcrime]]''.

The game's original score was composed by [[Frank Klepacki]] and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by [[PC Gamer]] and Gameslice magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;behindra&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of ''Red Alert'', titled &quot;Hell March&quot;, which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to the German marching command, &quot;''Die waffen legt an!''&quot; (which loosely translates to &quot;Aim your weapons!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:What_is_the_C%26C_slogan%3F C&amp;C Wikia - What is the C&amp;C Slogan?]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to be the theme for the [[Brotherhood of Nod]] faction in the ''Covert Operations'' expansion to the original 1995 ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (video game)|Command &amp; Conquer]]'' game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the C&amp;C Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=[http://www.frankklepacki.com/ frankklepacki.com] | accessdate=27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the ''Red Alert'' series instead.

{{quote|After C&amp;C came out we wasted no time kicking out Covert Ops. I wrote some more ambient style themes they asked me for, and then I began tinkering with this heavy metal song that I was trying to gear towards Nod for the next big C&amp;C game. Brett Sperry came in my office and said &quot;You got anything I can hear for the new C&amp;C?&quot; I played it for him. He said &quot;What's the name of this one?&quot; I said &quot;Hell March.&quot; He said &quot;That's the signature song for our next game.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook&quot;/&gt;|[[Frank Klepacki]]|''[[Composer|Senior Composer]]''}}

Following the success of &quot;Hell March&quot;, Klepacki headed the composition of its two variations, each becoming the main theme for ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2|Red Alert 2]]'' (&quot;Hell March 2/HM2&quot;) and ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3|Red Alert 3]]'' (&quot;Hell March 3&quot;), respectively. Recently, the original &quot;Hell March&quot; has been used in the motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Top Gear&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.penny-arcade.com/showthread.php?p=7784030|title=Top Gear|publisher=Penny-Arcade.com|date=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly during their American Road trip to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in Season 12 Episode 2.

When playing the single-player campaign, a limited number of tracks are initially available, and more are unlocked as the player progresses through missions. When playing in a multiplayer or &quot;skirmish&quot; game, however, all tracks are available from the start. More tracks were included in the ''Red Alert'' expansion packs: ''Counterstrike'', ''The Aftermath'' and ''Retaliation''. The music tracks can be listened to on [http://www.frankklepacki.com/ Frank Klepacki's website].

An official soundtrack was released with unique album art designed by Westwood studios and, like the previous release, featured the official Command &amp; Conquer series logo with the Red Alert series motif below. The album contained all fifteen songs plus a hidden bonus track. Half a minute after the end of track 15 plays an unnamed bonus track. Its melodramatic opening was used in the secret campaign, and the track itself is a tribute to [[Misirlou]], using the rhythm of an earlier ''Command &amp; Conquer'' music piece, &quot;No Mercy&quot;. In the media player on Frank Klepacki's website, the track is titled &quot;Surf No Mercy&quot;.

The soundtrack of ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' was released in 1999. In addition certain editions of ''Tiberian Sun'' came with the soundtrack bundled in, such as in the ''Platinum Edition'' and ''Firepower'' bundle pack, which also contained the original ''Tiberian Sun'' and its expansion pack, ''Firestorm''.

Reception of the soundtrack was mixed as the music departed from the [[industrial music]] style of the original ''[[Command &amp; Conquer (video game)|Command &amp; Conquer]]'' in favor of a slow, moody ambient music reflecting the game's apocalyptic setting in a world being ecologically ravaged by [[Tiberium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=124043224602|title=Frank Klepacki: Behind the making of the C&amp;C tiberian sun soundtrack|last=Klepacki|first=Frank|date=4 August 2009|publisher=FaceBook.com|accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Klepacki had originally started writing the soundtrack in a similar style to the previous titles but, after a meeting with Westwood, it was decided that the soundtrack would be &quot;very dark, moody and not upbeat at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook2&quot;/&gt; To help him achieve the desired style Klepacki enlisted the help and &quot;electronic style&quot; of [[Jarrid Mendelson]] for the production of songs such as ''Dusk hour'' and ''Flurry'' before the two split to write the remainder of the songs in their respective studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook2&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|I didn't want to stray too far from the original C&amp;C soundtrack, but it had to be more futuristic and ambient. From there I tried to capture the mood the designers wanted for each mission. I even brought in another composer for some of the in game scores, Jarrid Mendelson, who I knew would compliment my style for this genre of music. Also, you'll notice I put more development into GDI &amp; NOD's signature themes for the movie sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frank Quote&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/command-conquer-tiberian-sun/trivia|title=Game Trivia for Command &amp; Conquer: Firestorm|publisher=MobyGames.com|date=2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Frank Klepacki]]|''[[Composer|Senior Composer]]''}}

When the time came to score the music for the [[Tiberian Sun#Firestorm|Firestorm]] expansion pack, Klepacki and the producer decided that the music should be more upbeat and a return to the original style of the music of Command &amp; Conquer.&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook2&quot;/&gt;

Unlike previous album releases the cover for Tiberian Sun did not feature the classic Command &amp; Conquer series logo but favoured a shadowed style mirroring the ambient musical tone of the album.

Composer [[Frank Klepacki]] returned to write three tracks for the game. When interviewed regarding the matter, Klepacki indicated a strong desire to contribute more, but admitted that due to the fact that he is no longer being employed by Electronic Arts and currently works for [[Petroglyph Games]], this may be contractually impossible. At the ''RA3'' Community Summit in June 2008, Klepacki showed a video to the entire C&amp;C community in which he stated that he had been hired to work on ''Red Alert 3'', and that he was composing Hell March 3, the most recent update of ''Red Alert''{{'}}s iconic theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;ra3composer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/redalert/news-detail.jsp?id=13|title=Electronic Arts announces Red Alert 3 composer.|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frankklepackiinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evo-gamer.com/2008/02/15/frank-klepacki-exclusive-interview/ |title=Frank Klepachi - Exclusive Interview |date=2008-02-15 |publisher=Evo Gamer |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Crispy Gamer &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crispygamer.com/features/2008-11-03/behind-the-music-of-command-conquer-red-alert-3.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; reported that [[James Hannigan]] and [[Timothy Michael Wynn]] wrote the bulk of the game's remaining 114 minutes of music, with Hannigan composing the &quot;Soviet March&quot; menu theme along with music for the Empire of the Rising Sun Faction, and Wynn the music of the Allies and the remaining Soviet tracks. Music4Games has also covered the game's music score.&lt;ref name=&quot;c&amp;cra3music-M4Gam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=302|title=Interview with Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 Music Team|date=October 1, 2008|publisher=Music 4 Games|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[From First to Last]] composed several remix versions of Hell March and Hell March 2, also featured on the Red Alert 3 soundtrack shipped with the Premier Edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrackign&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/objects/142/14275460.html|title=Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 3 (Premier Edition).|accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The expansion pack, Uprising, scored mostly by Timothy Michael Wynn&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timwynn.net/news-popup.html&lt;/ref&gt;, introduced a new track called Yuriko's Theme, it features two singers: Miriam Stockley and Satomi Morimoto. This theme was later remixed by [[Menno de Jong]] into a trance version, and it was later played at many great Trance festivals.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.commandandconquer.com/jforum/posts/list/23703.page#395382&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and Legacy==

Before the release of [[Command &amp; Conquer (video game)|''Command &amp; Conquer'']], the majority of video games used [[MIDI]] files and other similar formats for music as a way to save space. Westwood was one of the first major developers to include actual audio files in their games. Although these recordings were generally of low quality compared to modern [[mp3]]s many credit Westwood for helping to popularize the concept.&lt;ref name = &quot;The music of C&amp;C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commandandconquer.filefront.com/info/article_musicofcnc|title=The music of C&amp;C|date=April 19, 2004|publisher=FileFront.com|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
