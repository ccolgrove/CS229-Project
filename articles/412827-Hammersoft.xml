'''Guanajuato''' ({{IPA-es|É¡wanaËxwato}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Guanajuato'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Guanajuato}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of Guanajuato|46 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]].

It is located in the [[North-Central Mexico]]. It is bordered by the states of [[Jalisco]] to the west, [[Zacatecas]] to the northeast, [[San Luis PotosÃ­]] to the north, [[QuerÃ©taro]] to the east and [[MichoacÃ¡n]] to the south. It covers an area of 30,608&amp;nbsp;kmÂ². 

Guanajuato is located between the arid north of the country and the lusher south, and it is geographically part of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], the [[Mexican Plateau]] and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]]. It was initially settled by the Spanish in the 1520s due to mineral deposits found around the now capital city of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], but areas such as the [[BajÃ­o]] region also became important for agriculture and livestock. Mining and agriculture have been the traditional mainstays of the state's economy, but today, about 30% of the state's GDP is accounted for by industry, which includes metals, automobiles, leather goods, processed foods and more. 

The state is home to several historically important cities, especially those along the &quot;Bicentennial Route&quot;, which retraces the path of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s insurgent army at the very beginning of the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. This route begins at [[Dolores Hidalgo]], and passes though the [[Sanctuary of Atotonilco]], [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Celaya]] and the capital of Guanajuato. Other important cities in the state include [[LeÃ³n, Guanajuato|LeÃ³n]], the most populous and [[Irapuato]].

==Geography and climate==
Guanajuato is located in the center of Mexico, north-west of Mexico City, bordering the states of Zacatecas, San Luis PotosÃ­, MichoacÃ¡n, QuerÃ©taro and Jalisco. It covers an area of 30,589&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² and is ranked 20th out of 31 states.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Medio FÃ­sico |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Geography |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has an average altitude of 2,015 meters above sea level, with its territory divided among three of Mexico physical regions, the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Mexican Plateau and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The Sierra Madre Oriental in Guanajuato consists of the [[Sierra Gorda]] and the Sierra del AzafrÃ¡n in the northeast. The Mexican Plateau extends through the center of the state. Within, it subdivides into various regions parted by low-lying mountain chains such as the Sierra de la Cuatralba and the Sierra de Cubo. The Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state in the south and includes the BajÃ­o area, the Altos de Jalisco and the valleys area in the far south. The state is crossed by several mountain ranges which have mountains between 2,300 and 3,000 meters high. Mountain ranges average 2,305 meters and flat areas lie at around 1,725 meters above mean sea level. The other important mountain ranges include the Sierra Gorda to the north, the Sierra de Guanjuato in the southeast, the Comanja in the northwest and the Codorniz in the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The state is divided into five regions taking into consideration geography and climate. These are called Altos de Guanajuato, La Sierra Central, BajÃ­o, La Sierra Gorda and Los Valles del Sur.&lt;ref name=&quot;r50&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The Altos de Guanajuato are located in the north of the state. They are a chain of forested mountains interspersed with pastures, small fields and areas with cacti and other desert plants. It begins near the border with San Luis PotosÃ­, and extends south to Dolores Hidalgo and then to San Miguel de Allende, then to the QuerÃ©taro border. The altitude of this area varies from 1,800 to peaks over 2,900 meters such as the La Giganta and La Sierra del Cubo mountains. The climate is mostly semiarid with a rainy season in the summer, with average temperatures between 15 and 20 Â°C. However, lows in the winter frequently reach 0 Â°C or lower with frosts. Wildlife is found mostly in the most rugged and inaccessible areas and includes deer, coyotes, eagles and rattlesnakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;r53&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cerro CuliacÃ¡n from Jaral del Progreso.jpg|thumb|Cerro CuliacÃ¡n from Jaral del Progresso]]
La Sierra Gorda is shared between Guanajuato and QuerÃ©taro and is considered to be an important biosphere. This area is the most rugged in the state where most of the natural areas and small villages are remain intact due to their inaccessibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;r51&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The Sierra Gorda is part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, with extreme variations in its geography and climate. The rugged terrain means that there are a wide number and variety of microclimates although average temperatures vary only between 16 and 19 Â°C. It lowest point is a canyon called Paso de Hormigas in [[XichÃº]] at 650 meters above sea level with a very warm climate suitable for tropical fruit. The highest point is Pinal de Zamorano at 3,300 meters, followed by El Picacho de Pueblo Nuevo, El Zorillo and El Cuervo all above 2,700 meters. The largest changes are seen in arid versus wetter zones, which can often be relatively nearby, with foliage changing from rainforest to pine forest to desert landscapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;r6465&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 64â65&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the Sierra Gorda region in QuerÃ©taro was declared a Biosphere Reserve by the federal government, with the Guanajuato portion added in 2007. On the Guanajuato side, it covers 236,882 hectares over the municipalities of XichÃº, [[San Luis de la Paz]], [[Atarjea]], [[Victoria, Guanajuato|Victoria]] and [[Santa Catarina, Guanajuato|Santa Catarina]]. Culturally, the Sierra Gorda region is the far western part of [[La Huasteca]], which extends over parts of the states of QuerÃ©taro, San Luis PotosÃ­, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r65&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sierra Central is a series of low, gentle mountains in the center of the state which are part of the Sierra Madre Occidental. They cover twelve municipalities: [[Ocampo, Guanajuato|Ocampo]], [[San Felipe, Guanajuato|San Felipe]], LeÃ³n, Silao, Guanajuato, Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, Irapuato, Salamanca, [[Santa Cruz de Juventino Rosas]], [[Comonfort, Guanajuato|Comonfort]] and [[Apaseo el Grande]]. Wild vegetation runs from tropical rainforest to arid grasslands with cactus, with cypress trees along rivers and other surface water. Wildlife includes raccoons, quail, rabbits, skunks and migratory birds. The land is productive, especially for fruit orchards producing [[guava]]s, [[tejocote]], apples, limes, [[quince]] and more. Desert fruits such as [[cactus pear]]s (tuna), garambullos and [[xoconostle]] are also produced commercially.&lt;ref name=&quot;r72&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known geographical region of the state is called the BajÃ­o, which is a relatively low, relatively flat area of between 1,700 and 1,800 meters, that surrounds the [[Lerma River]] and its tributaries. Centered in Guanajuato, parts also extend into the neighboring states of QuerÃ©taro and Jalisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nHistoria92.html |author= Enrique Nalda |title= La arqueologÃ­a de Guanajuato Trabajos recientes |year=1993 |work= ArqueologÃ­a Mexicana|publisher= Copyright Editorial RaÃ­ces S.A. de C.V. |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=The archeology of Guanajuato Recent work |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low area is the source of its name, coming from the Spanish word &quot;bajo&quot; or low.&lt;ref name=&quot;r76&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The BajÃ­o is filled with rolling hills and interrupted by the occasional chain of low mountains such as the Gavia and the CuliacÃ¡n.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Before the arrival of the Spanish, this area was covered in dense forests of [[holm oak]] and [[mesquite]] trees, however, mining's need for wood fuel eventually cleared these forests. Today, the area is the center of most of the state's agriculture and industry since the terrain allows for the building of highways and large farms, which produce grains, vegetables and fruit.&lt;ref name=&quot;r76&quot;/&gt; This farmland is considered some of the most productive in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Lake yuriria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yuriria]] Lake]]
Los Valles del Sur, also called the Valles AbajeÃ±os, are valleys located in the southwest part of the state, bordering the state of MichoacÃ¡n. This area is distinguished by the large number of [[PâurhÃ©pecha language|PâurhÃ©pecha]] place names and covers the municipalities of [[Valle de Santiago]], [[Yuriria]], [[Tarimoro, Guanajuato|Tarimoro]], [[Apaseo el Alto]], [[MoroleÃ³n]], [[Uriangato]], [[Santiago MaravatÃ­o]], [[AcÃ¡mbaro]], [[JerÃ©cuaro]], [[Coroneo]] and [[Tarandacuao]]. The area is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt with elevations ranging between 1,700 and 2,000 meters. The soil is fertile due to its volcanic base, producing crops such as [[sorghum]], wheat, corn and vegetables. The land also produces building materials such as [[tezontle]] and black sandstone. In the higher elevations, there are forests of pine and holm oak but these have been much reduced because of deforestation. In the more arid areas, mesquite, [[nopal]] and other desert plants can be found. There are several small lakes, the best known being the [[Yuriria Lake]] as well as canyons and cave systems, some of which were used for ceremonial purposes by pre-Hispanic peoples. It is also the home the [[Siete Luminarias]] de Valle de Santiago, a set of seven inactive volcanic craters located in the northwest and southwest of the Santiago Valley. The volcano cones rise abruptly out of the ground with craters that measure up to one kilometer across. Locals call the formations &quot;holes&quot; (hoyos) and they are named La Alberca, La CÃ­ntora, Estrada, Blanca, Alvarez, SolÃ­s and RincÃ³n de Parangueo. La CÃ­ntora and RincÃ³n de Parangueo contain cave paintings and evidence that people once lived in the craters. La Alberca (The Pool) is a crater lake with is open to the public for swimming, rowing or boating. The name of &quot;Siete Luminarias&quot; (Seven Lanterns) comes from an imagined time when the seven were active at once in prehistory.&lt;ref name=&quot;d17&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has about 1,500 bodies of surface water, along with underground aquifers in most parts of the state. The principle lakes in the state are the [[Cuitzeo Lake|Cuitzeo]], which is on the border with MichoacÃ¡n and the Yuriria. Several of the Siete Luminarias craters have also developed crater lakes, especially in the ones called &quot;La Joya,&quot; &quot;Parangueo&quot; and &quot;Olla de ZÃ¬ntora.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The most important river in Guanjuato and one of the most important in the country is the Lerma River, along with its tributaries [[Guanajuato River]], La Laja, and Turbio. The Lerma River basin covers 81% of the state (center and south) with the [[PÃ¡nuco River]] basin (north of the state) and Cuitzeo Lake covering the remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;/&gt; The Lerma River is regulated through various dams in part to control the fact that it ran very high in the rainy season and very low in the dry season.&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;/&gt; These dams include the Ignacio Allende, la PurÃ­sima, SolÃ­s, La Gavia, Conejo II and Santa Ifigenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Climates in the state are grouped by precipitation and average temperatures into three major groups. The semi-arid climate is characterized by the fact that evaporation often exceeds precipitation. Most of the vegetation in these areas is arid grassland with desert plants such as nopal. These climates cover about forty percent of the state, mostly in the north. Semi-arid temperate regions are found in the municipalities of San Felipe, [[San Diego de la UniÃ³n]], San Luis de la Paz, part of Dolores Hidalgo and [[San JosÃ© de Iturbide]], where precipitation varies between 400 and 500&amp;nbsp;mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 Â°C. Semi-arid semi hot climates can be found north of Dolores Hidalgo, around LeÃ³n and in areas near Celaya. In these municipalities, rainfall averages between 600 and 700&amp;nbsp;mm and the average annual temperature is between 18 and 20 Â°C. Temperate climates are judged by the presence of holm-oak and pine forest, pine forests and/or pine forests with meadows. Humidity varies in these forest regions. Temperate semi-moist areas are mostly found in the southeast municipalities of Apaseo, Coroneo and JerÃ©cuaro and in the center of the state. Precipitation varies from 600 to 700&amp;nbsp;mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 Â°C. Temperate and somewhat humid climates have rainfall averages of between 700 and 800&amp;nbsp;mm, with temperatures between 16 and 18 Â°C. These can be found in [[PÃ©njamo]], Coroneo, JerÃ©cuaro and parts of Guanajuato (municipality) and Dolores Hidalgo. Temperate climates with the most humidity are found in the Santa Rosa and municipality of Guanajuato. These have rainfall averages of over 800&amp;nbsp;mm and average temperatures of under 16 Â°C. Hot and moist climates in the state have temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 Â°C and are associated with tropical rainforest, with some grassland. These climates are subdivided into two types, one that receives less rainfall with a significant dry season and the other which is wetter. The drier type is found in Abasolo, Irapuato, Salamanca and [[Romita]]. In total, these hot and relatively moist climates can be found in about 40% of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

From the beginning of the colonial period, much of the state's environment suffered greatly due to the mining techniques and intensive agriculture introduced by the Spanish. The process has been ongoing since then to modern times. Before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], the state was covered in forests, but mining requires large amounts of fuel to process minerals, so these forests were cut down for fuel as well as numerous construction projects. Agriculture leached nutrients from the soil and caused erosion, and introduced plants, animals and diseases have had large impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;r52&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the state contains twenty one protected areas which extend over 63,611 hectares in twenty six municipalities. These natural reserves include Sierra de Lobos, Siete Luminarias, the Silva Dam, Megaparque de Dolores Hidalgo, Cuenca de la Esperanza, Las Fuentes, PeÃ±a Alta, Pinal de Zamorano, Parque Metropolitano, La Joya Crater, Yuriria Lake, Las Musas, CuliacÃ¡n and La Gavia Mountains, Sierra de los Agustinos, Cerro de Cubilete, Cerro de Amoles, La Purisima Dam, Arandas Mountain, La Soledad Dam, and the upper basin of the TemascatÃ­o River. Another protected area is the federal Biosphere Reserve of La Sierra Gorda. In Guanajuato, it extends over 236,882 hectares and contains 182 bird species, 42 mammal species and 84 plant species, including two recently discovered ones called [[Beaucamea compacta]] and [[Calibanus glassianus]]. The park contains a number of species which are in danger of extinction including the black bear and the [[Cougar|puma]]. The climate is semi-arid with variations in temperature due to altitude changes, but most of the area is covered in tropical forest in which many plants lose leaves during the dry season from November to May.&lt;ref name=&quot;r51&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
The state is located in the center of the country has important economic implications as a number of major national highways and railways pass through. The state is also a center of industry with most of the state's major cities and economy located in the La Sierra Central and El BajÃ­o regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r50&quot;/&gt; It has equal access to both the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico as well as the major metropolitan areas of [[Monterrey]], Mexico City and [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; In 2008, the total GDP for the state was 38,204,000,000 USD (427,503,000,000 MXN) or 3.88% of the total for the country. From 2003 to 2008, the economy grew 1.06% (adjusted for inflation). The state has the sixth largest economy in Mexico behind Mexico City, the [[State of Mexico]], [[Nuevo LeÃ³n]], Jalisco, and [[Veracruz]]. As of 2008, Guanajuato ranks fourth in per capita income at 7,609USD, behind Mexico City, Nuevo LeÃ³n and Jalisco, with a rate of increase of 2.04%. Manufacturing accounts for 28% of total GDP, down slightly from a high of over 30%. Its importance is followed by commerce at 16.3% and real estate at 11.2%. Agriculture, which includes forestry, fishing and hunting accounts for 4.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;iplaneg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://iplaneg.guanajuato.gob.mx/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11933&amp;folderId=25646&amp;name=DLFE-2801.pdf |title= La EconomÃ­a del estado de Guanajuato |date=April 27, 2010 |publisher=Government of Guanajuato IPLANEG |location=Guanajuato, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=The economy of the state of Guanajuato |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include financial and other professional services (17.6%) and transportation and storage at 11.8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;econinegi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/gto/economia/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=11 |title= Actividades econÃ³micas |publisher= [[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Economic activities |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employment figures break down differently with 13.2% employed in agriculture, 36.4% in mining and industry and 47.3 percent in commerce, services and tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Actividad EconÃ³mica |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Economic activity |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two significant migration patterns in the state. Twenty seven of 46 municipalities have a high level of migration out to other areas, with 19 having a moderate to low level of the same. The annual rate of migration to the United States is 7.07 people per thousand.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Perfil SociodemogrÃ¡fico |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Sociodemographic profile |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry, crafts and mining===
[[File:Mina La Valenciana.jpg|thumb|La Valenciana mine near the city of Guanajuato]]
Industry is the most important segment in the modern state economy, accounting for about 30%. Most of this is the production of automobiles and automobile parts, pharmaceuticals and other modern items. It also includes more traditional items such as processed foods (cheese, canned items and more) as well as shoes and other leather goods in LeÃ³n and a variety of crafts.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; The economy in this area continues to grow although there has been some drop in its percentage of GDP due to drop in prices for a number of manufactured products.&lt;ref name=&quot;iplaneg&quot;/&gt; The state has two large thermoelectrical plants in Salamanca and Celaya. Oil refining in Salamanca, which received raw material through pipelines from [[Poza Rica, Veracruz]] and from [[Tabasco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

One traditional industry is the making of shoes and other leather items, especially in LeÃ³n. This industry grew 50% from 2009 to 2010 in the number of enterprises dedicated to it. They now total 7,981 and employ 297,413 people directly and indirectly according to [[INEGI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;crecen50&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Crecen mÃ¡s del 50% empresas del calzado y piel |agency=Agencia el Universal. |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=September 23, 2010 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Footwear and leather enterprises grow more than 50%}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Volkswagen announced a new motor plant to be built in [[Silao]]. The project is projected to cost 550 million USD and will employ 700 people making 330,000 motors per year starting in 2013. A spokesman for the company acknowledged that part of the reason to build the plant was due to the existence of a General Motors plant in the same area as well as the existence of the Parque Industrial Puerto Interior which offers access to different transportation modes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Volkswagen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Acelera Volkswagen en MÃ©xico |author=Sara Cantera. |newspaper= El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=September 23, 2010 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Volkswagen accelerates in Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centro de InnovaciÃ³n (Innovation Center) of Microsoft was inaugurated in 2010 in LeÃ³n. This establishment is meant to support businesses and governments to form software and technology enterprises with the goal of starting fifty new businesses with ten to twenty employees each.&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Microsoft inaugura centro de innovaciÃ³n en Guanajuato |agency=Agencia el Universal. |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=September 23, 2010 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Microsoft inaugurates a innovation center in Guanajuato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all handcrafts (98%) are made in micro and small enterprises, most of which are family owned. Almost all which are exported are sent to the United States (91%), which mostly consist of glass, wrought iron, ceramic and wooden items. However, craft items are under pressure from imitations from Central America and Asia. The crafts sector of industry is not considered a particularly active segment of the state's population with no data as to the percentage of the state's GDP it represents.&lt;ref name=&quot;sdeartesanias&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sde.guanajuato.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=21&amp;Itemid=52 |title= Sector |publisher= Secretaria de Desarrollor Economico Sustenible |location=Guanajuato, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Handcrafts sector |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most crafts over time have become specialties of more or more municipalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;r42&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Majolica]] pottery has been made in the state since colonial times after being introduced by the Spanish. Since then, areas have developed specialties in form and decoration, but techniques have not changed much for over 400 years. Most clay is extracted from the Dolores Hidalgo region and most is produced in Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato.&lt;ref name=&quot;r4243&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 42â43&lt;/ref&gt; Another area noted for its work is Tarandacuaro, which makes high-fire ceramics. The two best-known workshops are Fabrica Javier Servin and Taller Checuan. The ceramics of this area have distinctive, very intricate, mostly geometric designs, which are painted on by hand. The municipality promotes the work through its Centro Turistico de Desarrollo de Tarandacuao.&lt;ref name=&quot;d39&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

AcÃ¡mbaro is noted for its bread. The city has two well-known bakeries by the name of Panificadora Loaeza and La Antigua Panificadora El Triunfo. One local bread specialty is the tallado, which has a base of egg and butter and can have fillings such as [[Common fig|fig]], coconut, raisins and chocolate. This bread is the result of recipes brought by the [[Franciscans]], modified over time by the native indigenous pottersâ community.&lt;ref name=&quot;d38&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[San Francisco del RincÃ³n]] has had a tradition of making hats since the 18th century. Traditionally, the hats were made from palm fronds brought from the MichoacÃ¡n coast area, but today many workshops and factories use synthetic fibers. In traditional workshops, the work is divided by sex, with women weaving the fibers together and men pressing it into shape, putting in the supports and other details. The quality of the hats made here has made them exportable.&lt;ref name=&quot;r44&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Luis de la Paz and Coroneo, wool is worked into clothing, especially into coats, gloves, vests, scarves and other items for winter wear. Some of the workshops still work with large old weaving looms. In addition, there are workshops which make rugs, [[zarape]]s, and other items for the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;r44&quot;/&gt; In Coroneo, the craft 100 years ago was practiced only by women. The most common item is still the zarape, which is decorated with figures such as horse heads and deer as well as fretwork on the edges. However, sweaters, capes, [[rebozo]]s, bags and even wool shoes can also be found for sale. One other specialty is rugs woven on large looms.&lt;ref name=&quot;d39&quot;/&gt;

Apaseo el Alto is known for its work in fine woods, which began with the workshop of Domingo Garcia sixty years ago. Since then about 150 workshops have been established in the municipality employing about 500 craftsmen. Items include sculptures such as religious figures and animals and utilitarian items such as utensils and furniture. Craftsmen first began working with a wood called &quot;patol&quot; and [[juniper]], but today they work with various woods such as walnut, [[Cedar wood|cedar]], [[mahogany]] and [[kapok]] (palosanto).&lt;ref name=&quot;d40&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r4344&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 43â44&lt;/ref&gt;

Celaya is known in much of Mexico for its [[cajeta]], a kind of spreadable caramel, often made with goat's milk, sugar and cinnamon. The mixture can be eaten straight from a spoon or used in a variety of recipes. The best known outlet for cajeta in the city is Cajetas La Tradicional, which has been in business for over 70 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;d40&quot;/&gt; 

Metalworking can mostly be found in the communities of Guanajuato and Salamanca. Although the capital's mines no longer produce large quantities of gold and silver, silver items are still made and sold in the city. Wrought iron work for doors, windows and railings are also a specialty in certain areas of the city. Oxidized bronze items are a specialty of Salamanca, producing mostly decorative items.&lt;ref name=&quot;r43&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the items made in Guanajuato city is still done Baroque style and sold in the city center.&lt;ref name=&quot;d4345&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 43â45&lt;/ref&gt; PÃ©njamo is one of very few places outside of the state of Jalisco to produce [[tequila]]. It is the home of the [[Tequila Corralejo]] brand, which is still made on the now former hacienda of Corralejo. The installation gives tours and has a museum called the Museo del Vino y la Botellas (Museum of Spirits and Bottles). The museum contains a collection of about 3,000 bottles, almost all of which with their original contents. Nearby is the factory that makes the distinctive blue bottles of this brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;d44&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass making was brought to Mexico during the early colonial period. Most items made in Guanajuato are single colored items in blue, green, yellow and red. San Miguel de Allende has the best-known tradition where curiously shaped bottles, vases, glass sets and small cups for tequila are produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;r44&quot;/&gt; Wax candles and other items are a specialty in Salamanca, where they are especially in demand during [[Holy Week]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r43&quot;/&gt; Comonfort is known for the making of [[molcajete]]s from volcanic stone, and San Miguel is known for figures and other items made from brass. Dolores Hidalgo is known for ice cream and ices, much of which is simply sold next to the parish church. Flavors include [[sapote]], mango, honey, [[aloe]], tequila and banana.&lt;ref name=&quot;d41&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining, manufacturing and construction accounts for over 27% of the state's GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state, with deposits making it one of the world's richest areas in the past. However in comparison gold and silver ores are mostly depleted today.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Gold and silver ore is still mined with silver still the major ore produced, followed by gold, lead, copper, [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]]. Most employed in mining are still related to metals rather than non-metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; Other products being mined or being studied are [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[tin]], [[copper]], [[lead]], sand, [[fluorite]], [[feldspar]], lime, [[kaolin]], and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

===Agriculture===
While the agricultural sector, which includes crops, livestock, fishing and forestry activities, accounts for only 4.6% of Guanajuato's current GDP, the sector is an important part of the state's identity and is still a major producer of a number of items nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;iplaneg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; The state has 1.1 million hectares suitable for agriculture, over 36% of the state's territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Over 659,000 hectares of land is under cultivation, with the main crops being corn, sorghum, beans, wheat, barley and broccoli.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; Today, the Bajio is still one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;/&gt; Certain areas of the state have large orchards producing peaches, strawberries, cactus pear, avocado, grapes, apples, quince, walnuts, apricots and guava.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Livestock raising is an important economic activity and can be found in all parts of the state, with animals such cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and domestic fowl,&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; with 1,451,478 hectares is dedicated to this activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; The Los Altos and BajÃ­o are the state's livestock producing regions, especially dairy cows. It is one the most important dairy producing states in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;d9&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; By volume, most of the meat produced is from domestic fowl, with pork coming in second, followed by beef, goat and sheep.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; Guanajuato produces 25.4% of the goat meat in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;pierde&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Pierde Estado interÃ©s en producir cabritos |author=Ludivina Ruiz |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=October 18, 2010 |page=7 |language=Spanish |trans_title=State loses interest in producing goats}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a very small percentage of the economy is based on fishing and forestry. Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring MichoacÃ¡n state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is [[carp]], followed by [[mojarra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and [[oyamel]] in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt;

===Commerce, services and tourism===
[[File:ChurchBicenDecorationsAllende.JPG|thumb|Church complex in [[San Miguel de Allende]]]]
[[File:Hacienda jaral de berrios.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Jaral de Berrios]], probably the most important Hacienda of colonial times]]

About 95% of the state's visitors are from Mexico, with the rest from other countries. Within the state, there are about seventy hotels ranked as four or five stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; The three main cities for tourism are the capital city of Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende and Dolores Hidalgo. Guanajuato is visited for its colonial architecture and its role in Mexico's history, especially during the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]]. Similarly, San Miguel has cultural and historical value. Both have been designated World Heritage Sites. Although not a World Heritage Site, Dolores Hidalgo is particularly important as the site as it is where Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla gave the cry called &quot;El Grito&quot; which began the War of Independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;atractivos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Atractivos Culturales y TurÃ­sticos |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Cultural and Tourist Attractions |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has set up tourist routes such as the Ruta de Independencia, Ruta de Aventura (Aventure Route), Ruta ArqueolÃ³gica (Archeological Route), Ruta de los Conventos (Monastery Route) and Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route). The Ruta de la Independencia or Independence Route comprises ten municipalities through which the insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo passed. These include San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, LeÃ³n, Irapuato, PÃ©njamo, Salamanca, Celaya, [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]] and AcÃ¡mbaro. In preparation for the Bicentennial of MexicoÂ´s independence, the state rehabilitated and marked the sites in which the significant historic events occurred in each of these locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;d7&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Yuriria.JPG|thumb|left|Monastery in Yuriria]]
[[File:Convento san agustin 1.jpg|thumb|left|220px|San AgustÃ­n de Yuriria Convent, founded by the [[Augustinians]] in 1550]]
The Ruta de Aventura connects ghost towns and abandoned mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV as well as other extreme sports such as [[paragliding]]. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as RelÃ¡mpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached it height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio DÃ­az, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no one lives there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine.&lt;ref name=&quot;d1213&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 12â13&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruta ArqueolÃ³gica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la CaÃ±ada in San Miguel de Allende and El CÃ³poro in Ocampo.&lt;ref name=&quot;d2223&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 22â23&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is concentrated in the south of the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the [[Augustinians]] who arrived from MichoacÃ¡n in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de ChÃ¡vez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then sent forth and its size and battlements helped to protect it from [[Chichimeca]] attacks. The church retains its original function and [[Plateresque]] facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the [[San Carlos Academy]]. During the [[Porfirio DÃ­az]] presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in AcÃ¡mbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen MarÃ­a Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;d30&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route) connects a number of municipalities which specialize in one or more handcrafted items, including food. These include AcÃ¡mbaro, noted for its bread, Coroneo for its wool items and Tarancuaro for ceramics.&lt;ref name=&quot;d38&quot;/&gt; 

The state also has a large number of water parks and thermal springs converted into water parks. Some of these include El TrÃ©bol, Villa Gasco and Comanjilla near LeÃ³n, Caldera Abasolo near Irapuato and Abasolo and Los Arcos and Agua Caliente near Celaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;mexdesstate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/guanajuato1.html |title= Guanajuato |publisher= Mexico Deconocido magazine |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guanajuato |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Festivals===
Culturally, the state is best known for the annual [[Festival Internacional Cervantino]], which takes place in the city of Guanajuato and some other affiliated venues in the state. The event sponsors a large number of artistic and cultural events with artists invited from Mexico and other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;mexconnect&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2798-the-beautiful-mexican-colonial-city-of-guanajuato |title= The beautiful Mexican colonial city of Guanajuato |date= February 4, 2007 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=November 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;d3240&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 32â40&lt;/ref&gt; The festival hosts events such as opera, theater productions, film showings, art exhibitions, academic conferences and talks, concerts and dance recitals. The performances occur in 70 different venues over most of the month of October.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3240&quot;/&gt; In addition to the major events in venues, artists such as dancers, clowns and more, give small and sometimes impromptu shows on the streets, sidewalks and small plazas of the city. Because of this, the event brings many visitors to the city who wander the streets, visiting the many sights of the city. During the event, hotel occupancy rates are as high as 98%. In 2010, invited artists included the Da Motus! Swiss dance company.&lt;ref name=&quot;artistasinvaden&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Artistas invaden las calles de Guanajuato |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/cultura/2010/242565/6/artistas-invaden-las-calles-de-guanajuato.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=October 19, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Artists invade the streets of Guanajuato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is named in honor of [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mexconnect&quot;/&gt; The festival began in 1972,&lt;ref name=&quot;stampart6&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Guanajuato, Mexico |last=Leal G. |first=Manuel |year=2009 |publisher=Stampart |location=Guanajuato /Spanish |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as short plays performed by [[University of Guanajuato]] students based on the works of Cervantes.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3240&quot;/&gt; In 2010, special guests included the state of QuerÃ©taro and the country of Colombia.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3240&quot;/&gt; The 2010 edition of the festival included performers such as [[Tangokineses]] from Argentina, [[Cumbia Cienaguera]] from Colombia.

A parallel event is the Festival International Cervantino Callejero which is sponsored by an organization called the Centro Libre de Experimentacion Teatral y Artistica (CLETA). In 2010, this event had 300 performances with social themes. This annual event was begun in 1975, in part inspired by the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' album cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;colmara&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= El teatro callejero colmarÃ¡ plazas de Guanajuato |author= Alondra Flores |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/10/14/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a05n2cul |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=October 14, 2009 |page=5 |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title= Street theater to fill the plazas of Guanajuato}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival Internacional de Cine Expresion en Corto began in 1997 and today is one of the most important cinematographic events in the country. It was established in Guanajuato in an effort to decentralize cultural events away from Mexico City. Most events associated with the festival take place in the city of Guanajuato and San Miguel Allende and awards prizes in various categories including commercials. The showing of films is sometimes in unusual locations such as one of Guanajuato's tunnels under the city or in the municipal cemetery at midnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;r21&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:BirriaGuanajuato.JPG|thumb|A [[birria]] dish served at the Mercado Hidalgo in Guanajuato]]
Many of the dishes that are traditionally eaten in Guanajuato are regional variations of dishes known in other parts such as [[carnitas]], [[tamale]]s, [[birria]] and [[pozole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;d3435&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 34â35&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the [[enchilada]] is called the enchilada minero (minersâ enchilada), which are tortillas fried in lard then filled with chicken and covered with a sauce made with [[guajillo chili]] peppers, a [[Cheeses of Mexico|cheese called ranchero]] and chopped potatoes and carrots.&lt;ref name=&quot;r45&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, there has been a movement to update many of these dishes, keeping to traditional ingredients, called &quot;Guanajuato fusion.&quot; This is most popular in upscale restaurants in San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato and can include dishes such as tuna with chili peppers and duck with mesquite honey.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3435&quot;/&gt; 

The state is better known as the producer of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is cajeta, soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat's milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called [[charamuscas]]. It is made with [[piloncillo]], which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. AlfeÃ±ique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for [[Day of the Dead]]. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of [[Chilacayote|melon of the same name]], which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made in other parts of the state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, [[pulque]], [[chile relleno]], even shrimp and [[mole (sauce)|mole]]. &lt;!--(rincones45) --&gt; The Franciscans taught the indigenous how to work with wheat and bake bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes. The best known breads are those from AcÃ¡mbaro, especially the type called &quot;pan grande.&quot; Other well known types are pan ranchero, tallado, pan huevo and pan leche. The first indigenous master baker in Guanajuato was Abraham de Silva CuÃ­n, who in 1526, began to make breads in unique forms and flavors.&lt;ref name=&quot;r45&quot;/&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:CayetanoVal2.JPG|thumb|150px|La Valenciana Church in the city of Guanajuato]]
Most of the state's architecturally significant buildings are in Mexican Baroque style, especially in the capital city. This was because the mines of the state were at maximum production during the 18th century, when this style was fashionable. It can be found in mansions and civil buildings of that time but the most ornate examples are churches, with intricate facades and altarpieces both which often use the &quot;estipite&quot; column (inverted, truncated pyramid). A number of Baroque [[altarpiece]]s from this time are also gilded with gold from local mines.&lt;ref name=&quot;r13&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Within the city of Guanajuato, the most notable examples are the San Cayetano or La Valenciana Church, the Basilica of Guanajuato, the Temple of the Company of Jesus and the San Roque Church. Outside the capital, notable examples include the Parish of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Dolores, the La Tercera Orden Temple and the Casa de Visitas in Dolores Hidalgo, the San Francisco Church and Monastery and the San Agustin Church in Celaya, and the Basilica Cathedral and the Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Angeles Church in LeÃ³n. There are some examples were the Baroque also contains indigenous elements such as the San JosÃ© Church in Irapuato and the San Agustin Monastery and Church in Yuriria. At the beginning of the 19th century, Baroque was giving way to Neoclassical. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] ended most major constructions, but in many churches in the state, Baroque altarpieces were replaced with Neoclassical ones. A few [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical constructions]] did manage to be built, mostly by [[Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras]] and include the [[obelisk]] monument to [[Charles IV of Spain]], the Del Carmen Church, The San Agustin Tower and the Dolores Chapel. Neoclassical works by others include the Entrance Arch of LeÃ³n, the Teatro Principal in Guanajuato and the Santiago ApostÃ³l Parish in Silao. From the 19th century on, trends became more modern with one notable exception. The Parish of San Miguel in San Miguel Allende had its facade redone by self taught architect Zeferino Gutierrez. Working from only images from postcards of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Europe, Gutierrez created the imposing Gothic-like front, which is unique in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1314&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 13â14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and literature===
Guanajuato is home or place of origin of three important painters: [[Diego Rivera]], [[JosÃ© ChÃ¡vez Morado]] and [[Olga Costa]]. Rivera was born in the city of Guanajuato and spent his early childhood there. When he was older, he moved to Mexico City to study painting and eventually became one of Mexico's most famous muralists. JosÃ© ChÃ¡vez Morado was a prolific painter who lived and worked in the city of Guanajuato. He initially worked with [[JosÃ© Clemente Orozco]], who impressed him both with art as well as politics. ChÃ¡vez Morado's most prolific period was between 1955 and 1967, when he realized works in the [[Ciudad Universitaria]] in Mexico City, the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] building in Mexico City and the [[AlhÃ³ndiga de Granaditas]] in his hometown. Olga Costa's real last name was Kostakowsky, but it was [[Hispanicization|Hispanicized]] to Costa. She was born in [[Leipzig]], Germany but she and her family moved to Mexico when she was very young. She was friends with and contemporaries of Diego Rivera, [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Carlos MÃ©rida]], as well as wife to JosÃ© ChÃ¡vez Morado. She is best known for founding the GalerÃ­a Espiral and co-founder of the Sociedad de Arte Moderno and the Salon de Plastica Mexicana. Her best known work is titled &quot;Vendedora de Frutas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;r1516&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 15â16&lt;/ref&gt;
Other artists include [[Manuel Leal]], whose works are mostly scenes from the state, [[Romualdo Garcia]], better known as a photographer than painter, [[Hermenegildo Bustos]], [[Hilario GÃ³mez SÃ¡nchez]] and [[Luis Ferro MÃ¡rquez]]. The state also produced one well-known sculptor by the name of [[TomÃ¡s ChÃ¡vez Morado]], brother of JosÃ©. His works can be seen at the Museo Regional de la AlhÃ³ndiga de Granaditas and the [[Museo de Caracol]] in Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1617&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 16â17&lt;/ref&gt;

Guanajuato's three main literary figures are [[Jorge IbargÃ¼engoitia]], [[Juan IbÃ¡Ã±ez]] and [[EfraÃ­n Huerta]]. IbargÃ¼engoitia was one of Mexico's most important writers of the 20th century, noted for his satirical works with social themes. Examples of his work include Los relÃ¡mpagos de agosto, Los pasos de Lopez and Estas ruinas que ves. IbÃ¡Ã±ez was a dramatist who was active in the second half of the 20th century. His best known work is Los caifanes, produced as a movie in 1966. Huerta began as a journalist and movie critic but his fame came as a poet. Some of his works include Absoluto amor, LÃ­nea del alba, Poemas de guerra y esperanza, and La rosa primitiva.&lt;ref name=&quot;r17&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
===Statistics and conservative reputation===
As of 2005, the state had a population of 4,893,812,&lt;ref name=&quot;numerohab&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/gto/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=11 |title= NÃºmero de habitantes |publisher= [[INEGI]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Number of inhabitants |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the sixth largest population in Mexico.(inplaneg) About 67% live in urban areas, with the rest in rural areas, with women slightly outnumbering men. The largest population centers are LeÃ³n with 1,134,842 people, Irapuato with 440,134, Celaya with 382,958 and Salamanca with 226,654.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;
Over 96% of the population professes the Catholic religion,&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; and the state is considered to be very conservative to Catholic principles both socially and legally. This is especially true in matters of sex such as contraception, abortion, sexual education and women's role in society. According to a 2010 report by [[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] newspaper, political and religious researchers warn that there is an environment of intolerance, repression and indoctrination towards youth, especially young women in order to enforce traditional values to a generation which is accepting more open sexual practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;disentir&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Guanajuato: sin derecho a disentir |author=Cristina PÃ©rez Stadelmann |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179121.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico Cigty |date=July 18, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guanajuato: without the right to disagree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also charged the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN party]] in Guanajuato with promoting Catholicism and marginalizing those who are not of the Catholic faith. In November 2009, the state social security agency ISSEG, ordered the suspension of [[emergency contraception]] in government pharmacies. Recently the governor of the state closed centers dedicated to intra-family violence and restricted reference to sexuality among adolescents in textbooks, referring to Catholic principles as justification although this appears to be a violation of church and state. Despite this, from 2007 to 2009 teen pregnancies have risen from 81,103 to 97,700. From 2000 to 2009, 190 women were imprisoned for having an abortion, with nine convicted for homicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;disentir&quot;/&gt;

Guanajuato is the only state in Mexico with no law designed to give rights specifically to women in abusive homes, although according to the Observatorio de Violencia Social y de GÃ¨nero of Guanajuato, about 59% of women over 15 have experienced violence at the hands of their partners, community or in school. The state has the highest suicide rate for women. Studies by the National Institute for Youth (Instituto Nacional de la Juventud) states that 75% of relationships among young people in the state experiences violence and that for every 100 male victims of violence there are 545.&lt;ref name=&quot;disentir&quot;/&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
Guanajuato has the fourth lowest number of people who can speak an indigenous language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are [[Chichimeca Jonaz language|Chichimeca Jonaz]], [[Otomi language|Otomi]] and [[Nahuatl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; The two most important indigenous groups are the [[Chichimeca Jonaz]] and the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant PâurhÃ©pecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as [[pitaya]]s, [[Myrtillocactus geometrizans]] (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and [[agave]]. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1819&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 18â19&lt;/ref&gt;
In what is now the state of Guanajuato, there were a number [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]) groups who built cities in the first millennium CE. but then abandoned them long before the arrival of the Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;r18&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the Chichimeca came to dominate the area after the fall of these cities, and the Chichimeca Jonaz believe that the eagle, which is sacred to them, led them here.&lt;ref name=&quot;r30&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Spanish conquest, the only Chichimeca group left were the Chichimeca Jonaz, who were semi-nomadic and warlike. These qualities allowed these Chichimecas to resist Spanish domination for many years. However, the deterioration of the environment by the Spanish depleted resources for these people and finally made them submit.&lt;ref name=&quot;r18&quot;/&gt; 

The Chichimeca Jonaz refer to themselves and other indigenous as &quot;uza&quot; (singular) or &quot;Ã©zar&quot; (plural), which roughly translates to &quot;Indian.&quot; Their language is [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean]] and related to their neighbors, the Otomi. Most Chichimecas are found in the municipality of San Luis de la Paz, in the community of Rancho Uza or Mision Chichimeca. This community subdivides into the Mision de Abajo in the east and Mision de Arriba in the west. This area borders lands of the Huasteca and [[Pame]] groups, and there have been conflicts among the three.&lt;ref name=&quot;r18&quot;/&gt; The Chichimeca Jonaz have a mixed Catholic-indigenous belief system. While outwardly Catholic, many rituals still follow the cycles found in nature, such as planting and harvesting and lunar cycles. The most important &quot;spirit guides&quot; are the eagle and water, with the Virgin of Guadalupe playing an important role as Universal Mother. One important saint is [[Isidore the Laborer]], who is connected to the bringing of rain.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1819&quot;/&gt; 

The Otomis of the state are concentrated in the community of Cieneguilla in the municipality of [[Tierra Blanca, Guanajuato|Tierra Blanca]]. In pre-Hispanic times, these people were semi-nomadic, desert dwellers. During the Conquest, these and other Otomi groups allied themselves with the Spanish, in part because the Aztecs and others considered the Otomi to be backwards and barbaric. The Otomi also speak an Oto-Pamean language and are related to other Otomi groups scattered around the central and southern areas of Mexico. Today, however, most children are not learning the language from their parents, putting it in danger of extinction in spite of efforts to introduce bilingual education.&lt;ref name=&quot;r1920&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 19â20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign presence in San Miguel de Allende===
Another group, concentrated in San Miguel de Allende, is foreign residents mostly from the United States and Canada who have come to live because of the area's mild climate, cultural opportunities and low crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;gringosviejos&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Territorio de 'gringos viejos' |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=April 9, 2001 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Territory of &quot;old gringos&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usretirees&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Number of U.S. Retirees Heading to Mexico Grows |author=Jenalia Moreno |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |location= Washington |date=October 6, 2002 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While only about ten percent of San Miguel's total population, they have had a large impact on the area economically, accounting for most home buyers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usretirees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;behinddoors&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Behind the doors of San Miguel de Allende |last=de Gast |first=Robert |year=2000 |publisher=Pomegranate Communications, Inc. |location=Rohnert Park, California |pages=1â9 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=-Yo60_zLXQAC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=0764913417|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of foreign residents range from 8,000 to 12,000 with about 7,000 of these from the United States alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;usretirees&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salengrito&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Salen estadounidenses al 'grito' en San Miguel |author=Jorge Escalante comunidad estadounidense. |newspaper=El Norte |location= Monterrey, Mexico |date=September 17, 2001 |page=17 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Americans leave the &quot;Grito&quot; in San Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bajaventa&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Baja la venta de casas en San Miguel de Allende |url= http://www.informador.com.mx/economia/2010/236779/6/baja-la-venta-de-casas-en-san-miguel-de-allende.htm |newspaper=El Informador |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=September 27, 2010 |language=October 20, 2010 |trans_title=House sales fall in San Miguel de Allende}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;introducing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/northern-central-highlands/san-miguel-de-allende |title= Introducing San Miguel de Allende |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=February 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nostalgia&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Nostalgia y fiesta en San Miguel de Allende Rutas de MÃ©xico |url= http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=287660&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |newspaper=El Financiero |location=Mexico City |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=October 20, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Nostalgia and party in San Miguel de Allende-Routes of Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes San Miguel one of the largest American communities in Mexico,&lt;ref name=&quot;salengrito&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bajaventa&quot;/&gt; large enough to warrant its own U.S. consulate to provide services such as notary and passport.&lt;ref name=&quot;usbajio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://spanish.elbajio.usvpp.gov/agencia_consular_san_miguel_de_allende2.html |title= Agencia Consular San Miguel de Allende |publisher=U.S. Government |location=San Miguel Allende, Guanajuato |language=Spanish |trans_title=Consular Agency San Miguel de Allende |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic era===
[[File:Peralta.jpg|thumb|[[Peralta (Mesoamerican site)|Peralta site]]]]
In the pre-Hispanic era, the Bajio saw the most human development due to the fertility of the soil and the presence of surface water for agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;/&gt; The oldest group to inhabit the area are called the ChupÃ­cuarios, who dominated the center of the BajÃ­o area and were active in between 800 BCE and 300 CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;r30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nArqueologia92.html |author= Beatriz Braniff C. |title= Guanajuato en la historia |year=1993 |work= Arqueologia Mexicana |publisher= Editorial RaÃ­ces S.A. de C.V. |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guanajuato in history |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their largest city is now the site called [[ChupÃ­cuaro (archaeological site)|ChupÃ­cuaro]], and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, QuerÃ©taro, [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], Hidalgo, State of Mexico, MichoacÃ¡n and [[Guerrero]]. ChupÃ­cuaro cities were associated with the [[Toltec]] city of [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went in to decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;r30&quot;/&gt; This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandonedbetween the 10th and 11th centuries with only the [[Guamare]]s left ethnically.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclatura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Nomenclatura |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Nomenclature |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then Chichimeca and other nomadic groups entered the area. These nomadic indigenous groups are generically referred to as Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the [[Guachichiles]], Pames and [[Zacateco]]s. These groups were warlike, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;r30&quot;/&gt; Part of the state was also inhabited by the Otomi but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the PâurhÃ©pecha in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclatura&quot;/&gt; By the 16th century, most of [[Mesoamerica]] was dominated by either the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] or [[Tarascan state|P'urhÃ©pecha]] empires, but Guanajuato was under the control of neither. It was on the northern border of the PâurhÃ©pecha empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as part of what the Spanish would call the &quot;Gran Chichimeca.&quot; These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;

===Colonial period===
As Guanajuato marks the beginning of the arid north of Mexico, at first relatively few Spanish came to settle as opposed to points south, where rainfall and indigenous labor was in much greater supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt; The first Spanish expedition to arrive to the Guanajuato area was led by [[CristÃ³bal de Olid]] in 1522 which arrived to the YuririhapÃºndaro and PÃ©njamo areas. The discovery of silver and gold in the area of the city of Guanajuato spurred Spanish settlement of the area in the 1520s and 1530s.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Historia |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Spanish did arrive, native tribes retreated to the most inaccessible areas of the BajÃ­o and mountains ranges in the state, resisting the invaders, attacking settlements and travelers along the routes that connected Spanish settlements and mining camps. Unlike the more settled indigenous peoples, the Spanish were unable to force the natives of this area to work and brought African slaves and indigenous peoples from other areas to work the haciendas and mines.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3031&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 30â31&lt;/ref&gt; The colonization efforts in the eastern part of the state began in 1542 when Spanish land grants were issued for the Apaseo and [[ChamÃ¡cuaro]] areas.In 1555, [[San Miguel de Allende|San Miguel el Grande]] was founded to protect roads linking mining camps and cities with Mexico City. The [[LeÃ³n, Guanajuato|Villa de LeÃ³n]] was founded in 1576 to counter attacks by the indigenous peoples. But through the first centuries of the colonial period, the city of Guanajuato dominated because of its mines.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; The official name of the state is Guanajuato, Estado Libre y Soberano (Guanajuato, Free and Sovereign State). &quot;Guanajuato&quot; comes from PÃºrhÃ©pecha Quanaxhuato, which has been translated as both &quot;place of frogs&quot; and &quot;places of many hills.&quot; The coat of arms of the state is that of the city of Guanajuato which was granted by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos I of Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclatura&quot;/&gt;

In 1590, the Villa de San Luis de la Paz was founded named after the peace (paz) treaty between the Spanish and the Chichimeca.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; With the Spanish occupying most of the most productive land and its resources, the indigenous of the area became extremely impoverished. This eventually allowed the Spanish to negotiate peace with chiefs in exchange for basic goods such as blankets, clothes and food. This would bring temporary truces. For the long term, evangelization efforts would bring longer term submission. Franciscans and Augustinians worked to gradually modify the worldview of the Chichimecas and others until many moved out of the mountains and into settlements and profess, at least nominally, the Catholic faith. However, the indigenous remained extremely marginalized and poor, losing both language and culture until most eventually intermarried with outsiders to produce [[mestizos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r31&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; 
Through the colonial period, most of the area's wealth came from mining, with much of the agriculture springing up to support the mining communities.The height of mining came in the 18th century, mostly from the mines in the hills around the city of Guanajuato, leading to the construction of a large number of notable civil and religious buildings in the same area.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; The BajÃ­o area was extremely fertile and became a major agricultural area for New Spain. Both of these activities brought in more Spanish and [[Criollo people|Criollo]]s to take advantage, as well as mestizos and some African slaves to work the mines and fields, making the area's population grow rapidly and eventually concentrate in urban centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;r31&quot;/&gt; The area was made an &quot;indentencia&quot; or province in 1786, when [[New Spain]] was divided into twelve parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Independence and 19th century===

Despite the riches the area produced, most lived in oppression and poverty at the end of the 18th century, working on haciendas and in mines while a few, mostly European-born Spaniards, lived in opulence. Not only the indigenous, mestizo and Negro slaves were having problems with the social order. Many Criollos or New World-born Spanish were marginalized by the Spain-born.&lt;ref name=&quot;r31&quot;/&gt; One of the first rebellions against colonial rule came in 1766, when a group attacked the Caja Real in Guanajauto city to protest high taxes. In 1767, there were protests against the expulsion of the [[Jesuits]] by the [[Spanish Crown]]. These were put down with extreme force, but they spurred conspiracies, and groups organizing against colonial rule, especially in San Miguel el Grande and LeÃ³n.&lt;ref name=&quot;r32&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous plans were made, but few were carried out or had impact until 1809. In that year, a group consisting of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[Ignacio Allende]], [[Juan Aldama]], [[Miguel DomÃ­nguez]] and more, began to plan an armed revolt against the colonial government. In 1810, the plot was discovered and Hidalgo decided to put their plans into action in September instead of the planned date in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;r32&quot;/&gt; On 15 September, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared the [[Grito de Dolores]] in the town of Dolores (Hidalgo). Hidalgo, accompanies by Ignacio Allende, left Dolores with about 800 men, half of whom were on horseback.&lt;ref name=&quot;elbalero&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/historia/html/independ/biohidalgo.html |title= DonMiguel Hidalgo y Costilla(1753â1811)|accessdate= 27 November 2008 |language=Spanish|archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080822042337/http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/historia/html/independ/biohidalgo.html| archivedate = August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just through sheer numbers, Hidalgo's army had some early victories,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vazquez&quot;/&gt; going through the economically important and densely populated province of Guanajuato.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamnett&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Hamnett |first=Brian R |title= Concise History of Mexico |year=1999 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Port Chester, New York, USA |isbn=9780521581202}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hidalgo's first stops was at the [[Sanctuary of Atotonilco]].

Military commanders [[Luis de CortÃ¡zar]] and [[Anastasio Bustamante]] joined forces with [[AgustÃ­n de Iturbide]] and took the city of Guanajuato on 8 July 1821, declaring the entire state independent of Spanish rule. In 1824, Guanajuato was officially proclaimed a state of Mexico by the Constitutional Congress of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

The years after the end of the War of Independence were extremely unstable, and would continue to be unstable through most of the rest of the 19th century. Dolores and San Miguel adopted the names of Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende in honor of those who began the independence movement and in 1826, the first constitution of the state of Guanajuato was adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;r32&quot;/&gt; Like much of the rest of the country, Guanajuato was affected by the prolonged fighting between Liberal and Conservative factions as well as the foreign incursions that dominated the 19th century. Guanajuato's status vacillated between state (when Liberals were in charge) and department (when Conservatives held the upper hand). Under Liberal ideals, educational institutions such as the Colegio de la Santisima Trinidad and the Colegio de la Purisima ConcepciÃ³n were secularized and under control of the State.&lt;ref name=&quot;r32&quot;/&gt; In 1847, General [[Gabriel Valencia]] raised an army of 6,000 men to fight the [[Mexican American War|U.S. invasion of Mexico]]. In 1848, in opposition to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], General Marian Paredes, General [[Manuel Doblado]] and priest Celedonio Domeco Jarauto revolted, taking the state capital, but they were defeated and Domeco was executed by firing squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; In 1855, Conservative Manuel Doblado, then the governor of Guanajuato, forced [[Juan Ãlvarez]] out of the presidency after he took power from [[Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;r32&quot;/&gt; In 1858, the government under President [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]] moved from Mexico City to the city of Guanajuato before moving again to [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] and then [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] during the [[Reform War]]. During this three year period, the state would vacillate various times between the Liberals and Conservatives. In 1863, it was taken over by the French as they installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as emperor of Mexico. Maximillian did not reign long but the governor he appointed for Guanajuato, [[Florencio AntillÃ³n]] remained in Guanajuato until 1877.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
The situation stabilized over much of the government of Porfirio DÃ­az at the end of the 19th century and the economy improved, but the Diaz government was oppressive. Diaz installed [[Francisco Mena]] as governor of the state, who made a fortune through the concession of railway lines which were being built to modernize the country. Even though slavery was officially abolished during the War of Independence, most laborers in farms and mines were extremely underpaid and in a number of cases not paid at all. Agricultural production reached a peak at the end of the 19th century, earning the state the nickname of the &quot;granary of the Republic.&quot; Industrialization took hold in cities such as LeÃ³n, Salvatierra, Celaya and San Francisco del RincÃ³n, making shoes, textiles and hats.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3233&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 32â33&lt;/ref&gt; One battle of the [[Mexican Revolution]] occurred in Celaya in 1915 between the troops of [[Ãlvaro ObregÃ³n]] and [[Francisco Villa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; Many from the state fought and died in other parts of Mexico, leaving behind widows and children. After the war, the large landholdings were broken up and land redistributed into [[ejido]]s, or commonly held land, which benefitted many rural families.&lt;ref name=&quot;r33&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Mexican Revolution, fighting in Mexico continues with the [[Cristero War]]. Fighting related to this was most prominent in PÃ©njamo and LeÃ³n, but occurred in other areas as well. In 1946, an uprising against the government by a group called the [[Sinarquistas]] occurred in Leon.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; However, most of the state was peaceful most of the time, allowing the economy to recover. This was especially true of the agricultural sector, producing wheat, corn, sorghum, alfalfa, strawberries in Irapuato and goats in various parts. Goat milk cajeta candy from Celaya is known in most of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;r34&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The first Festival Internacional Cervantino occurred in 1972.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; In the 1980s, two of the state's cities, Guanajuato and San Miguel de Allende were declared [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;r34&quot;/&gt; 

Today, the Bajio is one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;/&gt; The Guanajuato congress has asked for help against the theft of religious art in the state, which has the third highest incidence of such. One of the major occurrences was the theft of the gold crown of the Black Christ of Salamanca in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesacro&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Pide Guanajuato legislar sobre el robo de arte sacro |agency=Agencia el Universal. |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=September 1, 2010 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guanajuato asks for legislation against the theft of religious art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of Mexico's Bicentennial was particularly important to the state as initial events of the War in Independence occurred here. The state set up a Bicentennial Route to encourage visitors to the cities associated with Miguel Hidalgo's first campaigns. The state held a marathon from San Miguel Allende to Dolores Hidalgo for the Bicentennial with Omar Luna winning with a time of 2h23m14s.&lt;ref name=&quot;categorias&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Gana MÃ©xico todas las categorÃ­as en MaratÃ³n Bicentenario |agency=Agencia el Universal|newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=October 17, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Mexico wins in all categories of the Bicentennial Marathon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state sponsored the Expo Bicentenario 2010 from 17 July to 20 November just outside the capital city. The site was marked by a giant Mexican flag flying alongside older historic flags, including a replica of the standard with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe that Miguel Hidalgo carried as the insurgent banner. The Expo was housed in a series of pavilions which demonstrated the Mexican culture, history, traditions and customs. There were also pavilions hosted by various Latin American countries who also celebrated their Bicentennials around the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;d51&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;revive&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Revive en Guanajuato ruta de la Independencia |author=CristÃ³bal MartÃ­nez. |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=October 10, 2010 |page=6 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Relive the independence route in Guanajuato}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
Politically the state is divided into six regions: Region I Northeast, Region II North, Region II Center-West, Region IV South-West, Region V South and Region VI Center-East.&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalizacion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Regionalizacion |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Regions |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also divided into forty six municipalities for local government purposes. The municipalities are grouped into 15 political regions for elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;encgobierno&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Gobierno |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Government |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state government is headed by an elected governor who controls the executive branch of government. The governor has one six-year term with no re-election. He or she is required to report on the state of the government each year on August 1. This branch contains a large number of secretariats and other offices related to social issues, economic issues, education, law and administration. The legislative branch is [[unicameral]] with 36 elected representatives. Elections for congress occur every three years. This branch has various commissions related to legal, municipal and economic issues. The judicial branch consists of various levels of courts as well as the attorneys general offices. They are all presided over by a &quot;presidencia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;encgobierno&quot;/&gt;

==Education==
[[File:UniGTO2.JPG|thumb|View of the main building of the [[University of Guanajuato]]]]
Guanajuato ranks seventh in the country in the number of schools to population and sixth in teacher-student ratio. The state has over 4,000 preschools, 4,600 primary schools, about 1400 middle schools, about 650 high schools, 73 teachersâ colleges, 125 institutions offering bachelor's degrees and 60 offering advanced degrees. 12.1% of the population over 15 is illiterate according to the 2005 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Infraestructura Social y de Comunicaciones |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Social infrastructrure and communications |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the state is very conservative, much of its public education curriculum has been censored. Biology textbooks in middle school have had images of male and female reproductive organs erased, and has defined masturbation as &quot;el goce egoÃ­sta que prescinde de la otra persona&quot; â a selfish pleasure that leaves out other people with only abstinence promoted as a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Use of [[contraceptives]], especially emergency contraceptives is strongly discouraged. Because of government restriction of information in the public schools the poor are more affected by this.&lt;ref name=&quot;disentir&quot;/&gt;

About half of the state's municipalities have one or more institutions of higher education, with the most important being the [[University of Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt; This university is in the city of Guanajuato, and began as a Jesuit school for children in the first half of the 18th century. The establishment of this school was sponsored by Josefa Teresa de Busto y Moya, sister of the Marquis of San Clemente, who obtained permission for the school from the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1732 and established the institution in her home. She donated a fifth of her fortune towards it and worked to obtain donations from other wealthy families in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;r102&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stampart14&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Guanajuato, Mexico |last=Leal G. |first=Manuel |year=2009 |publisher=Stampart |location=Guanajuato /Spanish |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the school grew and began to offer high school and professional level studies. It held several names over its history, from Real Colegio de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n (1767), Colegio del Estado (1828), Colegio Nacional de Guanajuato (1867), with its current name adopted in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;r102&quot;/&gt; The Collegeio del Estado name was prompted the fact that the institution became property of the state in 1828. In 1945, it gained university status.&lt;ref name=&quot;stampart14&quot;/&gt; 

Today the institution serves approximately 30,000 students at the high school, bachelor's and graduate levels. In addition to the main campus in the city, there are nine others in other parts of Guanajuato state. The university hosts a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino, with its famous stairway acting as seating.&lt;ref name=&quot;r102&quot;/&gt; The best known facility of the institution was the main building in Guanajuato city, which was built in Neoclassical style in green stone. It houses the Dean's office, administrative offices and a number of the institution's departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;stampart14&quot;/&gt; The main building is recognized by its long staircase with 113 steps, which empties onto the Callejon del Estudiante. Under the main roof is a 16th century chapel which was sponsored by [[Vasco de Quiroga]], for indigenous mine workers called the Templo de los Hospitales (Temple of the Hospitals). It was also the place that received the image of the Virgin of the Rosary, now called the Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guanajuato.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3240&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;r103&quot;&gt;Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Other institutions include Instituto TecnolÃ³gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey ([[ITESM]]) campus LeÃ³n and Irapuato, Universidad de LeÃ³n (UDL), [[PolitÃ©cnico de Guanajuato]], Universidad De La Salle BajÃ­o, Universidad Iberoamericana, Universidad Santa Fe, Universidad de Celaya, Universidad QuetzalcÃ³atl, Universidad PedagÃ³gica Nacional (UPN), [[Instituto PolitÃ©cnico Nacional]] (IPN) Unidad Profesional Interdisciplinaria de IngenierÃ­a (UPIIUG).

The project will be built on a 60 hectare site in the south of the city to serve students in Guanajuato, [[Jalisco]], [[Aguascalientes]], [[QuerÃ©taro]], [[San Luis PotosÃ­]], [[MichoacÃ¡n]] and [[Zacatecas]], starting in 2011. The first major to be offered is orthodontics, which is not offered by any other school in the region and will be followed by eleven others.&lt;ref name=&quot;atendera&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= UNAM-Guanajuato atenderÃ¡ a 15 mil alumnos |agency=Agencia el Universal |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=October 5, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=UNAM-Guanajuato to attend to 15,000 students}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in Guanajuato there are research centers as: [[CIMAT]], [[CINVESTAV]], CRODE, CIATEC, CIO, CICSUG, CIQI, IIBE, IIEDUG, IIC, IIM, INIFAP, and laboratories as: CFE LAPEM and LANGEBIO .&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt;

==Transportation==
Guanajuato's highways directly connect to three of Mexico's ten major highways (Mexico City-Nuevo Laredo, QuerÃ©taro-[[Ciudad JuÃ¡rez]] and Manzanillo-[[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]]). The state has 11,061&amp;nbsp;km of highway, 5,281&amp;nbsp;km of which are rural. It also has 1,249&amp;nbsp;km of federal highways and 2,462 of state highways.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt; In July 2010, the state government of Guanajuato in Mexico awarded the 30-year concession of
the US$122mn Libramiento de Celaya toll road to consortium Concesionaria Bicentenario. The
consortium will be responsible for constructing, operating and maintaining two highway sections.
Work on the 12.9&amp;nbsp;km Libramiento Nororiente stretch is scheduled to start in September 2010 and
on the 16.5&amp;nbsp;km Libramiento Sur stretch on August 9, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;businfra&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico Infrastructure Report â Q4 2010 |newspaper= Mexico Infrastructure Report |location=London |date=Fourth Quarter 2010 |pages=21â22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in the rest of Mexico, rail lines are almost exclusively used for the transportation of freight in the industrial areas of the state and are usually curved into loopy loops. Like the highway system, connects to most of the major national lines, with a total of 1,085&amp;nbsp;km in the state. The most important line is the Empalme Escobedo in the municipalities of Comonfort, AcÃ¡mbaro and Irapuato. In Celaya, there is a &quot;ferropuerto&quot; (rail-port), an installation on 57 hectares used to transfer 1 million tons of freight each year. The facility has customs and other offices to facilitates international shipments.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt;

The [[Guanajuato International Airport]], formerly the BajÃ­o International Airport is located in the municipality of Silao between the cities of Silao and LeÃ³n. The airport currently serves the following airlines: [[Magnitur]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[Aviacsa]], [[American Airlines]], [[Aeromar]] and serves the following destinations: [[Mexicali]], Mexico City, [[Tijuana]], Monterrey, Cd. JuÃ¡rez, [[CancÃºn]], Zacatecas, [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Zihuatanejo]], Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, [[San JosÃ©, California]], Chicago, Oakland and Denver. There is one other airport in Celaya which serves domestic destinations as well as airfields in San Miguel Allende, [[Doctor Mora]], Irapuato, Manuel Doblado and San Francisco del RincÃ³n.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;/&gt;

==Archeological sites==
[[File:Chupicuaro statuette Louvre 70-1998-3-1.jpg|thumb|[[ChupÃ­cuaro (archaeological site)|ChupÃ­cuaro]] figurine at the [[Louvre]]]]
[[ChupÃ­cuaro (archeological site)|ChupÃ­cuaro]] is a site located in the south of the state on one side of the Lerma River. It is one of the older sites of Mesoamerica, having been active from 800 BCE to 300 CE and shows some of the earliest evidence of agriculture. The site has low flat rectangular platforms, with evidence of earlier structures below, which were probably the foundation of multigenerational houses; however most of the site is now under the waters of the SolÃ­s Dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;trabajos&quot;/&gt; This site along with some nearby contemporary sites, is known for its pottery called &quot;Blanco Levantado&quot; characterized with red and other colored lines on a light or cream background. This pottery has been shown to have elements in common with pottery in Zacatecas, other areas in northwest Mexico and even that of the [[Hohokam]] in [[Arizona]] and researchers believe that these people had trade relations that far north even finding [[turquoise]]. While the site has been extensively studied, it has also suffered looting, including some at the hands of Guanajuato authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt; 

Tierra Blanca is a large site which was a true city, not a ceremonial site, but most of the site had been sacked and practically destroyed when it fell and later as an archeological site although early photographs of it remain. There is evidence in Tula that this city, or one like it, had had significant influence on the Tula civilization. For this reason, the time span for Tierra Blanca is placed at before 950 CE although there is little evidence at the site itself to date it.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;

[[Carabino]] is located in the northeast of the state. At this site items from and influenced by the city of Tula are found dating the city to about 900 to 1150 CE. There is some evidence to suggest that the city was a colony of one of the cities of the center of Mexico. In Villa de Reyes in the far north in the Valley of San Luis, there also evidence of Toltec presence or influence. However, this later site was occupied first between 550 and 710 CE, then again in the Toltec era 200 to 300 years later. Evidence suggests that groups in these parts of Guanajuato had effect on the organization of the Toltec empire as settlements were abandoned sometime between 600 and 900 CE. Through the Toltec's influence in the [[Valley of Mexico]], Guanajuato cultures eventually had some influence on the much later Aztec.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Plazuelas.JPG|thumb|One of the structures at the [[Plazuelas site]]]]
[[Plazuelas]] is located just west of PÃ©njamo in the foothills of the Sierra de PÃ©njamo. The site is noted for the complexity of its architecture and was occupied during the first millennium of the Christian Era with its height at around 600 to 900 CE. The site was constructed over three hillsides separated by two large arroyos called Los Cuijes and Agua Nacida. The ethnicity of its occupants is not known nor is its original name. It appears to have been a theocracy with the elite inhabiting the hillsides and the rest of the population on flatter lands below. The most important construction at the site is the complex called Casas Tapadas which contains several large structures and one [[Mesoamerican ball game|Mesoamerican ball court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;d2223&quot;/&gt; 

[[Peralta (Mesoamerican site)|Peralta]] is located on Abasolo, 21&amp;nbsp;km from PÃ©njamo. It developed between 300 and 700 CE. at the time that Teotihuacan was declining and Tula was rising. According to archeologists the city declined and collapsed due to the overexploitation of the surrounding deciduous rainforest and it was abandoned around 900 CE. The site occupies 150 hectares divided into a center with five surrounding settlements. The most important structure is called the &quot;Patio Hundido&quot; (Sunken Patio), whose name comes from the four pyramids that are at the corners. Another important building is the La Mesita (The Small Table) or Recinto de los Gobernantes (Governorsâ Precinct). It has a large plaza which is considered to have been the main square for the city. Among the walls and other structures a semicircle dedicated to the Danza de Voladores has been discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;d2324&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 23â24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CaÃ±ada de la Virgen]] contains a number of closely related architectonic complexes. Complex A, also called the Casa de los Trece Cielos (House of the Thirteen Heavens or Skies) consists of a large &quot;sunken&quot; patio like that in Peralta surrounded a pyramidal base over 25 meters high and platforms that enclose the west, north and south sides. El CÃ³poro is situated on a small mountain and probably used by a group related to the Toltecs. It was at its height between 500 and 600 CE. but abandoned by 900 CE. It is a ceremonial center constructed of adobe and earth. One unique aspect of its construction is a series of columns which sink into the earth to a depth of about two and a half meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;d25&quot;&gt;Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
Other archeological sites in the state include Morales in San Miguel and [[El CÃ³poro]] in the northwest. The latter has figurines that show influence from groups in Zacatecas.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;
