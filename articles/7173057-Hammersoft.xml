==Recent games==
After an 8â0 series run by Notre Dame from 1987 to 1994, tying the series win streak set by Michigan State between 1955 and 1963 (they didn't meet in 1958), Michigan State won five games in a row. Michigan State won a double overtime 44â41 victory at Notre Dame in 2005.  Notre Dame pulled out a thrilling come from behind 40â37 victory in [[East Lansing]] in 2006. The trend continued in 2007 for Michigan State under new head coach [[Mark Dantonio]] who defeated the Fighting Irish 31â14, recording MSU's sixth straight victory at Notre Dame. On September 20, 2008, MSU defeated Notre Dame 23â7 in East Lansing, ending the series &quot;jinx&quot; of home teams always losing since 2001. Notre Dame returned the favor the following year by defeating MSU at Notre Dame. The 2010 meeting proved to be one of the most exciting finishes to the start of the college football season. A back and forth battle the entire game, Notre Dame took the lead in overtime off of a field goal. After Spartans quarterback Kirk Cousins was sacked on third down, Michigan State lined up for a field goal to tie the game at 31. Michigan State faked the field goal, and Aaron Bates, the holder, tossed a game-winning touchdown pass to Charlie Gantt to win it 34â31 for the Spartans. In 2011, the Irish reclaimed the trophy with a 31&amp;ndash;13 victory in which they led all the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/irish-first-win-beat-no-15-spartans-31-231616481.html |title=Irish get first win, beat No. 15 Spartans 31-13 |author=Gano, Rick |date=September 17, 2011 |work= |publisher= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}
