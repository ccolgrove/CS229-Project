===Cleveland-Marshall College of Law===
{{Main|ClevelandâMarshall College of Law}}
[[Image:Cleveland Marshall College of Law.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[ClevelandâMarshall College of Law]]]]
The ClevelandâMarshall College of Law traces its origins to the founding of Cleveland Law School in 1897 as the first evening law school in the state and one of the first in Ohio (and one of the earliest in the U.S.) to admit women and minorities.  In 1946, Cleveland Law School merged with the John Marshall School of Law, founded in 1916, to become ClevelandâMarshall College of Law. ClevelandâMarshall became part of Cleveland State University in 1969. 

One of the most famous alumni of the ClevelandâMarshall College of Law was [[Tim Russert]], host of [[television program]] ''[[Meet the Press]]'', who graduated in 1976. The college has also educated numerous highly esteemed judges and founders of prestigious private law firms. Due to its long tradition of providing evening education, the college has a large number of business and community leaders who are non-practicing attorneys as well.

==Location, campus, and community==
[[Image:CSU Rhodes Tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Rhodes Tower]]]]

CSU's main campus in [[downtown Cleveland]] is bounded on the east and west by [[Interstate 90]] and East 17th Street, respectively; and by Payne Avenue to the north and Carnegie Avenue on the south. It also has satellite campuses in [[Westlake, Ohio]] and [[Solon, Ohio]], both in the [[Greater Cleveland]] [[metropolitan area]] in [[Cuyahoga County]]. As of fall 2010, the student body totaled 17,204.

===Expansion plans===
CSU recently unveiled a long-term plan to make the campus more amenable to residence and increase the number of students living on campus by building thousands of housing units, anchored by a new dormitory, [[Fenn Tower]], a reuse of the school's most historic building.  The university is working with private developers and the City of Cleveland to develop housing, retail, and &quot;collegetown&quot; amenities around Fenn Tower, particularly along the main thoroughfare of [[Euclid Avenue (Cleveland, Ohio)|Euclid Avenue]], which was upgraded in 2010 as part of the [[HealthLine|Euclid Corridor Project]], bringing [[bus rapid transit]] to the university and connecting [[Public Square]] in downtown Cleveland to [[University Circle]], approximately four miles east.&lt;ref&gt;city.http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/csu_officials_envision_large_e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The University has also recently completed a new state of the art student recreation center, as well as two new buildings for the Colleges of Graduate Studies and Education; there are longer-term plans to create a &quot;Varsity Village&quot; incorporating athletic fields and student housing into a green, residential area.  

Fenn Tower formerly housed what was at one time the longest [[Foucault pendulum]] in the world; however, the pendulum has been inoperational since 1980 and was removed during the residence hall renovation in 2006. The pendulum currently resides in the Cleveland State University archives.

The Dramatic Arts Program is in the process of transitioning into the [[Allen Theatre]] at [[Playhouse Square Center]] in collaboration with the [[Cleveland Play House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marvin Fong / Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2010/03/cleveland_state_universitys_dr.html |title=Cleveland State University's drama program is booming under director Michael Mauldin |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Cleveland State University announced their plan to begin work on $65 million construction project, this project will transform the campus from a commuter school into a residential campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David I. Andersen, The Plain Dealer |url=http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/cuyahoga/1251102766197460.xml&amp;coll=2 |title=Cleveland State University to begin work on $65 million construction project this week |publisher=Cleveland.com |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction plans include the new Student Center and Julka Hull, completed in 2010, and more residential areas in Euclid Commons, which are still under construction.

===Student media===
The campus' student-run radio station, 89.3 [[WCSB]]-FM, has a 630-[[Watt]] [[Radio transmitter|transmitter]] on top of [[Rhodes Tower]] (formerly called University Tower).  Additionally, Cleveland State is served in print by [http://www.csucauldron.com/home/ The Cauldron], an independent student newspaper, The Cleveland Stater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandstater.com/ |title=The Cleveland Stater |publisher=The Cleveland Stater |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication, The Vindicator, and The Gavel which won the 2005 American Bar Association's -Student Division's first prize for the best law school newspaper in the country. There is no [[student television station]] at this time, though the university offers a film production and video production major with courses through its Digital Video Communication Center.

===Information technology===
CSU is a member of the OneCommunity (formerly OneCleveland) [[computer network]], an initiative of [[Case Western Reserve University]] that connects nonprofit institutions throughout Northeast Ohio, allowing large scale collaborations over a high-speed fiber optic network.

===Poetry Center===
The Cleveland State University Poetry Center is a literary [[small press]] and poetry outreach organization operated by the the English Department. It publishes primarily original works of [[poetry]] by contemporary writers, though it has previously also published [[novella]] and occasional works of criticism or translated poetry collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csuohio.edu/poetrycenter/aboutus.html Poetry Center || ABOUT THE CENTER || Cleveland State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1962 by poet [[Lewis Turco]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=CSUPC Encyclopedia of Cleveland History:CLEVELAND STATE UNIVERSITY POETRY CENTER&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at what was then Fenn College, attained its present name two years later when Fenn College was absorbed into the newly founded Cleveland State University, and began publishing books in 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Its current Director and Series Editor is poet and professor [[Michael Dumanis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uakron.edu/neomfa/faculty/bio_dumanis.dot NEOMFA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
{{Main|Cleveland State Vikings}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Vike.PNG|right|80px|thumb|Old CSU logo &quot;Vike&quot;]]  --&gt;
When the school was still known as Fenn College, the [[sports team]]s' [[nickname]] was the [[Fenn College Foxes|Foxes]]. When the University was renamed Cleveland State, the nickname changed as well, and CSU's sports teams became the &quot;Vikings&quot;. That nickname stands to this day. The [[school colors]] are forest green and white.  For many years the school mascot was the [[comic strip]] character [[HÃ¤gar the Horrible]] along with his wife Helga, and the couple appeared at sporting events as well as on University literature. A new mascot, &quot;Vike&quot; was introduced in 1997 and Hagar was gradually phased out by 1998. Another new mascot named &quot;Magnus&quot; was introduced in August 2007.

Cleveland State fields [[Varsity team|varsity]] teams in seventeen sports.  Most of the teams compete in the [[Horizon League]].  The [[Cleveland State Vikings men's basketball|men's basketball team]] was noteworthy in 1986 when seeded 14th in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|tournament]], it upset heavily favored 3-seed [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]] and [[Saint Joseph's University|St. Joseph's]] before being beaten by [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] by one point, an unprecedented achievement for such a low seed. The Vikes made yet another NCAA tournament appearance in 2009, upsetting the highly favored 4th seeded [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons|Wake Forest]] before falling to the [[Arizona Wildcats|University of Arizona]] in the second round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509997,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Cleveland State Shocks Wake Forest | date=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fielding a football team===
On October 14, 2008 CSU President Michael Schwartz stated &quot;he wants a blue ribbon panel to give him a recommendation on the [[American football|football]] team before July 1, 2009, when he is scheduled to retire. He also said the program will have to be structured to pay for itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/10/cleveland_state_university_con.html] Cleveland State considers a new name and a new football team.  Accessed October 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Football establishment issue became an official item on the Cleveland State University, Student Government Association election ballot. From Monday April 12 at 12:01 AM until Friday April 14 the student body voted on the issue. By the Friday evening, the results indicated that 68.7% of the student population favored establishment of a football team. Furthermore the student body was asked if they were willing to pay a fee for Division 1 non-scholarship football in addition to any potential, future tuition increases that may be instituted by the University. The student body responded 55.6% of the vote as no.&lt;ref name=&quot;Board of elections&quot;&gt;[http://www.csuohio.edu/studentlife/boardofelections/index.html Question 1: Are you interested in having Cleveland State University add a Division I non-scholarship football team (e.g. University of Dayton, Butler University) to its intercollegiate athletic program? 1. YES 	1,214 Votes 	68.7% of the vote], Question 2: Are you willing to pay a fee for Division 1 non-scholarship football in addition to any potential, future tuition increases that may be instituted by the University? 2. NO  	977 Votes  	55.6% of the vote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the university is studying the possibility of establishing a football team, Division I non-scholarship in the University and further reports will be released in the upcoming years.
