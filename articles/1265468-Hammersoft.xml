The '''Russian Football Union''' ({{lang-ru|Ð Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¤ÑÑÐ±Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ½ÑÐ¹ Ð¡Ð¾ÑÐ·}}) is the governing body of [[football (soccer)|football]] in [[Russia]]. The Union is considered a direct successor of the '''Football Federation of USSR'''. It organizes the football league, [[Russian Premier League|Premier-Liga]], and the [[Russia national football team|Russian national football team]]. It is based in [[Moscow]]. 

==History==
The '''All-Russian Football Union''' (VRS) was created on January 19, 1912 and in the same year was admitted to [[FIFA]]. The Unions initially consisted of 52 organizations across the [[Russian Empire]]. It was not until 1934 when the ''Football Federation of USSR'' was formed initially under the name the '''Football Section of [[Soviet Union]]'''. The organization of it was in accordance with the Declaration of the [[All-Union Council of Fitness Culture of USSR]] on December 27, 1934. The Section was admitted to FIFA as the Soviet organization in 1946 and admitted to UEFA in 1954. Later the Section was reorganized as the '''[[Football Federation of USSR]]'''. Concurrently with the Section and later Federation until 1972 there operated the ''Football Directorate of the Soviet Sport Committee'' that was subordinated directly to the Soviet Ministry of Sport. The Directorate was never recognized on the international level.

With the fall of the Soviet Union the modern '''Russian Football Union''' was formed (a constituent conference took place on February 8, 1992), inheriting everything from the previous associations such as VRS and FF USSR and reinstated in FIFA on July 3, 1992. In July 1992 was formed the [[Russian national football team]].
