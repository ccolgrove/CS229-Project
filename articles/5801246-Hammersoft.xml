The '''Italian elections of 1958''' were held on [[May 25]], and selected the '''third Parliament''' of the Italian Republic. The number of MPs to be elected was calculated upon the population's size for the last time.

==Electoral system==
The electoral law received minor edits in 1958, creating a legislation which would never be changed until its abrogation in 1993.

The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] was definitely adopted for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were united in 32 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were established, even if the assembly had 9 more members. The candidates needed a landslide victory of two thirds of votes to be elected: only 5 hoping senators reached this goal. All remained votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where a [[D'Hondt method]] was used: inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.

==Results==

The election gave similar results of five years before and, consequently, the same problems of political instability of the [[centrism|centrist]] formula. [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] was polarized by a fraction which liked more [[leftist]] politics, and another one which urged for a [[rightist]] route. Party's secretary [[Amintore Fanfani]] was in the first field, and called for a dialogue with the [[Italian Socialist Party]], which had frozen its relationships with the [[Italian Communist Party]] after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. Fanfani led a year-term government, but the reaction of the conservative fraction gave the power to [[Antonio Segni]], followed by [[Fernando Tambroni]] who received a decisive [[vote of confidence]] by [[neo-fascist]] [[Italian Social Movement]]. The MSI had been banned by any type of political power since its birth under the theory of the ''[[Constitutional Arch]]'', which stated that any government or opposition party which had voted the [[Italian Constitution]], had to refuse any relationship with fascist and monarchist forces, seen as anti-constitutional groups. Strikes and revolts causing some casualties erupted through the country, and Tambroni had to resign. Fanfani returned to the premiership, this time with an openly [[centre-left]] programme supported by the socialist abstention. The government created the [[middle school]] for workers' sons, and the [[ENEL]] after the [[electric energy]] [[nationalisation]].
