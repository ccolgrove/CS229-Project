'''Stephen &quot;Macki&quot; Mackintosh ''' was a friend of [[Justin Burton]]. The two met when Justin was troubled and began buying [[marijuana]] off Macki. Soon Justin was forced to go to boot camp and sorted out his life. When Justin returned to town, Macki frequently distracted Jusin and wanted him to come back to his old ways. However, Justin wanted to avoid Macki and hang around with his stepbrother [[Ali Taylor]] and friend [[Nicole Owen]]. An embittered Macki made Ali's life a misery by calling him &quot;monkey boy&quot; and other racist taunts, and he framed Justin for a fire started in the science lab at the school. However, after finding evidence against Macki, Justin managed to get him expelled.

Both Ali and Justin thought their troubles were over, until next term as Macki returned to school and wanted revenge. The bullying got worse and both Ali and Justin were beaten up by Macki and his friends.  Ali eventually had enough of the bullying and went after him with a knife that his father, Richard, had confiscated from Justin (who got the knife to defend himself against Macki).  When Ali found Macki, Macki challenged him to a one-on-one fight and led him to a quiet spot; whilst Ali's back was turned, Macki picked up a brick.

Justin, who had realised the knife was missing, found Ali just in time to see Macki with the brick. He called out to Ali, who then turned around and stabbed Macki.  Ali dropped the knife and Justin told him he'd sort it all out and told Ali to go home.  Ali then ran out into the road and was hit by a car. Justin hid the knife in the hospital toilets. Meanwhile, both Macki and Ali died of their injuries. A few days later, Justin went back for the knife but the police had already found it and were waiting for Justin to show up. Justin was then arrested for Macki's murder but was later found not guilty.

'''Charles Hayton''' was the father of [[Becca Dean|Becca]] and [[Nancy Hayton]]. Charles and his wife Margaret were wealthy and seen as snobbish by Jake and his family. When Charles first met Jake, he was in garden clothes, and Jake, assuming he was the gardener, proceeded to tell him all about how humourless and stuck up Charles was. Frankie, Craig, and Steph dropped in for an unplanned visit, and a drunk Frankie told the Haytons all about Jake's affair and his giving a Sexually Transmitted Infection to Becca. The families also clashed over wedding preparations and cost. In spite of this turmoil, Charles and Margaret attended their daughter's wedding and wished her well.

Charles had a heart attack in early 2006 and Becca went to visit him during his recuperation. During another visit a few months later, she was in the midst of an affair with Justin Burton and wasn't actually there when her father suddenly died.

Margaret was extremely apprehensive about the relationship, along with Nancy's relationship with tattoo artist Foz, but went along with what her daughters wanted. Over the course of the next year, Becca gave birth to Charlie, who was thought to be Jake's son, was sent to prison and stabbed to death. When Margaret returned the next summer, she was surprised to see Nancy, who was raising Charlie, had taken up with Jake. She wanted to take Charlie to raise for herself, but Jake and Nancy refused.

'''Bill Ashworth''' was the father of [[Noel Ashworth|Noel]] and [[Neville Ashworth]]. He was a retired bus driver and army veteran but despite his leaning towards military precision in all things, he never lost his sense of fun. With an eye for the ladies, he was not ready to settle into old age. Bill was a gambler and ran a book on any subject. He lived at an nursing home and often visited his family during Christmas holidays. However, when his best friend at the home died, Bill felt lonely and wanted to move in with his family. It was left up to his grandson [[Josh Ashworth|Josh]] and his maternal cousin [[Jamie &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher]] to help Bill out of the nursing home and moved him into the Ashworth's house. With much dispute between [[Suzanne Ashworth|Suzanne]] and Neville, they decided to let Bill stay after the children received a pay off from Bill in convincing their parents to let him stay. Often Bill made a mess around the house, which left Suzanne frustrated but Bill decided to give something back to the family in exchange for letting him stay. When Neville was sacked from his job, Bill gave him his inheritance which helped Neville to buy Drive and Buy. Also, the children received their inheritance as well, which was tied up into the family business.

'''Rory''' was an [[Irish Traveller]] whose caravan briefly set up a home in Chester near [[Tony Hutchinson]]'s restaurant, Il Gnosh. Tony was furious at them for being what he saw as low class and driving down his business. He clashed with Rory and his brother Connor, as well as their dog Sheba. Rory also had a brief flirtation with [[Zara Morgan]]. He confided in her that he and Connor were staying because their mother was battling cancer in a local hospital. When Zara told this to Tony's wife Mandy, and Rory helped stop a robbery at Il Gnosh, Tony mended fences, somewhat, with Rory.

The next day, she wanted to start over, but he told her he was moving back to Ireland with his brother and mother. Just before he left, he kissed Nicole and told her he'd always love her.

|last = 2006
}}

'''Freddy Watson''' studied English literature at HCC and was an animal rights campaigner. He arrived in 2005 and had a less than secret admirer in [[Zara Morgan]], an avid protester against anything and everything. She didn't realise he was using her to get revenge against HCC for animal rights.

Freddy also conspired with [[Chris Fenwick|Chris]] to depose [[Lee Hunter (Hollyoaks)|Lee Hunter]] from his presidency, but this backfired when Zara told the student council about the plot, and Freddy's involvement with the HCC Media Lab Fire in December 2005.

Freddy was not seen again, but it would appear that along with Zara and Lee, he and Chris were kicked out of HCC.

}}
'''Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Fenwick''' is the former head of the entertainment committee and editor of the newspaper at Hollyoaks Community College, losing his position to [[Lee Hunter (Hollyoaks)|Lee Hunter]] in an election.  Chris pretended not to care about losing and asked if he could be Lee's [[vice president]].

Little did Lee know that Chris was manipulating him into spending more money than what was in the college funds.  Lee's friend [[David &quot;Bombhead&quot; Burke]] found out what Chris was doing but when he tried to tell Lee, Lee wouldn't believe him.

Chris then told Lee about the missing money and blamed Bombhead, which caused Lee and Bombhead to have a massive falling out.  Chris then conspired with [[List of minor and recurring characters from Hollyoaks#Freddy Watson|Freddy Watson]], who set fire to the HCC's media lab for an [[animal rights]] demonstration and tried to pin the fire on Lee.  But Lee's friend and Freddy's girlfriend [[Zara Morgan]] told people what had really happened and the truth finally came out.  Lee punched Chris saying, &quot;This is for Bombhead&quot;.

It appears that Chris was kicked out of college along with Freddy, Zara and Lee.

Ben began to suspect Ally was trying to seduce Lisa. The foursome partied during ''[[Hollyoaks: Crossing The Line]]'', and Ben worried Alex and Ally would want more than just friendship, but nothing came of it.

'''Grace Antonia Helen Hutchinson''' was born in October 2005, two months early, to [[Tony Hutchinson|Tony]] and [[Mandy Richardson|Mandy Hutchinson]] Grace was originally going to be called Antonia but Mandy was not keen. Antonia was then made her middle name. Mandy suffered [[post-natal depression]] for a while. But after she spent a while in intensive care, Mandy made friends with a woman who had a premature baby called Daisy. Daisy died and Mandy grew to love Grace in fear of losing her. Grace was christened, where [[Becca Dean]] became her godmother, while [[Max Cunningham|Max]], [[Sam &quot;OB&quot; O'Brien|OB]] and [[Dom Reilly|Dom]] became godfathers. On 12 May 2006, aged seven months old, Grace was found dead from suspected [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], on a night [[Hannah Ashworth]] and [[Nancy Hayton]] were babysitting, which left the girls traumatised, after thinking it was their fault. Soon after Grace's death, Mandy left Hollyoaks in the hope of moving on and subsequently left a heart-broken Tony behind, after he had told her that it was all her fault that their daughter died that night.

Following her death, Grace has been mentioned several times. Tony and [[Jacqui McQueen]] miscarried a baby in 2007, thus reminding Tony of Grace. Mandy met another man and gave birth to a girl named Ella.

==Wayne Tunnicliffe==
{{Infobox soap character 2

|name = Wayne Tunnicliffe
|portrayer = [[Joe Marsden]]
|years=2005, 2006, 2007
|first = 2005
|last =  October 2007
}}

'''Wayne Tunnicliffe''' first appeared as one of [[Ste Hay]]'s friends. Ste was interested in [[Amy Barnes]], while Wayne dated [[Michaela McQueen]]. Wayne was only interested in her because she was &quot;easy&quot; and after a few months he dumped her via text message.

Wayne and Ste befriended [[Josh Ashworth]] and his cousin Fletch to get close to Josh's sister [[Hannah Ashworth]] (they gave up because Hannah was always out with friends). A nastier moment arrived when Ste and Wayne began bullying [[Nicole Owen]] after her brother Sam blew up the Dog in the Pond. They eventually pretended to care about her, taking her to the woods, getting her drunk, and planning to rape her. She threw herself on the ground, sobbing and telling them to get on with it, and they left her alone.

Ste was sent to a juvenile detention facility for his part in a joyride which sent Amy to hospital. Wayne was next seen in spring 2007, hanging out with [[Sonny Valentine]]. Wayne soon discovered that his ex, Michaela, fancied Sonny so he mentioned it to Sonny, not knowing that he and Michaela were secretly going out. Wayne made fun of Michaela to Sonny behind her back and Sonny went along with it to keep their relationship a secret, but when Wayne went too far insulting Michaela, Sonny stood up to him and told him that he and Michaela were dating. Wayne also taunted her about her gay brother, [[John Paul McQueen]], only for John Paul to grab him and threaten him into leaving Michaela alone.

Wayne began selling his little brother's [[ADD]] medication at school. [[Nancy Hayton]], who needed pills to cope with her hectic life, began buying them. When Wayne ran out of medication, she lost her temper. Wayne promised her he would get more and he tried to ask Nancy out. Wayne got cinema tickets but Nancy ripped them up, enraged that Wayne would not get the drugs in time for her next exams.

Wayne was last seen at a house party thrown by Amy and Michaela. Wayne stole food and CDs and when Amy caught him in baby Leah's room, a drunk Wayne grabbed Leah as a hostage. Wayne's former mate Ste grabbed the baby and punched Wayne before throwing all the partygoers out of the house.
