'''Homelessness''' describes the condition of people without a regular [[dwelling]]. People who are homeless are unable or unwilling to acquire and maintain regular, safe, and adequate housing, or lack &quot;fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], [http://www.hud.gov/homeless/definition.cfm &quot;Federal Definition of Homeless&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The legal definition of &quot;homeless&quot; varies from country to country, or among different entities or institutions in the same country or region.{{Dubious|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeless.org.au/glossary.htm &quot;Glossary defining homelessness&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''homeless'' may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a [[homeless shelter]], a [[warming center]], a [[domestic violence]] shelter or other ''ad hoc'' housing situation.

In western countries the large majority of homeless are men (75-80%), with single males particularly over represented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=-XafTs3IHMjG8QOH9MHXBQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=wvoo7zQgY5cC&amp;dq=Homelessness+%22large+majority%22+male&amp;q=large+majority%22+male#search_anchor Social inequality: forms, causes ... - Charles E.

== Difficulties in classification: lack of generally agreed nomenclature==
The &quot;unsheltered&quot; are that segment of a homeless community who do not have ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep. Such persons frequently prefer the term &quot;houseless&quot; to the term &quot;homeless&quot;. Others may use the term [[street people]] which does not fully encompass all unsheltered in that many such persons do not spend their time on urban &quot;street&quot; environments, and to the contrary shun such locales and prefer to convert unoccupied buildings, or to inhabit mountains or, more often, lowland meadows, creeks and beaches&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Inside Straight Edge&quot;.

&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of them are generally in transit, but there is no generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldtimer.wordpress.com/2007/05/21/houseless-and-homeless-not-same-thing âHouseless and Homeless Not Same Thingâ | Oldtimer Speaks Out&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where &quot;homeless&quot; persons of [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Sinti]] and other ethnic descent have rejected the term &quot;gypsy&quot;. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, [[vagabond]], [[tramp]] or &quot;railroad tramp&quot;. Occasionally these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler, i.e. hobo. The term &quot;bum&quot; is used for persons lacking a [[work ethic]], or ethics generally{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, but its application to persons purely on the basis of homelessness is strictly a form of prejudicial labeling. The term &quot;transient&quot; is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.

Many jurisdictions have developed programs to locate such persons in short term emergency shelter, often in churches or other institutional real property, during particularly cold spells. These are referred to as [[warming centers]], and are credited by their advocates as life saving.&lt;ref&gt;Svitek, Patrick. &quot;Evanston homeless find warm shelters&quot;.

=== United Nations definition ===
The United Nations, either via one of its agencies or via a vote in the General Assembly has agreed upon various minimum conditions for a person to be countable as homeless. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} It is understood that these legal definitions for homelessness may date back to the beginnings of the UN in the late 1940s. The definition of a person being a refugee is at least partly linked to the definition of homelessness as many refugees may have been or are homeless. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} 

In 2004, The United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, defined a homeless household as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Homeless households are those households without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters. They carry their few possessions with them, sleeping in the streets, in doorways or on piers, or in another space, on a more or less random basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/dyb/techreport/hhChar.pdf &quot;United Nations Demographic Yearbook review: National reporting of household characteristics, living arrangements and homeless households : Implications for international recommendations&quot;], United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Statistics Division, Demographic and Social Statistics Branch, 14 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Conference of European Statisticians (CES), held in Geneva, the Group of Experts on Population and Housing Censuses defined homelessness as:&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb20/Attachments/2009MPHASIS_ECE_Homeless-GUID25ae612721cc4c2c87b536892e1ed1e1.pdf &quot;Enumeration of Homeless People&quot;], United Nations Economic and Social Council, 18 August 2009; Economic Commission for Europe Conference of European Statisticians, Group of Experts on Population and Housing Censuses, Twelfth Meeting, Geneva, 28â30 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In its Recommendations for the Censuses of Population and Housing, the CES identifies
homeless people under two broad groups:&lt;br&gt;
(a) Primary homelessness (or rooflessness). This category includes persons living in
the streets without a shelter that would fall within the scope of living quarters;&lt;br&gt;
(b) Secondary homelessness. This category may include persons with no place of
usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodations
(including dwellings, shelters and institutions for the homeless or other living
quarters). This category includes persons living in private dwellings but reporting
âno usual addressâ on their census form.&lt;br&gt;
The CES acknowledges that the above approach does not provide a full definition of the
âhomelessâ.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 25 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted 10 December 1948 by the UN General Assembly, contains this text regarding housing and quality of living:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a25 Article 25] - Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted 10 December 1948.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== HUD technical definitions of homelessness===
[[Homelessness in the United States]] is addressed by [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] which promulgates best practices and definitions which are highly influential.
HUD defines homeless as pertinent to an individual who:&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), [http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/homelessness/definition &quot;Federal Definition of Homeless&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
#  lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate night-time residence; and
#  has a primary night-time residence that is -
## a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill);
## an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or
## a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings

=== Chronic homelessness, an area of emerging concern===

(HUD) defines a &quot;chronically homeless&quot; person as &quot;an unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition who has either been continuously homeless for a year or more, or has had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/chronic.cfm HUD working definition of Chronically homeless]&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the current literature takes note that such persons often account for a disproportionately large percent of the public and private expenditures related to homelessness. In response to this perception, there is as of early 2011 an increased momentum, particularly on both US coasts, to &quot;target&quot; the chronically homeless utilizing a [[vulnerability index]] system. These &quot;VI's&quot; code for conditions such as advance kidney or liver disease, HIV-AIDS or multiple hospitalization as well as factors such as age. Criticism has been relatively muted as parties often critical of conventional homeless service systems recognize a window of opportunity for innovations. Common Ground is an effort which originated in NYC, claiming high success in the Times Square area, and now proliferating its model in other areas such as Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonground.org/ Common Ground website] New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

===Area of emerging interest: the unsheltered===

The &quot;unhoused&quot; are that segment of a homeless community who do not have ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep, as referred to in the HUD definition as persons occupying &quot;place not designed for ... sleeping accommodation for human beings. Such persons frequently prefer the term &quot;houseless&quot; to the term &quot;homeless&quot;. Recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term &quot;unsheltered homeless.&quot; HUD requires jurisdictions which participate in [[Continuum of Care]] grant programs to count their homeless every two years. These counts have led to a variety of creative measures to avoid undercounting. Thus teams of counters, often numbering in the hundreds in logistically complex volunteer efforts, seek out the unsheltered in various nooks and crannies.&lt;ref&gt;WWW.COMMONGROUND.ORG&lt;/ref&gt;There has been a significant number of unsheltered persons dying of [[hypothermia]], adding impetus to the trend of establishing [[warming center]]s as well as extending the enumeration surveys with vulnerability indexes &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Detroit cuts funding for homeless warming centers&quot;.

==History==
===England and the USA===
====Early history through the 1800s====
Following the [[Peasants' Revolt]], English [[constable]]s were [[English Poor Laws|authorised under a 1383 statute]] to collar [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonds]] and force them to show support; if they could not, the penalty was [[gaol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntosh&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-521-89404-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vagabonds could be sentenced to the [[stocks]] for three days and nights; in 1530, [[flagellation|whipping]] was added. The presumption was that vagabonds were unlicensed [[beggar]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;McIntosh&quot;/&gt; In 1547, a bill was passed that subjected vagrants to some of the more extreme provisions of the criminal law, namely two years servitude and branding with a &quot;V&quot; as the penalty for the first offense and death for the second. Large numbers of vagabonds were among the [[convicts]] transported to the American colonies in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyamericancrime.com/www.earlyamericancrime.com/convict-transportation/convict-voyages/overview-2 Convict Voyages (1): Overview], by Anthony Vaver, Early American Crime, January 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century in England, the state first tried to give housing to [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] instead of punishing them, by introducing [[bridewell]]s to take vagrants and train them for a profession. In the 17th and 18th centuries, these were replaced by [[workhouse]]s but these were intended to discourage too much reliance on state help.

[[Image:Kanalbewohner um1900.jpg|thumb|A homeless man lives in a [[Sewerage|sewer]], [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], 1900.]]

The growing movement toward social concern sparked the development of rescue missions, such as America's first rescue mission, the New York City Rescue Mission, founded in 1872 by Jerry and Maria McAuley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycrescue.org/ New York City Rescue Mission website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycrescue.org/413019.ihtml History of the New York Rescue Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

In smaller towns, there were [[hobo]]s, who temporarily lived near train tracks and hopped onto trains to various destinations. Especially following the [[American Civil War]], a large number of homeless men formed part of a counterculture known as &quot;hobohemia&quot; all over America. This phenomenon re-surged in the 1930s during and after the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Depastino, Todd, [http://books.google.com/books?id=6RFcUQKNm08C&amp;printsec=frontcover &quot;Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America&quot;], Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 2003.

====Early 20th century====

''How the Other Half Lives'' later inspired [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The People of the Abyss]]'' (1903).  This raised public awareness, causing some changes in building codes and some social conditions.

These were later replaced by dormitory housing (&quot;spikes&quot;) provided by local boroughs, and these were researched by the writer [[George Orwell]]. By the 1930s in England, there were 30,000 people living in these facilities. In 1933, George Orwell wrote about poverty in London and Paris, in his book ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]''.

In general, in most countries, many towns and cities had an area which contained the poor, transients, and afflicted, such as a &quot;[[skid row]]&quot;. In New York City, for example, there was an area known as &quot;[[Bowery (Manhattan)|the Bowery]]&quot;, traditionally, where [[alcoholics]] were to be found sleeping on the streets, bottle in hand.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty, hunger, and
homelessness. There were two million homeless people migrating across the United States.&lt;ref name=Depression&gt;[http://amhist.ist.unomaha.edu/lessons/Ruben%20Cano_Why%20did%20the%20Great%20Depression%20happen%3F_lesson_template_mps.doc Overproduction of Goods, Unequal Distribution of Wealth, High Unemployment, and Massive Poverty], From: President's Economic Council&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Street Sleeper 8 by DS.JPG|thumb|Although [[The Bowery]] once was synonymous with homelessness, it has since become an avenue of high-priced luxury condominiums that jockey for space with its past.]]

In the 1960s, the nature and growing problem of homelessness changed in England as public concern grew. The number of people living &quot;rough&quot; in the streets had increased dramatically. However, beginning with the Conservative administration's Rough Sleeper Initiative, the number of people sleeping rough in London fell dramatically. This initiative was supported further by the incoming Labour administration from 2009 onwards with the publication of the 'Coming in from the Cold' strategy published by the Rough Sleepers Unit, which proposed and delivered a massive increase in the number of hostel bed spaces in the capital and an increase in funding for street outreach teams, who work with rough sleepers to enable them to access services.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Wendy. Rough Sleepers, Standard Note SN/SP/2007, House of Commons Library   [http://www.parliament.uk/briefingpapers/commons/lib/research/briefings/snsp-02007.pdf],&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later 20th century====
{{Or|date=February 2011}}
Modern homelessness started as a result of economic stresses in society and reductions in the availability of affordable housing such as [[Single Room Occupancy|single room occupancies]] (SROs) for poorer people. In the United States, in the 1970s, the [[deinstitutionalisation]] of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor which seeded the homeless population, especially in urban areas such as New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scherl DJ, Macht LB |title=Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=599â604 |year=1979 |month=September |pmid=223959 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=223959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Community Mental Health Act]] of 1963  was a predisposing factor in setting the stage for homelessness in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rochefort DA |title=Origins of the &quot;Third psychiatric revolution&quot;: the Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 |journal=J Health Polit Policy Law |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1â30 |year=1984 |pmid=6736594 |url=http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6736594 |doi=10.1215/03616878-9-1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into SROs and supposed to be sent to community mental health centers for treatment and follow-up. It never quite worked out properly, the community mental health centers mostly did not materialize, and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldman S |title=Out of the hospital, onto the streets: the overselling of benevolence |jstor=3561609 |journal=Hastings Cent Rep |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=5â7 |year=1983 |month=June |pmid=6885404 |doi=10.2307/3561609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Borus JF |title=Sounding Board. De-institutionalization of the chronically mentally ill |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=305 |issue=6 |pages=339â342 |year=1981 |month=August |pmid=7242636 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198108063050609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as real estate prices and neighborhood pressure increased to move these people out of their areas, the SROs diminished in number, putting most of their residents in the streets. Other populations were mixed in later, such as people losing their homes for economic reasons, and those with addictions (although alcoholic [[hobos]] had been visible as homeless people since the 1890s, and those stereotypes fueled public perceptions of homeless people in general), the elderly, and others.

Many places where people were once allowed freely to loiter, or purposefully be present, such as churches, public libraries and atriums, became stricter as the homeless population grew larger and increasingly congregated in these places. As a result, many churches closed their doors when services were not being held, libraries began enforcing &quot;no eyes shut&quot; and sometimes dress codes, and most{{Dubious|date=February 2011}} places hired private security guards to carry out these policies, creating a social tension. Many public toilets were closed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

This banished the homeless population to sidewalks, parks, under bridges, and the like. They also lived in the subway and railroad tunnels in New York City. They seemingly became socially invisible, which was the apparent effect of many of the enforcement policies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The homeless shelters, which were generally night shelters, made people leave in the morning to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping. There were some daytime shelters where people could go, instead of being stranded on the streets, and they could be helped, get counseling, avail themselves of resources, meals, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is [[Saint Francis House (Boston)|Saint Francis House]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], founded in the early 1980s, which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the [[settlement movement|settlement house]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, Thomas, Jr., [http://tomkeane.com/archives/2003/tom07042003.htm &quot;Greiff's activism isn't just a good act&quot;], Friday, July 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Homesless in Roma.jpg|thumb|Homeless person in [[Rome]]]]

Many homeless keep all their possessions with them because they have no access to storage. There was also the reality of the &quot;bag&quot; people, the shopping cart people, and the soda can collectors (known as [[binner]]s or dumpster divers) who sort through garbage to find items to sell, trade and eat. These people carry around all of their possessions with them all the time because they have no place to store them. If they had no access to or capability to get to a shelter and possible bathing, or access to toilets and laundry facilities, their hygiene was lacking. This again created social tensions in public places.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

These conditions created an upsurge in [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]],[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019922.htm &quot;Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Among Homeless Persons : Recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis&quot;], April 17, 1992 / 41(RR-5);001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slutkin G.

In 1974, Kip Tiernan founded [[Rosie's Place]] in Boston, the first drop-in and emergency shelter for women in the United States, in response to the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country.

In 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action suit before the courts, ''Callahan v. Carey'', against the City and State, arguing for a person's state constitutional &quot;right to shelter&quot;. It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women.
[[Image:Street Sleeper 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A homeless person's shelter.]]

By the mid-1980s, there was also a dramatic increase in family homelessness. Tied into this was an increasing number of impoverished and runaway children, teenagers, and young adults, which created a new sub-stratum of the homeless population ([[street children]] or street youth).&lt;ref&gt;Tull, Tanya, [http://wiki.nlchp.org/download/attachments/7438857/TANYA+TULL+TESTIMONY-Maxine+Waters+Hearing.doc?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1239895515000 &quot;Beyond Shelter: Testimony of Tanya Tull, President/CEO Before the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunities House Committee on Financial Services March 28, 2009&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nunez, Ralph, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/798021 &quot;Family Homelessness in New York City: A Case Study&quot;], ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 116, No. 3 (Autumn, 2001), pp. 367â379, The Academy of Political Science.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Steven, [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1883966,00.html &quot;Report Says 1 in 50 U.S. Kids Is Homeless&quot;], ''Time'' magazine, Tuesday, Mar. 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in the 1980s, in the United States, some federal legislation was introduced on homelessness as a result of the work of Congressman [[Stewart McKinney (politician)|Stewart B. McKinney]]. In 1987, the [[McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act]] was enacted.

Several organizations in some cities, such as New York and Boston, tried to be inventive about help to the swelling number of homeless people. In New York City, for example, in 1989, a [[street newspaper]] was created called &quot;[[Street News]]&quot; which put some homeless to work, some writing, producing, and mostly selling the paper on streets and trains.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Dana, &quot;Read all about it: street papers flourish across the US&quot;, The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', November 17, 2003. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1117/p13s01-lihc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written ''[[pro bono]]'' by a combination of homeless, celebrities, and established writers. In 1991, in England, a street newspaper, following on the New York model was established, called ''[[The Big Issue]]'' and was published weekly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigissue.com/ ''The Big Issue'']&lt;/ref&gt; Its circulation grew to 300,000. Chicago has ''[[StreetWise]]'' which has the largest circulation of its kind in the United States, thirty thousand. Boston has a ''[[Spare Change News]]'' newspaper, founded in 1992 by a small group of homeless people in Boston, built on the same model as the others: homeless helping themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Spare Change's Most Insidious Myths | first = David J. | last = Jefferson | url = http://sparechangenews.net/news/spare-changes-most-insidious-myths | newspaper = [[Spare Change News]] | publisher = Homeless Empowerment Project | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle has ''[[Real Change]]'', a $1 newsletter that aims to directly benefits homeless people and also reports on economic issues in the area.  Portland, Oregon has ''[[Street Roots]]'', with articles and poetry by homeless writers, sold on the street for a dollar. More recently, ''[[Street Sense (newspaper)|Street Sense]]'', in Washington, D.C. has gained a lot of popularity and helped many make the move out of homelessness. Students in Baltimore, MD have opened a satellite office for that street paper as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetsense.org/ ''Street Sense'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trends in homelessness are closely tied to neighborhood conditions according to a report by the [[Edna McConnell Clark Foundation]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;''Families on the move: Breaking the cycle of homelessness.'',Notkin, S., Rosenthal, B., &amp; Hopper, K.,  New York: [[Edna McConnell Clark Foundation]] Ken Burnett, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twenty-first century====
[[Image:Homeless koelner dom.JPG|thumb|right| Sleeping homeless person in the corner of Cologne Cathedral, Germany, 2010]]

In 2002, research showed that children and families were the largest growing segment of the homeless population in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;FACS, &quot;Homeless Children, Poverty, Faith and Community: Understanding and Reporting the Local Story&quot;, March 26, 2002
Akron, Ohio. [http://www.facsnet.org/edu/progs/family_03-26-02.php3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition for the Homeless, &quot;Homeless Youth&quot; 2005 {{PDFlink|[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/facts/youth.pdf]|164&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this has presented new challenges, especially in services, to agencies.

Some trends involving the plight of homeless people have provoked some thought, reflection and debate. One such phenomenon is paid physical advertising, colloquially known as &quot;[[Sandwich board|sandwich board men]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber Cindy, &quot;Sandwich men bring in the bread and butter&quot;, Columbia (University) News Service, May 8, 2002. [http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/studentwork/cns/2002-05-08/syndication/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]] and [[CNN]], &quot;Pizza company hires homeless to hold ads&quot;, Tuesday, June 17, 2003. [http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/06/17/offbeat.pizza.ap/]&lt;/ref&gt; and another specific type as &quot;[[Bumvertising]]&quot;.

Another trend is the side-effect of unpaid free advertising of companies and organizations on shirts, clothing and bags, to be worn by homeless and poor people, given out and donated by companies to homeless shelters and charitable organizations for otherwise altruistic purposes. These trends are reminiscent of the &quot;sandwich board signs&quot; carried by poor people in the time of [[Charles Dickens]] in the Victorian 19th century in England&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/advertising/sandwichmen.htm Victorian London site, &quot;Sandwich Men&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and later during the [[Great Depression]] in the United States in the 1930s.

In the USA, the government asked many major cities to come up with a ten year plan to end homelessness. One of the results of this was a &quot;[[Housing first]]&quot; solution, rather than to have a homeless person remain in an emergency homeless shelter it was thought to be better to quickly get the person permanent housing of some sort and the necessary support services to sustain a new home. But there are many complications of this kind of program and these must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term.&lt;ref name=&quot;HF1&quot;&gt;Abel, David, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/02/24/for_the_homeless_keys_to_a_home/ &quot;For the homeless, keys to a home: Large-scale effort to keep many off street faces hurdles&quot;], Boston Globe, February 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HF2&quot;&gt;[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/305/index.html &quot;Home at Last? â A radical new approach to helping the homeless&quot;], ''[[NOW on PBS|NOW]]'' TV program, December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some formerly homeless people, who were finally able to obtain housing and other assets which helped to return to a normal lifestyle, have donated money and volunteer services to the organizations that provided aid to them during their homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Solutions at Work, [http://www.solutionsatwork.org/InTheNews/Hatton.html &quot;Formerly Homeless Boston Man Donates Significant Portion of Social Security Retro-Check to the Organizations and People Who Gave Him a 'Hand Up'&quot;], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, some social service entities that help homeless people now employ formerly homeless individuals to assist in the care process.

Homelessness has migrated toward rural and suburban areas. The number of homeless people has not changed dramatically but the number of homeless families has increased according to a report of HUD.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Koch.&quot;Homelessness in Suburbs Increases. USA Today, July 9, 2009: 3a&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Congress appropriated $25 million in the [[McKinneyâVento Homeless Assistance Act|McKinney-Vento]] Homeless Assistance Grants for 2008 to show the effectiveness of Rapid Re-housing programs in reducing family homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Alliance to End Homelessness]], [http://www.endhomelessness.org/content/article/detail/2032 &quot;Rapid Re-Housing&quot;], July 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], [http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/programs/ &quot;Homeless Assistance Programs&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance to End Homelessness, [http://www.endhomelessness.org/section/policy/legislature/federalbudget &quot;HUD and McKinney-Vento Appropriations&quot;], FY 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, President Obama signed the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], part of which addressed homelessness prevention, allocating $1.5 billion for a Homeless Prevention Fund. The funding for it was called the &quot;Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program&quot; (HPRP), and was distributed using the formula for the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], [http://www.hudhre.info/hprp/ &quot;Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act into Public Law (Public Law 111-22 or &quot;PL 111-22&quot;), reauthorizing [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]]'s Homeless Assistance programs. It was part of the [[Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009]]. The HEARTH act allows for the prevention of homelessness, rapid re-housing, consolidation of housing programs, and new homeless categories. In the eighteen months after the bill's signing, HUD must make regulations implementing this new McKinney program.
&lt;ref&gt;National Alliance to End Homelessness, [http://www.endhomelessness.org/content/general/detail/2098 &quot;Summary of HEARTH Act&quot;], June 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlchp.org/content/pubs/HEARTH_Act_Overview_for_Web1.pdf &quot;The HEARTH Act â An Overview&quot;], National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, some homeless advocacy organizations, such as the National Coalition for the Homeless, reported and published perceived problems with the HEARTH Act of 2009 as a HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization bill, especially with regard to privacy, definitional ineligibility, community roles, and restrictions on eligible activities.&lt;ref&gt;National Coalition for the Homeless, [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/2009Policy/HMV.pdf &quot;NCH Public Policy Recommendations: HUD McKinney-Vento Reauthorization&quot;], Washington, D.C., September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia and the USSR===
After the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Russia in 1861, major cities experienced a large influx of former peasants who sought jobs as industrial workers in rapidly developing Russian industry. These people often lived in harsh conditions, sometimes renting a room, shared between several families. There also was a large number of shelterless homeless.

Immediately after the [[October Revolution]] a special program of &quot;compression&quot; (&quot;ÑÐ¿Ð»Ð¾ÑÐ½ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ðµ&quot;) was enabled: people who had no shelter were settled in flats of those who had large (4,5 or 6 room) flats with only one room left to previous owners. The flat was declared state property. This led to a large number of [[Kommunalka|shared flats]]  where several families lived simultaneously. Nevertheless the problem of complete homelessness was mostly solved as anybody could apply for a room or a place in dormitory (the number of shared flats steadily decreased after large-scale residential building program was implemented starting in 1960s). By 1922 there were at least 7 million homeless children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_/ai_n8801575 And Now My Soul Is Hardened: Abandoned Children in Soviet Russia, 1918â1930], By Thomas J. Hegarty, Canadian Slavonic Papers&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the creation of a large number of orphanages. By 1930s the USSR declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a [[propiska]] â a place of permanent residency. Nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission (called &quot;order&quot;) to register in another place. If someone wanted to move to another city or expand their living area, he had to find a partner who wanted to mutually exchange the flats. The right for shelter was secured in the Soviet constitution. Not having permanent residency was legally considered a crime.

There were also virtually no empty and unused apartments in the cities: any flat where nobody was registered was immediately lent by the state at symbolic price to others who needed better living conditions. If a person who had permanent registration could not pay for shelter, nobody had right to evict them, only to demand money through a court.

After the breakup of the USSR the problem of homelessness sharpened dramatically, partially because of the legal vacuum of early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market. In 1991 articles 198 and 209 of Russian criminal code which instituted criminal penalty for not having permanent residence were abolished. Because most flats had been privatized and many people sold their last shelter without successfully buying another, there was a sharp increase of homeless. Renting apartments from a private owner became widespread (which usually only gives temporary registration and apartment owner could evict the leaser after the contract is over, or if the  money was not paid). In Moscow, the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kulac.narod.ru/statya/bomz.html ÐÐµÐ·Ð´Ð¾Ð¼Ð½Ð¾ÑÑÑ Ð²ÑÐµÑÐ°, ÑÐµÐ³Ð¾Ð´Ð½Ñ... ÐÐ°Ð²ÑÑÐ°?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1990s certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness, such as prohibition of selling last flat with registered children.

Nevertheless, the state is still obliged to give permanent shelter for free to anybody who needs better living conditions or has no permanent registration, because the right to shelter is still included in the constitution. This may take many years, though. Nobody still has the right to strip a person of permanent residency without their will, even the owner of the apartment. This creates problems for banks because mortgage loans became increasingly popular. Banks obliged to provide a new, cheaper flat for a person instead of the old one if the person fails to repay the loan, or wait until all people who live in the flat are dead. Several projects of special cheap 'social' flats for those who failed to repay mortgages were proposed to facilitate mortgage market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

* CriminalityâSome homeless may have committed crimes and are therefore hiding from the authorities.

A substantial percentage of the U.S. homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name = &quot;glrdtz&quot;&gt;Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio (2006-09-17). [http://www.cohhio.org/resources/factsheets/Chicagofactsheet.html Homelessness: The Causes and Facts]. Retrieved 2006-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times.

Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable.&lt;ref&gt;For example, cf. [http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/mpi/mpi_newsrelease.htm &quot;News Release: Personal Income for Metropolitan Areas, 2006&quot;], [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Paul Koegel of [[RAND|RAND Corporation]], a seminal researcher in first generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koegel1&quot;/&gt;

===Demographics===
In western countries such as the United States, the typical homeless person is [[male]] and [[single person|single]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LwvA5RSeexsC&amp;q=%22peter+marin%22&amp;dq=%22peter+marin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=i2yeTrjWD4au8QON7pC1CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ The homeless: opposing viewpoints - Tamara L.

===Problems faced by people who are homeless===
{{Main|Discrimination against the homeless}}

The basic problem of homelessness is the human need for personal shelter, warmth and safety. Other basic difficulties include:
* personal security, quiet, and privacy, especially for sleeping
* safekeeping of bedding, clothing and possessions, which may have to be carried at all times
* hygiene and sanitary facilities
* cleaning and drying of clothes
* obtaining, preparing and storing food in quantities
* keeping contacts, without a permanent location or mailing address
* hostility and legal powers against urban vagrancy.

Homeless people face many problems beyond the lack of a safe and suitable home. They are often faced with many social disadvantages also, reduced access to private and public services and reduced access to vital necessities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Randall Amster|Amster, Randall]]|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/lost-in-space-the-criminalization-globalization-and-urban-ecology-of-homelessness/oclc/221150739|title=Lost in Space: The Criminalization, Globalization, and Urban Ecology of Homelessness|publisher=LFB Scholarly|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=1-59332-297-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced access to health care and dental services.
* Limited access to education.
* Increased risk of suffering from violence and abuse.
* General rejection or discrimination from other people.
* Loss of usual relationships with the mainstream
* Not being seen as suitable for employment.
* Reduced access to banking services
* Reduced access to communications technology

There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by [[WFXT|FOX 25 TV]] in [[Boston]] wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudet, Mike, [http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 &quot;FOX Undercover: Employees implicated in thefts from local homeless&quot;], FOX 25 TV, Boston, Tuesday, 22 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith,Stephen, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/02/23/shelter_kitchen_theft_prevalent_report_says/ &quot;Shelter kitchen theft prevalent, report says&quot;], ''The Boston Globe'', February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violent crimes against homeless people====
There have been many violent crimes committed against people who are homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Fantz, Ashley, [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/19/homeless.attacks/index.html?iref=newssearch &quot;Teen 'sport killings' of homeless on the rise&quot;], [[CNN]], February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found that the rate of such crimes is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Lewan, Todd, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-08-homelessattacks_N.htm &quot;Unprovoked Beatings of Homeless Soaring&quot;], [[Associated Press]], April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[National Coalition for the Homeless]], [http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/hatecrimes/ Hate, &quot;Violence, and Death on Main Street USA: A report on Hate Crimes and Violence Against People Experiencing Homelessness, 2008&quot;], August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assistance and resources available to homeless people==
Most countries provide a variety of services to assist homeless people. They often provide food, shelter and clothing and may be organized and run by community organizations (often with the help of volunteers) or by government departments. These programs may be supported by government, charities, churches and individual donors.

In 1998, a study by Koegel and Schoeni of a homeless population in Los Angeles, California, reported that a significant number of homeless do not participate in government assistance programs, and the authors reported being puzzled as to why that was, with the only possible suggestion from the evidence being that transaction costs were perhaps too high.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeni, Robert F &amp; Koegel, Paul, 1998. &quot;Economic Resources of the Homeless: Evidence from Los Angeles,&quot; Contemporary Economic Policy, Oxford University Press, vol. 16(3), pages 295â308, July.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] have a special [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] housing voucher program called VASH (Veterans Administration Supported Housing), or HUD-VASH, which gives out a certain number of Section 8 subsidized housing vouchers to eligible homeless and otherwise vulnerable US armed forces veterans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.va.gov/homeless/page.cfm?pg=53 The Department of Housing and Urban Development and VA's Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social supports===
While some homeless people are known to have community with one another,&lt;ref&gt;[http://usm.maine.edu/swo/faculty/david-wagner.html Wagner, David]. [http://books.google.com/books?id=lq1jpP57r_4C&amp;printsec=frontcover Checkerboard Square: Culture and Resistance in a Homeless Community] (Boulder: Westview Press), 1993. ISBN 0-8133-1585-9&lt;/ref&gt; providing each other various types of support,&lt;ref&gt;Snow, David A. and Leon Anderson. Down on their Luck: A Study of Homeless Street People (Berkeley: University of California Press), 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; people who are not homeless also may provide them friendship, food, [[relational care]], and other forms of assistance.  Such social supports may be done through a formal process, such as under the auspices of a [[non-governmental organization]], religious organization, or [[homeless ministry]], or may be done on an individual basis.

===Income sources===
Many non-profit organizations such as [[Goodwill Industries]] maintain a mission to &quot;provide skill development and work opportunities to people with barriers to employment&quot;, though most of these organizations are not primarily geared toward homeless individuals.  Many cities also have [[street newspapers]] or magazines: publications designed to provide employment opportunity to homeless people or others in need by street sale.

While some homeless have paying jobs, some must seek other methods to make money. [[Begging]] or panhandling is one option, but is becoming increasingly illegal in many cities. Despite the stereotype, not all homeless people panhandle, and not all panhandlers are homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Karash, Robert L., [http://sparechangenews.net/news/spare-change &quot;Spare Change?&quot;], ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston, March 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sennott, Adam, [http://sparechangenews.net/news/panhandling-beacon-hill-lowdown-reported-crackdown &quot;Panhandling on Beacon Hill: The Lowdown on a Reported Crackdown&quot;], ''Spare Change News'', Boston, June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Another option is [[busking]]: performing tricks, playing music, drawing on the sidewalk, or offering some other form of entertainment in exchange for donations. In cities where [[plasmapheresis]] centers still exist, homeless people may generate income through frequent visits to these centers.

Homeless people have been known to commit crimes just to be sent to [[County jail|jail]] or [[prison]] for food and shelter. In police slang, this is called &quot;three hots and a cot&quot; referring to the three hot daily meals and a cot to sleep on given to prisoners.

Invented in 2005, in Seattle, [[Bumvertising]], an informal system of hiring homeless people to advertise by a young entrepreneur, is providing food, money, and bottles of water to sign-holding homeless in the Northwest.

===Australia===
In Australia the [[Supported Accommodation Assistance Program]] (SAAP) is a joint Commonwealth and state government program  which provides funding for more than 1,200 organisations which are aimed to assist homeless people or those in danger of becoming homeless, as well as women and children escaping [[domestic violence]] [http://www.aihw.gov.au/publications/index.cfm/title/10191]. They provide accommodation such as refuges, shelters and half-way houses, and offer a range of supported services. The Commonwealth has assigned over $800 million between 2000â2005 for the continuation of SAAP.

The current program, governed by the Supported Assistance Act 1994, specifies that &quot;the overall aim of SAAP is to provide transitional supported accommodation and related support services, in order to help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. This legislation has been established to help the homeless people of the nation and help rebuild the lives of those in need, the joining of the states also helps enhance the meaning of the legislation and demonstrates the collaboration of the states and their desire to improve the nation as best they can.

===United States===
[[Housing first|Housing First]] is an initiative to help homeless people reintegrate into society, and out of homeless shelters. It was initiated by the federal government's [[Interagency Council on Homelessness]]. It asks cities to come up with a plan to end chronic homelessness. In this direction, there is the belief that if homeless people are given independent housing to start, with some proper social supports, then there would be no need for emergency homeless shelters, which it considers a good outcome. However this is a controversial position.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Florence; Sayfan, Hadar,  [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/06/24/first_things_first/ &quot;First things first: 'Housing first,' a radical new approach to ending chronic homelessness, is gaining ground in Boston&quot;], ''Boston Globe'', Sunday, June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roncarati, Jill, [http://www.bhchp.org/documents/JillsoundingboardJAAP0608.pdf &quot;Homeless, housed, and homeless again&quot;], Journal of the American Academy of Physician's Assistants, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Miami, Florida's [[Community Partnership for Homeless]] launched a national outreach program in 2008 to help other communities throughout the United States address homelessness. Since its inception in 1993, CPH has served nearly 76,000 residents with a successful outplacement rate of nearly 62 percent in Miami-Dade County, Florida.  The number of homeless people in the county has declined by 83 percent. The national program shares CPH's model of Homeless Assistance Centers, job training programs, on-site childcare, housing assistance and more. The organization also provides background on its unique funding structure and partnerships within the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cphi.org Community Partnership for Homeless] â webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

In Boston, Massachusetts, in September 2007, an outreach to homeless people was established in the [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]], after some arrests and shootings, and in anticipation of the cold winter ahead. This outreach targets homeless people who would normally spend their sleeping time on the Boston Common, and tries to get them into housing, trying to skip the step of an emergency shelter.

Applications for Boston Housing Authority were being handed out and filled out and submitted. This is an attempt to enact by outreach the Housing First initiative, federally mandated. Boston's Mayor, [[Thomas Menino]], was quoted as saying &quot;The solution to homelessness is permanent housing&quot;. Still, this is a very controversial strategy, especially if the people are not able to sustain a house with proper community, health, substance counseling, and mental health supportive programs.&lt;ref&gt;St. Martin, Greg, [http://www.metrobostonnews.com/us/article/2007/09/17/02/2107-72/index.xml &quot;Seeking help for homeless on Common: Program hopes to offer housing&quot;], ''Boston Metro'' newspaper, Monday, September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, as part of the city's ''Leading the Way'' initiative, Mayor [[Thomas Menino|Thomas M. Menino]] of Boston dedicated and opened the Weintraub Day Center which is the first city-operated day center for chronically homeless persons. It is a multi-service center, providing shelter, counseling, healthcare, housing assistance, and other support services. It is a {{convert|3400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility located in the Woods Mullen Shelter. It is also meant to reduce the strain on the city's hospital emergency rooms by providing services and identifying health problems before they escalate into emergencies. It was funded by $3 million in grants from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massmed.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home2 Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA).&lt;ref&gt;Mayor's Office, City of Boston, [http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=4390 &quot;Mayor Menino Dedicates New Day Center for the Homeless&quot;], Press Release, October 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, it was reported that the Housing First Initiative had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], although homeless families were still increasing in number. Some shelters were reducing the number of beds due to lowered numbers of homeless, and some emergency shelter facilities were closing, especially the emergency Boston Night Center.&lt;ref&gt;Brady-Myerov, Monica, [http://www.wbur.org/2010/09/29/homeless &quot;Homelessness On The Decline In Boston&quot;], [[WBUR]] Radio, Boston, September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refuges for homeless people==
[[File:A homeless person's shelter in Australia.JPG|thumb|A homeless person's shelter under a fallen willow tree in Australia.]]
There are many places where a homeless person might seek refuge.
* '''Outdoors''': On the ground or in a [[sleeping bag]], [[tent]], or improvised shelter, such as a large [[cardboard box]], [[dumpster (term)|dumpster]], in a park or vacant lot.
* '''[[Tent city|Tent cities]]''': Ad hoc campsites of tents and improvised shelters consisting of tarpaulins and blankets often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as [[rail yard]]s, [[interstates]] and high transportation veins. A few more elaborate tent cities, such as Dignity Village, are actually hybrids of tent cities and shantytowns. Tent cities frequently consist of ONLY tents and fabric improvised structures, with no semi-permanent wood structures at all.
* '''[[Shantytown]]s''': Ad hoc dwelling sites of improvised shelters and [[shack]]s, usually near [[rail yard]]s, [[interstates]] and high transportation veins. Some shanty towns have interstitial tenting areas, but the predominant feature consists of the hard structures. Each pad of site tends to accumulate roofing, sheathing, plywood, and nailed two by fours.
* '''Derelict structures''': abandoned or condemned buildings
*'''[[Squatting]]''' in an unoccupied house where a homeless person may live without payment and without the owner's knowledge or permission.
* '''Vehicles''': cars or trucks are used as a temporary or sometimes long-term living refuge, for example by those recently evicted from a home. Some people live in [[van]]s, [[sport utility vehicle]]s, covered [[pick-up truck]]s, [[station wagon]]s, [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s, or [[hatchback]]s . Many cities now have safe parking programs in which lawful sites are permitted at churches or in out of the way places. For example, because it is illegal to park on the streets in Santa Barbara, the New Beginnings Counseling Center worked with the city to make parking lots available to accommodate homeless people.&lt;ref name=&quot;radioproject.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.radioproject.org/2009/02/how-we-survive-the-deepening-homeless-crisis/ &quot;How We Survive: The Deepening Homeless Crisis&quot;] Making Contact, produced by National Radio Project.

* '''Public places''': [[Park]]s, [[bus]] or [[train station]]s, [[public libraries]], [[airport]]s, [[public transportation]] vehicles (by continual riding where unlimited passes are available), hospital lobbies or waiting areas, [[college]] campuses, and 24-hour businesses such as [[cafÃ©|coffee shop]]s.

* '''[[Homeless shelter]]s''': such as emergency cold-weather shelters opened by [[Church body|churches]] or community agencies, which may consist of cots in a heated warehouse, or temporary [[Christmas Shelters]]. More elaborate homeless shelters such as Pinellas Hope in Florida provide their residents with a recreation tent, a dining tent, laundry facilities, outdoor tents, casitas, and shuttle services that help inhabitants get to their jobs every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;radioproject.org&quot;/&gt;
* '''Inexpensive [[boarding house]]s''': Also called [[flophouse]]s, they offer cheap, low-quality temporary lodging.
* '''Residential [[hotel]]s''', where a bed as opposed to an entire room can be rented cheaply in a dorm-like environment.
* '''Inexpensive [[motels]]''' also offer cheap, low-quality temporary lodging. However, some who can afford housing live in a motel by choice. For example, [[Travelodge_UK#David_and_Jean_Davidson_stay|David and Jean Davidson]] spent 22 years at a UK [[Travelodge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=480999|title=The couple who stopped off at a Travelodge â and stayed 22 years|author=Paul Sims|date=11 September 2007|accessdate = 2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''24-hour [[Internet cafes]]''' are now used by over 5,000 Japanese &quot;[[Net cafe refugees]]&quot;. An estimated 75% of Japan's 3,200 all-night internet cafes cater to regular overnight guests, who in some cases have become their main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tokyo dreaming|author=Justin McCurry|publisher=The Guardian|date= September 28, 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2178925,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Friends or family''': Temporarily sleeping in dwellings of friends or family members (&quot;couch surfing&quot;). Couch surfers may be harder to recognize than street homeless people&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Susan, [http://www.insidetoronto.com/News/York/article/11919  &quot;Homeless advocates urge council to remember 'couch surfers'&quot;], ''Inside Toronto'', Canada, 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Underground tunnels''' such as abandoned subway, maintenance, or train tunnels are popular among the permanent homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Margaret, &quot;The Tunnel: The Underground Homeless of New York City (Architecture of Despair)&quot;, Yale University Press, 1995. ISBN 0-300-06559-0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toth, Jennifer, &quot;The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City&quot;, Chicago Review Press, October 1, 1995.
ISBN 1-55652-190-1&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of such refuges are called in some places, like New York City, &quot;[[Mole People]]&quot;. Natural caves beneath urban centers allow for places where people can congregate. Leaking water pipes, electric wires, and steam pipes allow for some of the essentials of living.

Homeless people are more likely to suffer injuries and medical problems from their lifestyle on the street, which includes poor nutrition, substance abuse, exposure to the severe elements of weather, and a higher exposure to violence (robberies, beatings, and so on). Yet at the same time, they have little access to public medical services or clinics.&lt;ref name=&quot;HCAH&quot;&gt;[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/health.html &quot;Health Care and Homelessness&quot;], National Coalition for the Homeless, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant challenges in treating homeless people who have psychiatric disorders, because clinical appointments may not be kept, their continuing whereabouts are unknown, their medicines are not taken and monitored, medical and psychiatric histories are not accurate, and for other reasons. Because many homeless people have mental illnesses, this has presented a crisis in care.&lt;ref&gt;McQuistion, Hunter L.; Finnerty, Molly; Hirschowitz, Jack; Susser, Ezra S., &quot;Challenges for Psychiatry in Serving Homeless People With Psychiatric Disorders&quot;, ''Psychiatric Services'' 54:669â676, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Jean-Marc; Boyer, Laurent; Belzeaux, Raoul; Baumstarck-Barrau, Karine; Samuelian, Jean-Claude, &quot;Mental Disorders Among Homeless People Admitted to a French Psychiatric Emergency Service&quot;, ''Psychiatric Services'' 61:264â271, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeless persons often find it difficult to document their date of birth or their address. Because homeless people usually have no place to store possessions, they often lose their belongings, including their identification and other documents, or find them destroyed by police or others. Without a photo ID, homeless persons cannot get a job or access many social services. They can be denied access to even the most basic assistance: clothing closets, food pantries, certain public benefits, and in some cases, emergency shelters.

Obtaining replacement identification is difficult. Without an address, birth certificates cannot be mailed. Fees may be cost-prohibitive for impoverished persons. And some states will not issue birth certificates unless the person has photo identification, creating a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]].&lt;ref&gt;National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, [http://www.nlchp.org/view_report.cfm?id=128 &quot;Photo Identification Barriers Faced by Homeless Persons&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is far less acute in countries which provide free-at-use health care, such as the UK, where hospitals are open-access day and night, and make no charges for treatment. In the US, free-care clinics, for homeless and other people, do exist in major cities, but they often attract more demand than they can meet.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.hds.harvard.edu/cswr/research/RHHI/healing_body/08.moore.pdf &quot;No Angels Here: The Closing of the Pine Street Inn Nurses Clinic, 1972â2003&quot;]}}, by Grace Elizabeth Moore, Harvard Divinity School, Center for the Study of World Religions&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions affecting homeless people are somewhat specialized and have opened a new area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including [[Scabies]], are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold in the winter and they have little access to bathing facilities. They have problems caring for their feet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ring.uvic.ca/07dec06/our-place.html |title=Caring for the footweary homeless |author=Beth Haysom |work=The Ring: The University of Victoria's community newspaper |date=December 2007 |quote=Many of the homeless suffer from &quot;street feet,&quot; which, Bell explains, are really sore feet, blistered and damaged from walking around all day with no means to change socks and shoes or care for their feet. |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5eCmq6wS0 |archivedate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have more severe dental problems than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;An oral health survey of homeless people in Hong Kong (2005) â University of Hong Kong Libraries, Digital Initiatives, Community Health Projects [http://lookup.lib.hku.hk/lookup/bib/B31788932]&lt;/ref&gt; Diabetes, especially untreated, is widespread in the homeless population.&lt;ref&gt;Joslyn, Matthew I., M.D., et al., [http://www.nhchc.org/Publications/clinicalguidelinesDM2007.pdf &quot;Adapting Your Practice: Treatment and Recommendations for Homeless Patients with Diabetes Mellitus&quot;], June 2007, HCH Clinicians' Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, James, J, M.D., editor, et al. &quot;The Health Care of Homeless Persons: a Manual of Communicable Diseases &amp; Common Problems in Shelters &amp; On the Streets&quot;, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, 2004.

There are many organizations providing free care to homeless people in countries which do not offer free medical treatment organised by the state, but the services are in great demand given the limited number of medical practitioners. For example, it might take months to get a minimal dental appointment in a free-care clinic. Communicable diseases are of great concern, especially [[tuberculosis]], which spreads more easily in crowded homeless shelters in high density urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;Collet Marc, Menahem, Georges, Picard, HervÃ©,  [http://www.irdes.fr/EspaceAnglais/Publications/IrdesPublications/QES113.pdf &quot;Why patients attending free health centres seek care: Precalog Survey 1999â2000&quot;], Health Economics Letter, Issues in health economics, IRDES (Institute for Research and Information in Health Economics), Paris, France. nÂ° 113- October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an ongoing concern and studies about the health and wellness of the older homeless population, typically ages fifty to sixty four years of age, and even older, as to whether they are significantly more sickly than their younger counterparts and if they are under-served.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Dennis P.; George, Christine; Walker, Christopher, [http://books.google.com/books?id=oEvI1Swbx_YC&amp;printsec=frontcover âFalling through the cracksâ: health care needs of the older homeless population and their implications&quot;], in Kronenfeld, Jennie Jacobs, ''Care for Major Health Problems and Population Health Concerns: Impacts on Patients, Providers and Policy'', Research in the Sociology of Health Care series, 2008, v.26, pp.187 â 204, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Carl I., [http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/1/5.abstract &quot;Aging and Homelessness&quot;], ''The Gerontologist'' (1999) 39(1): 5â15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Dr. Susan Barrow of the Columbia University Center for Homelessness Prevention Studies reported in a study that the &quot;age-adjusted death rates of homeless men and women were 4 times those of the general US population and 2 to 3 times those of the general population of New York City&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barrow SM, Herman DB, CÃ³rdova P, Struening EL |title=Mortality among homeless shelter residents in New York City |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=529â534 |year=1999 |month=April |pmid=10191796 |pmc=1508869 |url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10191796 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.4.529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, in Boston, Massachusetts, the Jean Yawkey Place, a four-story, {{convert|77653|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building, was opened by the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. It is an entire full service building on the Boston Medical Center campus dedicated to providing health care for homeless people. It also contains a long term care facility, the Barbara McInnis House, which expanded to 104 beds, which is the first and largest medical respite program for homeless people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhchp.org/yawkey.html Jean Yawkey Place] â Boston Health Care for the Homeless&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cromer, Janet M., R.N., [http://www.boston.com/jobs/healthcare/oncall/articles/2008/08/07/feature/ &quot;Moving with Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program: The new home for BHCHP's Barbara McInnis House is a place of healing, trust, and hope&quot;], On Call magazine, August 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, the federal government's HUD agency has required federally funded organizations to use a computer tracking system for homeless people and their statistics, called HMIS (Homeless Management Information System).&lt;ref&gt;Roman, Nan, [http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/132/WNV.html &quot;Tracking the Homeless: An Overview of HMIS&quot;], ShelterForce Magazine, Issue #132, November/December 2003, National Housing Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/hmis/ HUD information on HMIS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Libby, [http://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/2005/meta-crs-7973.tkl &quot;The Home Management Information System&quot;], Congressional Research Service, CRS Report RS22328, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some opposition to this kind of tracking by privacy advocacy groups, such as [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|EPIC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epic.org/privacy/poverty/ EPIC page on HMIS privacy]&lt;/ref&gt; However, HUD considers its reporting techniques to be reasonably accurate for homeless in shelters and programs in its ''Annual Homeless Assessment Report'' to Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008HUDReport&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, [http://www.hud.gov/news/release.cfm?content=pr08-113.cfm &quot;HUD Reports Drop in the Number of Chronically Homeless Persons: More resources and better reporting contribute to annual declines&quot;], 2007 data&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karash, Robert L., [http://sparechangenews.net/news/who-homeless-hud-annual-report-congress-and-homelessness-pulse-project &quot;Who is Homeless?

Actually determining and counting the number of homeless is very difficult in general due to their lifestyle habits.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Christopher, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119833144/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 &quot;Estimating the Number of Homeless: Media Misrepresentation of an Urban Problem&quot;], ''Journal of Urban Affairs'', Wiley InterScience publishing, Volume 18 Issue 4, Pages 431 â 447, 28 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Richard B. and Brian Hall. [http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/2013.html &quot;Permanent Homelessness in America?&quot;], ''Population Research and Policy Review'', Vol. 6, (1987), pp. 3â27.&lt;/ref&gt; There are so-called &quot;hidden homeless&quot; out of sight of the normal population and perhaps staying on private property.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA&quot;&gt;[http://www.shelterpartnership.org/documents/factsheet1_000.pdf &quot;Los Angeles County Homelessness Fact Sheet #1 Number of Homeless People Nightly&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various countries, states, and cities have come up with differing means and techniques to calculate an approximate count. For example, a one night &quot;homeless census count&quot;, called a point-in-time (PIT) count, usually held in the early Winter, for the year, is a technique used by a number of American cities, especially Boston, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/shelter/default.asp Emergency Shelter Commission, City of Boston] â see annual census reports&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofboston.gov/shelter/census/ Annual Homeless Census.

Some communities will give sub-population information to the PIT, such as information on veterans, youth, and elderly individuals as done in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Melissa, [http://www.nrchmi.samhsa.gov/(S(p153kl45sznmr445e5aq2t55))/Resource/One-Two-664414-Calculating-Homelessness-in-America-47790.aspx &quot;One, Two... 664,414: Calculating Homelessness in America&quot;], US [[SAMHSA]], Homelessness Resource Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, an estimated 100 million people worldwide were homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Capdevila, Gustavo, [http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086 &quot;Human Rights:  More Than 100 Million Homeless Worldwide&quot;], IPS, [[Geneva]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The following statistics indicate the approximate average number of homeless people at any one time.  Each country has a different approach to counting homeless people, and estimates of homelessness made by different organizations vary wildly, so comparisons should be made with caution.
:'''[[European Union]]''': 3,000,000 ([[UN-HABITAT]] 2004)

Their Estimate of Sheltered Homeless Persons during a One-Year Period, October 2006 to September 2007, that about 1,589,000 persons used an emergency shelter and/or transitional housing during the 12-month period, which is about 1 in every 200 persons in the United States was in a homeless facility in that time period. Individuals accounted for 1,115,054 or 70.2% and families numbered 473,541 or 29.8%.

The number of homeless people worldwide has grown steadily in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Zarocostas, John, [http://washingtontimes.com/news/2005/apr/10/20050410-105739-5991r/ &quot;Homelessness increasing all over the world&quot;], [[The Washington Times]], April 11, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capdevila, Gustavo, [http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=28086 &quot;Human Rights: More Than 100 Million Homeless Worldwide&quot;], IPS (Inter Press Service), March 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Third World]] nations such as [[Nigeria]], and [[South Africa]], homelessness is rampant, with millions of children living and working on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;The Urban Poverty Group, [http://www.homeless-international.org/doc_docs/UPGCommissionforAfricaSubmission(FINAL)__Dec0425958.pdf &quot;Urban Poverty Group submission to the Commission for Africa&quot;], [[Homeless International]], December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|UN-HABITAT]], [http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=3008&amp;catid=5&amp;typeid=6&amp;subMenuId=0 &quot;The Challenge of Slums â UN-HABITATâs new Global Report on Human Settlements&quot;], January 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Homelessness has become a problem in the countries of China, [[India]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]] despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes.&lt;ref&gt;YXC Project, [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]]/[[UNESCO]], [http://www.youthxchange.net/main/b236_homeless-i.asp &quot;Homeless: Developing Countries&quot;]. &quot;Homelessness has also become a problem in the cities of China, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes and to rising income inequality between social classes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

For people in Russia, especially the youth, alcoholism and substance abuse is a major cause and reason for becoming and continuing to be homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Osborn A |title=Russia's youth faces worst crisis of homelessness and substance misuse since second world war |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7504 |pages=1348 |year=2005 |month=June |pmid=15947386 |pmc=558316 |doi=10.1136/bmj.330.7504.1348-b |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7504/1348-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations, [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|United Nations Centre for Human Settlements]] (UN-Habitat) wrote in its ''Global Report on Human Settlements'' in 1995: &quot;Homelessness is a problem in developed as well as in developing countries. In London, for example, life expectancy among homeless people is more than 25 years lower than the national average.

Poor urban housing conditions are a global problem, but conditions are worst in developing countries. Habitat says that today 600 million people live in life- and health-threatening homes in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The threat of mass homelessness is greatest in those regions because that is where population is growing fastest.

By 2015, the 10 largest cities in the world will be in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Nine of them will be in developing countries: Mumbai, India â 27.4 million; Lagos, Nigeria â 24.4; Shanghai, China â 23.4; Jakarta, Indonesia â 21.2; SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil â 20.8; Karachi, Pakistan â 20.6; Beijing, China â 19.4; Dhaka, Bangladesh â 19; Mexico City, Mexico â 18.8. The only city in a developed country that will be in the top ten is Tokyo, Japan â 28.7 million.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [http://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/habitat/background/bg2.asp &quot;United Nations: Global Report on Human Settlements&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homelessness by country===
* [[Homelessness in Australia]]
* [[Homelessness in Canada]]
* [[Homelessness in England]]
* [[Homelessness in Iraq]]
* [[Homelessness in Israel]]
* [[Homelessness in Japan]]
* [[Homelessness in Scotland]]
* [[Homelessness in the United States]]
* In [[Sweden]],  homelessness should not exist, since the [[municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]] are required to provide a home to any citizen who does not have one. However, the landlords and leaseors have the right to select guests among applicants. Owners (including municipality owned) avoid homeless people, unemployed people or people with a bad [[credit score]]. People who cannot pay their rent, will be evicted, including families with small children. In 2009, 618 children were evicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/farre-barn-vraktes-i-fjol-1.1027099 FÃ¤rre barn vrÃ¤ktes i fjol - DN.SE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In cities with lack of housing, the only availability for homeless are usually shelters, usually privately owned, often of bad quality, for which municipalities pay.
* In [[Italy]], the growing number of homeless in [[Rome]] in 2010 was estimated at 7000.  One third of these are thought to be political refugees and asylum seekers.

==Strategies to reframe approaches to homelessness==
'''Housing first / rapid rehousing'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the USA, the government asked many major cities to come up with a ten year plan to end homelessness; and one of the results of this was a &quot;[[Housing first]]&quot; solution, also known as &quot;rapid re-housing&quot;, which quickly gets a homeless person permanent housing of some sort and the necessary support services to sustain a new home. There are many complications of this kind of program and these must be dealt with to make such an initiative work successfully in the middle to long term.&lt;ref name=&quot;HF1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HF2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karash, Robert L., [http://sparechangenews.net/news/housing-lost-housing-regained-housing-kept-0 &quot;Housing Lost, Housing Regained, Housing Kept&quot;], ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston,  February 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enhanced data collection and evaluation'''
Homeless enumeration counts are mandated by HUD for all jurisdictions participating in HUD Continuum of Care grant programs. These occur as frequently as every two years. More recently,organizations such as [Common Ground] have piggy-backed those counts with compilation of [[Vulnerability Index]]es which prioritize homeless persons. The factors include the existence of late stage terminal disease, HIV-AIDS, kidney or liver disease, frequent hospitalizations and frequent emergency room visits. The data which is compiled which exceeds the BUD mandate is retained and held confidential by Common Ground. Advocates of the system claim high rates of success in placing the most vulnerable persons, but skeptics remain concerned with confidentiality and security issues.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Beyond homelessness ==
'''Transitional housing'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Transitional Housing]] provides temporary housing for the certain segments of the homeless population, including working homeless, and is set up to transition their residents into permanent, affordable housing. It's not in an emergency homeless shelter but usually a room or apartment in a residence with support services. The transitional time can be short, for example one or two years, and in that time the person must file for and get permanent housing and usually some gainful employment or income, even if Social Security or assistance. Sometimes, the transitional housing residence program charges a room and board fee, maybe 30% of an individual's income, which is sometimes partially or fully refunded after the person procures a permanent place to live in. In the USA, federal funding for transitional housing programs was originally allocated in the McKinneyâVento Homeless Assistance Act of 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Martha R.,
[http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/411369_transitional_housing.pdf &quot;Characteristics of Transitional Housing for Homeless Families Final Report&quot;], Urban Institute, Washington, DC, September 7, 2006,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dordick, Gwendolyn A., [http://www.springerlink.com/content/l7110354uw2164n7/ &quot;Recovering from Homelessness: Determining the 'Quality of Sobriety' in a Transitional Housing Program&quot;], ''Journal Qualitative Sociology'', Volume 25, Number 1 / March, 2002, Springer Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karash, Robert L., [http://sparechangenews.net/news/graduate &quot;The Graduate&quot;], ''[[Spare Change News]]'', Boston, March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supportive housing'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Supportive housing]] is a combination of housing and services intended as a cost-effective way to help people live more stable, productive lives. Supportive housing works well for those who face the most complex challengesâindividuals and families confronted with homelessness and who also have very low incomes and/or serious, persistent issues that may include substance abuse, addiction or [[alcoholism]], [[mental illness]], [[HIV/AIDS]], or other serious challenges to a successful life.

'''Pedestrian villages'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2007 urban designer and social theorist [[Michael E. Arth]] proposed a controversial national solution for homelessness that would involve building nearly carfree [[Pedestrian Village]]s in place of what he terms &quot;the current band-aid approach to the problem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth, &quot;A National Solution to Homelessness That Begins Here&quot;, Orlando Sentinel, January 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype, Tiger Bay Village, was proposed for near [[Daytona Beach]], FL. He claims that this would be superior for treating the psychological as well as psychiatric needs of both temporarily and permanently homeless adults, and would cost less than the current approach. It would also provide a lower cost alternative to jail, and provide a half-way station for those getting out of prison. Work opportunities, including construction and maintenance of the villages, as well as the creation of work force agencies would help make the villages financially and socially viable.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Leonard, &quot;Daytona may give vagrants their own resort.&quot; Telegraph.co.uk,  January 24, 2007 [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/23/wdaytona23.xml/ link to article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etan Horowitz, &quot;Developer defends homeless-village concept&quot;, ''Orlando Sentinel'', January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebbecca Mahoney, &quot;Homeless village or leper colony?&quot; Orlando Sentinel, January 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
