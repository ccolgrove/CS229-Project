'''John Edmund Driscoll''' (born June 27, 1981 in [[Fort Belvoir, Virginia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[television]] and [[soap opera]] [[actor]].

==Early life==
Driscoll grew up in Virginia.  He went to [[Woodbridge High School (Virginia)|Woodbridge Senior High School]] in [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] and graduated in 1999.  He was raised in a military family that valued athletics.

Driscoll went to [[George Mason University]] where he majored in theatre and was a member of the [[Kappa Sigma Fraternity]].

==Career==
After he graduated from high school, he was a professional [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] and catalog [[Model (person)|model]] for [[Armani]] and [[Gianni Versace S.p.A.|Versace]], among others.  Modeling led to acting in commercials and musical theatre.

Driscoll's first role was as Brandon on ''[[Young Americans (TV series)|Young Americans]]'', in 2000, in a recurring role.  He also had a recurring role on ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' (2001â2002).  In 2004, he appeared on an episode of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. In 2006, he had a starring role on the short-lived [[NBC]] series, ''[[The Book of Daniel (TV series)|The Book of Daniel]]''.  He also guest starred on ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' that year.

Driscoll is best known, however, for his portrayal of &quot;Coop&quot; ([[Henry Cooper Bradshaw]]) on the daytime drama ''[[Guiding Light]]''.  He joined the show in 2004 and played his final scenes in February 2009, when the character died after injuries sustained in a car accident. 

In July 2009, Driscoll made his debut as [[Chance Chancellor]], another scion of an established soap family, on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. He continued in this role until September 2010, when his character was shot and apparently killed by his half-brother, Ronan. However, it was disclosed to Nina and Philip that Chance was not dead. The character was in the Witness Protection Program.  Driscoll returned for several appearances in February 2011 as Chance became a donor for half-brother Ronan's liver transplant. In May of that year his character rejoined the Army and returned to war in the Middle East on a touching Memorial Day episode, May 30, 2011.

In September 2007, he made his New York stage debut in Matt Morillo's play, ''Angry Young Women in Low-Rise Jeans with High-Class Issues''.
