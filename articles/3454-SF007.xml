It is [[IndiaâBangladesh border|bordered]] by [[India]] on all sides except for a small border with [[Burma]] (Myanmar) to the far southeast and by the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. The capital (and largest city) is [[Dhaka]], also it is the hub of all cultural, political and religious affairs. Together with the Indian state of [[West Bengal]], it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]]. The name ''Bangladesh'' means &quot;Country of Bengal&quot; in the official [[Bengali language]].
The borders of present-day Bangladesh were established with the [[1947 Partition of Bengal|partition of Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|India]] in 1947, when the region became [[East Pakistan]], part of the newly formed nation of [[Pakistan]]. However, it was separated from the [[West Pakistan|western wing]] by {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of Indian territory. Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination, and economic neglect by the politically-dominant West Pakistan, popular agitation grew against [[West Pakistan]] and led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971, which succeeded after Pakistan surrendered to an invasion by an Indian Brigade in Dhaka . After independence, the new state endured famines, natural disasters and widespread poverty, as well as political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]]. The restoration of democracy in 1991 has been followed by relative calm and economic progress.

Bangladesh is a [[parliamentary democracy]], with an elected parliament called the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. It is the [[List of countries by population|ninth most populous country]] and among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated countries]] in the world. A high poverty rate prevails, although the United Nations has acclaimed Bangladesh for achieving tremendous progress in [[Human Development Index|human development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MDG in Bangladesh |url=http://www.undp.org.bd/info/events.php?newsid=734&amp;t=In%20News |title=UNDP in Bangladesh &amp;#124; News and Events |publisher=Undp.org.bd |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11694599 | work=BBC News | title=UN: 'Significant progress' in human development | date=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, the country straddles the fertile [[Ganges Delta|Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta]] and is subject to annual [[monsoon]] floods and [[cyclone]]s.

The country is listed among the [[Next Eleven|Next Eleven economies]]. It is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]], the [[Developing 8 Countries|D-8]] and [[BIMSTEC]], and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. However, Bangladesh continues to face a number of major challenges, including widespread political and bureaucratic corruption, economic competition relative to the world, serious [[overpopulation]], widespread poverty, and an increasing danger of hydrologic shocks brought on by ecological vulnerability to [[climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/10/20/bangladesh_india_at_risk_from_climate_change/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://climatechange.worldbank.org/content/bangladesh-economics-adaptation-climate-change-study&lt;/ref&gt;.

The exact origin of the word &quot;Bangla&quot; or &quot;Bengal&quot; is not known, though it is believed to be derived from ''Bang'', the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/bdtoc.html |chapter=Early History, 1000 B.C.-A.D. 1202 |title=Bangladesh: A country study |editor=James Heitzman and Robert L.

The kingdom of [[Gangaridai]] was formed from at least the 7th century&amp;nbsp;BCE, which later united with [[Bihar]] under the [[Magadha Empire|Magadha]], [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]], [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] and [[Sunga Empire|Sunga]] Empires. Bengal was later part of the [[Gupta Empire]] and [[Harsha|Harsha Empire]] from the 3rd to the 6th centuries&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]. Following its collapse, a dynamic Bengali named [[Shashanka]] founded an impressive short-lived kingdom. After a period of [[anarchy]], the Bengali [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by a shorter reign of the [[Hindu]] [[Sena dynasty]].

Medieval European geographers located paradise at the mouth of the Ganges and although this was overhopeful, Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent until the 16th century. The area's early history featured a succession of Indian empires, internal squabbling, and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance.

Islam was introduced to the Bengal region in the 12th century by Arab Muslim merchants; [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries, and subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread [[Islam]] throughout the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;eaton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=R |year=1996 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |oclc=26634922 76881262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a Turkish general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal in the year 1204. The region was ruled by several [[Sultanate of Bengal|sultans]], [[Hindu Rashtra|Hindu state]]s  and [[Landlord|land-lords]]-[[Baro-Bhuiyan#Baro-Bhuyians of Bengal|Baro-Bhuiyans]] for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.


Maratha empire, a Hindu empire which overran Mughals in 18th century also devastated the Nawab of Bengal from 1742â1751 in a series of raids on Bengal and Bihar which were under Nawab of Bengal, Maratha demolished much of Bengal economy and was not able to withstand the continuous onslaught of Maratha for too long. Nawab Ali Vardi Khan made peace with Maratha thus giving whole of Orissa and parts of Western Bengal to Maratha apart from this a Chauth (1/4th of total revenue) was imposed on other Parts of Bengal and Bihar the amount was 20 [[lakh]]s for Bengal and 12 lakhs for Bihar per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Gordon |title=The Marathas 1600â1818 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&amp;pg=PA133 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-26883-7 |pages=133â}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brijen Kishore Gupta |title=Sirajuddaullah and the East India company, 1756â1757, background to the foundation of British power in India |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o-MUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |year=1966 |publisher=Brill Archive |pages=134â |id=GGKEY:RS7D7HRH8KA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Maratha defeat in Panipat by a coalition of Muslim forces, Maratha returned again under Maratha general Madhoji Sindhia and raided Bengal again. British Empire has stopped the payment of Chauth, to collect this amount they invaded the territory of Bengal in 1760s. This raid continued until Maratha was defeated completely by British Empire in the series of Anglo-Maratha Wars.

From 1517 onwards, Portuguese traders from Goa were traversing the sea-route to Bengal. Only in 1537, were they allowed to settle and open customs houses at Chittagong.

Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The exile government formally took oath at Mujib Nagar in Kustia district of East Pakistan on 17 April 1971, with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first Prime Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Vice President.

After Mujib declared independence of Bangladesh, Yahiaâs brutal crackdown, including a virtual massacre of the intelligentsia in the universities of Bangladesh, was comparable in method to the war crimes of the Nazis. International public opinion was revolted and a tidal wave of hapless refugees, their number soon reaching 10 million, sought shelter in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/birth-of-a-nation/552795/2 |title=Birth of a nation |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for nine months. The [[Bangladesh Forces]] formed within 11 [[list of Sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|sectors]] led by General M.A.G. Osmani consisting of Bengali Regulars, and [[Mukti Bahini]] conducted a massive guerilla war against the Pakistan Forces with all out support from the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. Jointly, the [[Mukti Bahini]] achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan on 16 December 1971, with Indian Armed Forces taking over 90,000 [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].

&lt;!--[[File:JSS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]], a tribute to the martyrs of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]]]--&gt;
After its independence, Bangladesh became a parliamentary democracy, with Mujib as the Prime Minister. In the 1973 parliamentary elections, the Awami League gained an absolute majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot;/&gt; and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascarenhas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London |isbn=0-340-39420-X |oclc=13004864 16583315 242251870}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of bloody coups and counter-coups in the following three months culminated in the ascent to power of General [[Ziaur Rahman]], who reinstated multi-party politics, and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascarenhas&quot;/&gt;

Bangladesh's next major ruler was General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a bloodless coup in 1982, and ruled until 1990, when he was forced to resign after a massive revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union). Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991, and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. However, the Awami League, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. It lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001.

On 11 January 2007, following widespread political unrest, a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The country had suffered from extensive corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm |title=Bangladesh tops most corrupt list |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-10-18 |accessdate=2007-04-13 |first=Waliur |last=Rahman}}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder and political violence. The new caretaker government has made it a priority to root out corruption from all levels of government. To this end, many notable politicians and officials, along with large numbers of lesser officials and party members, have been arrested on corruption charges. The caretaker government held what observers described as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/world/asia/30iht-bangla.5.19007747.html|title=Bangladesh election seen as fair, though loser disputes result|work=New York Times|date=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awami League's [[Sheikh Hasina]] won the elections with a landslide victory and took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/06/us-bangladesh-hasina-idUSTRE5053GG20090106 |title= Hasina takes oath as new Bangladesh prime minister|work=Reuters |date= 2009-01-06|accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh is a [[unitary state]] and [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.bd/Constitution_English/index.htm |title=Constitution of Bangladesh |publisher=Parliament.gov.bd |accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct elections in which all [[citizens]], aged 18 or over, can vote are held every five years for the [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] known as [[Jatiya Sangsad]]. The parliamentary building is known as the ''[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban]]'' and was designed by architect [[Louis Kahn]]. Currently the parliament has 345 members including 45 reserved seats for women, elected from single-member constituencies. The [[Prime Minister]], as the [[head of government]], forms the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and runs the day-to-day affairs of state. While the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the [[President of Bangladesh|President]], he or she must be an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who commands the confidence of the majority of parliament. The President is the [[Head of State|head of state]] but mainly a ceremonial post elected by the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm Background Note: Bangladesh], US Department of State, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

However the President's powers are substantially expanded during the tenure of a [[caretaker government]], which is responsible for the conduct of elections and transfer of power. The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task. This transitional arrangement is an innovation that was pioneered by Bangladesh in its 1991 election and then institutionalized in 1996 through its 13th constitutional amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;amendments&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/as.1997.37.6.01p0256x|last=Khan|first=Zillur R.|title=Bangladesh's experiments with parliamentary democracy|journal=Asian Survey|year=1997|volume=37|issue=6|pages=575â589|jstor=2645531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was drafted in 1972 and has undergone 14 [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amendments&quot;/&gt; The highest [[judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]]. Justices are appointed by the President. The judicial and law enforcement institutions are weak.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICG&quot;&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/south-asia/bangladesh/121-bangladesh-today.aspx Bangladesh Today], Asia Report NÂ°121, [[International Crisis Group]], October 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Separation of powers, judicial from executive was finally implemented on 1 November 2007. It is expected that this separation will make the judiciary stronger and impartial. Laws are loosely based on [[English law|English common law]], but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scripts, and therefore differ between religious communities.

[[List of political parties in Bangladesh|Major parties]] in Bangladesh are the [[Bangladesh Awami League]] and the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). BNP is led by [[Khaleda Zia]] and has politically been allied with [[Islamist]] parties like [[Jamaat Bangladesh]] but practise secular politics. [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s Awami League aligns with more [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] parties. Hasina and Zia are bitter rivals who have dominated politics for over 15 years; each is related to one of the leaders of the independence movement. Another important player is the [[Jatiya Party]], headed by former military dictator Ershad. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been bitter and punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics is particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era. Almost all parties have highly active student wings, and student leaders have been elected to the Parliament.

Two radical terrorist organizations, [[Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh]] (JMJB) and [[Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh]] (JMB), were banned in February 2005. Several small-scale bomb attacks taking place since 1999 have been blamed on those groups, and dozens of suspected members have been detained in security operations, including the heads of those two parties in 2006. The masterminds were tried and executed. The Bangladesh government won praise from world leaders, including Western leaders, for its strong anti-terrorist stance.

The January 22, 2007 election was postponed indefinitely and emergency law declared on January 11, 2007 as the Army backed caretaker government of [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] aimed to prepare a new voter list and crack down on corruption. They also assisted the interim Government of Bangladesh in a drive against corruption, which resulted in Bangladesh's position in [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] changed from the very bottom, where they had been for 3 years in a row, to 147th in just 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table |title=cpi 2008 table /cpi2008/2008/in focus/news room |publisher=Transparency.org |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large alliance led by the Bangladesh Awami League won the December 29, 2008 poll, in a landslide victory. They got 230 seats among 300 seats in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://123.49.39.5/result/report4.php?lang=en |title=Bangladesh Election Commission |publisher=123.49.39.5 |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh pursues a moderate foreign policy that places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In 1974 Bangladesh joined both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] and has since been elected to serve two terms on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] in 1978â1979 and 2000â2001. In the 1980s, Bangladesh played a lead role in founding the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) in order to expand relations with other South Asian states. Since the founding of SAARC 1985, a Bangladeshi has held the post of Secretary General on two occasions.

Bangladesh's most important and complex foreign relationship is with [[India]]. This relationship is informed by historical and cultural ties and is strengthened because of India's involvement of liberating the people of Bangladesh from [[Pakistan]]. This forms an important part of the domestic political discourse. Bangladesh's [[India-Bangladesh relations|relationship with India]] began on a positive note because of India's assistance in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|independence war]] and reconstruction. Throughout the years, relations between both countries have fluctuated for a number of reasons.

A major source of tension between Bangladesh and India is the [[Farakka Barrage|Farakka Dam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MMAli&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=M.M.|last=Ali |title= Indiaâs Major Gains and Losses in World Affairs |url= http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0397/9703025.htm |publisher=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date= March 1997|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, India constructed a dam on the [[Ganges River]] {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the Bangladeshi border. Bangladesh alleges that the dam diverts much needed water from Bangladesh and adds a man-made disaster to the country already plagued by natural disasters. The dam also has terrible ecological consequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMAli&quot; /&gt; On the other hand, India has voiced concerns about anti-Indian separatists and Islamic militants allegedly being harboured across their {{convert|2500|mi|km|sing=on}} border, as well as the flow of illegal migrants, and is [[Indo-Bangladeshi barrier|building a fence along most of it]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/26/asia/AS-FEA-GEN-Bangladesh-Fenced-In.php India quietly ringing Bangladesh with barbed-wire, cutting off former neighbors], by Tim Sullivan, Associated Press, June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the 2007 SAARC meeting both nations pledged to work cooperatively on security, economic and border issues.&lt;ref&gt;Pattanaik, Smruti S., &quot;[http://www.idsa.in/idsastrategiccomments/IndiaBangladeshRelationsaftertheForeignSecretaryLevelTalks_SSPattanaik_170707 India-Bangladesh Relations after the Foreign Secretary Level Talks],&quot; Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses, July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current strength of the army is around 200,000 including reservists,&lt;ref name=&quot;bdmil&quot;&gt;[http://www.bdmilitary.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=124 Bangladesh Military Forces]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}.

Retrieved July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has been called on to provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security during periods of political unrest. Bangladesh is not currently active in any ongoing war, but it did contribute 2,300 troops to the coalition that fought in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991 and Bangladesh is consistently a top (10,736) contributor to [[UN peacekeeping forces]] around the world. As of May 2007, Bangladesh had major deployments in [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Cote d'Ivoire|CÃ´te d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://army.mil.bd/newahq/index5.php?category=177 |title= TOTAL BD PARTICIPATION IN UN DEPL (COMPLETED) |accessdate=2008-05-02 |month=February | year=2007 |publisher= [[Bangladesh Army]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611133501/http://army.mil.bd/newahq/index5.php?category=177 |archivedate = June 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bangladeshi officers enhance UN troopsâ logistical support in Darfur | work = UN News Center | publisher = United Nations | date = 2008-10-23 | url = http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28691&amp;Cr=darfur&amp;Cr1= | accessdate = 2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh enjoys relatively warm ties with the People's Republic of China which has, particularly in the past decade, increased economic cooperation with the South Asian nation. Between 2006 and 2007, trade between the two nations rose by 28.5% and there have been agreements to grant various Bangladeshi commodities tariff-free access to the Chinese market. Cooperation between the [[Military of Bangladesh]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] is also increasing, with joint military agreements signed and Bangladesh procuring Chinese arms which range from small arms to large naval surface combatants such as the Chinese [[Jianghu class frigate|Type 053H1]] Missile Frigate.

Bangladesh is divided into seven administrative divisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?cid=2&amp;amp;id=151976&amp;amp;hb=top |title=Rangpur becomes a division &amp;amp;#124; Bangladesh |publisher=bdnews24.com |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA2007&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html CIA World Factbook 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]] (à¦¬à¦°à¦¿à¦¶à¦¾à¦²), [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]] (à¦à¦à§à¦à¦à§à¦°à¦¾à¦®), [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]] (à¦¢à¦¾à¦à¦¾), [[Khulna Division|Khulna]] (à¦à§à¦²à¦¨à¦¾), [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] (à¦°à¦¾à¦à¦¶à¦¾à¦¹à§), [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] (à¦¸à¦¿à¦²à§à¦)&lt;!--The spelling is correct. If you see anything odd, your browser isn't Unicode compliant.--&gt;, and [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]] (à¦°à¦à¦ªà§à¦°).

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''unions'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional, district or upazila levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dhaka]] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. Other major cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet]], [[Barisal]], [[Bogra]], [[Comilla]], [[Mymensingh]] and [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]]. These cities have [[mayor]]al elections, while other municipalities elect a chairperson. Mayors and chairpersons are elected for a span of five years.

Bangladesh lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20Â°]] and [[27th parallel north|27Â°N]], and longitudes [[88th meridian east|88Â°]] and [[93rd meridian east|93Â°E]].

Bangladesh is in the low-lying [[Ganges]]â[[Brahmaputra]] River Delta or Ganges Delta. This delta is formed by the confluence of the [[Ganges River|Ganges]] (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''PÃ´dda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]
([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna'' also known as &quot;Yamuna&quot;), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by these rivers has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve â in most cases as the lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In south east Bangladesh experiments have been done since the sixties to 'build with nature'. By implementing cross dams, the natural accretion of silt has created new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has since become a multiagency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|27000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} to 21,000 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change |title=&quot;Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change,&quot; by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladeshi climate is [[Tropics|tropical]] with a mild winter from October to March, a hot, humid summer from March to June. A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as [[Floods in Bangladesh|floods]], [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[tidal bore]]s occur almost every year,&lt;ref name=&quot;NatDis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=David E. |title= Natural Disasters |origorigyear= 1993 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=gWHsuGTcF34C&amp;pg=PA532 |accessdate=2008-05-02 |year= 1999|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|location= Dordrecht |isbn=0412047519 |oclc= 27974924 43782866|page=532 |chapter=The Third World }}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the effects of [[deforestation]], [[Soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and [[erosion]].

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the [[Brahmaputra]], the [[Ganges]] and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|0}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|0}} of embankment 1,000&amp;nbsp;people were killed and 30&amp;nbsp;million more were made homeless with 135,000 cattle killed, {{convert|50|km2|mi2|1}} of land destroyed and {{convert|11000|km|mi|0}} of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWG&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |origorigyear=2002 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&amp;pg=PA2634|accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |year= 2002|location= New York |isbn=0761473084 |oclc= 46578454|pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of the coastline comprises a [[marsh]]y [[jungle]], the [[Sundarbans]], the largest [[mangrove]] forest in the world and home to diverse flora and fauna, including the [[Royal Bengal Tiger]]. In 1997, this region was declared endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;sundarbans&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=IUCN |year=1997 |title=Sundarban wildlife sanctuaries Bangladesh |journal=World Heritage Nomination-IUCN Technical Evaluation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Magpie Robin]] is the [[National Bird]] of Bangladesh and it is common and known as the ''Doyel'' or ''Doel'' ({{lang-bn|à¦¦à§à¦¯à¦¼à§à¦²}}). It is a widely used symbol in Bangladesh, appearing on currency notes and a landmark in the city of Dhaka is named as the ''Doyel Chatwar'' (meaning: Doyel Square). The national flower of the country is [[water lily]], which is known as ''Shapla''. The national fruit is jackfruit ([[Artocarpus heterophyllus]]), which in Bengali is known as ''Kathal''. In late 2010, the Bangladeshi government selected the [[Mango]] tree as the national tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xinhua news on National Tree of Bangladesh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-11/15/c_13608012.htm |title=Bangladeshi gov't selects mango tree as national tree |publisher=Xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[polypropylene]] products began to substitute for jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to decline. Bangladesh grows very significant quantities of rice, tea, potato, mango, onion and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. According to [[FAOSTAT]], Bangladesh is one of world's largest producers of:&lt;ref name=&quot;FAOSTAT Production statistics 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/339/default.aspx |title=FAOSTAT 2008 by Production |publisher=faostat.fao.org |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rice]] (4th), [[Potato]] (11th), [[Mango]] (9th), [[Pineapple]] (16th),  Tropical Fruit (5th), [[Onion]] (16th), [[Banana]] (17th), [[Jute]] (2nd), [[Tea]] (11th).

Obstacles to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, inefficient state-owned enterprises, mismanaged [[port]] facilities, a growth in the labour force that has outpaced jobs, inefficient use of energy resources (such as [[natural gas]]), insufficient power supplies, slow implementation of economic reforms, political infighting and [[Political corruption|corruption]]. According to the World Bank, &quot;among Bangladeshâs most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank-brief&quot;&gt;
[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/BANGLADESHEXTN/0,,menuPK:295769~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295760,00.html Bangladesh â Country Brief], [[World Bank]], July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these hurdles, the country has achieved an average annual growth rate of 5% since 1990, according to the World Bank.

Bangladesh has seen expansion of its [[middle class]] (world's [[List of largest consumer markets|fifty-fourth largest]], just below of Singapore &amp; Vietnam), and its [[consumer]] industry has also grown. In December 2005, four years after its report on the emerging &quot;[[BRIC]]&quot; economies ([[Brazil]], Russia, India, and China), [[Goldman Sachs]] named Bangladesh one of the &quot;[[Next Eleven]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;nextele&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000177&amp;sid=aoJ4WG5LSf1s&amp;refer=market_insight |title=South Korea, Another `BRIC' in Global Wall |date=2005-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]] and seven other countries.

Bangladesh has seen a dramatic increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. A number of [[multinational corporation]]s and local big business houses such as [[Beximco]], [[SQUARE (Bangladesh)|Square]], [[Akij Group]], [[M. M. Ispahani Limited|Ispahani]], [[Navana Group]], [[Transcom Group]], [[Habib Group]], [[KDS Group]], T.K Group Of Industries, [[Dragon Group]] and multinationals such as [[Unocal Corporation]] and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], have made major investments, with the natural gas sector being a priority. In December 2005, the [[Bangladesh Bank|Central Bank of Bangladesh]] projected GDP growth around 6.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdbank1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangladesh-bank.org/pub/annual/anreport/annual.html |title=Annual Report 2004â2005, Bangladesh Bank |publisher=Bangladesh-bank.org |accessdate=2010-07-03}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to enhance economic growth, the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the [[Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority]].

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace prize]] in 2006) through the [[Grameen Bank]]. By the late 1990s, Grameen Bank had 2.3&amp;nbsp;million members, along with 2.5&amp;nbsp;million members of other similar organisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;schreiner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiner |first=Mark |year=2003 |title=A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh |journal=Development Policy Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=357â382 |doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Next Mega-Projects===

Bangladesh government is planning for construction of the largest deep sea port in South Asia at Sonadia Island. The 50,000 crore taka project will be completed in multiple phases and enable Bangladesh to service the whole region as a maritime transport and logistics hub. [[India]], [[China]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and other neighbouring countries will be able to take full advantage of the strategic location and Bangladeshâs LDC status for exporting their goods, which are manufactured in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=201245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=200833&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, with $7.5 billion a new international airport will be constructed too, which will be South Asiaâs largest airport. The airport is being modelled on [[Thailand]]âs [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] in size and capacity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangladesh.com/blog/bangabandhu-sheikh-mujib-international-airport&lt;/ref&gt;

To ease the chaotic [[traffic congestion]] in the capital [[Dhaka]] the government plans to  construct more [[expressways]], [[freeways]], [[flyovers]]. There is a plan to build a overhead [[Rapid transit]] called [[Dhaka Metro]], but the progress is slow and controversial because of contracts and agreements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dhakamirror.com/other-headlines/dhaka-metro-likely-by-2013/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/suppliments/2011/jacket/pg7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=153679&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the government of Bangladesh signed a deal with a Chinese company to provide high-speed modern DEMU trains and is also going to construct metro rail system and high-speed electric powered inter city rail network. More [[airports]], [[bridge]] (such as the multi-billion Padma bridge project) national [[highway]]s are also being constructed to facilitate trade and regional development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/more.php?news_id=154742&amp;date=2011-11-01&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] released a report on [http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/resources/docs/country_info/profile/en_Bangladesh_SoWMy_Profile.pdf The State of the World's Midwifery]. It contained new data on the midwifery workforce and policies relating to newborn and maternal mortality for 58 countries. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Bangladesh is 340. This is compared with 338.3 in 2008 and 724.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 55 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 57. The aim of this report is to highlight ways in which the [[Millennium Development Goals]] can be achieved, particularly Goal 4 â Reduce child mortality and Goal 5 â improve maternal health. In Bangladesh the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 8 and 1 in 110 shows us the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women.

The main religion practiced in Bangladesh is [[Islam in Bangladesh|Islam]] (89.6%), but a significant percentage of the population adheres to [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Hinduism]] (9.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banbeis.gov.bd/bd_pro.htm |title=Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics |publisher=Banbeis.gov.bd |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Muslims are [[Sunni]]. Many people in Bangladesh practice [[Sufism]], historically Islam was brought to the region by Sufi saints. There are also followers of the [[Deobandi]] movement, [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], and [[Ahl al-Hadith|Ahle Hadith]]. The largest gathering of Muslims in the country is the [[Bishwa Ijtema]], held annually by the [[Tablighi Jamaat]]. Ethnic [[Bihari people|Biharis]] are predominantly [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]] Muslims. There are also a small number of Muslims, numbering some 100,000 belonging to the [[Ahmadiyya]] community. [[Sufi]] influences in the region go back many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sufismjournal.org/community/community.html |title=Community: Sufism in Bangladesh |publisher=Sufism Journal |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other religious groups include [[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhists]] (0.7%, mostly [[Theravada]]), [[Christianity in Bangladesh|Christians]] (0.3%, mostly of the [[Roman Catholic]] denomination), and [[Animism|Animists]] (0.1%).

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Bangladesh}}
{{See also|Public holidays in Bangladesh|Sport in Bangladesh|Music of Bangladesh}}

Reflecting the long history of the region, Bangladesh has a culture that encompasses elements both old and new. The [[Bengali language]] boasts a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the Indian state of West Bengal. The earliest literary text in Bengali is the 8th century [[Charyapada]]. Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious (for example, [[Chandidas]]), or adapted from other languages (for example, [[Alaol]]). Bengali literature reached its full expression in the 19th century, with its greatest icons being poets [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]]. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, for example ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' and stories related to ''[[Gopal Bhar]]'', ''Birbal'' and ''Molla Nasiruddin''.

The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. The [[Baul]] tradition is a distinctive element of Bengali folk music. Numerous other musical traditions exist including [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]], varying from one region to the next. Folk music is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]] and [[tabla]]. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Four private FM radio stations named ([[Radio Foorti]], [[ABC Radio (Bangladesh)|ABC Radio]], [[Radio Today]], [[Radio Amar]]) are popular among urban youths. International Bengali language broadcasts include [[BBC Bangla]] and [[Voice of America]]. The dominant television channel is the state-owned [[Bangladesh Television]], but in the last few years, privately owned channels have developed considerably.

The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to nearby [[North East Indian cuisine|North-East Indian]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]] as well as having its own unique traits. Rice, and fish are traditional favorites. Biryani is a favourite dish of Bangladesh and this includes egg biryani, mutton biryani and beef biryani. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] from milk products, some common ones being ''[[Rasgulla|RÃ´shogolla]]'', ''Rasmalai, RÃ´shomalai'', ''chÃ´mchÃ´m'' and ''kalojam''. 

The [[sari]] ''(shaÅi)'' is by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi women. A guild of weavers in Dhaka is renowned for producing saris from exquisite [[Jamdani]] [[muslin]]. The [[salwar kameez]] ''(shaloar kamiz)'' is also quite popular, and in urban areas some women wear western attire. Among men, western attire is more widely adopted. Men also wear the ''[[kurta]]-paejama'' combination, often on religious occasions, and the [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt for men.

[[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]], being the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, are the subject of major festivals. The day before Eid ul-Fitr is called ''ChÃ£d Rat'' (the night of the moon) and is often celebrated with firecrackers. [[Eid ul-Adha]] is celebrated in the memory of great sacrifice of [[Prophet]] [[Abraham]]. Major Hindu festivals are [[Durga Puja]], [[Kali Puja]] and [[Saraswati Puja]]. [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Christmas]], called ''BÃ´Åodin'' (Great day), are both [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]]. The most important secular festival is [[Pohela Baishakh]] or Bengali New Year, the beginning of the Bengali calendar. Other festivities include [[Nobanno]], ''Poush parbon'' (festival of [[Poush]]) and observance of national days like [[Language Movement Day|Shohid Dibosh]] and [[Victory Day (Bangladesh)|Victory Day]].

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Bangladesh}}
The educational system in Bangladesh is three-tiered and highly subsidized. The government of Bangladesh operates many schools in the primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels. It also subsidizes parts of the funding for many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the government also funds more than 15 state universities through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

Primary (from grades 1 to 5), Secondary (from grades 6 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary.&lt;ref name=CompEd&gt;{{Cite book|author=T. Neville Postlethwaite|title=The Encyclopedia of Comparative Education and National Systems of Education|page=130|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1988|isbn=0080308538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five years of lower secondary education concludes with a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Examination.&lt;ref name=CompEd/&gt; Education is mainly offered in Bangla, but English is also commonly taught and used. A large number of Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education, which is imparted in Bangla and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in madrasahs.&lt;ref name=CompEd/&gt;

Bangladesh conforms fully to the [[Education For All]] (EFA) objectives, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) and international declarations. &lt;!-- Who set the EFA and MDG declarations? --&gt; Article 17 of the [[Bangladesh Constitution]] provides that all children between the ages of six and ten years receive a basic education free of charge.

[[Universities in Bangladesh]] are mainly categorized into three different types: Public university (government owned and subsidized), Private University (private sector owned universities), and International University (operated and funded by international organizations )

Bangladesh has some thirty public and forty-five private [[List of universities in Bangladesh|universities]]. [[Bangladesh National University|National University]] has the largest enrolment amongst them and [[University of Dhaka]] ''(estd.1921)'' is the oldest university of the country. [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]] is oldest and prominent engineering university in Bangladesh and well known in south Asia.  Bangladeshi universities are accredited by and affiliated with the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC), a commission created according to the Presidential Order (P.O. No 10 of 1973) of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moedu.gov.bd/about_moe__organizations_ugc.htm |title=University Grant Commission (UGC) |accessdate=2008-03-29 |work=Ministry of Education, Government of Bangladesh |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080318232408/http://moedu.gov.bd/about_moe__organizations_ugc.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
