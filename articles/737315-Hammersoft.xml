'''Peter Bergman''' (born June 11, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] [[soap opera]] [[actor]] best known for his portrayals as [[Cliff Warner and Nina Cortlandt|Dr. Cliff Warner]] on ''[[All My Children]]'', as well as [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack Abbott]] on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.

==Biography==
The son of Walter Bergman, a United States Navy officer, he was born in [[GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. Bergman was married to actress [[Christine Ebersole]] from 1976 to 1981. Since 1985, he has been married to Mariellen; with whom he has two children, Clare and Connor, who was once a five-star defensive end prospect at [[Harvard-Westlake School]]. The Bergmans currently live in California.

==Career==
Bergman originally auditioned for the ''All My Children'' casting director for the role of [[Jeff Martin (AMC)|Dr. Jeff Martin]]. His first notable role was his portrayal of [[Dr. Cliff Warner]] on ''All My Children'', which he played from 1979 to 1987 and again from 1988 to 1989. His character, Cliff, married Nina ([[Taylor Miller]]) four times (1980, 1982, 1986, and 1989) and divorced her three times. When the characters left the serial, their fourth marriage was intact.

In a [[Vicks|Vicks Formula 44]] cough syrup advertising campaign in 1986, Bergman told the viewing audience, &quot;Iâm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.&quot;  [[Chris Robinson (actor)|Chris Robinson]], who played Dr. Rick Webber on ABC's [[General Hospital]], was the original spokesperson in the ad campaign, which started in 1984. Bergman replaced Robinson after the latter experienced some legal difficulties. The writer of the commercial used this opening line as a disclaimer, because the then-existing &quot;white coat rule&quot; prohibited people from portraying doctors in commercials without some sort of clarification/disclaimer. The original commercial with Chris Robinson became the most-recalled TV commercial in the history of the Vicks brand. ([[Jay Leno]] later parodied the spot on [[The Tonight Show]]: &quot;Not a doctor? Hey, pal, I've seen your show...you're not even an ''actor''!&quot;)

Since 1989, Bergman has played the role of [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack Abbott]] on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. 

In 1997, Bergman portrayed Jack Abbott in an episode &quot;The Heather Biblow story&quot; on [[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]], where he shared an on-screen kiss with fellow guest-star, [[Pamela Anderson]]. In 2001, Bergman guest starred as Jack on [[The King of Queens]] in the Season 3 episode, &quot;Inner Tube.&quot; Carrie Heffernan tells Jack she can't believe that Doug lied to her. Jack, however, lets Carrie know he loves her, and is happy about the fact she's pregnant with her baby. They share a kiss. The sequence, however, is only a dream. [[Scott Reeves]] made an appearance in the episode as [[Ryan McNeil]], and [[Melody Thomas Scott]] co-starred as [[Nikki Newman]].

Bergman says that his success is a &quot;series of accidents&quot; because he didn't have huge aspirations, he just wanted to be a working actor.

===Awards===
Bergman has been nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor]] for his portrayal of [[Dr. Cliff Warner]] on ''[[All My Children]]''. 

He has been nominated 16 times (1990â2002, 2007, 2008, 2010) for his portrayal of [[Jack Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|Jack Abbott]] on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.(Y&amp;R) He won the award in 1991, 1992, and 2002.  In the eighties, Bergman and fellow actor Eric Braeden had a much-publicized altercation during rehearsals.  The two actors have since patched up their differences, and while they could never be described as &quot;close friends,&quot; they are cordial in their working relationship.
