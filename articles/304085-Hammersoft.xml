'''William Moses Kunstler''' (July 7, 1919&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; September 4, 1995) was an American self-described &quot;radical lawyer&quot; and [[civil rights]] activist, known for his controversial clients. Kunstler was a board member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and the co-founder of the [[Center for Constitutional Rights|Law Center for Constitutional Rights]] (CCR), the &quot;leading gathering place for radical lawyers in the country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt;

Kunstler's defense of the &quot;[[Chicago Seven]]&quot; from 1969-1970 led [[The New York Times]] to label him &quot;the country's most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt; Kunstler is also well known for defending members of the [[Catonsville Nine]], [[Black Panther Party]], [[Weather Underground Organization]], the [[Attica Prison riot]]ers, and the [[American Indian Movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt; He also won a ''de facto'' segregation case regarding the [[District of Columbia]]'s public schools and &quot;disinterred, singlehandedly&quot; the concept of federal [[removal jurisdiction]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt; Kunstler refused to defend right-wing groups such as the [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|Minutemen]], on the grounds that: &quot;I only defend those whose goals I share. I'm not a lawyer for hire. I only defend those I love.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt;

He was a polarizing figure: Many on the right wished to see him disbarred; many of the left admired him as a &quot;symbol of a certain kind of radical lawyer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt; Even some other civil rights lawyers regarded Kunstler as a &quot;publicity hound and a hit-and-run lawyer&quot; who &quot;brings cases on Page 1 and the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, Inc.]] wins them on Page 68.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt; Legal writer [[Sidney Zion]] quipped that Kunstler was &quot;one of the few lawyers in town who knows how to talk to the press. His stories always check out and he's not afraid to talk to you, and he's got credibility&amp;mdash;although you've got to ask sometimes, 'Bill, is it ''really'' true?'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
The son of a [[physician]], Kunstler was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[New York City]] and attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Langum, David J. [http://books.google.com/books?id=z_1Wwp3g8bMC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 &quot;William M. Kunstler: the most hated lawyer in America&quot;], p. 25. ''[[New York University Press]]'', 1999. ISBN 0814751504. &quot;Kunstler attended DeWitt Clinton High School at its annex on West End Avenue.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Yale University|Yale College]], graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]],&lt;ref name=&quot;fmda&quot;/&gt; and [[Columbia University Law School]]. While in school, Kunstler was an avid poet, and represented [[Yale]] in the [[Glascock Prize]] competition at [[Mount Holyoke College]].

Kunstler served in the U.S. Army during [[World War II]] in the Pacific theater, attaining the rank of Major, and received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. While in the army, he was noted for his theatric portrayals in the [[Fort Monmouth]] Dramatic Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;fmda&quot;&gt;Brooks Atkinson. 1941, December 21. &quot;Acting on the Camp Grounds.&quot; ''New York Times''. p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the bar in [[New York]] in 1948 and began practicing law. Kunstler went through [[Macy's, Inc.|R.H. Macy's]] executive training program in the late 1940s and practiced family and small business law in the 1950s before entering civil rights litigation in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt; He was an associate professor of law at [[New York Law School]] (1950â1951).

Kunstler won honorable mention for the [[National Legal Aid Association]]'s press award in 1957 for his series of radio broadcasts on [[WBBR|WNEW]]: &quot;The Law on Trial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Weaver. 1957. &quot;Public Defender in State Opposed.&quot; ''New York Times''. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; At WNEW, Kunstler also conducted interviews on controversial topics, such as the [[Alger Hiss]] case, on a program called &quot;Counterpoint.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Gould. 1957, July 15. &quot;TV-Radio: 2 New Comics&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunstler attended Brant Lake Camp, in [[Brant Lake, New York]] in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]], where he was an exceptional camper-athlete.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Civil rights career==
===Rise to prominence (1957-1964)===

Kunstler first made headlines in 1957 defending [[William Worthy]], a correspondent for the ''Baltimore Afro-American'', who was one of forty-two Americans who had their passports seized after violating the [[United States Department of State|State Department's]] [[travel ban]] on [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]] (after attending a Communist youth conference in Moscow).&lt;ref&gt;Dana Adams Schmidt. 1957, September 19. &quot;U.S. Youths in China Will Lose Passports.&quot; ''New York Times''. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler refused a State Department compromise which would have returned Worthy's passport if he agreed to cease visiting Communist countries, a condition Worthy considered [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1957, December 30. &quot;Reporter Rejects Passport Condition&quot;. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunstler played an important role as a civil rights lawyer in the 1960s, traveling to many of the segregated battlegrounds to work to free those who had been jailed.  Working on behalf of the ACLU, Kunstler defended the &quot;[[Freedom ride|Freedom Riders]]&quot; in Mississippi in 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr1&quot;&gt;''New York Times''. 1961, July 22. &quot;New Challenges Made.&quot; p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler filed for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] with [[Sidney Carr Mize|Sidney Mize]], a federal judge in Biloxi, and appealed to the Fifth Circuit; he also filed similar pleas in state courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr1&quot;/&gt; Judge Leon Hendrick in [[Hinds County, Mississippi|Hinds County]] refused Kunstler's motion to cancel the mass appearance (involving hundreds of miles of travel) of all 187 convicted riders.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr2&quot;&gt;''New York Times''. 1961, August 11. &quot;Riders Lose Appeal.&quot; p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The riders were convicted in a bench trial in Jackson city and appealed to a county jury trial, where Kunstler argued that the county systematically discriminated against African-American jurors.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1961, August 23. &quot;Jury List Scored in Trial of Rider&quot;. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Kunstler took part in efforts to integrate public parks and libraries in [[Albany, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrick Smith. 1962, August 12. &quot;Albany, Ga., Closes and Parks and Libraries To Balk Integration&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he published ''The Case for Courage'' (modeled on President Kennedy's ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'') highlighting the efforts of other lawyers who risked their careers for controversial clients as well as similar acts by public servants.&lt;ref name=&quot;courage&quot;&gt;Alan F. Westin. 1961, October 14. &quot;Counsel for the Defense Was on Trial Too&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the publication, Kunstler was already well known for his work with the Freedom Riders, his book on the [[Caryl Chessman]] case, and his radio coverage of trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;courage&quot;/&gt; Kunstler also joined a group of lawyers criticizing the application of Alabama's civil libel laws and spoke at a rally against [[HUAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard E. Ryan. 1964, October 14. &quot;Suits in Alabama Stir New Protest&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1962, October 24. &quot;Display Ad 61--No Title&quot;. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Unisphere.jpg|thumb|left|Kunstler represented the first Title IX [[Removal jurisdiction|federal removal]] cases under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]: protesters at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].]]
In 1963, for the [[Gandhi Society]] of New York, Kunstler filed to [[Removal jurisdiction|remove the cases]] of more than 100 arrested African-American demonstrators from the Danville Corporation Court to the Charlottesville District Court, under a [[Reconstruction Era]] statute.&lt;ref name=&quot;danville&quot;&gt;Ben A. Franklin. 1963, July 12. &quot;Dr. King Steps Up Danville Protest&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the district judge [[Remand (court procedure)|remanded]] the cases to city court, he dissolved the city's [[injunction]] against demonstrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;danville&quot;/&gt; In doing so, Judge [[Thomas J. Michie]] rejected a Justice Department ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief urging the removal to create a test case for the statute.&lt;ref name=&quot;danville&quot;/&gt; Kunstler appealed to the Fourth Circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;danville&quot;/&gt; That year Kunstler also sued public housing authorities in [[Westchester County]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1963, October 26. &quot;'Westchester Suit' Scores Rent Aid&quot;. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Kunstler defended a group of four accused of kidnapping a white couple, and succeeded in getting the alleged weapons thrown out of evidence, as they could not be positively identified as ones used.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1964, February 27. &quot;State Rests Case in Kidnapping Trial&quot;. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; That year he also challenged Mississippi's unpledged elector law as well as racial segregation in primary elections; he also defended three members of the [[Blood Brothers (gang)|Blood Brothers]], a Harlem gang, charged with murder.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Sittons. 1964, June 20. &quot;U.S. Official Warns Mississippi-Bound Students&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1964, July 2. &quot;Writ Denied 3 Boys Indicted in Murder&quot;. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunstler went to [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1964 during the demonstrations led by Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] and Dr. Robert B. Hayling that resulted in the passage of the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].  Kunstler himself brought the first federal case under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which allowed the [[Removal jurisdiction|removal of cases]] from county court to be appealed; the defendants were protestors at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred E. Clark. 1964, August 27. &quot;U.S. Judge to Hear Rights Case Here&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACLU director (1964-1972)===
He was a director of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) from 1964 to 1972, when he became a member of the ACLU National Council. In 1966 he co-founded the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]].  Kunstler also worked with the [[National Lawyers Guild]].

In 1965, Kunstler's firm Kunstler, Kunstler, and [[Arthur Kinoy|Kinoy]] was asked to defend [[Jack Ruby]] by his brother Earl, but dropped the case because they &quot;did not wish to be in a situation where we have to fight to get into the case&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred E. Clark. 1965, February 13. &quot;Law Firm Here Steps Out of Ruby Case&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1965, February 18. &quot;Ruby Family Bid Ignored by Texas Appeals Court&quot;. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby was eventually permitted to replace his original defense team with Kunstler,&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1966, February 27. &quot;Jack Ruby Draws and Colors to While Away Time in Jail&quot;. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Waldron|Waldron, Martin]]. 1966, June 14. &quot;Ruby Ruled Sane by a Texas Jury&quot;.

Kunstler's other notable clients include:  [[Salvador Agron]], [[H.

Zion. 1966, September 13. &quot;Handwriting Expert Casts Doubt on Evidence Used Against Sobell. ''New York Times''.  p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wayne Williams]], and [[Michael X]].

===&quot;Chicago Seven&quot; (1969-1972)===
Kunstler gained national renown for defending the &quot;[[Chicago Seven]]&quot; (originally &quot;Chicago Eight&quot;), in a five month trial in 1969-1970,  against charges of conspiring to incite riots in [[Chicago]] during the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;judge&quot;&gt;''New York Times''. 1972, May 14. &quot;A Judge Judged&quot;. p. E5.&lt;/ref&gt; Under cross-examination, Kunstler got a key police witness to contradict his previous testimony and admit that he had not witnessed [[Jerry Rubin]], but had rather been given his name two weeks later by the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Seth S. Kings. &quot;'Chicago 8' Man Accused of Urging Attack on Police. ''New York Times''.  p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Another prosecution witness, photographer Louis Salzberg, admitted under Kunstler's cross-examination that he was still on the payroll of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;John Kifner. 1969, October 24. &quot;F.B.I. Paid 'Friend' of the 'Chicago 8'&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial was marked by frequent clashes between Kunstler and U.S. Attorney [[Thomas Foran]], with Kunstler taking the opportunity to accuse the government of failing to &quot;realize the extent of antiwar sentiment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Kings. 1969, October 15. &quot;'Chicago 8' Denied Moratorium Day&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kunstler also sparred with Judge [[Julius Hoffman]], on one occasion remarking (with respect to the number of federal marshals): &quot;this courtroom has the appearance of an armed camp. I would note that the Supreme Court has ruled that the appearance of an armed camp is a reversible error&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Seth S. Kings. 1969, October 17. &quot;Chicago 8 Lawyer Sees A Conviction&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During one heated exchange, Kunstler informed Hoffman that his entry on &quot;[[Who's Who]]&quot; was three times longer than the judge's, to which the judge replied &quot;I hope you get a better obituary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;[[David Stout]]. 1995, September 5. &quot;William Kunstler, 76, Dies; Lawyer for Social Outcasts&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler and co-defense attorney [[Leonard Weinglass]] were cited for contempt (the convictions were later overturned, unanimously, by the Seventh Circuit).&lt;ref name=&quot;judge&quot;/&gt; If Hoffman's contempt conviction had been allowed to stand, Kunstler would have been imprisoned for an unprecedented four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1970, February 22. &quot;Judge Hoffman and the Contempt Weapon&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. E2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of the trialâwhich had many aspects of [[guerrilla theatre]]--was covered on the nightly news and made Kunstler the best-known lawyer in the country, and something of a folk hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestknown&quot;&gt;Victor S. Navasky. 1970, April  19. &quot;Right On! With Lawyer William Kunstler&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 217. &quot;''William Kunstler is without doubt the country's most controversial and, perhaps, its best-known lawyer period''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; After much deadlock, the jury acquitted all seven on the [[conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]] charge, but convicted five of violating the anti-riot provisions of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;John Kifner. 1970, December 4. &quot;Hoffman Recalls 2 Jury Messages&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Seventh Circuit overturned all the convictions on November 21, 1972 due to Hoffman's refusal to let defense lawyers question the prospective jurors on racial and cultural biases; the Justice Department did not retry the case.

===American Indian Movement (1973-1976)===

Kunstler arrived in [[Pine Ridge, South Dakota]] on March 4, 1973 to draw up the demands of the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) members involved in the [[Wounded Knee incident]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1973, March 5. &quot;Indians Get Offer on Ending Seizure&quot;. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler, who headed the defense, called the trial &quot;the most important Indian trial of the 20th century&quot;, attempting to center the defense on the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Waldron. 1974, January 8. &quot;Judge Defers Ruling on Treaty for First Wounded Knee Trial&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler's team represented [[Russell Means]] and [[Dennis Banks]], two of the leaders of the occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;armedcamp&quot;&gt;Martin Waldrons. 1974, January 27. &quot;Security Eased At Indians' Trial&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunstler objected to the heavy trial security on the grounds that it could prejudice the jury and Judge [[Fred Joseph Nichol|Fred J. Nichol]] agreed to ease measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;armedcamp&quot;/&gt; The trial was moved to Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Waldrons. 1974, January 27. &quot;Kunstler Works; Disbarment Effort Fails&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Two authors and three Sioux were called as defense witnesses, mostly focusing on the historical (and not-so-historical) injustice against the Sioux on the part of the U.S. government, shocking the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Waldrons. 1974, August 17. &quot;2 Indians Summon Only 5 Witnesses&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Kunstler again defended AIM members in the slaying of two FBI agents at [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], not far from the site of the Wounded Knee incident.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Lichtenstein. 1975, June 28. &quot;16 Sioux Sought by F.B.I. in Slaying of 2 Agents&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial in 1976, Kunstler subpoenaed prominent government officials to testify about the existence of a [[COINTELPRO|Counter-Intelligence Program]] (COINTELPRO) against Native American activists.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1976, June 9. &quot;Two Indians Go on Trial in Deaths of F.B.I. Agents&quot;. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; District Judge [[Edward Joseph McManus|Edward J. McManus]] approved Kunstler's attempt to [[subpoena]] FBI director [[Clarence M. Kelley]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Delaney. 1976, June 7. &quot;U.S. Judge Orders F.B.I. Chief to Testify at Trial of Two Indians&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kunstler also defended a Native American woman who refused to send her daughter with [[muscular dystrophy]] to school.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin R. Reilly, 1975, December 14. &quot;Indian is Fighting School Over Rights&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. BQLI149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attica (1974-1976)===
In 1974-1975, Kunstler defended a prisoner charged with killing a guard during the [[Attica Prison riot]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Wicker. 1974, October 1. &quot;Hindsight on Attica Won't Wash&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Under cross-examination, Kunstler forced Correction Officer Donald Melven to retract his sworn identification of [[Splitting the Sky|John Hill]], Kunstler's client, and [[Charles Pernasilice]] (defended by Richard Miller), admitting he still retained &quot;slight&quot; doubts that he confessed to investigators at the time of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Breasted. 1975, February 28. &quot;Attica Witness Has Some Doubts&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Kunstler focused on pointing out that all the other prosecution witnesses were testifying under reduced-sentencing agreements and called five prison inmates as defense witnesses (Miller called none), who testified that other prisoners hit the guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;atticajury&quot;&gt;Michael T. Kaufman. 1975, April 6. &quot;Attica Jury Convicts One of Murder, 2d of Assault&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Justice King's repeated warnings to Kunstler to &quot;be careful, sir&quot;, Kunstler quickly became &quot;the star of the trial, the man the jurors watch most attentively, and the lawyer whose voice carries most forcefully&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sleep&quot;&gt;Mary Breasted. 1975, March 4. &quot;Attica Drama Unfolds in Back Rows and Halls as well as on Stand&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the prosecution was careful to avoid personal confrontation with Kunstler, who frequently charmed the jury with jokes, on one instance Kunstler provoked a shouting match with the lead prosecutor, allegedly to wake up a sleeping jury member.&lt;ref name=&quot;sleep&quot;/&gt; The jury convicted Hill of murder and Pernasilice of attempted assault.&lt;ref name=&quot;atticajury&quot;/&gt; When Kunstler protested that the defendants would risk being murdered due to the judges [[Remand (court procedure)|remanding]] them, King threatened to send Kunstler with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;atticajury&quot;/&gt; [[New York Governor]] [[Hugh Carey]] granted executive clemency to Hill and the other inmates in 1976, even though Hill's name was not on the recommended list of pardons delivered to the governor and his appeals were still pending.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Goldstein. 1976, December 31. &quot;Governor Pardons 7 to 'Close the Book' on Attica Episode&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Kunstler and Barbara Handshu, representing another inmate at Attica, [[Mariano Gonzales]], asked for a new hearing on the role of FBI informant [[Mary Jo Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Breasted. 1975, June 10. &quot;Attica Witness Tells of Slaying&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assata Shakur (1977)===
Kunstler joined the defense staff of [[Assata Shakur]] in 1977, charged in New Jersey with a variety of felonies in connection with a 1973 shootout with New Jersey State Troopers.&lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Waggoner. 1977, February 4. &quot;Mrs. Chesimards' Defense Seeks to Change Site of Murder Trial&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Kuby (1983-1995)===
[[File:Omar Abdel-Rahman.jpg|thumb|right|Kunstler was defending [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]] (&quot;the Blind Sheik&quot;) for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] at the time of his death.]]
From 1983 until Kunstler's death in 1995, he employed future radio personality [[Ron Kuby]] as a junior partner. The two took on controversial civil rights and criminal cases, including cases where they represented Sheikh [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], head of the Egyptian-based terrorist group Gama'a al-Islamiyah, responsible for the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]; [[Colin Ferguson (convict)|Colin Ferguson]], the man responsible for the LIRR shootings, who would later reject Kuby &amp; Kunstler's legal counsel and choose to represent himself at trial; [[Qubilah Shabazz]], the daughter of Malcolm X, accused of plotting to murder [[Louis Farrakhan]] of the [[Nation of Islam]]; Glenn Harris, a New York public school teacher who absconded with a fifteen-year-old girl for two months; [[Nico Minardos]], a flamboyant actor indicted by [[Rudy Giuliani]] for conspiracy to ship arms to Iran; Darrell Cabey, one of the persons shot by [[Bernard Goetz]]; and associates of the [[Gambino crime family]].

Kunstler's defense of the three clerics made him &quot;more visible, more venerated, more vilified than ever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;stillradical&quot;&gt;David Margolick. 1993, July 6. &quot;Still Radical After All These Years&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first [[Gulf War]], they represented dozens of American soldiers who refused to fight and claimed [[conscientious objector]] status. They also represented [[El-Sayyid Nosair]], the assassin of the late [[Jewish]] leader [[Rabbi Meir Kahane]] who was acquitted of murder charges.

==Other work==
In 1979, Kunstler represented [[Marvin Barnes]], an [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] basketball player, with past legal troubles and league discipline problems.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Gross. 1979, June 8. &quot;Barnes is Kunstler's New Cause&quot;. ''New York Times''. p. A22.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1994-95 television season, Kunstler starred as himself in an episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' titled &quot;White Rabbit&quot;. It was based on the 1971 shooting of a policeman in connection with the robbery of a Boston [[Brinks]] truck by members of the [[Weatherman Underground]].

==Death and legacy==
In late 1995, Kunstler died in New York of  heart failure at the age of 76. In his last major public appearance, at the commencement ceremonies for the [[University at Buffalo]]'s [[University_at_Buffalo,_The_State_University_of_New_York#Schools_and_colleges|School of Architecture and Planning]], Kunstler lambasted the death penalty, saying, &quot;We have become the [[charnel house]] of the Western world with reference to executions; the next closest to us is the Republic of South Africa.&quot;
