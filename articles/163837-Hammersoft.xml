'''Tracey Karima Emin''' [[Associate of the Royal Academy|RA]] (born 3 July 1963 in [[Croydon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tate|first=|title=The Perfect Place to Grow  2001|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=81057|accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[artist]] of [[English people|English]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] origin. She is part of the group known as Britartists or YBAs ([[Young British Artists]]). 

In 1997, her work ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963â1995]]'', a tent appliquÃ©d with names, was shown at [[Charles Saatchi]]'s ''[[Sensation (exhibition)|Sensation]]'' exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London. The same year, she gained considerable media exposure when she appeared drunk and swearing on a live Channel 4 TV discussion.

In 1999, she was a [[Turner Prize]] nominee and exhibited ''[[My Bed]]'' â an installation, consisting of her own unmade dirty bed with used [[condom]]s and blood-stained underwear. There has been an ongoing dispute with former boyfriend, artist [[Billy Childish]], particularly over the [[Stuckism]] movement, founded in 1999 and named after an insult by her.

In 2004, her tent artwork was destroyed in the [[Momart#The 2004 warehouse fire|Momart warehouse fire]]. In March 2007, Emin was chosen to join the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy of Arts]] in London as a Royal Academician. She represented Britain at the 2007 [[Venice Biennale]]. Her first major retrospective ''20 Years'' was held in Edinburgh 2008, and toured Europe until 2009.

Tracey opened  the [[Turner Contemporary]] art gallery in [[Margate]] with [[Jools Holland]] in April 2011. She has been a major supporter of the project from its inception and it has been suggested she will exhibit there in the future. In May 2011, Emin's largest major solo exhibition in a public space was held at [[Hayward Gallery]], London titled ''Love Is What You Want''.

Emin is a panelist and speaker: she has lectured at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London,&lt;ref name=&quot;london&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/activ_events/courses/lectures_talks_tours/friday_talks/index.html | title=Tracey Emin.

Emin's art takes many different forms of expression including needlework and sculpture, drawing, video and installation, photography and painting.

==Life==
===Early life===
[[Image:MedwayPoets.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sexton Ming]], Tracey Emin, [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], [[Billy Childish]] and Russell Wilkins at the Rochester Adult Education Centre 11 December 1987 to record [[The Medway Poets]] [[LP album|LP]]]]
Tracey Emin was born in [[Croydon]] and brought up in [[Margate]]. She has a twin brother. Emin's father, a [[Turkish Cypriot]], was married to a woman other than her mother and divided his time between his two families. He owned the Hotel International in Margate, and, when the business failed, Emin's family suffered a severe decline in their standard of living, circumstances which have featured in a number of works. Around the age of 13 she was raped. In a &quot;loosely autobiographical&quot; film to be made of this event she only asked, in true documentary fashion, that &quot;The extras will all come from Margate and I'll hire a church hall there to hold auditions. I'll ask each of the girls: 'What is it you really hate about your mum?'&quot;
At 18 she was pregnant with twins but had an abortion because she was scared of what her parents would think.

She studied fashion at [[University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester|Medway College of Design]] (1980&amp;ndash;1982), where she met expelled student [[Billy Childish]] and was associated with [[The Medway Poets]]. Emin and Childish were a couple until 1987 during which time she was the administrator for his small press [[Hangman Books]] which specialized in publishing Childish's confessional poetry. In 1984 she studied printing at [[Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design|Maidstone Art College]], which she has described as one of the best experiences of her life. In 1995, she was interviewed in the ''Minky Manky'' show catalogue by [[Carl Freedman]], who asked her, &quot;Which person do you think has had the greatest influence on your life?&quot; She replied,
{{cquote|Uhmm... It's not a person really. It was more a time, going to Maidstone College of Art, hanging around with Billy Childish, living by the River Medway.}}
In 1987, Emin moved to London to study at the [[Royal College of Art]], where she obtained an [[Master's degree|MA]] in painting, though she has described this time as a very negative experience. Her influences included [[Edvard Munch]] and [[Egon Schiele]]; later she destroyed all her paintings from this early period, and for a time studied [[philosophy]] at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].  One of the paintings that survives from her time at Royal College of Art is [http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/large.php?uid=73132&amp;sos=0 Friendship] which is in the Royal College of Art Collection.

===Britartist===

In 1993, Emin opened a shop with fellow artist [[Sarah Lucas]], called simply ''The Shop'' at 103 Bethnal Green Road in [[Bethnal Green]]. This sold works by the two of them, including [[T-shirt]]s and ash trays with [[Damien Hirst]]'s picture stuck to the bottom. Lucas paid Emin a wage to mind the shop and Emin also made extra money by writing letters to people asking them to invest Â£20 in her as an artist, one being [[Jay Jopling]], who became her dealer. During this period Emin was also working with the gallerist [[Joshua Compston]].

In 1994, she had her first solo show at the [[White Cube]] gallery, a leading contemporary art gallery in London. It was called ''My Major Retrospective'', and was what is now seen as typically autobiographical in her work, consisting of personal photographs, and photos of her (destroyed) early paintings, as well as items which most artists would not consider showing in public, such as a packet of [[cigarette]]s her uncle was holding when he was decapitated in a car crash. This willingness to show details of what would generally be thought of as her private life has become one of Emin's trademarks.

In the mid-1990s she had a relationship with [[Carl Freedman]], who had been an early friend of, and collaborator with, [[Damien Hirst]] and who had co-curated seminal [[Britart]] shows, such as ''Modern Medicine'' and ''Gambler''. In 1994, they toured the US together, driving in a [[Cadillac]] from [[San Francisco]] to New York, and making stops en route where she gave readings from her autobiographical book ''Exploration of the Soul'' to finance the trip. En route they &quot;belly surfed&quot; in San Diego and watched bears in [[Big Sur]].

The couple also spent time by the sea in [[Whitstable]] together, using the beach hut, which she uprooted and turned into art in 1999 with the title ''The Last Thing I Said to You is Don't Leave Me Here'', and which was destroyed in the 2004 [[Momart#The 2004 warehouse fire|Momart warehouse fire]].

[[Image:Emin-Tent-Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963â1995]] by Tracey Emin (1995). An interior view of the work.]]
In 1995, Freedman curated the show ''Minky Manky'' at the [[South London Gallery]]. Emin has said,
{{cquote|At that time Sarah (Lucas) was quite famous, but I wasnât at all. Carl said to me that I should make some big work as he thought the small-scale stuff I was doing at the time wouldnât stand up well. I was furious. Making that work was my way at getting back at him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2003/031203eminbarker.php?PageId=804 &quot;Tracey Emin with Barry Barker&quot;, University of Brighton, 3 December 2003]. Retrieved 2 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The result was Emin's famous &quot;tent&quot; ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963â1995]]'', which was first exhibited in the show. It was a blue [[tent]], appliquÃ©d with the names of everyone she has slept with. These included sexual partners, plus relatives she slept with as a child, her twin brother, and her two [[abortion|aborted]] children. Although often talked about as a shameless exhibition of her sexual conquests, it was rather a piece about intimacy in a more general sense, although the title invites misinterpretation. The needlework which is integral to this work was used by Emin in a number of her other pieces. This piece was later bought by [[Charles Saatchi]] and included in the successful 1997 [[Sensation exhibition]] at the [[Royal Academy of London]]; it then toured to Berlin and New York. It, too, was destroyed by the fire in Saatchi's east London warehouse, in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3748179.stm Fire devastates Saatchi artworks]&quot;. BBC, 26 May 2004. Retrieved on 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedman's interview with her appears in the catalogue. Other featured artists were [[Sarah Lucas]], [[Gary Hume]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Mat Collishaw]], [[Gilbert &amp; George]], Critical DÃ©cor and [[Steven Pippin]]. Emin now describes Freedman as &quot;one of my best friends&quot;.

Emin lives in [[Spitalfields]], East London on [[Fournier Street]] in a Georgian [[Huguenot]] silk weavers house which dates from 1726.

===Fame===

Although these early events caused Emin to be well known in art circles, she was largely unknown by the public until she appeared on a [[Channel 4]] [[television]] programme in 1997. It was an ostensibly serious debate show about that year's Turner Prize, and Emin appeared completely drunk (she later said this was caused by painkillers she was taking for a broken finger), swearing, insulting the other panel members and saying that she wanted to go home to her mother, before actually walking out. From the interview: &quot;Are they really real people in England watching this programme now, they really watching, really watching it?... They're 25 minutes behind us, think about that... I'm leaving now, I wanna be with my friends, I wanna be with my mum. I'm gonna phone her, and she's going to be embarrassed about this conversation, this is live and I don't care. I don't give a fuck about it.&quot;

[[Image:Emin-My-Bed.jpg|thumb|''[[My Bed]]'' by Tracey Emin]]
Two years later, in 1999, Emin was shortlisted for the [[Turner Prize]] herself and exhibited ''[[My Bed]]'' at the [[Tate Gallery]]. There was considerable media furore about this, particularly as the sheets of the bed were stained yellow, and the floor surrounding it had items from her room such as condoms, empty cigarette packets, a pair of knickers with menstrual stains and other detritus including a pair of slippers. The bed was presented as it had been when she had stayed in it for several days feeling suicidal because of relationship difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John.

Two performance artists, [[Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi]], jumped onto the bed with bare torsos in order to &quot;improve&quot; the work, which they thought had not gone far enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kino&quot; /&gt;

In July 1999, at the height of Emin's [[Turner Prize]] fame, the artist created a number of monoprint drawings  inspired by the public and private life of [[Princess Diana]] for a themed exhibition called ''Temple of Diana'' held at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as ''They Wanted You To Be Destroyed'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Work illustrated on page 21 of Neal Brown's book ''Tracey Emin (Tate's Modern Artists Series)'' (London: Tate, 2006) ISBN 1854375423&lt;/ref&gt; related to Princess Diana's [[bulimia]] eating disorder, while other monoprints included affectionate texts such as ''Love Was On Your Side'' and a description of Princess Diana's ''dress with puffy sleeves''. Other drawings highlighted ''The things you did to help other people'' written next to a drawing by Emin of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola. Another work was a delicate sketch of a rose drawn next to the phrase, ''It makes perfect sence to know they killed you'' (with Emin's trademark spelling mistakes) referring to the conspiracy theories surrounding Princess Diana's death. Emin herself described the drawings saying they &quot;could be considered quite scrappy, fresh, kind of naive looking drawings&quot; and &quot;It's pretty difficult for me to do drawings not about me and about someone else. But I have did have a lot of ideas. They're quite sentimental I think and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zczfilms.com/tracey.html |title=Video footage and interview with Emin from The Blue Gallery exhibition is included in the 1999 documentary ''Mad Tracey From Margate'' |author= |date= |work= |publisher=ZCZ Films |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[George Michael]] and [[Kenny Goss]] neon, Emin also created a unique neon work for her supermodel friend [[Kate Moss]] called ''Moss Kin''. In 2004, it was reported that this unique piece had been discovered dumped in a skip in east London. The piece, consisting of neon tubing spelling the words ''Moss Kin'', had been mistakenly thrown out of a basement, owned by the craftsman who made the glass. The artwork was never collected by Moss and had therefore been stored for three years in the basement of a specialist artist used by Emin in the Spitalfields area. It was accidentally dumped when the craftsman moved.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3790377.stm Emin artwork found dumped in skip]&quot;. BBC, 9 June 2004.

===Monoprints===

Emin's [[monoprints]] are a well documented part of her creative output. These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week Of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2590&amp;page=1 Tate Collection | Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, {{cquote|It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63 The Parkett Issues&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Emin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''&lt;ref&gt;Terrebly Wrong (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''&lt;ref&gt;''Something'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [''sic''] written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside &quot;forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page. Some are complete bodies, others only female torsos, legs splayed and with odd, spidery flows gushing from their vaginas. They are all accompanied by the legend ''There's Something Wrong''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue1/something.htm Tate Magazine issue 1 article written by Melanie McGrath]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key monoprints include a series from 1994 and 1995 known as the ''Illustrations from Memory'' series which document Tracey's childhood memories of sexual awakening and other experiences growing up in [[Margate]] such as ''Fucking Down An Ally 16/5/95'' (1995) and ''Illustrations from Memory, the year 1974. In The Livingroom'' (1994). Emin further produced a set of monoprints detailing her memories of [[Margate]]'s iconic buildings such as ''Margate Harbour 16/5/95'' (1995), ''The Lido 16/5/95'' (1995) and ''Light House 15/5/95'' (1995). Other drawings from 1994 include  the ''Family Suite'' series, part of the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] collection, consisting of 20 monoprints with &quot;archetypal themes in Emin's art: sex, her family, her abortions, and Margate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/artwork/9639/family-suite The Art Fund - Family Suite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This series of monoprints will be displayed for the first time from August 2008 at the Edinburgh based gallery as part of her first major retrospective, which has been called the ''Summer Blockbuster'' exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/supportus/page/3:205 National Galleries of Scotland - Supportus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A further ''Family Suite II'' set was exhibited in Los Angeles in November 2007 as part of Emin's solo show at Gagosian gallery.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/beverly-hills-2007-11-tracey-emin/ Gagosian Gallery - Exhibition - Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin's monoprints are rarely displayed alone in exhibitions, they're particularly effective as collective fragments of intense emotional confrontation. Emin has made several works documenting painful moments of sadness and loneliness experienced when travelling to foreign cities for various exhibitions such as ''Thinking Of You'' (2005) and ''Bath White I'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehmannmaupin.com/#/artists/tracey-emin/ Image 20 in the images of artworks, Lehmann Maupin website]&lt;/ref&gt; which were from a series of monoprints drawn directly onto the USA Mondrian hotel stationery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecube.com/artists/emin/monoprintstwo/ White Cube â Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Emin herself has said, {{cquote|Being an artist isn't just about making nice things, or people patting you on the back; it's some kind of communication, a message.|&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=26487 Tate Collection | Sad Shower in New York by Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In summer 2009, Emin along with book publisher [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]] released a book titled ''One Thousand Drawings''. As the title suggests, the book contains 1000 drawings of Emin's career since 1988. The book was released to coincide with Emin's show ''Those who suffer love'' at [[White Cube]] which is mainly a drawings show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/emin/ White Cube - Those who suffer love]&lt;/ref&gt; Emin said in an interview that &quot;We actually looked at about 2000 drawings and then chose 1000 drawings [for the book]...

Monoprint drawings of mothers and children that Emin drew during a pregnancy in 1990 were included in a 2010 joint exhibition with [[Paula Rego]] and [[Mat Collishaw]] at the [[Foundling Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/video/2010/jan/27/foundling-museum-tracy-emin Video about 2010 Tracey Emin exhibition at the Foundling Museum Guardian review of Emin at Foundling Museum, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin displayed six small watercolours&lt;ref&gt;List of Works in the Turner Prize 1999 brochure, Tate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; in her [[Turner Prize]] exhibition in 1999, and also in her New York show ''Every Part Of Me's Bleeding'' held that same year, known as the ''Berlin Watercolour'' series (1998). These delicate, washed out but colourful watercolours include four portraits of Emin's face and were all painted by Emin in Berlin during 1998, adapted from Polaroids of the artist taking a bath.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5040978.html 'Artist's abortion tape and unmade bed lead Turner Prize shortlist']&lt;/ref&gt; Each unique painting from this series share the same title, ''Berlin The Last Week In April 1998''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehmannmaupin.com/past/?object_id=32 As exhibited in Emin's show ''Every Part Of Me's Bleeding'' at the Lehmann Maupin gallery, New York. Photo of one of these watercolours is in their website's relevant Emin exhibition section]&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Wilson, spokesperson for the Tate, commented that Emin included the set of tiny Berlin watercolours &quot;as a riposte to the accusation that there are no paintings&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; in the Turner Prize exhibitions.  The bath theme seen in these watercolours was later revisited by Emin in her photographic work ''Sometimes I Feel Beautiful'' (2000) and in monoprints such as the ''Bath White'' (2005) series. With all these works, Emin explores a [[Mary Cassatt]] quality of the &quot;woman in a private moment&quot;.

Emin's focus on painting has developed over the past few years, starting with the ''Purple Virgin'' (2004) acrylic watercolour series of purple brush strokes depicting her naked open legs, and leading to paintings such as ''Asleep Alone With Legs Open'' (2005), the ''Reincarnation'' (2005) series and ''Masturbating'' (2006) amongst others.

In May 2005, London's ''[[Evening Standard]]'' newspaper highlighted Emin's return to painting in their preview of her ''When I Think About Sex'' exhibition at [[White Cube]]. Other works were nude self-portrait drawings. Emin was quoted: &quot;For this show I wanted to show that I can really draw, and I think they are really sexy drawings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-18897358-details/The+bare+truth+about+Tracey/article.do The bare truth about Tracey| Showbiz | This is London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work for her 2007 show at the [[Venice Biennale]] (see below) included large-scale canvases of her legs and vagina. A watercolour series called ''The Purple Virgins'' were displayed. There are ten ''Purple Virgin'' works in total, six of which were shown at the Biennale. These were accompanied by two canvases of a similar style called ''How I Think I Feel 1 and 2''.

The Venice Biennale was also the first time Emin's ''Abortion Watercolour'' series, painted in 1990, had ever been shown in public.

Jay Jopling uncovered a brand new Emin painting, ''Rose Virgin'' (2007), as part of White Cube's stand at the Frieze Art Fair in London's Regent's Park on 10 October 2007. More new paintings are expected to be shown in Emin's ''You Left Me Breathing'' exhibition in Los Angeles' Gagosian gallery from 2 November 2007, described in a recent interview as an 'exhibition of sculpture and painting'.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt; A number of new paintings were on display including ''Get Ready For The Fuck Of Your Life'' (2007).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt;

===Photography===

Emin has produced many photographic works throughout her career, including ''Monument Valley (Grand Scale)'' (1995â97)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=81013&amp;searchid=9779&amp;tabview=image Tate Collection | Monument Valley (Grand Scale) by Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Outside Myself (Monument Valley, reading âExploration of the Soulâ)'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simmonscontemporary.com/browse/?a=Tracey+Emin&amp;t=&amp;m=&amp;l= Simmons Contemporary art collection including Emin's 'Outside Myself' 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted &quot;from a trip Emin made to the United States in 1994. She and her then boyfriend, the writer, curator and gallerist [[Carl Freedman]], drove from San Francisco to New York stopping off along the way to give readings from her book, Exploration of the Soul 1994. The photograph shows the artist sitting in an upholstered chair in [[Monument Valley]], a spectacular location on the southern border of Utah with northern Arizona, holding her book. Although it is open, it is not clear whether she is looking at the viewer or at the text in front of her. Emin gave her readings sitting in the chair, which she had inherited from her grandmother, which also became part of Emin's art, ''There's A Lot Of Money In Chairs'' (1994).&lt;ref name=&quot;MV&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=81013&amp;searchid=9779&amp;tabview=text Monument Valley]&quot;. Tate Gallery. Retrieved on 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other photographic works include a series of nine images comprising the work ''Naked Photos â Life Model Goes Mad'' (1996) documenting a painting performance Emin made in a room specially built in Galleri Andreas BrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m, Stockholm. Another photographic series, ''Trying On Clothes From My Friends (She Took The Shirt Off His Back)'' (1997), shows the artist trying on her friendsâ clothes offering up questions of identity.

Other works such as ''I've Got It All'' (2000) show Emin with her &quot;legs splayed on a red floor, clutching banknotes and coins to her crotch. Made at a time of public and financial success, the image connects the artistâs desire for money and success and her sexual desire (her role as consumer) with her use of her body and her emotional life to produce her art (the object of consumption)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MV&quot;/&gt; Whilst ''Sometimes I Feel Beautiful'' (2000) pictures Emin lying alone in a bath. Both these works are examples of Emin using &quot;large-scale photographs of herself to record and express moments of emotional significance in her life, frequently making reference to her career as an artist. The photographs have a staged quality, as though the artist is enacting a private ritual.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MV&quot;/&gt;

Emin's most iconic are the two self portraits taken inside her famous beach hut, ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here I'' (2000) and ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here II'' (2000). The latter two photographs are a diptych although they are often exhibited and sold separately. They depict a naked Emin on her knees inside her beach hut which she and friend [[Sarah Lucas]] had bought in Whitstable, Kent in 1992. The hut itself later became the sculpture ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut)'' (1999). They are part of museum collections including [[Tate Modern]], the [[Saatchi Gallery]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)]] and have been mass produced as postcards sold in museum shops around the world.

===Neon===

Emin has also worked with [[neon]] lights. One such piece is ''You Forgot To Kiss My Soul'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/youforgottokissmysoul/5/ |title=White Cube â You forgot to kiss my soul |publisher=Whitecube.com |date=2001-05-26 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of those words in blue neon inside a neon heart-shape. Another neon piece is made from the words ''Is Anal Sex Legal'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=81062&amp;searchid=9621 |title=Tate Collection &amp;#124; Is Anal Sex Legal by Tracey Emin |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; to complement another ''Is Legal Sex Anal'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=81061 |title=Tate Collection &amp;#124; Is Legal Sex Anal by Tracey Emin |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Venice Biennale, Emin produced a series of new purple neon works, for example, ''Legs I'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcouncil-venice.org/ British Council - Tracey Emin, Venice 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This 2007 series of ''Legs'' neon works were directly inspired by the ''Purple Virgin'' (2004) watercolour series. For example, ''Legs IV'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artwork/425153950/424046260/tracey-emin-legs-iv.html Tracey Emin - Legs IV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; directly follows the watercolour lines of the ''Purple Virgin 9'' (2004). For a joint 2010 exhibition with Paula Rego and Mat Collishaw she decorated the front of the Foundling Museum with the neon words &quot;Foundlings and fledglings are angels of this earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/video/2010/jan/27/foundling-museum-tracy-emin Video about Tracey Emin exhibition at the Foundling Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin has donated neon work to auction for charity and in 2007, her neon ''Keep Me Safe'' reached the highest price ever made for one of her neon works of over Â£60,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/artmarketwatch/artmarketwatch6-22-07.asp Art Market Watch - artnet Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A brand new neon piece called ''With You I Want To Live'' will be shown as part of Emin's ''You Left Me Breathing'' exhibition in November/December 2007 at the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/beverly-hills-2007-11-tracey-emin/ The image of the neon is being used in publicity surrounding the forthcoming exhibition of new Emin work.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fabric===

Emin frequently works with fabric in the form of appliquÃ©s &amp;mdash; material (often cut out into lettering) sewn onto other material. She collects fabric from curtains, bed sheets and linen and has done so for most of her life. She keeps such material that holds emotional significance for later use in her work. Many of her large scale appliquÃ©s are made on hotel linens, for example, ''It Always Hurts'' (2005), ''Sometimes I Feel So Fucking Lost'' (2005), ''Volcano Closed'' (2001) and ''Helter Fucking Skelter'' (2001).  ''Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing'' (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large scale blanket inspired in part by Margaret Thatcher due to her involvement in &quot;an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy&quot; and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work &quot;about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/btseries/bb/traceyemin/explore/blanket_walkthru.html BT Series - Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin's use of fabric is diverse, one of her most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother's armchair in ''There's A Lot Of Money In Chairs'' (1994). The chair was very detailed, &quot;including her and her twin brotherâs names, the year of her grandmotherâs birth (1901) and the year of her birth (1963) on either side of the words â''another world''â, referring to the passing of time. An exchange between the artist and her grandmother using the nicknames they had for each other: â''Ok Puddin, Thanks Plum''â, covers the bottom front of the chair and a saying of Eminâs grandmotherâs, â''Thereâs a lot of money in chairs''â, is appliquÃ©d in pink along the top and front of its back. Behind the chair back, the first page of Exploration of the Soul, handwritten onto fabric, is appliquÃ©d together with other dictums such as, â''Itâs not what you inherit. Itâs what you do with your inheritance''â&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MV&quot;/&gt; Emin used the chair on a trip Emin made to the United States in 1994. Driving from San Francisco to New York stopping off along the way to give readings from her book, ''Exploration of the Soul'' (1994). Emin gave her readings sitting in the upholstered chair and &quot;as she crossed the United States, the artist sewed the names of the places she visited â San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Monument Valley, Detroit, Pittsburgh, New York - onto the front of the chair&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MV&quot;/&gt; Emin also posed in the chair for two of her photographic works (see Photography) whilst in Monument Valley, in the Arizona Desert. It is currently on public display at [http://www.pallant.org.uk/home Pallant House Gallery] until 6 March 2011 as part of the exhibition, [http://www.pallant.org.uk/exhibitions/current/main-galleries/contemporary-eye-crossovers1/contemporary-eye-crossovers 'Contemporary Eye: Crossovers.']

Emin has made a large number of smaller scale works, often including hand sewn words and images, such as ''Falling Stars'' (2001), ''It Could Have Been Something'' (2001), ''Always Sorry'' (2005) and ''As Always'' (2005).

On 13 April 2007, Emin launched a specially designed flag made out of fabric with the message ''One Secret Is To Save Everything'' written in orange-red letters across the banner made up of hand-sewn swimming sperm. Tracey Emin's flag, at 21 feet by 14 feet, will fly above the Jubilee Gardens in the British capital until 31 July 2007, with the parliament building and the London Eye as backdrops. Emin called the artwork &quot;a flag made from wishful thinking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6553327.stm | work=BBC News | title=Artist Emin unveils cryptic flag | date=13 April 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was commissioned by the South Bank Centre in London's Waterloo.

In June 2007, on returning from the [[Venice Biennale]], Emin donated a piece of artwork, a handsewn blanket called ''Star Trek Voyager'' to be auctioned at [[Elton John]]'s annual glamorous White Tie &amp; Tiara Ball to raise money for The Elton John AIDS Foundation. The piece of artwork sold for Â£800,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;&gt;Alexander, Hilary. &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/main.jhtml?xml=/fashion/2007/06/29/efwhite129.xml White tie and tiara ball]&quot;. telegraph.co.uk, June, 2006. Retrieved on 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin's works on fabric has been related to other artists such as [[Louise Bourgeois]], who Emin actually mentions in a sewn work called ''The Older Woman'' (2005) with the phrase (monoprint on fabric), &quot;I think my Dad should have gone out with someone older like Louise, Louise Bourgeois&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://www.lehmannmaupin.com/artists/traceyemin/ Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Emin was interviewed by [[Alan Yentob]] during the BBC's ''Imagine'' documentary ''Spiderwoman'' about Louise Bourgeois, aired in the UK on 13 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/imagine/article/louise_bourgeois.shtml Episode Guide: Louise Bourgeois, Spiderwoman]&quot;. BBC, November, 2007. Retrieved on 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Found objects===

Emin has often made use of [[found object]]s in her work from the early use of a cigarette box found in a car crash in which her uncle died. The most well known example is ''[[My Bed]]'', where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from [[Whitstable]] to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut)'' (1999).

She revisited the theme of the bed in 2002, with the mixed media installation, ''To Meet My Past'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/artpages/tracey_emin_meet_my_past2.htm Tracey Emin - To Meet My Past - Contemporary Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; another installation with a [[four poster bed]] with embroidered text such as ''Weird Sex'' and ''To Meet My Past'' hanging down alongside the mattress.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

Emin also incorporated stones and rocks which had been thrown through her window in a mixed media piece in her 2005 show. The work consists of a [[monoprint]] of herself sitting on a chair with the stones lined up below the drawing in a vitrine.

''The Leg'' (2004) included a plaster cast inside a vitrine, kept by the artist after she broke her leg, exhibited alongside a C-print photograph of the artist wearing the cast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/whenithinkaboutsex/7/ White Cube â When I Think about Sex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Installations===

Emin has created a number of installation art pieces including ''Poor Thing (Sarah and Tracey)'' (2001) which was made up of two hanging frames, hospital gowns, a water bottle and wire. A similar installation called ''Feeling Pregnant III'' (2005) made up of fabric hung off wooden and metal coat hangers and stands was a later creation for Emin. Both these installations touch further on Emin's relationship with pregnancy and abortion and can be related to [[Louise Bourgeois]]' sculptures such as ''Untitled'' (1996), a mobile of hanging clothes, and ''Untitled'' (2007), a series of standing bronze sculptures.

''The Perfect Place to Grow'' (2001) was a video installation with a set consisting of a wooden birdhouse, a DVD (shot on Super 8), monitor, trestle, plants, wooden ladder. This installation has been exhibited at the Tate Britain in 2004 in their room dedicated to Emin's work and also White Cube in 2001. It was dedicated to her father, creating the bird house as ''a tiny home for my dad'' and Emin thought of the works' title from the idea of ''nature and nurture''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/btseries/bb/traceyemin/explore/shed_home.html BT Series - Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Knowing My Enemy'' (2002) was a large scale installation created by Emin for her [[Modern Art Oxford]] solo show of that year. Consisting of reclaimed wood and steel, Emin created a wooden 'look-out' house upon a long, broken, wooden pier. ''It's Not the Way I Want to Die'' (2005) was another large scale installation, part of Emin's 2005 solo show at White Cube. Emin created a large rollercoaster track with reclaimed timber and metal. Displayed in the same show was a smaller installation work called ''Self Portrait'' (2005) which consisted of a tin bath, bamboo, wire and neon light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/whenithinkaboutsex/5/ White Cube â When I Think about Sex&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another related installation ''Sleeping With You'' (2005) consisted of painted reclaimed timber and a thin neon light across a dark wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

===Films===

Emin featured with her then boyfriend, [[Billy Childish]], in ''Quiet Lives'' (1982) (11 mins, 16&amp;nbsp;mm, written and directed by Eugene Doyen),  once available with ''Cheated'' and ''Room for Rent'' in ''A Hangman Triple Bill'', also known as ''The Hangman Trilogy'', [[Hangman Books|Hangman Films]]. ''Quiet Lives'' is discussed in an article on Childish's films in No Focus: punk on film (Headpress, 2006).

An autobiographical work is the [[film]], ''CV Cunt Vernacular'' (1997), in which Emin narrates her story from childhood in Margate, through her student years, abortions and destruction of her early work.

''[[Top Spot]]'' (2004) is a feature-length non-fiction production, mixing DV footage and Super 8 film into lyrical montage. The title refers to a youth centre/disco in Margate (but also a sexual reference), ''Top Spot''. The film draws heavily on Emin's teenage experiences of growing up in Margate, and features six teenage girls who share their stories. The natural beauty of the sea and the sunsets is linked with Margateâs more manmade pleasures, underscored with a selection of 1970s songs that formed the soundtrack to the artistâs own adolescence. It was shot during the summertime in Margate, London, and Egypt. Emin withdrew the film from general distribution in cinemas, after the film was rated with an 18 certificate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4018433.stm  Emin withdraws film from cinemas, BBC News, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, the film was broadcast on BBC3 television in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4040215.stm Emin film shown on BBC3 in December 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; A DVD of the film was released in 2004.

===Sculpture===
In February 2005, Emin's first public artwork, a bronze sculpture, went on display outside the Oratory, adjacent to [[Liverpool Cathedral]]. It consists of a small bird perched on a tall bronze pole, and is designed so that the bird seems to disappear when viewed from the front. It was commissioned by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/4293245.stm |title=Emin unveils 'sparrow' sculpture |publisher=BBC News|date=2005-02-24 |accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Emin's work stands outside The Oratory, in Upper Duke Street just outside the Cathedral.  The Roman Standard - which features a small bird on top of a four-metre high bronze pole - is a tribute to the city's famous symbol the Liver Bird.  The sculpture was commissioned by the BBC as part of their contribution to the art05 festival and Liverpool's year as European Capital of Culture in 2008.  Emin says the sculpture represents strength and femininity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.liverpoolcathedral.org.uk/content/musicandevents/whatson/detail/Installation_by_Tracey_Emin_1_month/171.aspx Installation by Tracey Emin (1 month) - Liverpool Cathedral&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, Emin will unveil a brand new neon work that will &quot;be installed in the well of the cathedral&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2007/12/06/sir-paul-mccartney-and-tracey-emin-are-culture-stars-100252-20209788/ Sir Paul McCartney and Tracey Emin are Culture stars - Liverpool Echo.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Emin herself says of her continuing relationship of making public sculptures in the town, &quot;When Liverpool is Capital of Culture in 2008, I'll be making a large work for the Anglican Cathedral, which I'm really looking forward to.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

Other sculptures have included ''Death Mask'' (2002) which is a bronze cast of her own head. Emin loaned this work to the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2005,

{{cquote|The death mask, which enjoyed a popular revival in the nineteenth century, was a method for preserving the final expression and physiognomy of the famous or infamous, largely based on the belief that facial features and proportion could explain personal attributes such as genius or criminality. These likenesses were often produced and distributed in multiples as plaster casts could be taken from a bronze original.

In an ironic reference to the much discussed autobiographical nature of her practice which has dominated critical reception of her work, Emin has cast her own death mask during her life-time creating a contemporary portrait with an historic allusion through her use of this lost tradition.

Death Masks were most usually made of male subjects. The red appliquÃ© fabric on which Emin's bronze head is placed refers to the frequent use of quilting and embroidery in her work, associated with the domestic sphere of women, which challenges masculine frameworks of history and art history. Emin, whose work is often based on images of herself, once commented &quot;It is like they have seen my art by seeing me&quot;. In this work she offers herself in perpetuity as an enclosed specimen or museum display, literally transforming herself into an object for the scrutiny of generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/wotraceyemin.asp National Portrait Gallery | What's on? | Death Mask by Tracey Emin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At Emin's 2007 ''Venice Biennale'' exhibition, as well as the central exhibition's ''Tower'' sculptures, tall wooden towers consisting of small pieces of timber piled together, a new small bronze-cast sculpture work of a child's pink sock was revealed ''Sock'' (2007) on display on the steps of the British Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishcouncil-venice.org/images/200.jpg Image]&lt;/ref&gt; Her exhibition again attracted widespread UK media coverage, both positive and negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kino&quot; /&gt;

In September 2007, Emin announced she would be exhibiting new sculpture work in the inaugural [[Folkestone]] Triennial which took place in the Kent town from June until September 2008. In June 2008, Emin discussed the [[Folkestone]] sculptures, stating the &quot;high percentage&quot; of teenage pregnancies in the Kent town had inspired this latest work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2108165/Teenage-mothers-inspire-Tracey-Emin-artwork.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Teenage mothers inspire Tracey Emin artwork | date=11 June 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emin said her contribution would be different pieces placed around the town,

Emin's 2007 solo show at [[Gagosian Gallery]] in Los Angeles' Beverly Hills&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot; /&gt; included brand new sculpture works described by Emin as, &quot;some very strange little sculptures.

In late November 2007, it was announced that Emin was one of six artists to have been shortlisted to propose a sculpture for the fourth plinth in London's [[Trafalgar Square]].

==Definition of art==
In common with many YBAs, including [[Damien Hirst]], Emin employs assistants for fabrication purposes, for example sewing the lettering onto her appliquÃ©d pieces.

A poster she photocopied and put up around her home when her cat Docket went missing became an object collected by people, but was excluded by Emin from her canon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1898461.stm Emin's cat posters taken by collectors]&quot;. BBC, 28 March 2002. Retrieved on 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Emin was commissioned, as part of a scheme throughout London titled ''Art in Sacred Spaces'',&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1180915,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=A Â£35,000 Tracey Emin quilt - but worthless if school tries to sell it | first=Lucy | last=Ward | date=30 March 2004 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to collaborate with children on an artwork at Ecclesbourne Primary School in Islington, North London. Pupils made the piece with her in Emin's style of sewing cut out letters onto a large piece of material. In 2004, the school enquired if Emin would sign the work so that the school could sell it as an original to raise funds. They planned to auction the piece for Â£35,000 for an arts unit,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3584273.stm Emin wants school quilt returned]&quot;. BBC, 30 March 2004.

Emin and her gallery White Cube refused saying that it was not a piece of her art, therefore reducing its value and requested it be returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/style/article428901.ece As referenced in the Sunday Times interview with Emin 30 May 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; But Emin quickly came to an agreement with the school, where she paid Â£4,000 to create a perspex display box for the patchwork quilt to be showcased. Taking as her theme the title &quot;Tell me something beautiful&quot;, Emin invited eight-year-olds to nominate their ideas of beauty and then to sew the keywords in felt letters on bright fabric squares. The resulting bold patchwork, featured words such as &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;sunrise&quot;, &quot;dolphin&quot; and &quot;nan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3603787.stm BBC Online news piece]&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic John Slyce, who has worked on school collaborations with artists, supported Emin and White Cube's decision saying, &quot;This is a horrific precedent for the school to try to set. They were lucky to have an artist of that stature spending that amount of time with them ... the artwork should remain in context with the kids. Children's primary experience of art should not be as a commodity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt;

==Momart fire (2004)==
{{Main|Momart}}
On 24 May 2004, a fire in a [[Momart|Momart storage warehouse]] in East London destroyed many works from the [[Saatchi Gallery|Saatchi collection]], including Emin's famous tent with appliquÃ©d letters, ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963â1995]]'' (&quot;The Tent&quot;) (1995) and ''The Last Thing I Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here'' (&quot;The Hut&quot;) (1999), Emin's blue wooden beach hut that she bought with fellow artist [[Sarah Lucas]] and shared with her boyfriend of the time, the gallerist [[Carl Freedman]]. Emin spoke out angrily against what she perceived as a general public lack of sympathy, and even amusement, at the loss of the artworks in the fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kino&quot; /&gt; However, she also put the loss in her perspective, commenting: {{cquote|I'm also upset about those people whose wedding got bombed last week [in Iraq], and people being dug out from under 400ft of mud in the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1227746,00.html They said what?]&quot; ''The Guardian'', 30 May 2004.

==Venice Biennale (2007)==
{{Main|Venice Biennale}}

In August 2006, the [[British Council]] announced that they had chosen Emin to produce a show of new and past works for the British Pavilion at the 52nd [[Venice Biennale]] in 2007. Emin was the second woman to produce a solo show for the UK at the Biennale, following [[Rachel Whiteread]] in 1997. In a BBC interview, Andrea Rose, the commissioner for the British Pavilion, said the exhibition would allow Emin's work to be viewed &quot;in an international context and at a distance from the [[Young British Artists|YBA]] generation with which she came to prominence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5285970.stm Emin art show planned for Venice]&quot;. BBC, 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin has chosen the title ''Borrowed Light''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/exhibition/en/73805.6.html La Biennale di Venezia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for the in-depth exhibition of her work. The artist produced new work especially for the British Pavilion, using a wide variety of media - from needlework, photography and video to drawing, painting, sculpture and neon. A promotional British Council flyer includes an image of a previously unseen monoprint for the exhibition called ''Fat Minge'' (1994) which will be included in the show whilst the Telegraph newspaper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Slideshow/slideshowContentFrameFragXL.jhtml?xml=/arts/slideshows/biennale/pixbiennale.xml&amp;site= | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=52 International Biennale, Venice | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured a photo of a new purple neon ''Legs I'' (2007) which will be on display (directly inspired by Emin's 2004 purple watercolour ''Purple Virgin'' series. Emin herself summed up her Biennale exhibition work as,&lt;ref&gt;Taken from the British Council flyer to promote the 52nd International Art Exhibition in Venice Biennale&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Pretty and hard-core|}}

Emin was interviewed about the Venice Biennale in her East London studio by the BBC's [[Kirsty Wark]]; this was broadcast on [[BBC Four]] television channel in November 2006. Emin showed Wark some work-in-progress, which included large-scale canvases with paintings of Emin's legs and vagina. Starting with the ''Purple Virgin'' (2004) acrylic watercolour series with their strong purple brush strokes depicting Emin's naked open legs, leading to Emin's paintings in 2005-6 such as ''Asleep Alone With Legs Open'' (2005), the ''Reincarnation'' (2005) series and ''Masturbating'' (2006) amongst others, these works are a significant new development in her artistic output.

In an interview with [[Lynn Barber]] published in The Observer newspaper the week before the launch of Emin's biennale show, the artist said of her work,{{cquote|It's the most feminine work I've ever made.|}} Andrea Rose, the British Pavilion commissioner, added to this commenting on the art Emin has produced, 'It's remarkably ladylike. There is no ladette work - no toilet with a poo in it - and actually it is very mature I think, quite lovely. She is much more interested in formal values than people might expect, and it shows in this exhibition. It's been revelatory working with her. Tracey's reputation for doing shows and hanging them is not good, but she's been a dream to work with. What it shows is that she's moved a long way away from the YBAs. She's quite a lady actually!'&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Lynn.&quot;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2093995,00.html From party girl to Biennale queen]&quot;. guardian.co.uk, 3 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal Academician (2007)==
On 29 March 2007, Tracey Emin was made Royal Academician by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. Emin became a member of the Royal Academy joining an elite group of artists including [[David Hockney]], Peter Blake, Anthony Caro and Alison Wilding. This entitles Emin to exhibit up to six works in the annual summer exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, GeneviÃ¨ve. &quot;[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2401711.ece Tracey Emin is made Royal Academician]&quot;. independent.co.uk, 29 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emin has a long history of exhibiting her art at the Royal Academy, having been invited to include works at their Summer Exhibitions in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004  and 2001. For 2004's Summer Exhibition, Emin was chosen by fellow artist David Hockney to submit two monoprints, one called ''And I'd Love To Be The One'' (1997) and another on the topic of Emin's abortion called ''Ripped Up'' (1995) as that year's theme celebrated the art of drawing as part of the creative process. Whilst 2007 saw Emin exhibit a neon work called ''Angel'' (2005). Emin's art was first included at the Royal Academy as part of the ''Sensation'' exhibition in 1997.

For the June 2008 Summer Exhibition, Emin has been invited to curate a gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/summer-exhibition/ Summer Exhibition 2008 - Exhibitions - Royal Academy of Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Emin also gave a public talk in June 2008 interviewed by art critic and broadcaster [[Matthew Collings]], contemplating her role within the Royal Academy, the Academyâs relationship to the contemporary art world, and her perspective, as an artist, on hanging and curating a gallery in the Summer Exhibition.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;[http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/events/lectures/tracey-emin-ra-in-conversation,471,EV.html Tracey Emin RA in Conversation with Matthew Collings - Evening lectures - Exhibitions &amp; events - Royal Academy of Arts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The large scale exhibition included the full range of Emin's art from the rarely seen early work to the iconic ''My Bed'' (1998) and the room-sized installation ''Exorcism of the Last Painting I Ever Made'' (1996). The show displayed her unique appliquÃ©d blankets, paintings, sculptures, films, neons, drawings and monoprints. The [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] was the only UK venue for the show which travels to the Centro de Arte ContemporÃ¡neo in [[MÃ¡laga]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecube.com/news/132/ Emin at CAC Malaga, White Cube website news]&lt;/ref&gt; Spain and then to the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstmuseumbern.ch/index.cfm?nav=1245,1397,1442&amp;SID=2&amp;DID=9&amp;aID=227 |title=Kunstmuseum Bern &amp;#124; Schweiz - Upcoming |publisher=Kunstmuseumbern.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Vanishing Lake - Frieze Fair (2011)''==

On October 6th 2011 Emin opened a site-specific exhibition at Fitzroy Square. The title is taken from her novel which has served as a catalyst for a series of new works, created for a neoclassical house designed by Robert Adam in 1794. The exhibition also featured a series of embroidered texts and hand-woven tapestries continue Eminâs interest in the domestic and handcrafted tradition.

On the afternoon of October 15th graffiti artist RSH poured liters of bright red paint on the street and sidewalk outside the Gregorian building at 6 Fitzroy Square as a statement about the false nature of Emin's art work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/30604065  |title='RSH' attacks Emin exhibition October 2011 |publisher=  |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2011-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuckism==
[[Image:2001 Stuckist Turner demo 2 (4).jpg|thumb|[[Stuckist]]s use a cut-out of Emin in 2001 to demonstrate against the [[Turner Prize]]]]
{{Main|Stuckism}}
Emin's relationship with the artist and musician [[Billy Childish]] led to the name of the [[Stuckism]] movement in 1999. Childish, who had mocked Emin's new affiliation to conceptualism in the early '90s, was told by Emin, &quot;Your paintings are stuck, you are stuck! &amp;ndash; Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!&quot; (that is, stuck in the past for not accepting the YBA approach to art). He recorded the incident in the poem, &quot;Poem for a Pissed Off Wife&quot; published in &quot;Big Hart and Balls&quot; [[Hangman Books]] 1994, from which [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], who knew them both, later coined the term Stuckism.

Emin and Childish had remained on friendly terms up until 1999, but the activities of the Stuckist group offended her and caused a lasting rift with Childish. In a 2003 interview, she was asked about the Stuckists:
{{cquote|&quot;I don't like it at all,&quot; she spat. &quot;I don't really want to talk about it. If your wife was stalked and hounded through the media by someone she'd had a relationship with when she was 18, would you like it? That's what happened to me. I don't find it funny, I find it a bit sick, and I find it very cruel, and I just wish people would get on with their own lives and let me get on with mine.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/02/1044122263222.html?oneclick=true |title=Eminently outrageous |publisher=smh.com.au |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Charity work==
Emin is well known for her charity work including raising over a million pounds for children's charities such as the [[NSPCC]] and for HIV/AIDS charities including the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tht.org.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/2007/march/13march.htm THT website, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Emin frequently donates original artworks for charity auctions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory/5061/23/03/2011/terrence-higgins-trust-auction-raises-26000-for-service-users.aspx The Pink Paper, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and has often adopted the role of auctioneer on the charity night to help increase the highest bid.

In June 2007, on returning from the [[Venice Biennale]], Emin donated a piece of artwork, a handsewn blanket called ''Star Trek Voyager'' to be auctioned at [[Elton John]]'s annual glamorous White Tie &amp; Tiara Ball to raise money for The Elton John AIDS Foundation. The piece of artwork sold for Â£800,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;white&quot;/&gt; Also in June 2007, Emin's neon work ''Keep Me Safe'' reached the highest price ever (at that time) made for one of her neon works of over Â£60,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

Emin has participated in [[The Independent]] newspaper's ''Christmas Appeal'' for many years, where she has offered for auction bespoke artworks and also drawing lessons with the artist.

In January 2008, Emin went to Uganda where she had set up the brand new &quot;Tracey Emin Library&quot;  at the rural Forest High School. She explained in her newspaper column, &quot;Schools here don't have libraries. In fact, rural areas have very little. Most have no doctor, no clinic, no hospital; schools are few and far between.

==Political views==
Emin has been a critic of Britain's Labour tax regime, stating &quot;Iâm simply not willing to pay tax at 50%&quot;, she is &quot;very seriously considering leaving Britain&quot;, and suggests she will live in France &quot;The French have lower tax rates and they appreciate arts and culture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Richard. (4 October 2009). [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article6860232.ece 'Tracey Emin: Stuff your 50% tax, Iâm taking my tent to France'], ''Times online''. Retrieved 16 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Emin has since corrected the rumour that she intends to leave the country, stating that a journalist she spoke to previously exaggerated her comments, and that London is her home, and is the context in which she belongs.&lt;ref&gt;''Mark Lawson Talks to Tracey Emin'', BBC 4, 14 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper reported in August 2010 that Emin is thought of as a supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artists-flinch-at-honour-of-hanging-in-tory-offices-2065546.html |title=Artists flinch at 'honour' of hanging in Tory offices - Culture minister Ed Vaizey says he ruffled feathers after selecting contemporary artworks to adorn Westminster |author=Arifa Akbar |date=30 August 2010 |work= |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |accessdate=5 September 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in an interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'' she revealed that she voted for the Conservatives at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], adding, &quot;We've got the best government at the moment that we've ever had.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2010/10/voting-tory-emin-melvyn |title=Preview: NS Interview with Tracey Emin |author=Sophie Elmhirst |date=8 October 2010 |work= |publisher=The Independent on Sunday |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
