<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="8843053" ns="0" title="Microsoft Music Central"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Microsoft Music Central''' was a music encyclopedia on [[CDROM]] produced by [[Microsoft]], similar to their [[Microsoft Cinemania|Cinemania]] product and part of the [[Microsoft Home]] range. The software featured a selection of biographical articles from the [[Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] a spin off of the [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] written by [[Colin Larkin (writer)]]; along with album reviews from ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' Magazine.[http://www.monitor.ca/monitor/issues/vol3iss1/newstuff.html] The software also included [[image|still images]] and full-motion [[video]] clips and featured online updates.

Users had the option of taking an informational 'tour' led by the recorded voice of an artist (or an imitation of their voice, in the case of Little Richard) on their own musical genre. This automatically directed the user to particular articles, and played samples of music.

Users could also browse by artist, album, and genre, or search for particular keywords. There was also a gallery feature to view portraits, album covers, video clips and song clips.
