It operates with unlimited hours, with 500 [[watt]]s during the daytime, and 116 watts in the evening hours.

WHTX's sportscasters include veteran announcer Bob Church.

==History==
===Early Years===
The 1570 frequency was the original home of '''WHOT''', then a daytime-only station in the 1950s. One of the first Top 40 stations in the United States, WHOT was founded by Myron Jones&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pab.org/hof_Jones.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Bill Fleckinstein, who first signed on [[WJET (AM)|WJET]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] on the 1570 frequency as a daytimer. After upgrading WJET to a fulltime signal on the 1400&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency in 1955, Jones and Fleckinstein used the now-opened 1570 frequency to establish WHOT in the Youngstown suburb of [[Campbell, Ohio]] as a 250 watt non-directional daytime-only station. At the time, the station had to sign off at nighttime in order to protect clear channel [[XERF]] in [[Ciudad AcuÃ±a]], and for a period WHOT was the only daytimer in the Youngstown market. 

Despite the technical limitations, WHOT rose to the top of the local ratings in the Youngstown area. Longtime broadcaster [[Dick Biondi]] was the afternoon host on WHOT at this time. In 1963, WHOT moved to [[WGFT|the 1330 frequency]] as a full time operation (and to this day, still operates with a CHR/Top 40 format, although on [[WHOT|the 101.1 MHz frequency]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrcdxas.org/articles/whot.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The 1570 frequency was reestablished in 1971 as '''WTCL''', licensed to [[Warren, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1972/B-2%20YB%201972%20All-12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; WTCL became '''WOKG''' on November 2, 1981, and would eventually come under the ownership of Geraldine Taczak.

In WOKG's later years, it aired a controversial locally-based talk radio format under the &quot;Talk 1570&quot; name. Programmed by Steve Fine, the lineup featured Neil Hagan (host of &quot;Sundown Talk&quot;), A.J., Charles Cunningham, Mike Murphy and Mike Ward. Even while the station had authorization for nighttime operation by this period, WOKG primarily operated during the daytime hours (excluding whenever high school play-by-play would air). As a result, the schedule would vary according to sunrise and sunset times.

On March 23, 1990, the WOKG studios in [[Warren Township, Trumbull County, Ohio|Warren Township]], [[Ohio]] were destroyed by a fire, which was ruled arson by local authorities. No suspects were ever apprehended, and the case remains unsolved to this day. The station returned to the air on March 30, 1990 from studios in a pizza concession trailer, located in the parking lot next to the destroyed converted farm house which had previously housed the station. Shortly thereafter, Geraldine Taczak would make plans to sell the station.

In the following months, the station began simulcasting an urban-contemporary format with [[WYCL|the 1540 facility]] in [[Niles, Ohio]], known as &quot;Network 15 - The City.&quot; WOKG took the '''WANR''' calls on December 15, 1990, while the 1540 facility assumed the complementary WNRB callsign. (WANR initially stood for &quot;'''WA'''rren's '''N'''etwo'''R'''k 15&quot;, but long after the simulcast ended, it eventually stood for &quot;'''WA'''rre'''N R'''adio.&quot;)

The two stations on &quot;Network 15&quot; featured local personalities such as program director/morning host Boots Bell, Sweat William, DC Don Clyde, Will Thomas, and Steve Arnold.  The station was most known for the paid [[General Motors]] program &quot;GM Together&quot; - which focused on the company's [[Lordstown Assembly|nearby plant]] in [[Lordstown, Ohio]] - and &quot;TMH together,&quot; focusing on Trumbull Memorial Hospital.
 
WANR split off from WNRB in 1994, and carried a basic news/talk and sports format. Beacon Broadcasting, headed by Micheal Arch, acquired WANR in late 1998, and the station added Christian programming to the mix as &quot;The Arrow.&quot;

It then carried a mix of oldies music and specialty talk shows as &quot;Crusin' 1570,&quot; and then went back to a talk format as &quot;The Talk of the Valley.&quot; WANR's studios by this point were located at 124 North Park Avenue in Warren's historic downtown Courthouse Square.

===Recent Years===
After airing a number of syndicated and local talk programs, in [[2005]] WANR became the Youngstown/Warren area affiliate of the [[Air America Radio]] liberal talk radio network. It also broadcast a local talk radio program called ''The New Talk of the Town'', hosted by local political figure Don Hanni III. The liberal talk format was operated by Hanni and associates under a [[local marketing agreement]]. 
 
After a dispute between the station's ownership and the group operating the station, a court settlement returned programming control to owner Beacon Broadcasting. Following the court decision, former Warren steel supply magnate Harold Glunt took exclusive control over Beacon, and soon acquired [[WGRP]] and [[WLVX|WEXC]] from Vilkie Communications, [[WLOA]] from [[Holy Family Communications]], and former sister station WRTK from D&amp;E Broadcasting. Glunt readjusted Beacon's focus to being a faith-based company that adhered to &quot;family friendly&quot; radio. Consequently, the purchase of WEXC eliminated that station's 50s/60s oldies format in favor of [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]].

Following the dropping of the liberal talk format, WANR picked up a variety of Christian and secular oldies music until adopting a &quot;Family Friendly&quot; oldies trimulcast with WLOA and WGRP (a semi-continuation of [[WLVX|WEXC]]'s former oldies format. Initially identifying itself with the anachronistic &quot;Wexy 107&quot; name, this arrangement later was known as &quot;1570, 1470 and 940 - Your Family Friendly Frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ohiomediawatch.wordpress.com/2005/09/07/its-a-land-of-glunt-again/&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

It ended in December 2006, with the two other stations adopting separate formats, while WANR became &quot;Classic Hits 1570,&quot; featuring hits from the 60's, 70's 80's and 90's and including local broadcasters such as Gregg Allen in the morning, Johnny Rogers in afternoons, John Madden in evenings and Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Strother.

This format would be dropped in favor of the Fox Sports Radio-based sports format on [[July 4]], [[2009 in radio|2009]]. At the time, Cumulus-owned ESPN affiliate [[WBBW]] carried ''[[The Dan Patrick Show]]'' on their weekday schedule (which is normally on Fox Sports Radio's main lineup, but produced by [[DirecTV|DirecTV Sports Group]] and syndicated separately by FSR's parent company, [[Premiere Radio Networks]]). WANR instead offered a three-hour syndicated program devoted to [[professional boxing]] during the latter days of Beacon ownership. Following Whiplash Radio's takeover of the station, FSR's alternate morning show, ''The Zakk and Jack Show'', aired on a tape-delayed basis in that time slot, moving the boxing program to the evening hours.

Following the death of Harold Glunt in January 2010, all of the Beacon stations, including WANR and WRTK, were put up for sale. Concurrently, WRTK also began a full-time simulcast of WANR's sports format (albeit only during the daytime hours). Whiplash Radio LLC purchased the stations on Friday, August 13, [[2010 in radio|2010]].  The company is headed by radio veteran [[Chris Lash]], who has built, owned and operated stations in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida and Ohio. Both WRTK and WANR then moved to WRTK's studio/transmitter site in Mineral Ridge a few weeks later, with WRTK assuming a separate classic country format known as &quot;Youngstown's Country Legends,&quot; WYCL 1540 The Farm, on September 1, 2010.

The sports radio format and Fox Sports Radio affiliation was dropped in November 2010 after Clear Channel announced a new affiliation agreement between the network and [[WNIO]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ohiomediawatch.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/busy-monday/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azn2a-X_Htk&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, WANR revived their previous classic hits format christened as &quot;The Blizzard,&quot; including legendary personalities Jim Zippo, Larry James, Eric Chase, [[John Records Landecker]], Randy Hames, and [[Rick Dees]] via the [[TKO Radio Network]].

On January 20, 2011, Whiplash Radio LLC of Ohio applied to change WANR's call letters to '''WHTX''', call letters previously used on the 96.1&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] frequency in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] (now [[WKST-FM]]) and later on the 95.9&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] frequency in [[Sharpsville, Pennsylvania|Sharpsville]] (now [[WAKZ]]). The following Wednesday, WHTX announced that they would become the flagship station for the [[Mahoning Valley Scrappers]], succeeding long-time flagship WNIO.

WHTX then switched formats again to [[adult standards]] on March 22, 2011, filling a format hole in the market after both WNIO and WSOM both switched from standards to spoken word formats. Citing health concerns, owner Chris Lash leased out operating control of WHTX to Cleveland broadcast veteran Jim Davison that June 6, keeping the standards format but adding additional local and syndicated programming in the process.

On October 14, 2011, WHTX became the exclusive [[CBS Radio Network]] affiliate for the entire Warren and Youngstown market.

==Programming==
WHTX has longtime local Youngstown radio personality Gary Rhamy in morning drive, followed by Cathy Taylor in middays, Scott LeTourneau in afternoons, Mary Marlowe in evenings and Billy Shears in overnights. The station's music is currently provided from [[Dial Global]] Local's [[The Lounge (radio network)|The Lounge]] format.

Weekend and specialty programming includes ''The Sounds of Sinatra with [[Sid Mark]]'', ''Rock, Roll and Remember with [[Dick Clark]]'',  ''American Standards By The Sea with [[Don Robinson]]'', ''Footlight Parade with Bill Rudman'', ''Weekend Radio with Robert Conrad'', and ''Elvis Only with Jay Gordon''.

Hourly newscasts are also provided by [[CBS News|CBS Radio News]] and supported locally by a news-sharing agreement with the [[Warren Tribune Chronicle]]. Weather updates are provided by [[Accuweather]].
