From its sixth release, [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X v10.5]] &quot;Leopard&quot; and onward, every release of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} gained [[UNIX 03]] certification while running on [[Intel]] processors.&lt;ref name=leopard_unix_cert/&gt;&lt;ref name=snow_leopard_unix_cert/&gt;

The first version released was [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] in 1999, and a desktop-oriented version, [[Mac OS X v10.0]] &quot;Cheetah&quot; followed on March 24, 2001. Releases of Mac OS X are named after [[big cat]]s: for example, Mac OS X v10.7 is usually referred to by Apple and users as &quot;[[Mac OS X Lion|Lion]]&quot;. The [[server (computing)|server]] edition, [[Mac OS X Server]], is [[software architecture|architecturally]] identical to its desktop counterpart, and includes tools to facilitate management of workgroups of Mac OS X machines, and to provide access to [[network service]]s. These tools include a [[mail transfer agent]], an [[LDAP]] server, a [[Domain Name System|domain name server]], and others. It is pre-loaded on Apple's [[Xserve]] server hardware, but can be run on almost all of Apple's current selling computer models.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Mac OS X}}

Mac OS X is based upon the [[Mach kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;

Certain parts from [[FreeBSD]]'s and [[NetBSD]]'s implementation of [[Unix]] were incorporated in [[NeXTSTEP]], the core of Mac OS X. NeXTSTEP was the [[object-oriented operating system]] developed by [[Steve Jobs]]' company [[NeXT]] after he left Apple in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;

While Jobs was away from Apple, Apple tried to create a &quot;next-generation&quot; OS through the [[Taligent]], [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] and [[Gershwin operating system|Gershwin]] projects, with little success.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, NeXT's OS, then called [[OpenStep|OPENSTEP]], was selected to be the basis for Apple's next OS, and Apple purchased NeXT outright.&lt;ref&gt;

Steve Jobs returned to Apple as interim CEO, and later became CEO, shepherding the transformation of the programmer-friendly OPENSTEP into a system that would be adopted by Apple's primary market of home users and creative professionals. The project was first known as ''[[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]]'' and was later renamed to ''Mac OS X''.&lt;ref&gt;

Mac OS X Server 1.x, was incompatible with software designed for the original Mac OS and had no support for Apple's own [[IEEE 1394 interface]] (FireWire). Mac OS X 10.x included more [[backward compatibility]] and functionality by including the [[Carbon API]] as well as FireWire support. As the operating system evolved, it moved away from the legacy Mac OS to an emphasis on new &quot;digital lifestyle&quot; applications such as the [[iLife]] suite, enhanced business applications ([[iWork]]), and integrated home entertainment (the [[Front Row (software)|Front Row]] media center).&lt;ref&gt;

Each version also included modifications to the general interface, such as the [[Brushed Metal (interface)|brushed metal]] appearance added in version 10.3, the non-pinstriped titlebar appearance in version 10.4, and in 10.5 the removal of the previous brushed metal styles in favor of the &quot;Unified&quot; gradient window style.&lt;ref&gt;

Mac OS X is the tenth major version of Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers. Previous Macintosh operating systems were named using [[Arabic numerals]], e.g. [[Mac OS 8]] and [[Mac OS 9]]. The letter ''X'' in Mac OS X's name refers to the number ''10'', a [[Roman numeral]]. It is therefore correctly pronounced &quot;ten&quot; ({{IPAc-en|Ë|t|É|n}}) in this context.&lt;ref name=ten_not_x/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the tenth version being the first to be based on Unix origins, and a reason for the Roman numeral to be used for the number 10 in its honour, a common pronunciation is &quot;X&quot; ({{IPAc-en|Ë|É|k|s}}).&lt;ref&gt;

| quote=Now we have dealt with this a number of times over the years. Of course X ({{IPAc-en|Ë|É|k|s}}) does mean 10, but anyone who used to poke around on Unix systems will know that in those days anything Unix had an X (ËÉks) in it, and OS Ten is written OS X (ËÉks) in honour of the fact that it is based on Unix, unlike its predecessors. So, hey, you can say it any way you want; me, I'm showing my age and sticking with X (ËÉks).
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac OS X's core is a [[POSIX]] compliant operating system (OS) built on top of the [[XNU]] [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]], with standard Unix facilities available from the [[command line interface]]. Apple has released this family of software as a [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] operating system named [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]. On top of Darwin, Apple layered a number of components, including the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]] interface and the [[Finder (software)|Finder]], to complete the [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]-based operating system which is Mac OS X.&lt;ref name=&quot;osx_unix&quot;/&gt;

Mac OS X introduced a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor, [[Mac OS 9]]. For example, [[pre-emptive multitasking]] and [[memory protection]] improved the system's ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate=November 5, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many aspects of Mac OS X's architecture are derived from [[OpenStep|OPENSTEP]], which was designed to be portable, to ease the transition from one platform to another. For example, [[NeXTSTEP]] was ported from the original [[68k]]-based NeXT workstations to [[x86]] and other architectures before NeXT was purchased by Apple,&lt;ref name=&quot;nextstep_history&quot; /&gt;
and OPENSTEP was later ported to the [[PowerPC]] architecture as part of the [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody project]].

The most visible change was the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua theme]]. The use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes&amp;nbsp;â similar to the hardware design of the first [[iMac]]s&amp;nbsp;â brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what OS 9 and OS X Server 1.0's &quot;[[Platinum (theme)|Platinum]]&quot; appearance had offered. According to John Siracusa, an editor of [[Ars Technica]], the introduction of Aqua and its departure from the then conventional look &quot;hit like a ton of bricks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Bruce Tognazzini]] (who founded the original Apple Human Interface Group) said that the Aqua interface in [[Mac OS X v10.0]] represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original Mac OS interface.&lt;ref&gt;

Third-party developers started producing [[skin (computing)|skins]] for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the Aqua appearance. To some extent, Apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage, at various times threatening [[legal action]] against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its [[copyright]]ed design.&lt;ref&gt;

Mac OS X [[Architecture of Mac OS X|architecture]] implements a layered design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/MacOSXOverview/MacOSXOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001067-CH205-BCICAIFJ |title=Apple.com |publisher=Developer.apple.com |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks.

Mac OS X includes its own [[software development]] tools, most prominently an [[integrated development environment]] called [[Xcode]]. Xcode provides interfaces to [[compiler]]s that support several [[programming language]]s including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. For the [[AppleâIntel transition]], it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a [[universal binary]], which provides compatibility with both the Intel-based and PowerPC-based Macintosh lines.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] sub-system in Mac OS X is in charge of managing the filesystem, which includes the Unix [[File system permissions|permissions]] layer. In 2003 and 2005, two Macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme; Ted Landau called misconfigured permissions &quot;the most common frustration&quot; in Mac OS X,&lt;ref&gt;

while Rob Griffiths suggested that some users may even have to [[Repair permissions|reset permissions]] every day, a process which can take up to 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

More recently, another Macworld editor, Dan Frakes, called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused.&lt;ref&gt;

He argues that Mac OS X typically handles permissions properly without user interference, and resetting permissions should just be tried when problems emerge.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Distribution and languages ===
As of September 2011, Mac OS X is the second most active general-purpose client operating system in use on the [[World Wide Web]], after [[Microsoft Windows]], with an 8.45% usage share according to statistics compiled by W3Counter.&lt;ref name=&quot;marketshare&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the most successful [[Unix-like]] desktop operating system on the web, estimated at over 5 times the usage of [[Linux]] (which has 1.5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;marketshare&quot; /&gt; See also [[Usage share of operating systems]].

There are twenty-two &quot;System Languages&quot; available for the user at the moment of installation (the &quot;system language&quot; is the entire operating system environment). As of Mac OS X Lion, the languages are Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Portuguese (European), Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. Input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language.&lt;ref name=&quot;languages&quot;&gt;

The [[API]]s that Mac OS X inherited from [[OpenStep]] are not backward compatible with earlier versions of Mac OS. These APIs were created as the result of a 1993 collaboration between [[NeXT|NeXT Computer]] and [[Sun Microsystems]] and are now referred to by Apple as [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]. This heritage is highly visible for Cocoa developers, since the &quot;NS&quot; prefix is ubiquitous in the framework, standing variously for '''N'''ext'''s'''tep or '''N'''eXT/'''S'''un. The official OpenStep API, published in September 1994, was the first to split the API between Foundation and Application Kit and the first to use the &quot;NS&quot; prefix.&lt;ref name=&quot;nextstep_history&quot;&gt;

Apple's Rhapsody project would have required all new development to use these APIs, causing much outcry among existing Mac developers. All Mac software that did not receive a complete rewrite to the new framework would run in the equivalent of the [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic environment]]. To permit a smooth transition from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X, the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] [[Application Programming Interface]] (API) was created. Applications written with Carbon can be executed natively on both systems. Carbon was not included in the first product sold as Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server (now known as Mac OS X Server 1.x).

Mac OS X also used to support the [[Java Platform]] as a &quot;preferred software package&quot; &amp;nbsp;â in practice this means that applications written in Java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being [[cross-platform]] compatible, and that graphical user interfaces written in [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] look almost exactly like native Cocoa interfaces. Traditionally, Cocoa programs have been mostly written in [[Objective-C]], with Java as an alternative. However, on July 11, 2005, Apple announced that &quot;features added to Cocoa in Mac OS X versions later than 10.4 will not be added to the Cocoa-Java programming interface.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Mac OS X is [[POSIX]] compliant, many software packages written for the *[[BSD]]s, [[Linux]], or other [[Unix-like]] systems can be recompiled to run on it. Projects such as [[Homebrew (package management software)|Homebrew]], [[Fink]], [[MacPorts]] and [[pkgsrc]] provide pre-compiled or pre-formatted packages. Since version 10.3, Mac OS X has included [[X11.app]], Apple's version of the [[X Window System]] graphical interface for Unix applications, as an optional component during installation.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate=December 15, 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to and including [[Mac OS X v10.4]] (Tiger), Apple's implementation was based on the [[X11 License]]d [[XFree86]] 4.3 and X11R6.6. All bundled versions of [[X11]] feature a window manager which is similar to the Mac OS X look-and-feel and has fairly good integration with Mac OS X, also using the native [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] rendering system. Earlier versions of Mac OS X (in which X11 has not been bundled) can also run X11 applications using [[XDarwin]]. With the introduction of version 10.5 Apple switched to the [[X.Org Server|X.org]] variant of X11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Hardware===
For the early releases of Mac OS X, the standard hardware platform supported was the full line of Macintosh computers (laptop, desktop, or server) based on [[PowerPC]] G3, G4, and G5 processors. Later versions discontinued support for some older hardware; for example, Panther does not support [[Power Macintosh G3|&quot;beige&quot; G3s]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TigerRequirements&quot;&gt;
{{cite web

| title=Mac OS X: System Requirements

| publisher=Apple Inc
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and Tiger does not support systems that pre-date Apple's introduction of integrated [[FireWire]] ports (the ports themselves are not a functional requirement). [[Mac OS X v10.5|Mac OS X v10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;]], introduced October 2007, has dropped support for all PowerPC G3 processors and for PowerPC G4 processors with clock rates below 867&amp;nbsp;MHz. [[Mac OS X v10.6|Mac OS X v10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;]] supports Macs with Intel processors, not PowerPC. [[Mac OS X Lion|Mac OS X 10.7 &quot;Lion&quot;]] requires a Mac with an Intel [[Core 2 Duo]] or newer processor.

Tools such as [[XPostFacto]] and patches applied to the installation disc have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of Mac OS X on systems not officially supported by Apple. This includes a number of pre-G3 Power Macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar, all G3-based Macs which can run up to and including Tiger, and sub-867&amp;nbsp;MHz G4 Macs can run Leopard by removing the restriction from the installation DVD or entering a command in the Mac's [[Open Firmware]] interface to tell the Leopard Installer that it has a clock rate of 867&amp;nbsp;MHz or greater. Except for features requiring specific hardware (e.g. graphics acceleration, DVD writing), the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware.

PowerPC versions of Mac OS X prior to Leopard retain compatibility with older Mac OS applications by providing an emulation environment called [[Classic Environment|Classic]], which allows users to run [[Mac OS 9]] as a process within Mac OS X, so that most older applications run as they would under the older operating system. Classic is not supported on Intel-based Macs or in Mac OS X v10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;, but users still requiring Classic applications on Intel Macs can use the [[SheepShaver]] emulator to run Mac OS 9 on top of Leopard.

===AppleâIntel transition===
{{Main|AppleâIntel transition}}

In April 2002, eWeek announced a rumor that Apple had a version of Mac OS X code-named Marklar, which ran on [[Intel x86]] processors. The idea behind Marklar was to keep Mac OS X running on an alternative platform should Apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the PowerPC platform.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rumors subsided until late in May 2005, when various media outlets, such as the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
announced that Apple would unveil Marklar in the coming months.

On June 6, 2005, Steve Jobs confirmed these rumors when he announced in his keynote address at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that Apple would be making the transition from PowerPC to [[Intel]] processors over the following two years, and that Mac OS X would support both platforms during the transition. Jobs also confirmed rumors that Apple had versions of Mac OS X running on Intel processors for most of its developmental life. The last time that Apple switched CPU familiesâfrom the [[Motorola]] 68K CPU to the [[IBM]]/Motorola PowerPCâApple included a Motorola 68K emulator in the new OS that made almost all 68K software work automatically on the new hardware. Apple had supported the 68K emulator for 11 years, but stopped supporting it during the transition to Intel CPUs. Included in the new OS for the Intel-based Macs is [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], a [[binary translation]] layer which enables software compiled for PowerPC Mac OS X to run on Intel Mac OS X machines. Apple dropped support for Classic mode on the new Intel Macs. Third party emulation software such as [[Mini vMac]], [[Basilisk II]] and [[SheepShaver]] provides support for some early versions of Mac OS. A new version of Xcode and the underlying command-line compilers support building [[universal binary|universal binaries]] that will run on either architecture.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

| date=June 6, 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PowerPC-only software is supported with Rosetta, though applications may have to be rewritten to run properly on the newer OS X for Intel. Apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both PowerPC and x86.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| title=Adopting Universal Binaries

| url=http://developer.apple.com/macosx/adoptinguniversalbinaries.html|publisher=Apple Inc
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a performance penalty when PowerPC binaries run on Intel Macs through Rosetta. Moreover, some PowerPC software, such as kernel extensions and System Preferences plugins, are not supported on Intel Macs. Some PowerPC applications would not run on Intel OS X at all. Plugins for Safari need to be compiled for the same platform as Safari, so when Safari is running on Intel it requires plug-ins that have been compiled as Intel-only or universal binaries, so PowerPC-only plug-ins will not work.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While Intel Macs are able to run PowerPC, x86, and universal binaries, PowerPC Macs support only universal and PowerPC builds.

Support for the PowerPC platform was dropped after Mac OS X 10.5. Such cross-platform capability already existed in Mac OS X's lineage; OpenStep was ported to many architectures, including x86, and Darwin included support for both PowerPC and x86. Apple stated that Mac OS X would not run on Intel-based personal computers aside from its own, but a hacked version of the OS compatible with conventional x86 hardware was developed by the [[OSx86]] community.

On June 8, 2009, Apple announced at its [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] that [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard (version 10.6)]] would drop support for PowerPC processors and be Intel-only.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

| accessdate=June 15, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Rosetta is still supported. In Snow Leopard, Rosetta is not installed by default, but it is available on the installation DVD as an installable add-on and is installed automatically via the Internet when first attempting to run a PowerPC-based application.

==Features==
One of the major differences between the previous versions of Mac OS and OS X was the addition of the [[Aqua GUI]], a graphical user interface with water-like elements. Every window element, text, graphic, or [[widget (computing)|widget]] is drawn on-screen using [[anti-aliasing]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, [[drop shadow]]s were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (document modal [[dialog box]]es attached to specific windows) and drawers.

Apple has continued to change aspects of the OS X appearance and design, particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar. One example of a UI behavioral change is that previewed video and audio files no longer have progress bars in column view; instead, they have mouse-over start and stop buttons as of 10.5.

The [[human interface guidelines]] published by Apple for Mac OS X are followed by many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system [[OpenGL]] composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called [[Quartz Compositor|Quartz Extreme]], a component of [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]]. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) imaging model, making it easy to output PDF to multiple devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;davidson&quot; /&gt;
As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.&lt;ref&gt;

In version 10.3, Apple added [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]], a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop. Its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks, display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application, and hide all windows to access the desktop.&lt;ref&gt;

With the exception of [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] and the original public beta, Mac OS X versions are named after [[big cat]]s. Prior to its release, [[Mac OS X v10.0|version 10.0]] was [[code name]]d &quot;Cheetah&quot; internally at Apple, and [[Mac OS X v10.1|version 10.1]] was code named internally as &quot;Puma&quot;. After the immense buzz surrounding [[Mac OS X v10.2|version 10.2]], codenamed &quot;Jaguar&quot;, Apple's product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system. [[Mac OS X Panther|10.3]] was marketed as &quot;Panther&quot;, [[Mac OS X Tiger|10.4]] as &quot;Tiger&quot;, [[Mac OS X Leopard|10.5]] as &quot;Leopard&quot;, [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|10.6]] as &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;, and the current version [[Mac OS X Lion|10.7]] as &quot;Lion&quot;. &quot;Panther&quot;, &quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Leopard&quot; are registered as trademarks of Apple, but &quot;Cheetah&quot;, &quot;Puma&quot; and &quot;Jaguar&quot; have never been registered. Apple has also registered &quot;Lynx&quot; and &quot;Cougar&quot; as trademarks, though these were allowed to lapse.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark #78257226 for Panther, #78269988 for Tiger, #78270003 for Leopard, #78271630 for Cougar and #78271639 for Lynx, all registered in 2004 by Apple Computer, Inc.

Computer retailer [[Tiger Direct]] sued Apple for its use of the name &quot;Tiger&quot;. On May 16, 2005 a US federal court in the Southern District of Florida ruled that Apple's use did not infringe on Tiger Direct's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;

The &quot;PB&quot; as it was known marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback. Mac OS X Public Beta expired and ceased to function in Spring 2001.&lt;ref&gt;

===Version 10.0: &quot;Cheetah&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X v10.0}}
On March 24, 2001, Apple released [[Mac OS X v10.0]] (internally codenamed [[Cheetah]]).&lt;ref&gt;Although the version is now called Cheetah by users, rare evidences can be found to prove that it was called so internally. For instance, a Q&amp;A was created in 2005 which mentions it

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. Simply releasing Mac OS X was received by the Macintosh community as a great accomplishment, for attempts to completely overhaul the Mac OS had been underway since 1996, and delayed by countless setbacks. Following some bug fixes, [[kernel panic]]s became much less frequent.

===Version 10.1: &quot;Puma&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X v10.1}}
Later that year on September 25, 2001, [[Mac OS X v10.1]] (internally codenamed [[Puma]]) was released.&lt;ref&gt;The name Puma can be found here

It had better performance and provided missing features, such as DVD playback. Apple released 10.1 as a free upgrade CD for 10.0 users, in addition to the US$129 boxed version for people running [[Mac OS|Mac OS 9]]. It was discovered that the upgrade CDs were full install CDs that could be used with [[Mac OS|Mac OS 9]] systems by removing a specific file; Apple later re-released the CDs in an actual stripped-down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;pumaupgrade&quot;&gt;

Apple followed up with [[Mac OS X v10.2]] &quot;[[Jaguar]]&quot;, the first release to use its code name as part of the branding.&lt;ref&gt;The headline of the press release mention &quot;Jaguar&quot;, while the codename was not mentioned for earlier versions.

The [[Happy Mac]] which had appeared during the Mac OS startup sequence for almost 18 years was replaced with a large grey Apple logo with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2.

===Version 10.3: &quot;Panther&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X Panther}}
[[Mac OS X v10.3]] &quot;[[Panther]]&quot; was released on October 24, 2003. In addition to providing much improved performance, it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface. Panther included as many or more new features as Jaguar had the year before, including an updated Finder, incorporating a brushed-metal interface, [[Fast user switching]], [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]] (Window manager), [[FileVault]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], iChat AV (which added [[videoconferencing]] features to iChat), improved [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) rendering and much greater [[Microsoft Windows]] interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;

Support for some early G3 computers such as &quot;beige&quot; Power Macs and &quot;WallStreet&quot; PowerBooks was discontinued.

===Version 10.4: &quot;Tiger&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X Tiger}}
[[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X v10.4]] &quot;[[Tiger]]&quot; was released on April 29, 2005. Apple stated that Tiger contained more than 150 new features.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As with Panther, certain older machines were no longer supported; Tiger requires a Mac with a built-in [[FireWire]] port.&lt;ref name=&quot;TigerRequirements&quot; /&gt;
Among the new features, Tiger introduced [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight]], [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]], [[Virtual folder|Smart Folders]], updated Mail program with Smart Mailboxes, [[QuickTime]] 7, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] 2, [[Automator (software)|Automator]], [[VoiceOver]], [[Core Image]] and [[Core Video]]. The initial release of the [[Apple TV]] used a modified version of Tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services. On January 10, 2006, Apple released the first Intel-based Macs along with the 10.4.4 update to Tiger. This operating system functioned identically on the PowerPC-based Macs and the new Intel-based machines, with the exception of the Intel release dropping support for the Classic environment.&lt;ref&gt;

Only PowerPC Macs can be booted from retail copies of the Tiger client DVD, but there is a Universal DVD of Tiger Server 10.4.7 (8K1079) that can boot both PowerPC and Intel Macs.

===Version 10.5: &quot;Leopard&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X Leopard}}
[[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X v10.5]] &quot;[[Leopard]]&quot; was released on October 26, 2007. It was called by Apple &quot;the largest update of Mac OS X&quot;. It brought more than 300 new features.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Leopard supports both [[PowerPC]]- and [[X86|Intel x86]]-based Macintosh computers; support for the G3 processor was dropped and the G4 processor required a minimum clock rate of 867&amp;nbsp;MHz, and at least 512 MB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] to be installed. The single DVD works for all supported Macs (including 64-bit machines). New features include a new look, an updated Finder, [[Time Machine (Apple software)|Time Machine]], [[Spaces (software)|Spaces]], [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] pre-installed,&lt;ref name=&quot;bootcamp&quot;&gt;

full support for [[64-bit]] applications (including graphical applications), new features in [[Mail (application)|Mail]] and [[iChat]], and a number of new security features. Leopard is an [[Single UNIX Specification|Open Brand UNIX 03]] registered product on the Intel platform. It was also the first [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD-based]] OS to receive UNIX 03 certification.&lt;ref name=leopard_unix_cert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

It was the final version of Mac OS X to support the PowerPC architecture.{{Clear}}

===Version 10.6: &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X Snow Leopard}}
[[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Mac OS X v10.6]] &quot;[[Snow_leopard|Snow Leopard]]&quot; was released on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}, Snow Leopard focuses on &quot;under the hood&quot; changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes are: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to [[Mac OS X Leopard|Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard]], a more responsive [[Finder (software)|Finder]] rewritten in [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], faster [[Time Machine (Apple software)|Time Machine]] backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, as well as a faster [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser.

The rewrite of [[Finder (software)|Finder]] in Apple's native [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] API allows the Finder to take advantage of the new technologies introduced in Snow Leopard. An update of the web browser, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 4]], includes a boost in [[JavaScript]] and [[HTML]] performance, which results in faster web browsing. The majority of this performance boost is enabled by the new [[JavaScriptCore|SquirrelFish]] [[JavaScript]] interpreter, improving the JavaScript rendering performance of [[Safari web browser|Safari]] by over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new Top Sites also displays the most frequently visited and/or bookmarked sites in a panorama view, allowing the user to easily access their favorite sites along with a new [[Cover Flow]] view for the user's browsing history. [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 4]] is now also more crash resistant, being able to isolate plug-ins which are the main cause of web browser crashes.&lt;ref&gt;

| publisher=Apple Inc

| accessdate=October 22, 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mac OS X v10.6 also features [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] support for [[Mail (application)|Mail]], [[iCal]], and [[Address Book (application)|Address Book]], new [[64-bit]] technology capable of supporting greater amounts of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], an all new [[QuickTime X]] with a refreshed user interface and more functionality that used to be only available to QuickTime Pro owners.

Back-end platform changes include improved support for multi-core processors through [[Grand Central Dispatch]] which attempts to ease the development of applications with multi-core support, and thus improve their CPU utilization. It used to be that developers needed to code their programs in such a way that their software would explicitly take advantage of the multiple cores, which could easily become a tedious and troublesome task, especially in complex software. It also includes advanced GPU performance with [[OpenCL]] (a cross platform open standard for GPGPU distinct from [[CUDA]], Dx11 Compute Shader or STREAM) by providing support to offload work normally only destined for a CPU to the graphic card's GPU. This can be especially useful in tasks that can be heavily parallelized.

Snow Leopard only supports machines with Intel CPUs, requires at least 1 GB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and drops default support for applications built for the [[PowerPC]] architecture ([[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] can be installed as an additional component to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).&lt;ref&gt;

===Version 10.7: &quot;Lion&quot;===
{{Main|Mac OS X Lion}}
[[Mac OS X v10.7]] &quot;[[Lion]]&quot; was released on July 20, 2011. It includes support for the [[Mac App Store]], and brings many other developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily-navigable display of installed applications ([[Launchpad (Mac OS X)|Launchpad]]) and (a greater use of) [[multi-touch]] gestures, to the Mac. This release removed [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], making it incapable of running PowerPC applications.

Changes made to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) include the [[Launchpad (Mac OS X)|Launchpad]] (similar to the home screen of iOS devices), auto-hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used, and Mission Control, which unifies ExposÃ©, Spaces, Dashboard, and full-screen applications within a single interface.&lt;ref&gt;
