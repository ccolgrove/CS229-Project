'''Christopher Keith Irvine''' (born November 9, 1970),&lt;ref name=SLAM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/jericho.html|accessdate=2009-07-21|last=John|first=Milner|coauthors=Richarad Kamen|title=Chris Jericho's bio|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=SLAM Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his [[ring name]] '''Chris Jericho''', is an &lt;!-- he was born in New York --&gt; inactive [[Canadian-American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], musician, songwriter, radio personality, television host, actor, author, and dancer. He is best known for his time in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E), as well as in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), and internationally in Canadian, Mexican and Japanese promotions. 

Jericho has won 30 championships between WWF/E WCW, and ECW - the three most prominent American promotions in the 1990s. He is credited as being the first [[Undisputed Championship#World Wrestling Entertainment|Undisputed WWE Champion]], having [[Championship unification|unified]] the [[WWF Championship]] and the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Championship]] in 2001. 

In WWE Jericho is a six-time [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Champion]], having won the [[WWE Championship|Undisputed WWF Champion]] [[List of WWE Champions|once]], the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW/World Champion]] [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions|twice]] and the the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|thrice]].
He is also a record [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|nine-time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]]. Meanwhile in tag team competition he is a seven-time champion between [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|five]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team]] and [[List of WWE Tag Team Champions|two]] [[WWE Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team]] Championship reigns. Combining those with his single [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]] and [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] reigns earned him the distinction of being WWE's fourth [[Grand Slam Championship#World Wrestling Entertainment|Grand Slam Champion]]/&lt;ref name=wwebio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/chrisjericho/|publisher=[[WWE]]|title= WWE Alumni Profile|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho is also a two-time Television Champion between his single [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW Television]] and [[ECW World Television Championship|ECW Television]] Championship reigns. In WCW, he was also a [[List of WWE Cruiserweight Champions|four-time]] [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|Cruiserweight Champion]].

Outside of wrestling, Jericho formed the band [[Fozzy]] in 1999 as their lead vocalist. Their [[Fozzy (album)|self-titled debut album]] consisted mostly of cover songs. Their 2005 album [[All That Remains (album)|All That Remains]], featured all original music, as did their 2010 release [[Chasing the Grail]]. He also competed in the 2011 series of [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 12)|''Dancing With The Stars'']], lasting until the sixth week. Prior to this, he hosted the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[game show]] ''[[Downfall (game show)|Downfall]]''.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1990&amp;ndash;1996)===
At age 19, Irvine entered the Hart Brothers School of Wrestling where, on his first day, he met [[Lance Storm]]. Two months later, he was ready to start wrestling on independent shows, making his debut on October 2, 1990, in a draw against Storm. The pair then worked as a tag team, initially called &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;. Meanwhile, he took the name &quot;Jericho&quot; from the [[Helloween]] album, ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Jericho with Peter Thomas Fornatale, ''A Lion's Tale: Around The World In Spandex'', Grand Central Publishing, pp. 65, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho and Storm worked for Tony Condello in the tours of Northern Manitoba with [[Edge (wrestler)|Adam Copeland]] (Edge), [[Christian (wrestler)|Jason Reso]] (Christian), and [[Rhino (wrestler)|Terry Gerin]] (Rhino).&lt;ref name=SLAM/&gt; The pair also wrestled in Calgary's Canadian National Wrestling Alliance (CNWA) and Canadian Rocky Mountain Wrestling (CRMW). In 1991, Jericho and Storm started touring in Japan for [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]], where he would befriend [[Ricky Fuji]], who also trained under [[Stu Hart]].

In the winter of 1992, he traveled to Mexico and competed under the name '''Leon D'Oro''', and later '''CorazÃ³n de LeÃ³n''', where he wrestled for several small wrestling companies, as well as the largest in the country, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL). In CMLL, Jericho took on [[CÃ©sar CuauhtÃ©moc GonzÃ¡lez|Silver King]], [[Negro Casas]], and [[Ãltimo DragÃ³n]] en route to an 11 month reign as the [[NWA World Middleweight Championship|NWA Middleweight Champion]] that began in December 1993. After leaving Mexico, Jericho would wrestle in [[Hamburg, Germany]] for six weeks as part of a tournament run by Rene Lasarteese.&lt;ref name=SLAM/&gt; His burgeoning wrestling skills also took him to Japan in 1994 where he competed for [[Genichiro Tenryu]]'s [[WAR (wrestling promotion)|Wrestling and Romance]] (later known as Wrestle Association &quot;R&quot;) (WAR) promotion, facing the likes of [[Keiji Takayama|Gedo]] and Ãltimo DragÃ³n, to whom he lost the [[WAR International Junior Heavyweight Championship]]. He would also become a member of the heel stable Fuyuki-Gun (also known as Team No Respect) with Gedo, Jado, and [[Hiromichi Fuyuki]] under the name '''Lion Do''', and would go on to team with Gedo to become the first [[Dragon Gate I-J Heavyweight Tag Team Championship|WAR International Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions]]. 

1994 also saw Jericho reunited with his former teammate from CRMW, Storm, as the Thrillseekers in [[Jim Cornette]]'s [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] promotion, where they feuded with the likes of [[Well Dunn]], [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]], and [[The Heavenly Bodies]]. In December 1995, Jericho competed in the second [[Super j cup 1995|Super J Cup]] Tournament, hosted by WAR, losing to [[Chris Benoit|Wild Pegasus]].&lt;ref name=SLAM/&gt;

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996)===
In 1996, thanks in part to recommendations by [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Perry Saturn]], to promoter [[Paul Heyman]], and after [[Mick Foley]] saw Jericho's match against Ãltimo DragÃ³n for the WAR International Junior Heavyweight Championship in July 1995 and gave a tape of the match to Heyman, Jericho began wrestling for the Philadelphia-based [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) promotion, winning the [[ECW World Television Championship]] from [[Anthony Durante|Pitbull #2]] in June 1996. While in ECW, Jericho wrestled [[Tazz|Taz]], [[Terry Brunk|Sabu]], [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], [[Shane Douglas]], and [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. It was during this time that he drew the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW).

===World Championship Wrestling===
====Cruiserweight Champion (1996&amp;ndash;1998)====
On August 26, 1996 Jericho made his first appearance with WCW, and on September 15, he appeared at his first [[pay-per-view]] show in a match against Chris Benoit at [[Fall Brawl 1996|Fall Brawl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/fall.html#96|title=Fall Brawl 1996 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1997, Jericho made his debut for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], who had a working agreement with WCW, as Super Liger, the masked arch nemesis of [[Jushin Liger|Jushin &quot;Thunder&quot; Liger]].&lt;ref name=LionsTale/&gt; Super Liger's first match against [[Koji Kanemoto]] at [[January 4 Dome Show#Wrestling World 1997|Wrestling World 1997]] was so poorly received that the gimmick was dropped instantly.&lt;ref name=LionsTale/&gt; The following six months, Jericho worked for New Japan unmasked, before being called back by WCW.&lt;ref name=LionsTale/&gt; On June 28, 1997, Jericho defeated [[Sean Waltman|Syxx]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to win the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|Cruiserweight Championship]] for the first time. He won the title again on August 12, 1997, by defeating [[Alex Wright]].

Jericho began his WCW [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] run when he won the title a third time by defeating [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] at [[Souled Out 1998|Souled Out]] by forcing him to submit to the Liontamer. After the match, Jericho assaulted Mysterio's knee with a [[toolbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/january/1998.htm|title=Souled Out 1998 Results|accessdate= 2008-06-15|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the storyline, Mysterio needed six months of recovery before he could return to the ring. Jericho then had a short feud with [[Juventud Guerrera]] in which Guerrera repeatedly requested a shot at Jericho's Cruiserweight Championship, but Jericho constantly rebuffed him. The feud culminated in a [[professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Title vs. Mask match]] at [[SuperBrawl VIII]]. Guerrera lost the match and was forced to remove his mask.&lt;ref name=&quot;sb8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#VIII|title=SuperBrawl 1998 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this match, Jericho began his ongoing [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of collecting and wearing to the ring [[trophy]] items from his defeated opponents, such as Guerrera's mask, [[Michael Haynes III|Prince Iaukea]]'s Hawaiian dress, and a headband from [[Glenn Gilbertti|Disco Inferno]].

Jericho then began a long feud with [[Dean Malenko]] in which Jericho repeatedly claimed he was a better wrestler than Malenko, but refused to wrestle him. Because of his mastery of technical wrestling, Malenko was known as &quot;The Man of 1000 Holds,&quot; so Jericho claimed to be &quot;The Man of 1004 Holds.&quot; During the March 30, 1998 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', after defeating [[Marty Jannetty]], Jericho pulled out a long pile of paper that listed each of the 1004 holds he knew and recited them to the audience. Many of the &quot;holds&quot; were fictional, and every other hold was an [[Professional wrestling holds#Armbar|armbar]]. On the March 12, 1998 episode of ''[[WCW Thunder]]'', Malenko defeated a wrestler wearing Juventud Guerrera's mask who appeared to be Jericho. However, the masked wrestler was actually [[Lenny Lane]], who Jericho bribed to appear in the match. This started a minor feud between Lane and Jericho after Jericho refused to pay Lane. At [[Uncensored 1998|Uncensored]] Jericho finally wrestled Malenko and defeated him, after which Malenko took a leave of absence from wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/uncensor.html#98|title=Uncensored 1998 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho then proceeded to bring with him to the ring a portrait of Malenko that he insulted and demeaned. Just prior to [[Slamboree 1998|Slamboree]], [[James J. Dillon|J.J. Dillon]] (referred to by Jericho as &quot;Jo Jo&quot;) scheduled a cruiserweight [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] in which the wrestler who won would immediately have a shot at Jericho's Cruiserweight Championship. Jericho accepted on the grounds that whoever had to face him would not have nearly enough energy to wrestle two matches in a row. At Slamboree, Jericho came out to announce the competitors in an insulting fashion before the match started and then went backstage for coffee. An individual who appeared to be [[Manuel Ortiz|Ciclope]] won the battle royal after Juventud Guerrera shook his hand then eliminated himself. However, the winner was not Ciclope, but instead a returning Malenko in disguise. Malenko proceeded to defeat Jericho for the championship. Jericho claiming he was the victim of a carefully planned [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to get the belt off of him. He at first blamed the WCW locker room, then added Dillon, [[Ted Turner]], and finally in a vignette, he walked around [[Washington, D.C.]] with the sign &quot;conspiracy victim&quot; and accused President [[Bill Clinton]] of being one of the conspirators after being rejected from a meeting. Eventually, Malenko vacated the title. Jericho ended up defeating Malenko at [[The Great American Bash 1998|The Great American Bash]] to win the vacant title after Malenko was disqualified after hitting Jericho with a chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#98|title=The Great American Bash 1998 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next night, Malenko was suspended for his actions.

At [[Bash at the Beach 1998|Bash at the Beach]], the recently returned Rey Mysterio, Jr. (who had recovered from his knee injury) defeated Jericho in a [[No Disqualification match]] after the still-suspended Malenko interfered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/beach.html#98|title=Bash at the Beach 1998 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho regained the Cruiserweight Championship from Mysterio the next night after he interrupted J.J. Dillon while Dillon was giving the championship to Mysterio. Jericho was again awarded the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/nitro/980713.htm|title=WCW Nitro results - July 13, 1998|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=1998-07-13|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Jericho decisively lost the title to Juventud Guerrera in a match at [[Road Wild 1998|Road Wild]] with Malenko as special referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/roadwild.html#98|title=Road Wild 1998 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Television Champion (1998&amp;ndash;1999)====
On August 10, Jericho defeated [[Lane Huffman|Stevie Ray]] to win the [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Championship]] (Stevie Ray substituting for the champion [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/nitro/980810.htm|title=WCW Nitro results - August 10, 1998|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=1998-08-10|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Jericho repeatedly called out [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], in an attempt to begin a feud with him, but never actually wrestled him.&lt;ref name=SLAM/&gt; Jericho cites [[Eric Bischoff]], Goldberg, and [[Hulk Hogan]]'s reluctance to book Jericho in a pay-per-view [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|squash match]] loss against Goldberg, which Jericho felt would be a big draw, as a major reason for his deciding to leave the company.

On November 30, 1998 Jericho lost the Television Championship to [[Konnan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/champs/wcwtvc.htm|title=WCW Television Champions|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1999, Jericho began a feud with [[Perry Saturn]]. The feud saw Jericho and Saturn instigating bizarre stipulation matches, such as at [[Souled Out 1999|Souled Out]], where Jericho defeated Saturn in a &quot;loser must wear a dress&quot; match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/january/1999.htm|title=WCW/nWo Souled Out 1999|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[SuperBrawl IX]] Jericho and Saturn wrestled in a &quot;dress&quot; match in which Jericho once again defeated Saturn. Saturn finally defeated Jericho at [[Uncensored 1999|Uncensored]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Dog Collar match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/s-brawl.html#IX|title=SuperBrawl 1999 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho's final WCW match came on July 21, where he and Eddie Guerrero lost a tag team match to [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.]].

===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment===
====The Y2J problem (1999&amp;ndash;2000)====
[[File:Chris Jericho 1999 WWF Smackdown (WWE).jpg|thumb|right|Jericho on ''SmackDown!'' with [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]], his enforcer during his rivalry with [[Ken Shamrock]].]]
Jericho alternated between WCW and a number of Japanese tours before he signed a contract with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) on June 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;wcw&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=R.D.|last2=Alvarez|first2=Bryan|title=The Death of WCW: WrestleCrap and Figure Four Weekly Present...|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|format=Kindle Edition|accessdate=2010-03-20|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks before Jericho's debut, a clock labeled &quot;countdown to the new millennium&quot; appeared on WWF programming. On the home video, ''Break Down the Walls'', Jericho states he was inspired to do this as his entrance when he saw a similar clock in a post office. [[Vince McMahon]] gave him the green light to use it as his intro to the WWF. The clock finally ran down on August 9, 1999 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] while [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] was in the ring doing a promo. Jericho entered the arena and proclaimed himself &quot;Y2J&quot; (a play on the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K bug]]). The Rock proceeded to verbally mock him for his interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/raw/990809.htm|title=Raw is War results - August 9, 1999| accessdate=2008-06-15|date=1999-08-09|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Jericho made his in-ring debut on August 26, 1999 losing by disqualification in a match against [[Brian Gerard James|Road Dogg]] on the inaugural edition of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' after powerbombing Road Dogg through a table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/|title=WWF SmackDown - 1999 Results|accessdate=2009-11-23|publisher= onlineworldofwrestling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jericho's first long-term feud was with [[Chyna]], for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]. After losing to Chyna at the [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1999/results/|title=Survivor Series 1999|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho won his first Intercontinental title at [[WWE Armageddon#1999|Armageddon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/arm99.html|title=WWF Armageddon 1999 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Hoffco}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feud included a controversial decision during a rematch in which two separate referees declared each one of them the winner of a match for the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/raw/000103.htm|title=Raw is War results - January 3, 2000|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=2000-01-03|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they became co-owners of the title until Jericho attained sole ownership at the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811411/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2000|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho's subsequent alliance with Chyna, coupled with growing enthusiasm for his ring work and mic skills, effectively turned him into a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]]. Shortly thereafter, he began a feud with [[Kurt Angle]], and lost the title to Angle at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2000/results/|title=No Way Out 2000 results|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, Jericho competed in a Triple Threat match against [[Chris Benoit]] and Angle at [[WrestleMania 2000]] where he won the [[WWF European Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm16/results/|title=WrestleMania 2000|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho lost the title the next day to [[Eddie Guerrero]] on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' after Chyna, claiming she could not resist Guerrero's Latino Heat, turned heel to side with him. On the April 17 edition of ''Raw'', Jericho upset [[Triple H]] in a [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] match. Referee [[Earl Hebner]] made a fast count when Jericho pinned Triple H, causing Jericho to win the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pwwew.net/tv/raw/000417.htm|title=Raw is War results - April 17, 2000|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=2000-04-17|publisher= PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hebner later reversed the decision due to pressure from Triple H, and WWE does not recognize Jericho's reign as champion. On the May 4 edition of ''SmackDown!'', Jericho defeated Benoit to become Intercontinental Champion for the third time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/smackdown/000504.htm|title=WWF SmackDown results - May 4, 2000|accessdate=2008-06-15|date=2000-05-04|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost the title to Benoit four days later on ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/000508.htm|title=Raw is War results - May 8, 2000|accessdate =2008-06-15|date=2000-05-08|publisher=PWWEW.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Jericho's feud with Triple H climaxed at [[WWF Fully Loaded#2000|Fully Loaded]], when they competed in a [[Last Man Standing match]]. Jericho lost the match to Triple H only by one second, despite the repeated assistance Triple H's wife [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] provided him in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/fl00.html|title=WWF Fully Loaded 2000 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Hoffco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Undisputed Champion (2001&amp;ndash;2002)====
[[File:ropes.jpg|thumb|left|Jericho performing his entrance on Raw.]]
At the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|2001 Royal Rumble]], Jericho defeated Chris Benoit in a [[Ladder match]] to win the Intercontinental Championship for the fourth time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881142/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2001|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], he successfully defended his title in a match against [[William Regal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm17/results/|title=WrestleMania X-Seven|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to lose it four days later to Triple H.

At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Jericho and Benoit won a &quot;Tag Team Turmoil&quot; match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/jd01.html|title=WWF Judgment Day 2001 Results|accessdate=2008-06-15|publisher=Hoffco}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a shot at [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Triple H for their [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' the next night. Benoit and Jericho won the match, in which Triple H legitimately tore his quadriceps and spent the rest of the year injured, and Jericho became WWF Tag Team Champion for the first time.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; The team defended their title in the first [[Triple Threat match|Fatal Four-Way]] [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]] where Benoit sustained a year-long injury doing a [[Diving head butt|diving headbutt]] through a table. Though Benoit was carried out on a stretcher, he returned to the match to climb the ladder and retain the championship. The duo lost the title one month later to the [[Dudley Boyz]] on June 19, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwe1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=World Tag Team|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, Jericho became a major force in [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] storyline in which WCW and ECW joined forces to overtake the WWF. Jericho remained on the side of the WWF despite previously competing in WCW and ECW. However, Jericho began to show jealousy toward fellow WWF member The Rock. They faced each other in a match at [[No Mercy 2001|No Mercy]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW Championship]] after Jericho defeated [[Rob Van Dam]] in a number one contenders match.

On the November 5 edition of ''Raw,'' The Rock defeated Jericho to regain the WCW Championship. Following the match, Jericho attacked The Rock with a [[Chair shot|steel chair]]. At the [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]], Jericho almost cost The Rock, and the WWF, victory in their elimination matchup by attacking The Rock again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/|title=Elimination Match WWE vs. The Alliance|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, at [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]], Jericho defeated both The Rock for the WCW Championship (unbranded and only referred to as the World Championship following Survivor Series) and Stone Cold Steve Austin for his WWF Championship on the same night to become the first wrestler to hold both championships at the same time, which made him the first Undisputed WWF Champion.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; He fought both of the men he defeated at Vengeance on separate occasions and retained his title at the next two pay-per-views, [[Royal Rumble (2002)|Royal Rumble]] (vs. The Rock)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811413/results/|title=Royal Rumble 2002|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[No Way Out (2002)|No Way Out]] (vs. Stone Cold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/history/2002/results/|title=No Way Out 2002 results|accessdate= 2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho later lost the title to Triple H in the main event of [[WrestleMania X8]].&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; After his title loss, Jericho became a member of the ''SmackDown!'' roster and continued his feud with Triple H.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/backlash02.html|title=Backlash 2002 Results|accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry culminated at Judgment Day when Triple H defeated Jericho in a [[Hell in a Cell]] match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday02.html|title=Judgment Day 2002 Results| accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teaming and feuding with Christian (2002&amp;ndash;2004)====
[[File:Jerichoentrance.jpg|right|thumb|Jericho's ring entrance during ''Raw''.]]
Jericho was later drafted to Raw, where he won the Intercontinental Championship from Rob Van Dam (RVD). He then later formed a tag team with [[Jason Reso|Christian]], with whom he won the World Tag Team Championship, then renamed WWE Tag Team Championship, on October 14, 2002. Christian and Jericho lost the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, involving the teams of The Dudley Boyz, Booker T and Goldust, and William Regal and Lance Storm, on December 15, 2002 at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]].

[[File:Jerichomichaels.jpg|left|thumb|125px|Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels after their match at WrestleMania XIX in March 2003]]
On January 13, 2003, Jericho won an over-the-top-rope challenge against Kane, RVD, and [[Dave Batista|Batista]] to select his entry number for the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble match]]. He chose number two in order to start the match with [[Shawn Michaels]], who had challenged Jericho to prove his claims that he was better than Michaels. After Michaels' entrance, Jericho entered as the second participant. Christian, in Jericho's attire, appeared while the real Jericho attacked Shawn from behind. He eliminated Michaels shortly afterward, but Michaels got his revenge later in the match by causing Test to eliminate Jericho. Jericho spent the most time of any other wrestler in that same Royal Rumble. Jericho simultaneously feuded with Test, Michaels, and [[Jeff Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881141/mainevent/|title=Royal Rumble|accessdate=2007-11-21|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho and Michaels fought again at [[WrestleMania XIX]]. In the end, Michaels scored the victory. Jericho, however, hit Michaels with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Low blow|low blow]] after the match following an embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm19/results/|title=WrestleMania XIX|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After this match, Jericho entered a rivalry with Goldberg, which was fueled by Goldberg's refusal to fight Jericho in WCW. During Jericho's first edition of the ''[[WWE Raw#Recurring segments|Highlight Reel]]'', an interview show, where Goldberg was the guest, he complained that no one wanted Goldberg in WWE and continued to insult him in the following weeks. On May 12 on ''Raw'', a mystery assailant attempted to run over Goldberg with a [[limousine]]. A week later, [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|Co-Raw General Manager]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], interrogated several Raw superstars to find out who was driving the car. One of the interrogates was [[Lance Storm]], who admitted that he was the assailant. Austin forced Storm into a match with Goldberg, who defeated Storm. After the match, Goldberg forced Storm to admit that Jericho was the superstar who conspired Storm into running him over. On May 26, Goldberg was once again a guest on the ''Highlight Reel''. Jericho expressed jealousy towards Goldberg's success in WCW and felt that since joining WWE, he had achieved everything he had ever wanted in his career and all that was left was to defeat Goldberg and challenged him to a match. At [[Badd blood 2003|Bad Blood]], Goldberg settled the score with Jericho and defeated him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inyourheadonline.com/viewnews.php?autoid=1214|title=Interview Recap - Chris Jericho|publisher=In Your Head Wrestling Radio|first=Neal|last=Jones|date=2007-12-07|accessdate=2009-08-21|quote=Chris says everything you heard about the Goldberg story was true, he took him down twice with a front face lock.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2003, Jericho began a romance with [[Trish Stratus]] while his tag team partner Christian began one with [[Amy Dumas|Lita]]. This, however, turned out to be a bet over who could sleep with their respective paramour first, with a [[Canadian 1 dollar coin|Canadian Dollar]] at stake. Stratus overheard this and ended her relationship with Jericho, who seemingly felt bad for using Stratus. After he saved her from an attack by [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]], Stratus agreed that the two of them could just be &quot;friends&quot;. After Christian put Stratus in the [[Boston crab|Walls of Jericho]] while competing against her in a match, Jericho sought revenge on Christian, which led to a match at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Christian defeated Jericho after Stratus ran down and &quot;inadvertently&quot; struck Jericho (thinking it was Christian) and Christian got the roll-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm20/results/|title=WrestleMania XX|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Stratus turned on Jericho and revealed that she and Christian were a couple. This revelation led to a handicap match at [[Backlash (2004)|Backlash]] that Jericho won, thus turning him into a fan favorite in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/history/backlash2004/results/|title=Backlash 2004 results|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho won his seventh Intercontinental Championship at that year's [[Unforgiven (2004)|Unforgiven]] in a ladder match against Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/history/2004/results/|title=Unforgiven 2004 results|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho's seventh reign was short lived, as he lost it at [[Taboo Tuesday (2004)|Taboo Tuesday]] to [[Shelton Benjamin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/cybersunday/history/alltimeresults|title=Taboo Tuesday 2004|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Championship pursuits and departure (2004&amp;ndash;2005)====
Jericho teamed up with [[Randy Orton]], Chris Benoit, and [[Maven Huffman|Maven]] to take on Triple H, Batista, Edge, and [[Gene Snitsky|Snitsky]] at [[Survivor Series (2004)|Survivor Series]]. The match's stipulation stated that each member of the winning team would become the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Raw brand authorities|General Manager]] of Raw throughout the next four weeks. Jericho's team was victorious, so they took turns as General Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2004/mainevent/|title=RAW Elimination Match|accessdate=2007-11-24|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Jericho's turn as General Manager, he stripped Triple H of his World Heavyweight Championship because a [[Triple Threat match|Triple Threat]] match for the title a week earlier ended in a draw. At [[New Year's Revolution (2005)|New Year's Revolution]], Jericho competed in the [[Elimination Chamber]] against Triple H, Chris Benoit, Batista, Randy Orton, and Edge for the vacated World Heavyweight Championship. Jericho began the match with Benoit but Batista ultimately eliminated Jericho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/newyearsrevolution/history/2005/results/|title=New Year's Revolution 2005 Results|accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that June, Jericho turned on WWE Champion [[John Cena]]. Jericho lost a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship at Vengeance which also involved Christian and Cena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/vengeance/history/vengeance2005/results/|title=Vengeance 2005 results|accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071114193117/http://www.wwe.com/shows/vengeance/history/vengeance2005/results/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud continued throughout the summer and Jericho lost to Cena in a championship match at [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/2005/|title=SummerSlam 2005|accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next night on ''Raw'', Jericho faced Cena in a rematch, this time in a &quot;[[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|You're fired&quot; match]].&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; Cena won again, and Jericho was fired by Raw General Manager [[Eric Bischoff]], Jericho then turned on Bischoff. Jericho was carried out of the arena by security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/08222005/|title=Jericho fired; Angle No. 1 contender|accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWE announced that Jericho's WWE contract had expired on August 25, 2005.

===Return to WWE===
====The Second Coming (2007&amp;ndash;2008)====
[[File:Chris Jericho and Umaga.jpg|thumb|Jericho facing [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] on ''Raw''.]]
WWE promoted Jericho's return since September 24, 2007 with a [[viral marketing]] campaign using a series of 15-second [[Cryptic crossword|cryptic]] [[binary code]] videos, similar to the [[matrix digital rain]] featured in [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix series]].

==Personal life==
His father [[Ted Irvine]] is a former [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) player.&lt;ref name=wwebio/&gt; Though he was born in the prominent [[Long Island]] neighborhood of [[Manhasset, New York]], Irvine was raised in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{cite news|last=Callis|first=Don|title=Jericho just one of the guys, yet hard to forget|date= 2004-07-04|publisher=[[Winnipeg Sun]]|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/DonCallis/2004/07/04/525161.html|accessdate= 2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vince McMahon felt that by introducing him as &quot;born in Manhasset, New York&quot;, American fans would be more likely to get behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/04/16/423757.html|last=Engstrom|first=Kevin|title= Jericho loses roots|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irvine and his wife Jessica have three children - a son named Ash Edward Irvine, who was born on September 24, 2003 and twin daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/20643 |title=Chris Jericho And Jessica Irvine Introduce Y2J Jr.|accessdate=2010-12-27 |publisher=411mania.com |date=2003-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=139326 |title=FOZZY: New Audio Interview With CHRIS JERICHO Posted Online - Apr. 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-27 |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Irvine has two tattoos on his left hand. The first is his wedding band while the second is the letter 'F' on the back of his hand, representing Fozzy, a band he has been lead vocalist for since 1999.

On July 5, 2004, Irvine was awarded The Order of the Buffalo Hunt in a ceremony held in Manitoba for his achievements in wrestling and his commitment to working with underprivileged children.&lt;ref name=buffalo/&gt; The award has previously been given to [[Pope John Paul II]], Chicago mayor [[Richard M.

On February 7, 2009, Irvine appeared to have punched a fan after she spat at him with fans outside [[Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] after a WWE live event. Video footage, however, clearly showed he did not make contact with the woman. As a result of the incident, police detained them, but released them without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090209/jericho_incident_090209/20090209?hub=Entertainment|title=Wrestler Chris Jericho gets in altercation with fans|date=2009-02-09| publisher=CTV|accessdate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police later announced that they would not press charges against anyone in the brawl as it was &quot;hard to determine who provoked who&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/Sports/Police+charges+melee+involving+wrestler/1424147/story.html|title=Police won't lay charges in melee involving pro wrestler|date= 2009-03-24|accessdate=2009-03-25|publisher=Times Colonist}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
