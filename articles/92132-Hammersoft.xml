Warren County is part of the [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]&amp;ndash;[[Middletown, Ohio|Middletown]], OH-[[Kentucky|KY]]-[[Indiana|IN]] [[Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|407|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|400|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|8|sqmi|km2}} of it (1.84%) is water. The county is a rough square with the sides roughly 20&amp;nbsp;miles (30&amp;nbsp;km) long.

===Adjacent counties===
*[[Montgomery County, Ohio|Montgomery County]] (northwest)
*[[Greene County, Ohio|Greene County]] (northeast)
*[[Clinton County, Ohio|Clinton County]] (east)
*[[Clermont County, Ohio|Clermont County]] (south)
*[[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] (southwest)
*[[Butler County, Ohio|Butler County]] (west)

===Boundaries===
Warren County was created by the first [[Ohio General Assembly]] in the Act of March 24, 1803, which also created Butler and Montgomery Counties. The act defined Warren County as &quot;all that part of the county of Hamilton included within the following bounds, viz.: Beginning at the northeast corner of the county of Clermont, running thence west with the line of said county to the [[Little Miami River|Little Miami]]; thence up the same with the meanders thereof to the north boundary of the first tier of sections in the second entire range of townships in the [[Symmes Purchase|Miami Purchase]]; thence west to the northeast corner of Section No. 7 in the third township of the aforesaid range; thence north to the [[Great Miami River|Great Miami]]; thence up the same to the middle of the fifth range of townships; thence east to the County line; thence with same south to the place of beginning.&quot; Originally this included land now in [[Clinton County, Ohio|Clinton County]] as far east as [[Wilmington, Ohio|Wilmington]].

Clinton County proved a continuing headache to the legislature. The Ohio Constitution requires that every county have an area of at least four hundred square miles (1,036&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²). Clinton County's boundaries were several times adjusted in an effort to comply with that clause of the constitution. One of them, the Act of January 30, 1815, detached a strip of land from the eastern side to give to Clinton. That would have left Warren under four hundred square miles (1,036&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²), so a portion of Butler County (the part of [[Franklin Township, Warren County, Ohio|Franklin Township]] where [[Carlisle, Ohio|Carlisle]] is now located) was attached to Warren in compensation. The 1815 act was as follows:
*Section 1âThat all that part of the county of Butler lying and being within the first and second fractional townships in the fifth range, and adjoining the south line of Montgomery County, shall be and the same is hereby attached to and made part of the county of Warren.
*Section 2âThat eleven square miles [[28&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²]] of the territory of the county of Warren and extending parallel to the said eastern boundary of Warren County, along the whole length of such eastern boundary from north to south, shall be and the same is hereby attached to and made a part of the county of Clinton.&quot;
Except for the sections formed by the Great and Little Miamis, the sides are all straight lines.

===Lakes and rivers===
The major rivers of the county are the [[Great Miami River]], which flows through the northwest corner of the county in [[Franklin Township, Warren County, Ohio|Franklin Township]], and the [[Little Miami River]] which zig-zags across the county from north to south. There is one sizable lake, the [[Caesars Creek Reservoir]], created by a [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] dam on Caesars Creek in the northeast part of the county in [[Massie Township, Warren County, Ohio|Massie Township]].

===Airports===
Warren County has one public airport, designated as [[Lebanon-Warren County Airport]] (KI68/I68). The runway is a 4502' x 65' paved and lighted North-South runway (01/19), and parallel taxiway. Navigation and communications equipment includes [[Precision Approach Path Indicator|PAPI]], [[AWOS]], [[Pilot Controlled Lighting]], and [[UNICOM]]. The airport runway, taxiway, and navigation equipment is owned by the County. The county leases a public terminal, but other facilities are privately owned and operated under contract by a [[Fixed base operator]]. The airport serves general and business aviation, but has no commercial airlines.

There are also two privately owned operating airports in the county; Waynesville airport, also known as Red Stewart Field (K40I/40I), and Caesar Creek Gliderport (2OH9), both with grass runways. Operations have ceased at two former private paved runway airports, Brownie's Lebanon Airport (19I), and Lebanon San Mar Gale (OH79).

===Rail and Bus===
Warren County does not currently have passenger train service except for a scenic train that runs between Lebanon and Mason. Freight trains still serve Carlisle, and on a limited basis, Monroe, Mason, and Lebanon. Historically, there have been several trains that ran through the county whose stops became cities and villages. These trains include the [[Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway]], the [[Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad]], and the [[Little Miami Railroad]] whose path is now replaced by the [[Little Miami Bike Trail]]. There have been proposals to run commuter trains from Cincinnati to the Kings Island area, but none have ever found sufficient support or funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_cin002.htm Cincinnati's Rail + Bus Plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no public bus transportation based in Warren County, but there is limited service from Cincinnati to Mason and Kings Island. Middletown also runs bus service to eastern portions of Middletown that are located in Warren County.

===Waterways===
There are currently no commercially navigable waterways in Warren County, but the [[Warren County Canal]] did operate in the 19th century as a branch of the [[Miami and Erie Canal]], bringing freight to Lebanon by [[Barge|canal boat]]. Recreationally, the Little Miami River can be traveled by canoe or kayak for its length through the county, and motorized boating can be done at Caesar's Creek Lake.

==Government==
{{main|Ohio county government}}

==Politics==
Warren County is staunchly [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and has been since the party was established in the 1850s. Since the first presidential election after its founding, 1856, Warren County has supported the Republican candidate for president all but once, the exception being 1964 when Warren County voted for [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] over [[Barry M. Goldwater]]. Before the Republican party was formed, Warren County supported the [[United States Whig Party|Whigs]]. Since 1869, Warren County has almost always supported the Republican candidate for [[Governor of Ohio]], the exceptions being in 1924 when it supported [[Vic Donahey]], 1932 ([[George White (Ohio politician)|George White]]), 1952 ([[Frank Lausche]]), and 1958 ([[Michael V. DiSalle]]). However, excepting DiSalle, each of these four Democrats, who were all victorious statewide, was a conservative Democrat.

In local races, Warren County occasionally elected Democrats. In 1976, two of the three county commission seats were won by Democrats. Until the mid-1990s, Democrats regularly ran for county offices and, while almost always losing, did not do so badly. However, with the massive expansion in population in the 1990s, the county became extremely Republican, so much so the Democrats fail to field any candidates. In the 1996, 2000, and 2004 elections, in which eight county offices were on the ballot, there were no Democratic candidates for any of them. In November 1999, the last Democrat to hold office in Warren County, a member of the Educational Service Center (county school board), lost her seat to a Republican.
