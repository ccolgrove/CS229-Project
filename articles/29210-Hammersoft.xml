The '''Sydney Swans Football Club''' is an [[Australian rules football]] club which plays in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). The club is based in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]]. The club, founded in 1874, was known as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' until it relocated to Sydney in 1982 to become the Sydney Swans. Sydney was the first club in the competition to be based outside of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The Swans play most home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], while larger games are played at [[ANZ Stadium]].

Since 1995, the Sydney Swans are the only club not to have missed the finals in consecutive seasons, and have made the finals more years than any other club in the same time, only missing the finals in 2000, 2002 and 2009.

==South Melbourne history==
[[File:Smfc.png|right|thumb|200px|Old South Melbourne Football Club shield. The motto, &quot;Aut vincere aut mori&quot;, is Latin for &quot;either to conquer or to die&quot;.]]
[[File:Old lake oval grandstand.jpg|thumb|200px|All that remains of the Swan's old [[Bob Jane Stadium|Lake Oval]] ground, a single grandstand built in 1926, now unused and in a state of disrepair, but flagged as a possible club museum]]

===Origins: 1874â1876===
The inauguration date of the club is officially 19 June 1874, but it only adopted the name &quot;South Melbourne Football Club&quot; four weeks later, on 15 July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydneyswans.com.au/Swans/TheClub/History/tabid/7210/Default.aspx History â Official AFL Website of the Sydney Swans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The club represented the Melbourne suburb of [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], one of the city's oldest. In 1880 it absorbed the [[Albert Park Football Club|Albert Park]] club (one of the VFA's foundation senior clubs), and by 1890 it had replaced the original blue and white with the now familiar red and white of the South Melbourne coat of arms.

Nicknamed the âSouthernersâ, the team were more colourfully known as the âBloods&quot;, in reference to the bright red sash on their white jumpers&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~nickname/afl.html#swans Nickname â AFL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Ross, J and G. Hutchison, G.,''100 Years of Australian Football'', Published by Viking, Penguin Books Australia Ltd, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; (the sash was replaced with the current red âVâ in 1932).&lt;ref&gt;Branagan, Mark and Lefebvre, Mike, Bloodstained Angels, The Rise &amp; Fall of the Foreign Legion, 1995, self-published, Melbourne, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; The colorful epithet the âBloodstained Angelsâ was also in use. The âBloodstained Angelsâ epithet proved prophetic when South Melbourne played in the 1945 &quot;Bloodbath&quot; Grand Final against Carlton, a game legendary for its brutal violence which saw many of the Swans' players jumpers stained with their own or the oppositionâs blood (from the book &quot;The Blood Stained Angels&quot;, a history of the South Melbourne Football Club). The 1945 Grand Final saw 10 players reported and suspended for a total of 69 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/day-the-bloodstained-angels-were-born/2006/09/01/1156817102957.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Day the Blood-Stained Angels were born | date=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was based at [[Lake Oval]], also home of the [[South Melbourne Cricket Club]].

===VFA era: 1877â1896===
A junior foundation club of the VFA, South Melbourne played in the [[Victorian Football Association]] from 1877 until 1896. During this period, South Melbourne were particularly successful winning five VFA premierships, including a 'three-in-a-row'. These came in 1881, 1885, and 1888-89-90. South Melbourne were also VFA runners-up in 1880, 1883, 1886 and 1896.

At the end of the 1896 season, [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and South Melbourne finished exactly equal in all respects at the top of the VFA's premiership ladder. This was the first time this had occurred in VFA history. The VFA determined that an elimination match should take place to decide the season's premiership on 3 October 1896 at the [[East Melbourne Cricket Ground]].

Collingwood won the match, six goals to five, in front of an estimated crowd of 29,000. Even though this victory brought Collingwood a premiership, it is uncertain whether the match itself was promoted as a &quot;Premiership Match&quot; or as a &quot;Grand Final&quot; at the time.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed history of the evolution and development of the manner in which the VFA premiers were determined, and finals system used by the early [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL) see [[Early VFL Final systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This Grand Final would be the last match South Melbourne would play in the VFA, as the following season they would be one of eight founding clubs forming the breakaway [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]]. The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].

===VFL entry: 1897â1909 ===
South Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.

===Premiership success: 1909â1945===
The club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including 4 successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933. On Grand Final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, I.W. (2006)''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period that the team became known as the Swans, the nickname having been given courtesy of the number of West Australians in the team (Swans being the state emblem of WA). The name stuck, partially due to the association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its white [[swan]]s (ironically there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).

After several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as &quot;the Bloodbath&quot;, courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.

===Struggling times: 1946â1981===
In the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled as their inner-city recruiting area largely emptied. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall so that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. Though they temporarily bounced back and nearly made the finals in 1952, in the following seventeen years South Melbourne did not finish above eighth position (though in 1953 and 1965 they won as many games as they lost). By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this.

Under the legendary [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finally improved substantially in 1970 with a fourth place. However, having probably the worst [[country zone]] in the league and a poor metropolitan zone meant their 1970 joy was short-lived. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, they lost 29 consecutive games. There was a brief glimmer of hope when South Melbourne made the finals in 1977 finishing 5th under coach Ian Stewart, but losing the Elimination final at [[VFL Park]] to [[Richmond Football Club]] by 34 points. The same year Graeme Teasdale, who had moved from full-forward to the ruck won the [[Brownlow Medal]]. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne had massive debts after struggling for so long and, despite strong supporter opposition, in the early 1980s they were given the &quot;choice&quot; by the VFL of relocation to Sydney or oblivion.

==Sydney history==
===The Swans: 1982â1987===
{| style=&quot;margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; -moz-border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;&quot;

The Swans moved to Sydney (and the SCG) in 1982 as part of the VFL's attempts to broaden its appeal, a move which ultimately culminated in its extension into a national competition, the AFL.

The move to Sydney is the subject of the [[Weddings Parties Anything]] song 'The Swans Return'.

[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]

On 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be $6.3 million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten|Dr. Geoffrey Edelsten]] &quot;bought&quot; the Swans. In reality it was $2.9 million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately snapped up former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelongâs contracts to snap up [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded, and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Greg: Diesel: The Greg Williams Story, page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Greg: Diesel: The Greg Williams Story, page 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field â all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans' successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the 'Swanettes', a cheerleading group that were unique for an AFL club. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the AFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued, and no AFL club has had cheerleaders since then.

In 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]], and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans are the only team to have scored two double-tons (200-plus scores) in a row.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark times: 1988â1994===
The club's form was to slump in the following year.

Losses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willessee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.

Morale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128&lt;/ref&gt; Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).

Capper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the clubâs finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydneyâs goalkicking was led by defender [[Bernard Toohey]] with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] came to an end,&lt;ref&gt;Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]&lt;/ref&gt; while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.

Attendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The side won the wooden spoon in 1992, 1993 and 1994.

The AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] or fold altogether. With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team fielded a competitive team after the early part of the decade. During this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (footballer)|Paul Kelly]].

Desperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.

===Tony Lockett and Grand Final return: 1995â2001===
A big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony &quot;Plugger&quot; Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to pull in larger crowds.

1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won 8 games- as much as they did in the previous three years combined- and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.

Former Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into a competitive force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].

The Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge of. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL Stk}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].

Following the 1998 season, it was revealed the [[Sydney Swans]] had breached the League's salary cap, as punishment, it was banned from the first round of the [[AFL Draft]] for three years between 1999â2001. 1999 was a largely uneventful season for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.

After missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium|Colonial Stadium]].

===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002â2004===
Former Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed coach part-way through the 2002 season after it became obvious that [[Rodney Eade]] was not performing as coach. Eade was punted after Round 12, when Roos took over. He had an immediate impact, winning six of the remaining 10 games that year, and continuing a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow. 2002 saw the Swans return to the first round of the AFL Draft following its three-year ban for breaching the salary cap in 1998. This is believed to have played a factor in Sydney's poor season.

A new home ground in [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people.

Sydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. Though there were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude) which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in the new surrounds and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.

As the new century turned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL Stk}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.

===Premiership glory: 2005===
{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}
{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}

Sydney played the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005 against the [[West Coast Eagles]], defeating them by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

{| style=&quot;margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; -moz-border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;&quot;

In 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL commissioner [[Andrew Demetriou]] for their unorthodox, &quot;boring&quot; defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). The coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent premiership winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.

On Friday, 30 September 2005 a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city. The flag of the Swans also flew on top of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] during the week; the same flag was later given to [[Western Australia|WA]] premier [[Geoff Gallop]] to fly on top of the state legislature in Perth as part of the friendly wager between Gallop and [[New South Wales|NSW]] premier [[Morris Iemma]].

===Grand Final loss: 2006===
{{Main|2006 AFL Grand Final}}

The 2006 AFL Grand Final was contested between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 30 September 2006. The West Coast Eagles avenged their 2005 Grand Final defeat by beating the Sydney Swans by one point, only the fourth one-point Grand Final margin in the competition's history.

The rivalry between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles has become one of the greatest rivalries in VFL/AFL history. The six games between the two sides (from the start of the 2005 finals to the 2006 Grand Final inclusive) were decided by a combined margin of 13 points. Four of those six games were finals.

===Finals goal: 2007â2010===
{{Inappropriate tone|date=August 2010}}
Sydney finished the 2007 home and away season in 7th place, and therefore advanced to the finals, where they met [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] at the MCG in an elimination final. Collingwood were always in control of the match by quarter time, Collingwood were out to a 31 point lead. Collingwood's lead was cut to five points, two minutes into the third quarter, but Collingwood went on to run out convincing winners by 38 points.

This was Sydney's earliest exit since 2002, when they failed to make the finals. The season was seen as somewhat a disappointment, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a 5th consecutive finals campaign. Within the 2007 trade week for the 2008 season premiership winning players such as Jude Bolton, Amon Buchanan and other key players were placed to be traded leading to changes for the Swans 2008 season.

The conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of [[Adam Schneider]] and [[Sean Dempster]] to [[st Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the delisting of [[Simon Phillips (footballer)|Simon Phillips]], Jonathan Simpkin and [[Luke Vogels]], and the gain of [[Henry Playfair]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Martin Mattner]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]].

[[File:Sydney banner honouring Amon Buchanon and Paul Roos.jpg|thumb|A Sydney Swans banner honouring Amon Buchanon's 100th game as a player [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]]' 500th game as player and coach]]

The Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. This earned them a home elimination final against {{AFL Nor}} (its first finals meeting since the [[1996 AFL Grand Final]]) which the Swans won by 35 points. Unfortunately for the Swans their season ended with a disappointing loss to the [[Western Bulldogs]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] the following Friday night.

2009 saw a L-W pattern follow for the first eight rounds before the Swans strung together consecutive wins for the first and only time in round nine when they thrashed [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] at home. This had them at a 5â4 record at the conclusion of round nine, however only three more wins followed and the Swans missed the finals for the first time since 2002. [[Barry Hall]], [[Leo Barry]], [[Jared Crouch]] and [[Michael O'Loughlin]] all left the club at season's end, signalling a new rebuilding period at the Swans.

In the 2009 off-season the Swans did compensate for the losses of those four players by picking up West Coast premiership ruckman [[Mark Seaby]] as well as ex-[[Brisbane Lions]] triple-premiership player [[Daniel Bradshaw]] and {{AFL Gee}} rising ruckman [[Shane Mumford]] who did not play in Geelong's [[2009 AFL Grand Final]] triumph. Only the latter had played more games than Seaby and Bradshaw combined.

The 2010 season started with an eight-point loss to rivals St Kilda before a string of five consecutive wins took the Swans to the top of the ladder for the first time since round 1, 2005 at the conclusion of round six. Unfortunately the Swans would go into freefall, losing their next four games as well as ruckman Mumford for two weeks for an [[National Rugby League|NRL]]-style spear tackle on {{AFL Gee}} superstar [[Gary Ablett, Jr.|Gary Ablett]]. The rot ended with a nine-point win over {{AFL Ess}} followed by a big win over {{AFL Por}} at [[Football Park|AAMI Stadium]], making the Swans two-from-two at the venue in 2010. Losses to {{AFL Col}} and {{AFL Ric}} followed before the Swans had big wins over {{AFL Nor}} and {{AFL Car}}. Round 17 saw the Swans suffer its worst ever loss under Paul Roos with a 73-point hiding from {{AFL Mel}} which was also its first loss against them since 2006 and first against them in Melbourne since the [[2000 AFL season|2000 season]]. Yet another loss to Geelong followed before the Swans comfortably defeated Hawthorn in round 19 at the SCG, maintaining its dominance over Hawthorn at home. This was followed up with a rare win over {{AFL Fre}} at [[Subiaco Oval]], the first win for the Swans over the Dockers at the venue since 1998, and first at the venue since 2008. The following week saw a win over the {{AFL WB}} by 44 points, in what was [[Brett Kirk]] and [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]]' final regular season home game at the SCG (this is subject to whether the Swans gain a home final or not) and it was the Swans' first win over any top four side since defeating St Kilda in round 12, 2008. It also guaranteed the Swans a finals spot for 2010. The Swans wrapped up a home final with victory against the [[Brisbane Lions]] away at [[the Gabba]] where the Swans have enjoyed playing recently, with only two losses in the past eight years.

In the 2010 finals, they defeated {{AFL Car}} by just five points in a sudden death elimination final at [[Stadium Australia|ANZ Stadium]] after the Swans fell behind during the third quarter. The Swans went down to the {{AFL WB}} by 5 points â 11.11 77 to 10.12 72 in a semi final at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]], seeing the culmination of club servants â coach [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] and captain [[Brett Kirk]]'s memorable careers with the Swans.

===Post-Roos era: 2011âpresent===
Sydney has had a reasonable season so far in 2011, registering a draw in the opening round against {{AFL Mel}} before going on to beat {{AFL Ess}} and {{AFL WC}} by 5 and 13 points respectively. However, the Swans would then go on to lose their next two matches, against {{AFL Gee}} and {{AFL Car}} with a bye sandwiched in between, before rebounding with consecutive wins over the {{AFL WB}} and {{AFL Por}}. A huge loss to {{AFL Haw}} by 46 points followed, but the Swans would again rebound with a narrow 1-point victory over bitter rivals {{AFL NM}} in Melbourne, which was followed by a huge win over the {{AFL BL}} in Brisbane where the Swans have only lost twice since 2002. Their good form continued in Round 12 beating {{AFL Ric}} before losses followed in the next three matches, against {{AFL Car}}, {{AFL Col}} and {{AFL Ade}} (whom the Swans have only beaten twice since 2001). An easy win over the {{AFL GC}} at [[Carrara Stadium|Metricon Stadium]] followed in Round 16, to snap a three-game losing streak, before costly losses to {{AFL Fre}} and {{AFL Ess}} saw them tumble to eighth on the ladder and in danger of missing the finals for only the third time since 2000. In Round 23 of the 2011 season, Sydney defied all odds and defeated the Geelong Cats at Skilled Stadium, Geelong's home ground, which had not been achieved by any team in four years. Sydney had not won there in 12 years. This win broke the longest ever home ground winning streak in the history of the AFL. Geelong would then go on to win the premiership.

Sydney qualified for this year's finals finishing 7th. They defeated {{AFL StK}} at [[Docklands Stadium]] by 25 points, but then lost its semi-final showdown against 2008 premiers {{AFL Haw}} at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]].

In recent times the Swans have lacked from quality top draft picks, this is due to them not finishing any lower than 12th since 1994. Unlike teams such as {{AFL WC}}, {{AFL PA}}, {{AFL Mel}} and the [[Brisbane Lions]] who have declined or bottomed out in recent years, the Swans do not bottom out, rather they continue to develop their players to prepare them for the mental and physical demands of Australian rules football. Also, a lack of quality top draft picks is believed to have contributed to their long losing runs against top teams such as {{AFL Col}} (which bottomed out in 2004 and 2005 after making the Grand Final in 2002 and 2003) and {{AFL Gee}} (which bottomed out in 2006 before going on to win the premiership in 2007).

{{Boxbottom}} --&gt;
The jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red &quot;V&quot; on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans.

===Mascot===
[[File:Swans mascot.jpg|thumb|100px|Syd 'Swannie' Skilton, Sydney Swans Mascot Manor mascot]]&lt;br /&gt;
The Sydney Swans mascot for the [[Mascot Manor|AFL's Mascot Manor]] is Syd 'Swannie' Skilton.
He is named after Swans legend [[Bob Skilton]]. The actual mascot at Sydney's home games is, however, still known as ''Cyggy'' (as in [[swan|cygnet]]).

==Supporter base==
As the only AFL club in Sydney, the Swans have a large population base to draw on.
In 2006, following the first premiership in 72 years, the club achieved a record membership and the biggest since 1999. There is still a healthy Melbourne following for the Swans, particularly a revival in the late 1990s. Almost 10,000 Swans members are (South) Melbourne based and the club experiences good support when the team plays in Melbourne and many also make the long trip to Sydney for home games as well. The club recently celebrated in 2007 their 25th anniversary since relocating from [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]], with parties hosted both in Sydney and their former home.

==Rivalries==
===West Coast Eagles===
[[File:Barry Hall.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Barry Hall]] and [[Darren Glass]]]]
The Swans developed arguably their most famous [[AFL team rivalries|modern rivalry]] against the Perth-based [[West Coast Eagles]] between 2005 and 2007. Six consecutive games between the two teams (from the 2005 Qualifying Final to the Round 1 of 2007) were each been decided by less than a goal, resulting in two wins to Sydney and 4 to West Coast (including a Grand Final win each). The difference in aggregate across the six games was three points and the sum of the margins was thirteen points.

In 2005, Sydney lost the Qualifying Final to the Eagles by four points, only to later win the Grand Final by four points against the Eagles. In 2006, the Eagles lost the Qualifying Final to Sydney by one point, only to later win the Grand Final by one point against the Swans. Strangely, the total scores in those two games were also the same, but reversed â 85 d 84.

Below are the results of recent clashes between these rivals:&lt;br&gt;
'''2005 Qualifying Final, Subiaco'''
* West Coast 10.9 (69) beat Sydney 10.5 (65)
'''2005 Grand Final, MCG'''
* Sydney 8.10 (58) beat West Coast 7.12 (54)
'''2006 Round 15, Subiaco'''
* West Coast 9.13 (67) beat Sydney 9.11 (65)
'''2006 Qualifying Final, Subiaco'''
* Sydney 13.7 (85) beat West Coast 12.12 (84)
'''2006 Grand Final, MCG'''
* West Coast 12.13 (85) beat Sydney Swans 12.12 (84)
'''2007, Round 1, Telstra Stadium'''
* West Coast 11.8. (74) beat Sydney Swans 10.13 (73)

This trend was broken when the teams clashed again in Round 16, 2007. The Eagles won the game 112â100, a margin almost as high as the combined total margins of the previous 6 contests between the two teams.

Round 4 2008 saw Sydney 16.11 (107) beat West Coast 5.15 (45) at ANZ Stadium. Although this game wasn't the traditional low scoring heart stopper (Sydney won by 62 points, its biggest win over the Eagles since 2000), it did have its fair share of controversy. Swans player, [[Barry Hall]] knocked out West Coast's [[Brent Staker]], which made headlines worldwide.

However in Round 11 another epic took place at [[Subiaco Oval]] with a thrilling 5-point win to the Swans, with [[Jude Bolton]] kicking the winning goal with just 90 seconds left.

'''2008, Round 11, Subiaco Oval'''
* Sydney Swans 12.11. (83) beat West Coast 11.12 (78)
'''2009, Round 5, ANZ Stadium'''
* Sydney Swans 16.10. (106) beat West Coast 15.11 (101)

Overall of the 40 games played between the two teams Sydney have won 21, lost 19 and drawn 0.

===Brisbane Lions===
[[File:AFL match Brisbane Lions - Sydney Swans.jpg|thumb|Sydney and the Brisbane Lions have built up as strong rivalry, due to the sporting and political rivalry between the two state of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]]]

The Swans share a strong rivalry with the [[Brisbane Lions]], which is based on the ongoing sporting and political rivalry between the two states [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]]. Since the mid-1990s the two sides have played for the Alan Schwab Shield, named after the late AFL administrator who worked to establish the two sides in traditional [[rugby league]] territory. Between them the two clubs have won four of the past eight Premierships.

In recent years, the Swans have dominated the Brisbane Lions, even during the Lions' halycon years. Since 2003, the Swans have won 9 of 12 games against the Lions, plus a draw in 2007. Round 3, 2009 saw the Swans finally fall to the [[Brisbane Lions]] after five years of dominance. The Lions won by 33 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/74784/default.aspx Lions swamp soggy Swans â AFL.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Kilda===
The Swans share a long and storied rivalry with [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] that dates back to the days when South Melbourne played at the [[Lake Oval]] on the other side of Melbourne's [[Albert Park and Lake|Albert Park]] Lake, not far from [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]'s old home ground [[Junction Oval]]. Because the Swans and the Saints used to be towards the bottom of the ladder on a regular basis after the [[Second World War]] up until St Kilda's move away from the [[Junction Oval]], clashes between both sides used to be dubbed &quot;The Lake Premiership&quot;.

Memorable but controversial matches between the two teams included a 8.8 (56) draw in 2002 where the Swans let slip a one-point lead to force a draw, a 36-point win to the Swans in 2004 which ended the Saints' undefeated start to [[2004 AFL season|that season]], a 51-point win for St Kilda in the finals that year, a 43-point thrashing for St Kilda where the Swans' game plan was heavily criticised, and a 31-point win in a controversial preliminary final later that year where Swans captain [[Barry Hall]] appeared to punch Saints defender [[Matt Maguire]] but was let off on a lesser charge.

The trading of [[Adam Schneider]] and Sean Dempster, as well as the team now being coached by the former assistant coach at Sydney, [[Ross Lyon]], plus the fact that ex-Saints [[Barry Hall]], [[Tony Lockett]] and [[Peter Everitt]] had played for the Swans, have led to a much stronger rivalry between the clubs, with matches being dubbed &quot;Ross versus Roos&quot; (from 2007 until 2010) by many commentators. For the record, Ross Lyon leads Paul Roos 5â2 in terms of head-to-head as of 27 March 2010. Sydney took the points in their two clashes in season 2011: first a 15-point win in Sydney in Round 22 and then a more convincing 23-point win in the elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] that not only ended the Saints' season but also handed them their first Saturday night loss at the venue since early 2003 (St Kilda had dominated the Saturday night timeslot at Docklands Stadium for more than eight years leading into the match).

Claims by St Kilda [[CEO]] [[Archie Fraser]] against Craig Bolton, suggesting Bolton had &quot;tunnelled&quot; Saints captain [[Nick Riewoldt]], has led to outrage amongst Swans fans, and has also increased the rivalry between the two clubs.

===North Melbourne===
Stemming back from the [[1996 AFL Grand Final|1996 Grand Final]] loss to [[North Melbourne]], Sydney has established a minor rivalry with the {{AFL Nor}} over recent history. The loss denied the Swans the chance to end the then longest premiership drought. The Swans 23 point lead and apparent winning lead mid-way through the second quarter further fuels the rivalry between the two teams as the Roos ran out eventual 43 point winners. The rivalry was further extended in 2000 when North Melbourne attempted to play &quot;home&quot; games in Sydney to further promote the game of [[Australian rules football]], which was deemed that the Kangaroos were trying to invade Sydney's &quot;territory&quot;. A cumulation of close games, including a goal after the siren win by Daryn Cresswell in 2002, and immense and 100+ point winning margins, ensured the Swans' rivalry was maintained with the Kangaroos in recent years.

A clash in 2008 ended in a controversial draw, Sydney 8.16 (64) â Nth Melbourne 9.10 (64). [[Brett Kirk]] believed he had kicked the winning goal with over a minute remaining but the ball was touched on the line by North's [[Michael Firrito]], ensuring a draw. Had the ball not been touched the Swans would have won by 5 points. Although Sydney had an extra player, [[Darren Jolly]] who was supposed to come off for Jesse White, on the field who was directly involved in the play.

These two teams met in the first week of the [[2008 AFL finals series|2008 finals]], with Sydney running out convincing 35-point winners in front of the lowest ever finals crowd in Sydney, in a rain-affected match. It was their first finals showdown since the [[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Grand Final]] and Sydney's win extracted some revenge for the Grand Final loss 12 years prior. Their only clash in 2009 (Round 14, which the Swans won by 15 points to end a four-game losing streak) was aired into both the [[ATN|Sydney]] and [[BTQ|Brisbane]] markets rather than the live {{AFL Stk}} vs. {{AFL Gee}} match which was a high-rating television match around [[Australia|the rest of the country]].

In 2010 the Swans beat the Kangaroos in [[Melbourne]] for the first time in more than a decade. In the second match, Swans ruckman Mike Pyke had a Goal of the Year contender disallowed as replays showed it had hit the post.

In 2011 the Swans won a thriller at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] by one point. It was the Swans' fifth-straight win over the Kangaroos, dating back to Round 6, 2007.

The Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match.

In 2008 [[Network Ten]] broadcasted all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside of New South Wales live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney. Occasionally, the [[Seven Network]] may broadcast Swans games, mainly on Sunday afternoons, live. Most of their games however are broadcast by Fox Sports.
