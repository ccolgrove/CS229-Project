'''cdrtools''' (formerly known as cdrecord) is a collection of independent projects of [[free software]]/[[Open source software|open source]] computer programs, created by [[JÃ¶rg Schilling]] and others under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

The most important parts of the package are '''cdrecord''', a [[console|console-based]] burning program; '''cdda2wav''', a CD audio ripper that uses [[libparanoia]]; and '''mkisofs''', a CD filesystem image creator. Because these tools don't include any [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], many graphical front-ends have been created (see [[#Software that can use cdrtools|Software that can use cdrtools]] section).

==Features==

The collection includes many features, such as:
* creation of audio, data, and mixed (audio and data) CDs.
* burning [[CD-R]], [[CD-RW]] and [[DVD-R]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+R]] and [[DVD+RW]], both single and [[dual layer]] DVDs.
* several [[Optical disc recording modes|burning modes]], such as [[Optical disc recording modes#CD Track-At-Once|Track-At-Once]] and [[Optical disc recording modes#CD Disc-At-Once|Disc-At-Once]]
* [[cue sheet (computing)|cue sheet]] based writing using the control file format from cdrwin including enhancements for ExactAudioCopy
* ability to process [[Blu-ray Disc]]s
* understanding and exploitation of many vendor specific drive features.

== Licensing ==
The project was originally licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

In versions starting with 2.01.01a09, most code from cdrtools has been relicensed under the [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[Free Software Foundation]] considers [[License compatibility|incompatible]] with the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL),&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#SoftwareLicenses|title=Various Licenses and Comments About Them - Common Development and Distribution License|publisher=Free Software Foundation|accessdate=2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other parts, such as mkisofs, are still licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. Jonathan Corbet, founder of the [[LWN.net]] news source argued this change makes it impossible to legally distribute cdrtools binaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However several lawyers &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosenlaw.com/Rosen_Ch06.pdf Reciprocity and the GPL], Lawrence Rosen, OpenSource Licensing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osscc.net/pdf/QualipsoA1D113.pdf Report on Problem Scope and Definition about OSS License Compatibility], Thomas Gordon for an EU OSS-Project: Licensecompatibility&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~tlavian/publications/article/Berkeley_Law_Journal_softwarecombinations060403.pdf Dangerous Liaisons - Software combinations as Derivative Works?], Lothar Determan&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that combinations with software under GPL and other different licenses usually are ''collective works'', to which the rules in the GPL about ''derivative works'' may not apply.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2008, [[Mark Shuttleworth]] offered to ask the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] for a legal opinion on whether cdrtools could be included in [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], provided Schilling agreed to accept the opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the licensing change, cdrtools added some bug fixes and new features, such as the ability to use [[UTF-8]] with mkisofs, create multi extent files (&gt; 4 GB) with mkisofs, create correct hard links with mkisofs, and write [[Blu-ray]] discs.
