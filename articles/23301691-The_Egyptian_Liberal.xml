== Biography ==
Agha-Soltan was the middle child of a [[middle class]] family of three children,&lt;ref name=&quot;times-booth1&quot; /&gt; whose family resided in a fourth floor flat on Meshkini Street in the [[Tehranpars]] district of Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondent in Tehran (June 24, 2009).

Agha-Soltan was an aspiring, [[underground music|underground]] [[musician]], who was studying her craft through private voice and music lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Women in Iran are legally prohibited from singing in the presence of men; nonetheless, an underground market exists for CDs of such music.

Those who knew her maintain that Agha-Soltan had not previously been very political  â she had not supported any particular candidate in the 2009 Iran elections&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes2009june23&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/13/iran-demonstrations-viole_n_215189.html |title=Iran updates (video): Live-blogging the uprising |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2009 |last=Pitney |first=Nico}}&lt;/ref&gt; â but that anger over the election results prompted her to join the protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-booth1&quot; /&gt; Her [[voice teacher|voice]] and [[music teacher]], Hamid Panahi, who was accompanying Agha-Soltan during the protest and can be seen on the video trying to comfort the dying woman, told the media: &quot;She couldn't stand the injustice of it.&quot; Panahi went on to state: &quot;All she wanted was the proper vote of the people to be counted. She wanted to show with her presence that, 'I'm here, I also voted, and my vote wasn't counted', although her family has stated that she attempted to vote and didn't because no representatives of any other parties than the incumbent were present, &quot;It was a very peaceful act of protest, without any violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;times-booth1&quot; /&gt;

Her name is often miscited as &quot;Neda Soltani&quot;. Neda Soltani is a different woman, whose Facebook profile photo was mistakenly published in many articles about the incident. She tried in vain to remove her photo from the internet. Finally, Neda Soltani had to flee from Iran and was granted asylum in Germany in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} David Schraven, [http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/32571 ''Das zweite Leben der Neda Soltani''], SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, Heft 05/2010.

== Circumstances of her death ==
On June 20, 2009, at around 6:30 p.m., Neda Agha-Soltan was sitting in her [[Peugeot 206]] in traffic on [[Kargar Avenue]] in the city of [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNRally&quot; /&gt; She was accompanied by her music teacher and close friend, Hamid Panahi, and two others, who remain unidentified.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes2009june23&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Daragahi |first=Borzou |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-neda23-2009jun23,0,366975,full.story |title=Family, friends mourn 'Neda,' Iranian woman who died on video |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_0623&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/world/middleeast/23neda.html |title=In a death seen around the world, a symbol of Iranian protests |last=Fathi |first=Nazila |date=June 22, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four were on their way to participate in the protests against the outcome of the [[2009 Iranian presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neda Agha Soltanâs story touches everyone except Iranâs rulers|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6565497.ece|work=The Times|date=2009-06-2004|accessdate=2009-06-2004 | location=London | first=Martin | last=Fletcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car's air conditioner was not working well, so she stopped her car some distance from the main protests and got out on foot to escape the heat. She was standing and observing the sporadic protests in the area when she was shot in the chest.&lt;ref name=&quot;targeted1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8113552.stm |title=Death video woman 'targeted by militia'|date=June 22, 2009|accessdate=June 24, 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As captured on amateur video,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNRally&quot; /&gt; she collapsed to the ground and was tended to by a doctor, her music teacher, and others from the crowd. Someone in the crowd around her shouted, &quot;She has been shot! Someone, come and take her!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who was Neda?

A young woman who was standing aside with her father [sic, later identified as her music teacher] watching the protests was shot by a Basij member hiding on the rooftop of a civilian house. He had clear shot at the girl and could not miss her. However, he aimed straight at her heart. I am a doctor, so I rushed to try to save her. But the impact of the gunshot was so fierce that the bullet had blasted inside the victimâs chest, and she died in less than two minutes. The protests were going on about one kilometre away in the main street and some of the protesting crowd were running from tear gas used among them, towards Salehi St. The film is shot by my friend who was standing beside me.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/2009/06/in-.html |title=In Iran, one woman&amp;nbsp;â Neda&amp;nbsp;â becomes a symbol |date=June 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2009 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |last=DeRoy |first=Glenna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her last words were, &quot;I'm burning, I'm burning!&quot;, according to Panahi.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes2009june23&quot; /&gt;  She died en route to Tehran's Shariati hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-booth1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Neda Agha Soltan |work=[[The Times]] |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2009 |first=Jenny |last=Booth |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6562649.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the civilian physician that tended to Neda in the video has stated that Neda died on the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=C4-iLG6FwRc22|title=Neda : An Iranian Martyr &amp;#91;BBC Documentary&amp;#93;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=mYN53BOeijY|title=HBO The True Story of Neda Agha-Soltan Ø²ÙØ¯Ú¯Ù ÙØ¯Ø§ Ø¢ÙØ§ Ø³ÙØ·Ø§Ù Ø§ÙØ±Ø§Ù}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hejazi, standing one metre away from her when she was shot, tried to stanch her wound with his hands. Hejazi said nearby members of the crowd pulled a man from his motorcycle while shouting: &quot;We got him, we got him,&quot; disarmed him, obtained his identity card and identified him as a member of the [[Basij]] militia (government paramilitary).  The militiaman was shouting, &quot;I didn't want to kill her.&quot; The protesters let him go, but they kept the alleged killer's identity card and took many photographs of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Hejazi&quot;&gt;According to an eye-witness, Dr. Arash Hejazi; see [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8119713.stm News.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; A recent documentary on the shooting contained a previously unseen clip of demonstrators capturing the militiaman seconds after the shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Hejazi&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6917831.ece Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Logically we therefore cannot deduce whether Neda was shot from the rooftop or from the street hence questioning the apparent witness accounts.

{{See also|Role of the Internet during 2009 Iranian election protests}}
[[File:Neda non graphic.jpg|thumb|A frame from the video of Agha-Soltan's death by gunfire]]
The videos spread across the internet [[Viral video|virally]], quickly gaining the attention of international media and viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Langendonck, Gert Van (June 23, 2009). [http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2280315.ece/Iconic_Iran_video_was_posted_in_the_Netherlands Iconic Iran video was posted in the Netherlands]. ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions about the incident on [[Twitter]], using a [[hashtag]] of #neda, became one of the &quot;'trending topics'&quot; by the end of the day on June 20, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNRally&quot; /&gt; The incident was not originally reported by the state-controlled Iranian media, but was instead first reported on by international media. The video has been shown on [[CNN]] and other news networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Youtube - Neda's Death Becomes Iranian Symbol: News Current |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmrB2FOLqiE|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three videos depicting her death. One shows her collapsing to the ground, apparently still conscious.&lt;ref name=&quot;video1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Young girl being killed by plain-clothes |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=0db_1245519048 |publisher=[[LiveLeak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second shows her only after she appears to lose consciousness and begins to bleed heavily.&lt;ref name=&quot;video2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Girl shot by police&amp;nbsp;â Second Angle|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=fe5_1245534854 |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |publisher=[[LiveLeak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third video shows her just as she begins to bleed profusely.&lt;ref name=&quot;video3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran - New Footage of Neda's Death ( Graphic ) - Third Angle|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b1d_1276271267 |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |publisher=[[LiveLeak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first video, the cameraman approaches a group of people huddled together in front of a parked car at the side of the street. As he moves closer, she can be seen collapsing to the pavement with a large bloodstain at her feet. Two men, Hamid Panahi and Arash Hejazi, are seen trying to revive her. The elderly Panahi was initially assumed to be her father, but later confirmed to be her music teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-booth1&quot; /&gt; As seconds pass, her eyes roll to one side and she appears to lose consciousness. Blood begins to pour from her nose and mouth, and screams are heard.&lt;ref name=&quot;video1&quot; /&gt;

In the second video, the cameraman approaches her and the two men; the camera passes over them and centers on her face; her stare is blank and she is bleeding profusely from her nose and mouth. Loud screaming can be heard.&lt;ref name=&quot;video2&quot; /&gt;

The man next to her can apparently be heard speaking in the first video, saying her name:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Neda, don't be afraid. Neda, don't be afraid. [obscured by others yelling] Neda, stay with me. Neda stay with me!&lt;ref name=&quot;video1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The videos were awarded the [[George Polk Award]] for Videography for 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-george-polk-award&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Anonymous video of Neda Aghan-Soltan's death wins Polk award|last=Bunz|first=Mercedes|publisher=[[The Guardian]]: PDA The Digital Content Blog|date=February 16, 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/feb/16/george-polk-awards/ |accessdate=June 13, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caspian Makan (Agha-Soltan's fiancÃ©) told BBC: &quot;Neda had said that even if she lost her life and got a bullet in her heart, she would carry on&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Sheikholeslami |first=Ali |coauthors= Alexander, Caroline |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aHvSY8wNfM_M| title=Nedaâs killing propels Iranâs women to more opposition protests |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and other news sources have speculated that due to the widespread attention given to Agha-Soltan's story by [[social media]] networks and mainstream news organizations, she is already being hailed as a [[martyr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-tait&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_0623&quot; /&gt; There is also speculation that the [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] cycle of [[mourning]] on the third (June 23), seventh (June 27), and 40th (July 30) day after a person's death may give the protests sustained momentum, in similar fashion to the [[Iranian Revolution]], where each commemoration of a demonstrator's death sparked renewed protests, resulting in more deaths, feeding a cycle that eventually resulted in the overthrowing of [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran's monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wright |first=Robin |title=In Iran, one woman's death may have many consequences |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=June 23, 2009 |date=June 21, 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, Iranian presidential candidates [[Mehdi Karroubi]] and [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], who are contesting the validity of the election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], called upon Iranian citizens to commemorate Agha-Soltan.&lt;ref name=&quot;agenzia_giornalistica_italia&quot; /&gt; Karroubi announced his appeal on Facebook, asking demonstrators to gather in the center of the Iranian capital at 4:00 pm local time.&lt;ref name=&quot;agenzia_giornalistica_italia&quot; /&gt; The chief of the Tehran Police announced that his department had no involvement in the fatal incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost.com&quot;&gt;Hendelman-Baavur, Liora (June 25, 2009).

''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, riot police armed with [[live ammunition]] and tear gas dispersed a crowd of between 200 and 1,000 protesters who had gathered in [[Tehran]]'s Haft-e Tir Square.

=== Funeral ===
About 70 mourners gathered outside Niloufar mosque in [[Abbas Abad]], where the Agha-Soltan family attended services. A leaflet posted on the mosque's door read, &quot;There is no commemoration here for Neda Agha Soltan.&quot; Many in the crowd wore black. Some recited poems. After about ten minutes, 20 Basij paramilitary arrived on motorcycles and dispersed the attendees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/06/the-world-mourns-neda.html Political Punch]; ABC News, 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported the results of interviews of neighbours who said Agha-Soltan's family had been forced to vacate their apartment some days after her death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Neda Soltan's family 'forced out of home' by Iranian authorities|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=June 24, 2009|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/24/neda-soltan-iran-family-forced-out | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reuters]] reported that supporters of presidential candidate [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] stated they would release thousands of balloons on Friday, June 26, 2009 with the message &quot;Neda you will always remain in our hearts&quot; imprinted on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE55F54520090625?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews Reuters: ''Ahmadinejad compares Obama to Bush''.

On June 23, it was reported that, to prevent Agha-Soltan's family's home from becoming a place of pilgrimage, government authorities told the family to remove the black mourning banners from outside the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;times-booth2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Iranian authorities scramble to negate Neda Soltan 'martyrdom'|work=[[The Times]]|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=June 24, 2009|first=Jenny|last=Booth|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6561253.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, July 31, 2009, 40th day anniversary of the killings of such youth as Neda Agha Soltan, [[Sohrab Aarabi]] and Ashkan Sohrabi was held in Tehran where thousands of Iranians mourned for the loss of the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran witnesses: Neda memorial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8176961.stm|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2010|work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports also came of gatherings in the thousands in cities of [[Rasht]], [[Shiraz]] and Mashad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IRAN: Footage emerges from demonstrations across the country|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2009/07/iran-footage-emerges-from-demonstrations-across-the-country.html|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=December 7, 2010|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Smith|first=Amber|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desecration of her grave===
[[File:Graveyard.jpg|thumb|photo by Arash Nikkhah 2011]]
On November 16, 2009, supporters of the Iranian regime desecrated her grave and removed her gravestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Hejazi&quot;/&gt; Later, on December 31, 2009, supporters of the Iranian Government defaced the portrait on her grave by shooting at it multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6979914.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Neda Soltans grave defaced as Iran issues new internet restrictions | first=Martin | last=Fletcher | date=January 8, 2010 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iranian government reactions===
The university branch of female members of [[Basij]] held a gathering in Tehran in front of the British embassy, demanding that [[Arash Hejazi]] be returned to Iran (as witness or suspect). As they are assumed to be close to the government, it means the government condemns the crime and is pursuing it (their way). According to an Iranian official, announcing her as a martyr is possible. Iran's ambassador to [[Mexico]], Mohammad Hassan Ghadiri, suggested in an interview on June 25, 2009 that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] could have been involved in Agha-Soltan's death. Ambassador Ghadiri questioned how the shooting was video taped so effectively, asserting that the incident occurred away from other demonstrations. He also stated that using a woman would be more effective in accomplishing the goals the CIA is purported to desire.&lt;ref&gt;Malcom, Andrew (June 25, 2009).

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador Ghadiri said &quot;the bullet that was found in her head was not a bullet that you could find in Iran&quot; (he thought she was shot in head). The account of Doctor Hejazi was that Agha-Soltan was shot in the chest from the front, as there was no exit wound, and the video evidence showing a wound to the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Iran doctor tells of Neda's death | work = BBC | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | date = 2009-06-25 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8119713.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hejazi is the man seen in the video placing his hands on Agha-Soltan's chest to staunch her bleeding (as described above under section [[#Circumstances of death|Circumstances of death]]).

During his Friday sermon on June 26, the [[Ali Khamenei|Supreme Leader]]'s appointed speaker Ayatollah [[Ahmad Khatami]] said &quot;evidence shows that [protesters] have done it themselves and have raised propaganda against the system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Erdbrink | first = Thomas | coauthors = William Branigin | title = Iranian cleric says protesters wage war against God | work = The Boston Globe | accessdate = 2009-07-02 | date = 2009-06-27 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2009/06/27/iranian_cleric_says_protesters_wage_war_against_god/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eye witnesses at the scene of the shooting said Agha-Soltan was shot by a member of the pro-government [[Basij]] militia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8113552.stm Death video woman 'targeted by militia'].

Iran's police chief, brigadier general Ahmadi-Moghaddam told the press on June 30, 2009 that the Iranian police and [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Ministry of Intelligence]] filed an arrest warrant for [[Interpol]] to arrest Dr. Arash Hejazi, an eyewitness of Neda's death, for poisoning the international atmosphere against the Iranian government and telling misinformation about Neda's death by giving his account of the incident to foreign news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/2009/07/090701_ka_ir88_hejazi_ahmadimoghadam.shtml| title=ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙØ¯Ù ÙÛØ±ÙÛ Ø§ÙØªØ¸Ø§ÙÛ: Ø´Ø§ÙØ¯ ÙØ±Ú¯ ÙØ¯Ø§ ØªØ­Øª ØªØ¹ÙÛØ¨ ÙØ²Ø§Ø±Øª Ø§Ø·ÙØ§Ø¹Ø§Øª Ù Ù¾ÙÛØ³ Ø¨ÛÙ Ø§ÙÙÙÙ Ø§Ø³Øª| language=[[Persian language|Persian]]| publisher=[[BBC Persian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezzatollah Zarghami]], the head of [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]], told the press on July 4, 2009 that the videos of Neda's death were all made by [[BBC]] and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://tabannews.net/totla.php?id=4642|title= Ø¶Ø±ØºØ§ÙÛ: Ø¯Ø± Ø§ÙØªØ®Ø§Ø¨Ø§Øª ÙÙØ²ÙØ¦ÙØ§ ÙÙ ÛÚ© ÙÙØ± ÙØ«Ù &quot;ÙØ¯Ø§&quot; Ø±Ø§ Ú©Ø´ØªÙØ¯!| language=[[Persian language|Persian]]| publisher=Taban News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.iranuk88.com/article.php?id=39219|title=  Ø§Ø¯Ø¹Ø§Ù Ø¹Ø¬ÙØ¨ Ø¶Ø±ØºØ§ÙÙ: ØªØµÙÙØ± ÙØªÙ ÙØ¯Ø§ Ø¢ÙØ§Ø³ÙØ·Ø§Ù Ø³Ø§Ø®ØªÚ¯Ù Ø§Ø³Øª| language=[[Persian language|Persian]]| publisher=Iranian Uk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.ayandenews.com/fa/pages/?cid=9643|title=  Ø¶Ø±ØºØ§ÙÛ:Ø¯Ø± ÙÙØ²ÙØ¦ÙØ§ ÙÙ ÙØ¯Ø§ Ú©Ø´ØªÙØ¯ ØªØ§ Ø¨Ú¯ÙÛÙØ¯ Ø±Ø§Û ÚØ§ÙØ² ÙÙ Ø³Ø§Ø®ØªÚ¯Û Ø§Ø³Øª| language=[[Persian language|Persian]]| publisher=Ayandenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Iran's embassy in London sent a letter of protest to [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] about the college establishing the [[Neda Agha-Soltan Graduate Scholarship]] in Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g6AZA1tCAKUr-s6fNAG9gfKpZMkwD9BTGBP03 | title=Iran condemns Oxford for honoring slain protester | author=Ali Akbar Dareini | publisher=Associated Press | date=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Iranian state television aired a report about Agha-Soltan's death, portraying it as a western plot. The program argued that Agha-Soltan simulated her death with accomplices, and that she was killed afterwards, having no knowledge of her partners' intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Shp7HE2YA_c|title=Nedas Death - The other Side of the Coin,''Press TV''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Claims of forced confessions====
According to The Times, quoted from Mr. Makan and Ms. Agha Soltan's parents, officials tried to get them to confess that it was opposition protestors that had killed Neda, and not government militiamen. They were given incentives such as declaring Neda to be a martyr and giving the family a pension if they complied. Mr. Makan and Neda's family refused the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times Hejazi&quot;/&gt;

Mr. Panahi was later forced by the government to change his story. The new version of events were retold by Panahi on state television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/deathintehran/view/ A Death in Tehran], at PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to the Iranian government====
In December 2009, her family accused the security forces of killing her. This was the strongest statement the family of Neda Agha-Soltan made since her death. This accusation followed the spread of an Iranian government-proposed theory blaming a ''&quot;conspiracy of western governments&quot;'' for the killing. ''&quot;I openly declare that no one, apart from the government, killed Neda. Her killer can only be from the government,&quot;'' her father told the BBC's Persian service by telephone from Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8396052.stm &quot;Neda Agha-Soltan's family accuse Iran of her killing&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxford Graduate Scholarship===
{{Main|Neda Agha-Soltan Graduate Scholarship}}
The Neda Agha-Soltan Graduate Scholarship is a [[scholarship]] for post-graduate philosophy students at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], with preference given to students of [[Iran]]ian citizenship or heritage.  The college received offers from two anonymous donors to establish a scholarship, followed by many individual donations from members of the public and former students of Queen's.  The college aims to raise Â£65,000 to establish the scholarship on a permanent basis.  The first recipient of the scholarship is Arianne Shahvis, a philosophy student of Iranian descent, who described the award as &quot;a great honour&quot;.
