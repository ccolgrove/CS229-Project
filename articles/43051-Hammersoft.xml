'''Lehigh University''' is a [[private university|private]], co-educational university located in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of the United States. It was established in 1865 by [[Asa Packer]] as a four-year [[technical school]], but has grown to include studies in a wide variety of disciplines. As of 2010, the university comprises 4,781 undergraduate students, 2,270 [[graduate student]]s, 666 professors, and a staff of 1,255.&lt;ref name=&quot;lufacts&quot;/&gt;

The university has four [[college]]s: the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business and Economics, and the College of Education. While the College of Arts and Sciences is the largest college today, home to roughly 40% percent of the university's students,&lt;ref name=&quot;class_summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.lehigh.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/pdf/admissions/LUadmissions_class_summary.pdf |title=Class Summary |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the university is historically known for engineering&lt;ref name=&quot;academicinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academicinfo.net/online-schools/lehigh-university#box-1 |title=Introduction to Lehigh University |publisher=Academicinfo.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and business. The university offers a variety of degrees, including [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]], [[Master of Science]], [[Master of Business Administration]], [[Master of Engineering]], [[Master of Education]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy]].

==History==
[[Image:Asa Packer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Asa Packer]]]]
{{Main|Lehigh University History}}
[[Asa Packer]] named his university 'Lehigh' after his other passion, [[Lehigh Valley Railroad|the railroad]], despite suggestions from some to call it 'Packer University'. It was founded to provide a well-rounded education for young men, combining a [[Liberal arts|liberal]] and [[scientific]] education with the technical skills necessary to increase the prosperity of the region. According to [[William Bacon Stevens]], the first president of the board of trustees, Asa Packer's founding gift of $500,000 was the largest single endowment for a literary institution at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

From 1871 to 1891, Packer's endowment allowed the institution to offer its education free of charge by competitive exam.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Yates | first = W. Ross | title = An Institution is Born, A Tradition Begins | publisher = Lehigh University | url = http://www3.lehigh.edu/about/past/luhistory.asp | accessdate = August 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, plus its blend of engineering and liberal arts, attracted some of the nation's brightest students, many of whom went on to distinguished careers in industry and engineering.

Unlike other engineering schools of the day, Lehigh was envisioned as a university instead of an &quot;institute of technology,&quot; offering an education that was rooted in both scientific and classical traditions as espoused by [[Comenius|John Amos Comenius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; Initially there were five schools: four scientific (civil engineering, mechanical engineering, mining and metallurgy, and analytical chemistry) and one of general literature. Over time, additional areas of the arts and sciences were added and engineering curricula were both merged and expanded.

The stock market crash accompanying the [[Panic of 1893]] was a major financial blow to the university, since its endowment was largely invested in stocks, particularly shares of [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] donated by the founder.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; As a consequence, Lehigh decided to drop its [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] affiliation in 1897, allowing it to qualify for state and federal government aid.

Based on the experience of Lehigh engineers who went into industry&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;&gt;Plotnicki, Rita M., ''Looking Back: A Lehigh Scrapbook,'' Lehigh University, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; a College of Business &amp; Economics was added in 1910. Lehigh's business curriculum was unique&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt; in that it combined both the abstract emphasis on Economics seen in the [[Ivy League]] with the practical skills of management seen in more common business administration degrees given by other universities.

A similar emphasis on the well-rounded graduate can be seen in Lehigh's approach to education degrees. Lehigh's respected School of Education started as (and remains) a solely graduate-level program. This is based&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt; on the principle that you need to learn primary subject matter well before you can learn how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five year program earning both a Bachelors Degree in a specialized field and a Masters Degree in Education.

===The Clery Act===
{{Main|Clery Act}}
On April 5, 1986, a 19-year-old Lehigh freshman was raped and murdered in her dorm room; the culprit was later sentenced to death. The backlash against unreported crimes on numerous campuses across the country led to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires that colleges reveal information regarding crime on their campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross |first=Ken |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116872,00.html |title=After Their Daughter Is Murdered at College, Her Grieving Parents Mount a Crusade for Campus Safety |publisher=People.com |date=1990-02-19 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=271&amp;Itemid=60 |title=Complying With The Jeanne Clery Act |publisher=Securityoncampus.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrestling===
The most storied athletic program at Lehigh is its wrestling team. Over the past several decades it has turned out several All-Americans and had numerous squads finish with Top 20 NCAA national rankings. Under coach Greg Strobel, recent teams have dominated the [[EIWA]] league. On April 15, 2008, the athletic department announced the hiring of former assistant coach and two-time national champion [[Pat Santoro]] as Lehigh's next head coach.

===&quot;The Rivalry&quot;===
{{Main|Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)}}
Lehigh University is notable for its rivalry in sports and academics with nearby [[Lafayette College]]. Since 1884, the two football teams have met 146 times, making [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|&quot;The Rivalry&quot;]] the most played in the history of college football. It is also the longest uninterrupted rivalry in college football, with the teams playing at least once every year since 1897. The Rivalry is considered one of the best in all of college athletics and [[ESPNU]] recently ranked The Rivalry #8 in their Top Ten College Football Rivalries. This game is sold out long before gameday each year.

==Greek life==
{{Prose|section|date=September 2010}}
Nearly all of Lehigh's fraternities and sororities have their own houses which are owned by the university; most of the fraternities and sororities are located on the &quot;Hill&quot; along Upper and Lower Sayre Park Roads. Approximately 34% of undergraduates are members of a Greek organization.  There are currently 22 fraternities, 16 of which are on campus, and 10 sororities, 9 of which are on campus: &lt;ref name=&quot;greek-life&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.lehigh.edu/greekheritage/index.cfm |title=List of all Greek Life at Lehigh |publisher=.lehigh.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spirit and traditions==
Lehigh students have several lasting traditions: Lehigh's school colors, brown and white, date back to 1874, and the school newspaper of the same name was first published in 1894.

Following the death of Asa Packer in May 1879, the University established &quot;Founder's Day&quot; to be held in October  to remember and recognize those have contributed to the success of the University. The event remains an annual tradition.

Freshmen are traditionally inducted into the University in a convocation in the [[Zoellner Arts Center]] and welcomed at a Freshman-Alumni Rally where their class flag is given to them by the class from fifty years before.

Until the 1970s, freshmen wore small brown hats with their class numbers called &quot;dinks&quot; from the beginning of the fall semester until the Lafayette football game. The week leading up to the big game was full of festivities created to unite the students and fuel spirit. In one of these events, &quot;The Pajama Parade,&quot; the freshmen were led across the penny toll bridge in their pajamas singing &quot;We Pay No Tolls Tonight&quot; to the [[Moravian College]] dormitories where they would serenade the women. The week before the game still involves decoration of the Greek houses, a bonfire, parties, rallies and the Marching 97 performing unexpectedly during classes the Friday before the game.

While the riots to rip down the goal posts in Taylor Stadium are a thing of the past, many alumni return for the Lafayette game (which is usually sold out three months in advance) to root Lehigh on, to attend parties at their former fraternities and sororities, and to see old friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt;

===Beirut===
{{Main|Beer pong}}
Lehigh University is credited with coining the phrase &quot;Beirut&quot; to represent the popular drinking game Beer pong. The name most likely originated from the 1982 Lebanon War. At Lehigh University, Beer Pong is considered to be the drinking game played with paddles and Beirut is the more common version of throwing a ping pong ball into a cup. There are myriad rules utilized across Lehigh's campus, with the most prevalent rule being &quot;house rules&quot;. Each fraternity has their own style of game play. Another difference between the game played at Lehigh compared to other schools is that at Lehigh the common cup used is a plastic 9oz cup versus the classic Solo cup seen elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbeirut.com/history.aspx |title=National Beirut Leagueâ¢ - Up the Stakes. Play for Real |publisher=Playbeirut.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
The 2008 edition of ''Best Colleges'' from ''US News &amp; World Report'''s ranked Lehigh as &quot;Most Selective&quot; in admissions and 31st in the &quot;National Universities (Doctoral)&quot; category. It ranked as follows among the 126 top-tier universities:&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot;/&gt;
