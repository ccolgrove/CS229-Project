'''WFME''' is a radio station on 94.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] licensed to [[Newark, New Jersey]] that serves the [[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|New York metropolitan area]] with [[Christian]] education, music and fellowship.  It is owned by [[Family Radio]], a [[non-profit]] organization based in [[Oakland, California]].  The studio, office and transmitter is located in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], and is shared with sister station [[WFME-TV]] (channel 66).

WFME's programming is also heard on two [[broadcast translator|translator stations]]: '''W213AC''' (90.5 FM) in [[Hyde Park, New York]]; and '''W247AE''' (97.3 FM) in [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania]].

==History==
The 94.7 FM frequency signed on in 1947 as '''WAAT-FM''', and was owned by the Bremer Broadcasting Company along with sister station WAAT (970 AM, now [[WNYM]]).  The following year Bremer launched a television station, WATV on channel 13, New Jersey's first TV outlet.  In 1958 the three stations were sold by Bremer to [[National Telefilm Associates]], who changed the operation's call letters to '''WNTA-FM'''.  During this period, the station had diversified programming such as [[jazz music|jazz]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[easy listening]] music.

National Telefilm split up its holdings in 1962, with WNTA-TV (now [[WNET]]) being sold to a New York City-based nonprofit educational group, and the WNTA radio stations going to Communications Industries Broadcasting.  The new owners changed the calls to '''WJRZ-FM''' and initially retained the station's previous format, but in 1964 began leasing airtime to Family Radio.  In 1965, the station was renamed to its current '''WFME''', and in 1966 Family Radio bought 94.7 FM outright and began airing its religious programming around-the-clock.

In the present-day, WFME's local programming consists of community announcements; weekend public affairs; and news, weather and traffic inserts during Family Radio's ''Rise and Rejoice'' morning show.  WFME originates a portion of the network's overnight program ''Nightwatch'', hosted by station manager/chief engineer Charlie Menut.  The rest of the station's schedule, such as the [[Harold Camping]]-hosted ''Open Forum'', originates from Family Radio headquarters in Oakland.

Call Sign Origin: Karen Johnson at Family Stations headquarters in an email dated June 28, 2000, says the call letters stand for &quot;Where Faith Means Everything&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
