<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="15134939" ns="0" title="September 11 attacks advance-knowledge debate"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''9/11 advance-knowledge debate''' is the ensemble of discussions about whether institutions or individuals other than the perpetrators had foreknowledge of the [[September 11 attacks]] and should have taken action to try to prevent them.

Some of the issues under debate include whether the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] or military knew about the threat of planes being used as missiles; how much the intelligence agencies knew about al-Qaeda activities inside the United States; whether the [[put options]] placed on [[United Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]] and other trades indicate foreknowledge, and why the identities of the traders have never been made public.

Also under question is whether the warnings received from foreign countries were specific enough to have warranted action; whether [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] information gathered about imminent al Qaeda attacks was specific enough to have warranted action; the extent to which the alleged hijackers were under surveillance prior to the attacks; and whether agents of the [[Mossad]] or the [[Pakistan]]i [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] were aware that the attacks were going to take place.

==Using planes as missiles==
{{See also|United States government operations and exercises on September 11, 2001}}

Immediately following the attacks, President [[George W. Bush]] stated that &quot;nobody in our government at least, and I don't the think the prior government, could envisage flying air planes into buildings&quot; and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] claimed no-one &quot;could have predicted that they would try to use an airplane as a missile&quot;. An Air Force general called the attack &quot;something we had never seen before, something we had never even thought of.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20021208092449/http://www.publicedcenter.org/faaterrorist.htm The Public Education Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the attacks, FBI Director [[Robert Mueller]] announced &quot;there were no warning signs that I'm aware of that would indicate this type of operation in the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Some mainstream media reports have conflicted with these statements, claiming that the FBI, CIA and Executive Branch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/17/attack/main509471.shtml |title=99 Report Warned Of Suicide Hijacking |work=USA TODAY |date=May 17, 2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt; knew of the threat of planes being used as missiles as early as 1995, following the foiling of the [[Bojinka Plot]]. The [[Chicago Sun-Times]] reported that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The FBI had advance indications of plans to hijack U.S. airliners and use them as weapons, but neither acted on them nor distributed the intelligence to local police agencies. From the moment of the September 11 attacks, high-ranking federal officials insisted that the terroristsâ method of operation surprised them. Many stick to that story. Actually, elements of the hijacking plan were known to the FBI as early as 1995 and, if coupled with current information, might have uncovered the plot.â&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book ''[[The Terror Timeline]]'' includes numerous articles that are often cited to suggest that the method of flying planes into buildings was known by U.S. officials:&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;complete_911_timeline_key_events=complete_911_timeline_key_warnings Complete 911 Timeline: Key Warnings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1994, there were three examples of failed attempts to deliberately crash planes into buildings, including one where a lone pilot crashed a small plane into the lawn of the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamonitors.net/mosaddeq36.html#_Toc9410686 Did Bush Know? :: Warning Signs of 9-11 and Intelligence Failures :: (by Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed) - Media Monitors Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[The Bojinka Plot]] was a foiled large-scale al Qaeda terrorist attack to blow up eleven [[airliners]] and their passengers as they flew from Asia to America, due to take place in January 1995.
*The 2000 edition of the FAAâs annual report on Criminal Acts Against Aviation said that although Osama bin Laden âis not known to have attacked civil aviation, he has both the motivation and the wherewithal to do so,â adding, âBin Ladenâs anti-Western and anti-American attitudes make him and his followers a significant threat to civil aviation, particularly to U.S. civil aviation.ââ
*In April 2001, NORAD ran a war game in which the Pentagon was to become incapacitated; a NORAD planner proposed the simulated crash of a hijacked foreign commercial airliner into the Pentagon but the Joints Chiefs of Staff rejected that scenario as &quot;too unrealistic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/libertystrikesback/lead-up.html] Charles Aldinger, &quot;Pentagon crash scenario rejected before Sept. 2001&quot;, Reuters, April 14, 2004.

*In July 2001 at the [[G8 summit]] in [[Genoa]], anti-aircraft missile batteries were installed following a report that terrorists would try to crash a plane to kill George Bush and other world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;LA Times.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the morning of September 11, 2001, the [[National Reconnaissance Office]], who are responsible for operating U.S. reconnaissance satellites, had scheduled an exercise simulating the crashing of an aircraft into their building, four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].&lt;ref name=boston.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/sept11/anniversary/wire_stories/0903_plane_exercise.htm|title=Agency planned exercise on Sept. 11 built around a plane crashing into a building |first=John |last=Lumpkin |year=2002 |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 ''[[USA Today]]'' article, &quot;NORAD had drills of jets as weapons&quot;, describes pre-9/11 NORAD drills that suggest they were prepared for such an attack as happened on 9/11:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;In the two years before the September 11 attacks, the North American Aerospace Defense Command conducted exercises simulating what the White House says was unimaginable at the time: hijacked airliners used as weapons to crash into targets and cause mass casualties. One of the imagined targets was the World Trade Center. In another exercise, jets performed a mock shootdown over the Atlantic Ocean of a jet supposedly laden with chemical poisons headed toward a target in the United States. In a third scenario, the target was the Pentagon â but that drill was not run after Defense officials said it was unrealistic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-04-18-norad_x.htm NORAD had drills of jets as weapons] By Steven Komarow and Tom Squitieri, USA TODAY. Retrieved 2010-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That NORAD was aware of the threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States, and using them as guided missiles, was flatly denied by the 9/11 Commission, which asserted several times in their report that &quot;The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United States -- and using them as guided missiles -- was not recognized by [[NORAD]] before 9/11.&quot;

The [[Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001|Joint Inquiry of 2002]] confirmed that the [[Intelligence Community]] had received at least twelve reports over a seven-year period suggesting that terrorists might use planes as weapons. After briefly discussing each of them, it says that &quot;The CIA disseminated several of these reports to the FBI and to agencies responsible for preventive actions. They included the FAA... Despite these reports, the Intelligence Community did not produce any assessments of the likelihood that terrorists would use planes as weapons, and U.S. policymakers apparently remained unaware of this kind of potential threat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/911rpt/ part 2, pp. 209, 212].&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Sandy Berger]] testified to the Joint Inquiry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We heard of the idea of planes as weapons, but I don't recall being presented with any specific threat information about an attack of this nature, or highlighting this threat, or indicating it was more likely than any other&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/911rpt/ part 2, p. 212].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of airliners as weapons had been broadly{{Peacock term|date=September 2011}} popularized in the 1994 [[Tom Clancy]] novel ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' and the 1996 [[Kurt Russell]] movie [[Executive Decision]], with stories in both cases having [[Boeing 747|747]]s used as weapons targeted against Washington, D.C.{{Citation needed|reason=even if we establish those are plot elements, we would need a source for the connection.

In a statement to the [[9/11 Commission]] in 2003, [[Mindy Kleinberg]], of the [[9/11 Family Steering Committee]], said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Never before on the Chicago Exchange were such large amounts of United and American Airlines options traded. These investors netted a profit of at least $5&amp;nbsp;million after the September 11 attacks. Interestingly, the names of the investors remain undisclosed and the $5&amp;nbsp;million remains unclaimed in the Chicago Exchange account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9-11commission.gov/hearings/hearing1/witness_kleinberg.htm Statement of Mindy Kleinberg to the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States] March 31, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding these trades, the 9/11 Commission found no malfeasance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95% of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10... much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, that recommended these trades.&lt;ref&gt;page 51 of the [http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Notes.pdf Commission Report], PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[9/11 Truth Movement]] members [[Jim Hoffman]], [[Michael Ruppert]] and [[David Ray Griffin]] are among those who criticize the 9/11 Commission for using a [[circular argument]] in concluding that the trades were innocuous primarily because there were no ties to [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://911research.wtc7.net/sept11/stockputs.html Insider Trading: Pre-9/11 Put Options on Companies Hurt by Attack Indicates Foreknowledge] January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/12_06_01_death_profits_pt1.html Profits of Death - Insider Trading and 9-11] December 6, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Ray Griffin |title= The 9/11 Commission Report: A 571-page Lie |url=http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20050523112738404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruppert also claims that the intelligence agencies constantly monitor the stock exchange and should have &quot;connected the dots&quot; to realize that an event was about to take place involving American Airlines, United Airlines, and the World Trade Center.

'''''WTC hard drive restoration operation'''''

In December 2001 and early 2002, there was extensive media coverage of the efforts by the German data retrieval company Convar to reconstruct, using laser scanning technology, data from damaged hard drives recovered from the WTC as part of the investigation into a surge in financial transactions just before the two hijacked planes crashed into New York's World Trade Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=December 20, 2001
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company's CEO, Peter Henschel, noting that the investigation was being conducted for a number of U.S. based clients cooperating with the FBI, said that there was suspicion that criminals had used inside knowledge about the attacks to make and authorize financial transactions during the chaos. According to Convar's data retrieval expert Richard Wagner, criminal transactions in excess of 100 million dollars could have been made in the hope that their trail would have disappeared as a result of the destruction of the WTC mainframe computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As reported by the ''Heute Journal'', a news programme by the German ZDF TV channel, by March 2002 Convar had been able to restore several hundred hard drives from the WTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

However, the 9/11 Commission, in a memorandum entitled &quot;FBI Briefing on Trading&quot; dated October 18, 2003, said that when asked about the media coverage of the hard drive restoration operation, the &quot;assembled [FBI] agents expressed no knowledge of the reported hard-drive recovery effort&quot;, further noting that one New York agent argued that it was &quot;extremely unlikely that any hard-drives survived to the extent that they data [sic] be recovered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Later research'''''

The papers of several finance researchers also suggest that some profited from foreknowledge of 9/11. In 2006, Allen Poteshman, a professor of Finance from the University of Illinois, published an analysis of the airline stock option trades preceding the attacks. This peer-reviewed study, published by the University of Chicago Press, came to the conclusion that an indicator of long put volume was &quot;unusually high which is consistent with informed investors having traded in the option market in advance of the attacks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In January 2010, a team of Swiss financial experts published evidence for at least thirteen informed trades in which the investors had apparent foreknowledge of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Finally, in April 2010, an international team of experts showed that there was a significant abnormal increase in trading volume in the option market just before the 9/11 attacks in contrast to the absence of abnormal trading volume over periods long before the attacks, concluding that their findings were &quot;consistent with insiders anticipating the 9-11 attacks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Intelligence warnings==
The [[9/11 Commission Report]] states that &quot;the 9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise. Islamic extremists had given plenty of warnings that they meant to kill Americans indiscriminately and in large numbers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;9/11 Commission Report Executive Summary, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Report continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;During the spring and summer of 2001, U.S. intelligence agencies received a stream of warnings about an attack al Qaeda planned, as one report puts it &quot;something very, very, very big.&quot; Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet told us &quot;the system was blinking red.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;9/11 Commission Report Executive Summary, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The US administration, CIA and FBI received multiple prior warnings from foreign governments and intelligence services, including France, Germany, the UK, Israel, Jordan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Morocco and Russia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,53065,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Clues Alerted White House to Potential Attacks | first=Carl | last=Cameron | date=May 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The warnings varied in their level of detail, but all stated that they believed an [[Al Qaeda]] attack inside the United States was imminent. British Member of Parliament Michael Meacher cites these warnings, suggesting that some of them must have been deliberately ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Meacher |first = Michael |authorlink = Michael Meacher |url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/comment/0,12956,1036687,00.html |title = This war on terrorism is bogus |work = The Guardian Unlimited - Comment |publisher = Guardian Newspapers Limited |accessdate = June 11, 2006 | location=London | date=September 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these warnings include the following:

*March 2001 - Italian intelligence warns of an al Qaeda plot in the United States involving a massive strike involving aircraft, based on their wiretap of al Qaeda cell in Milan.
*July 2001 - [[Jordan]]ian intelligence told US officials that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on American soil, and [[Egypt]]ian intelligence warned the CIA that 20 al Qaeda Jihadists were in the United States, and that four of them were receiving flight training.
*August 2001 - The [[Israel]]i Mossad gives the CIA a list of 19 terrorists living in the US and say that they appear to be planning to carry out an attack in the near future.
*August 2001 - The [[United Kingdom]] is warned three times of an imminent al Qaeda attack in the United States, the third specifying multiple airplane hijackings. According to the Sunday Herald, the report is passed on to President Bush a short time later.
*September 2001 - Egyptian intelligence warns American officials that al Qaeda is in the advanced stages of executing a significant operation against an American target, probably within the US.

In her testimony to the 9/11 Commission, [[Condoleezza Rice]] stated that &quot;the threat reporting that we received in the spring and summer of 2001 was not specific as to time nor place nor manner of attack. Almost all the reports focused on al Qaeda activities outside the United States.&quot; However, on August 6, 2001, the [[President's Daily Briefing]], entitled ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]'' warned that bin Laden was planning to exploit his operatives' access to the U.S. to mount a terrorist strike:
&lt;blockquote&gt;FBI information... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country, consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attack.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rice responded, when being asked about the PDB at the Commission hearings, that &quot;it wasn't something that we felt we needed to ''do'' anything about&quot;.

===Able Danger===
{{Main|Able Danger}}

A classified military intelligence program known as &quot;Able Danger&quot; was created in October 1999 specifically targeting al Qaeda. [[Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer]] and Congressman [[Curt Weldon]] (R-PA) charged before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] that Able Danger had identified [[Mohamed Atta]], and three of the other hijackers, prior to 9/11.

The existence of Able Danger, and its purported early identification of the 9/11 terrorists, was first disclosed publicly on June 19, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;kp050619&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Keith |last = Phucas |url = http://www.timesherald.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=14720231&amp;BRD=1672&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=33380&amp;rfi=8 |title = Missed chance on way to 9/11 |work = The Times Herald |publisher = Shelley Meenan |date = June 19, 2005 |accessdate = August 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 2005, Weldon stated to the House:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Speaker, I rise because information has come to my attention over the past several months that is very disturbing. I have learned that, in fact, one of our Federal agencies had, in fact, identified the major New York cell of [[Mohamed Atta al-Sayed|Mohamed Atta]] prior to 9/11; and I have learned, Mr. Speaker, that in September 2000, that Federal agency actually was prepared to bring the [[FBI]] in and prepared to work with the FBI to take down the cell that Mohamed Atta was involved in &lt;!-- obfuscate against &quot;fixing&quot; by double-word bots and AWB --&gt; in New York City, along with two of the other terrorists. I have also learned, Mr. Speaker, that when that recommendation was discussed within that Federal agency, the lawyers in the administration at that time said, you cannot pursue contact with the FBI against that cell. Mohamed Atta is in the U.S. on a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]], and we are fearful of the fallout from the [[Waco Siege|Waco incident]]. So we did not allow that Federal agency to proceed.&lt;ref name=&quot;H5244&quot;&gt;United States Congress. &quot;{{PDF|1=[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&amp;page=H5244&amp;position=all U.S. Intelligence.]}}&quot; ''Congressional Record&amp;mdash;House.''

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is no mention of Able Danger in the 9/11 Commission Report. Two 9/11 Commission members, [[Timothy J. Roemer]] and [[John F.

Following coverage in the national media of Weldon's claims in August 2005, [[Thomas Kean]] and [[Lee H. Hamilton]], former Chair and Vice Chair of the 9/11 Commission, issued a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{PDF|[http://www.9-11pdp.org/press/2005-08-12_pr.pdf statement]|32.1&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they stated the Commission had been aware of the Able Danger program, and requested and obtained information about it from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD), but none of the information provided had indicated the program had identified Atta or other 9/11 hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinejournal.org/Special_Reports/082405Chin/08-24-05_Chin.pdf More pre-9/11 US intelligence connections to al-Qaeda exposed and spun] Online Journal.Com August 24, 2005 pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/19/MNGH5EA5121.DTL&amp;hw=claim+about+9%2F11&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=719 Claim about 9/11 takes new twist] [[San Francisco Chronicle]] August 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curt Weldon issued a response to this statement clarifying the mission of Able Danger, expressing concern over the statements made by various members of the 9/11 Commission, and promising to push forward until it is understood why the DoD was unable to pass the information uncovered by Able Danger to the FBI, and why the 9/11 Commission failed to follow up on the information they were given on Able Danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061130002015/http://curtweldon.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=32271 WELDON RESPONDS TO OMISSION OF ABLE DANGER FROM 9/11 REPORT], August 12, 2005.

Numerous [[whistleblowers]] and officials have surfaced, claiming that there was a deliberate effort, from high-ranking officials, to prevent investigations into Al Qaeda.

In 2002, FBI agent [[Coleen Rowley]] wrote to FBI director [[Robert Mueller]] describing her experience working with [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] FBI agents tracking suspected terrorist [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] prior to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020603/memo.html Coleen Rowley's Memo to FBI Director Robert Mueller], May 21, 2002. Retrieved 2010-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; She describes how FBI HQ personnel in Washington, D.C. had mishandled and failed to take action on information provided by the Minneapolis Field Office, and had failed to issue a warrant to search Moussaui's computer despite having probable cause.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:FBI eMails concerning Moussaoui|FBI eMails concerning Moussaoui]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rowley goes on to describe her superior, Agent Marion &quot;Spike&quot; Bowman, as having âconsistently, almost deliberately thwarted the Minneapolis FBI agents' effortsâ to obtain the search warrant. Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] later wrote that âIf the application for the FISA warrant had gone forward, agents would have found information in Moussaoui's belongings that linked him ... to a major financier of the hijacking plot&quot;. Rowley was credited as a whistleblower and jointly awarded the ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' &quot;[[Person of the Year]]&quot; for 2002. Her testimony to the 9/11 Commission was omitted from their final report.

FBI agent and [[Al-Qaeda]] expert [[John P. O'Neill]] warned of an Al-Qaeda threat to the United States in 2000. He retired from his position in mid 2001, citing repeated blocking of his investigations of Al Qaeda by FBI officials. After his retirement from the FBI, the [[World Trade Center]] hired him as its chief of security. He started work on August 23, 2001; 9/11 rescue workers found his body in a staircase inside the south tower rubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Kirk |first = Michael |coauthors = Jim Gilmore |year = 2002 |url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/script.html |title = The Man Who Knew |work = Transcript of Frontline program #2103 |publisher = WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate = June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the attacks, [[David Schippers]], the chief prosecutor for the impeachment of [[Bill Clinton]], stated that the government had been warned in 1995 about a future attack on a government building and that later he was contacted by three FBI agents who mentioned uncovering a possible terrorist attack planned for lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Crogan |first = Jim |year = 2002 |url = http://www.laweekly.com/ink/02/37/news-crogan.php |title = Another FBI Agent Blows the Whistle |work = LA Weekly News |publisher = LA Weekly, LP |accessdate = June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schippers, as the agents informed their superiors, they were briefed not to pursue the issue and were threatened with prosecution. Schippers declared, &quot;Five weeks before the September 11 tragedy, I did my best to get a hold of [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] with my concerns.&quot; According to Schippers, Ashcroft responded that the Justice Department does not start investigations at the top. Author William Norman Grigg agrees with Schippers in his article &quot;''Did We Know What Was Coming?''&quot; According to the article, three unnamed veteran federal law enforcement agents confirmed &quot;the information provided to Schippers was widely known within the Bureau before September 11.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Grigg |first = William Norman |year = 2002 |url = http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2002/03-11-2002/vo18no05_didweknow.htm |title = Did We Know What Was Coming? |work = The New American magazine |publisher = American Opinion Publishing Incorporated |accessdate = June 11, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060528025916/http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2002/03-11-2002/vo18no05_didweknow.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Senator [[Bob Graham]], who was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee from June 2001 through the buildup to the Iraq war, ''&quot;Two of the September 11, 2001, hijackers had a support network in the United States that included agents of the Saudi government, and the Bush administration and FBI blocked a congressional investigation into that relationship,&quot;'' as reported by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. And in Graham's book, ''Intelligence Matters'', he makes clear that some details of that financial support from Saudi Arabia were in the 27 pages of the congressional inquiry's final report that were blocked from release by the administration, despite the pleas of leaders of both parties on the House and Senate intelligence committees.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/9584265.htm |title=Graham book: Inquiry into 9/11, Saudi ties blocked |publisher=Miami Herald.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040907022815/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/9584265.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been allegations that the hijackers' preparations may have been given assistance by U.S. intelligence. According to [[CBS]] news, &quot;two of the Sept. 11 hijackers who lived in San Diego in 2000 rented a room from a man who reportedly worked as an undercover FBI informant... the FBI informant prayed with them and even helped one open a bank account.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/09/attack/main521223.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Hijackers Lived With FBI Informant | date=September 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubts have been raised about the speed with which the hijackers were identified, leading to suggestions that the FBI already had the names of the hijackers in advance. In his book ''Against All Enemies'', Richard Clarke said that at 9:59 am on September 11, which is the time when WTC2 collapsed and 8&amp;nbsp;minutes before NORAD even knew Flight 93 had been hijacked, the FBI already had a list of the 19 alleged hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=SCO20061220&amp;articleId=4207 JFK and 9/11 - Insights Gained from Studying Both] by Dr. Peter Dale Scott, December 20, 2006.

Hersh, The New Yorker, October 8, 2001. Retrieved 2010-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign government foreknowledge==
It has been suggested that some foreign governments and intelligence agencies may have had some foreknowledge of the attacks. In particular, the possible foreknowledge of the Israeli Mossad, and possible financial ties to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, have raised doubts about the [[9/11 Commission Report]] conclusion that no one outside the terrorist organisation al Qaeda was involved or had foreknowledge of the attacks. There are also questions about how much was known by other governments and intelligence agencies in countries such as France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt, which all warned the United States of an imminent attack.

===Iran===
[[Sibel Edmonds]], an FBI translator, stated that the FBI received information in April 2001, from a reliable Iranian intelligence asset, that Osama Bin Laden was planning attacks on 4-5 cities with planes, and that some of the plotters were already in the country and the attacks would happen in a few months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040602210202/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=507514 April 2, 2004 'I saw papers that show US knew al-Qa'ida would attack cities with aeroplanes' The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justacitizen.com/articles_documents/FBI%20&amp;%20911.htm FBI &amp; 9/11 - by Sibel Edmonds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
It was reported that the Mossad informed the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and CIA in August 2001 that as many as 200 terrorists were slipping into the United States and planning &quot;a major assault on the United States.&quot; The Israeli intelligence agency allegedly cautioned the FBI that it had picked up indications of a &quot;large-scale target&quot; in the United States and that Americans would be &quot;very vulnerable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/20/news/mn-47840 Officials Told of âMajor Assaultâ Plans] LA Times, RICHARD A. SERRANO and JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG|TIMES STAFF WRITERS&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Israeli espionage agents, and particularly the [[Mossad]], may have had foreknowledge of the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ketchum&quot;&gt;[http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/Final%20PDF%20of%20CounterPunch%20article%20re%20Israelis%2001-29-07.pdf]

In September, 2001, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that four hours after the attack, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrested five Israelis who had been filming the smoking skyline from the roof of a white van in the parking lot of an apartment building, for &quot;puzzling behavior&quot;. They were charged with illegally residing in the United States and working there without permits. The Israelis were said to have been videotaping the disaster with what was interpreted as cries of &quot;joy and mockery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=JAMES RISEN AND DON VAN NATTA JR. |title=AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE INVESTIGATION; Authorities Have Learned the Identities Of 18 Hijackers, Attorney General Says |date=September 14, 2001 |work=[[New York Times]] |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DD1E38F937A2575AC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |accessdate=August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=75266&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y 5 Israelis detained for `puzzling behavior' after WTC tragedy] By Yossi Melman, Haaretz.com. Retrieved 2010-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Police found the van and a search revealed $4,700 in cash hidden, along with foreign passports and a boxcutter which aroused suspicions and led to the detention of the occupants. The men were held in detention for more than 2&amp;nbsp;months, during which time they were subjected to interrogation and lie detector tests, before being deported back to Israel; one of the men (Paul Kurzberg) refused to take the test for 10 weeks, and then failed it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The five men worked at the company Urban Moving Systems, owned and operated by Dominick Suter. After the men were arrested the FBI searched their offices and questioned Suter, however Suter fled to Israel before he could be questioned further. Eventually, Suter's name appeared on the May 2002 FBI Suspect List, along with the Sept. 11 hijackers and other suspected extremists.&lt;ref&gt;Times Herald, August 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a former CIA chief of operations for counterterrorism [[Vince Cannistraro]], there was speculation that Urban Moving Systems may have been a front for an intelligence operation investigating fund-raising networks channeling money to [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]]. On March 15, 2002, ''[[The Forward]]'' claimed that the FBI had concluded that the van's driver, Paul Kurzberg, and his brother Sivan, were indeed [[Mossad]] operatives, who were in America &quot;spying on local Arabs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://positiontoknow.com/S-11/html/Americans%20Probing%20Reports%20of%20Israeli%20Espionage.htm FORWARD : News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; ABC news cited this report on June 21, 2002, adding that the FBI had concluded that the five Israelis had no foreknowledge of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{wayback|http://web.archive.org/web/20020802194310/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/2020/DailyNews/2020_whitevan_020621.html |The White Van:Were Israelis Detained on Sept. 11 Spies?}} June 21, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2001, the US [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive]] had issued a warning about people identifying themselves as &quot;Israeli art students&quot; attempting to bypass security and gain entry to federal buildings, and even to the private residences of senior federal officials. A French intelligence agency later noted âaccording to the FBI, Arab terrorists and suspected terror cells lived in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as in Miami and Hollywood, Florida, from December 2000 to April 2001 in direct proximity to the Israeli spy cellsâ. The report contended that Mossad agents were spying on Mohammed Atta and Marwan al-Shehi, two of leaders of the 9/11 hijack teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCIX&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncix.gov/archives/nacic/news/2001/mar01.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070124104741/http://www.ncix.gov/archives/nacic/news/2001/mar01.html |archivedate=2007-01-24 |title=Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive: Suspicious Visitors to Federal Facilities (archived at Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/03/07/wspy07.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2002/03/07/ixworld.html |title= US arrests 200 young Israelis in spying investigation | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Ben | last=Fenton | date=March 7, 2002 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/05/07/students/index_np.html |title=Salon.com: The Israeli &quot;art student&quot; mystery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sunday Herald&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww1.sundayherald.com/37707|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060423065411/http://ww1.sundayherald.com/37707|archivedate=2006-04-23|title=Sunday Herald (UK) via Internet Archive: Were they part of a massive spy ring which shadowed the 9/11 hijackers and knew that al-Qaeda planned a devastating terrorist attack on the USA?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 several officials dismissed reports of a spy ring and said the allegations were made by a Drug Enforcement Agency who was angry his theories had been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020307&amp;slug=notspies07 |title=U.S. officials dismiss report of Israeli spies |last=Mintz |first=John |coauthors=Dan Eggen |date=March 7, 2002 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press reported that &quot;Israeli intelligence services were aware several months before Sept. 11 that bin Laden was planning a large-scale terror attack&quot; and that this information was passed on to Washington. According to Fox News, In August 2001, Israel warned the US that an al-Qaeda attack is imminent. Reportedly, two high-ranking agents from the Mossad came to Washington and warned the FBI and CIA that up to 200 terrorists have slipped into the US and are planning &quot;a major assault on the United States...

On February 18, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that [[Ali al-Jarrah]] a Palestinian activist and cousin of 9/11 hijacker [[Ziad al-Jarrah]], was arrested in [[Lebanon]] on charges of being a paid [[Mossad]] asset over the last two decades. ''The Times'' reported that the two cousins were 20 years apart and did not know each other very well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/world/middleeast/19lebanon.html Lebanese in Shock Over Arrest of an Accused Spy The New York Times February 18, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2007 French authorities filed preliminary charges against [[Guillaume DasquiÃ©]], a reporter for the daily ''[[Le Monde]]'', for publishing state secrets related to the 9/11 hijackings. DasquiÃ©'s April 16 article in Le Monde, titled &quot;September 11: the French had long known&quot; claimed the [[Direction GÃ©nÃ©rale de la SÃ©curitÃ© ExtÃ©rieure|General Directorate of External Security]] (DGSE), had warned the U.S. of a possible terrorist plot that involved al-Qaeda hijacking planes and crashing them into buildings some eight months before 9/11.

[[Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil]], the Taliban's [[Foreign Minister of Afghanistan|Foreign Minister]], sent the USA an advance warning of the attack following a tip-off he received from [[Tohir Yoâldosh]], the leader of the [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]].
Like al Qaeda, the Taliban allowed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan to place training camps in Afghanistan.
Tohir Yoâldosh was reported to have been concerned that if al Qaeda was not stopped prior to launching the attacks, the USA would retaliate against all of Afghanistan, which would have a negative effect on his movement's efforts.
