<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="16526001" ns="0" title="Ahlmann Ridge"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Ahlmann Ridge''', also known as '''Ahlmannryggen''', is a broad, mainly ice-covered ridge, about {{convert|70|mi|km}} long, surmounted by scattered, low peaks. It rises between [[Schytt Glacier]] and [[Jutulstraumen Glacier]] and extends from [[Borg Massif]] northward to [[Fimbul Ice Shelf]] in [[Queen Maud Land]]. The area was first photographed from aircraft of the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â39) and peaks in this vicinity were roughly plotted. The [[Stein Nunataks]] and [[Witte Peaks]], named by the German Antarctic Expedition, appear to coincide with the northeast part of the Ahlmann Ridge. The feature was mapped in detail from surveys and air photos by the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) (1949â1952) and air photos by the Norwegian expedition (1958â59). Named for [[Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann]], chairman of the Swedish committee for the NBSAE.
