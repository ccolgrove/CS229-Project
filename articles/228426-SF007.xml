'''SQL-Ledger''' is an [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] and [[double-entry book-keeping|double entry]] [[accounting]] system. Accounting data is stored in an [[SQL]] Database Server and a standard [[web browser]] can be used as its [[user interface]]. The system uses the [[Perl]] language with a database interface module for processing and [[PostgreSQL]] for data storage.

==Business model==

DWS generates their revenue from selling support services. There are 5 support levels. For free, DWS provides the source code of the actual and all the previous versions, installation instructions, an FAQ collection and a user forum.

Version 2.8 of this program was released under the GNU GPL 2.0 license.&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.sql-ledger.org/cgi-bin/nav.pl?page=misc/COPYING&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.0 (closed source) is available either hosted, or with an Enterprise Support Contract.

== Capabilities ==

Not only is the user interface multi-lingual, but it also offers the ability to print out statements, invoices, and the like in the language of the customer, even if the user does not know the language that the content is being printed out in.

It offers all of the standard features of SMB accounting software. Specific customization is available, as part of an enterprise support contract.

== Licensing Issues ==

At its inception, SQL-Ledger used the GNU GPL 2.0 license. In 2005, [[Debian legal]] questioned whether or not the program belonged in Free or Non-Free, due to wording in the ''Terms and Conditions'' notice in the tarball.&lt;ref&gt;http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00044.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 2006, [[LedgerSMB]] was created as a secure fork of SQL-Ledger.  In early 2007, SQL-Ledger 2.8 was released under the '''SQL-Ledger Open Source License'',&lt;ref&gt;http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/15/1759254&lt;/ref&gt; a license which retroactively revokes all previous licenses that the covered code has been released under.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.purple.dropbear.id.au/sql-ledger-license-changed-no-longer-gpl-when-gpl-software-goes-bad&lt;/ref&gt; That version also contained an &quot;anti-forking&quot; clause.
However, within a month, SQL-Ledger 2.8.1 was released, under the GNU GPL 2.0.
