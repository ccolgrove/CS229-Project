'''TG4''' ({{lang-ga|TG Ceathair}} or ''TG a Ceathair''; {{IPA-ga|tiË dÊiË kÊ²ahÉÉ¾Ê²|pron}}) is a [[public service broadcaster]] for [[Irish language]] speakers. The channel has been on-air since 31 October 1996 in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and since April 2005 in [[Northern Ireland]].

TG4 was formerly known as '''TeilifÃ­s na Gaeilge''' or '''TnaG''', before a rebranding campaign in 1999.  TG4 was the third national station to be launched in Ireland; after [[RTÃ One]] in 1961 (as TeilifÃ­s Ãireann) and [[RTÃ Two]] in 1978, and followed by [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] in 1998. The channel has 800,000 viewers who tune into the channel each day to view a broad programming policy. It has a share of 3% of the national television market. The daily Irish language programme schedule is its core service: seven hours of programming in Irish supported by a wide range of material in other languages such as English and French.

==History==
In 1969, Lelia Doolan, Jack Dowling and [[Bob Quinn (Irish filmmaker)|Bob Quinn]] published ''Sit down and Be Counted'', a book describing their campaign for a separate Irish language television service. Bob Quinn is a maverick film director who produced many documentaries and fiction films through the Irish language on limited budgets including the first Irish language feature film ''[[PoitÃ­n (film)|PoitÃ­n]]'' starring [[Niall TÃ³ibÃ­n]], [[Cyril Cusack]] and [[Donal McCann]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;A Separate Irish language Television Channel? by Margaret O'Connor, Dublin City University&lt;/ref&gt;

The three writers proposed small temporary buildings for [[Gaeltacht]] regional television services broadcasting a limited number of hours each night with programming coming from each of the Gealtacht regions around the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[RTÃ]] and the Irish government had sought to improve the availability of Irish language programming on RTÃ services. In 1972, [[RTÃ RaidiÃ³ na Gaeltachta]] (RnaG) was set up to provide Irish language radio services across the country. All radio and television services provided by RTÃ provided some Irish language programming.

In 1980, a new group called ''Coiste ar son Teilifis Gaeltachta'' (The Committee for Irish Language Teleivision) was set up and in 1987 after years of delays, including the sudden death of their technician who was to build the transmitter, they set up the pirate television station TelefÃ­s na Gaeltachta. Eighteen hours of live and pre-recorded programming was broadcast between 2 and 5 November 1987. The transmitter was built at a cost of [[Irish pounds|IRÂ£4,000]] through donations from local [[Gaeltacht]] communities. In December 1988, further broadcasts were transmitted from three different sites, broadcasting pre-recorded programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 1988, as part of RTÃ's renaming of [[RTÃ Two]] to Network 2, they provided some Irish language children's programming on ''[[The Den (television)|The Den]]'' such as ''BoilÃ­'' and ''[[Echo Island]]'', with a current affairs programme ''CursaÃ­'' airing each night at 19:00. During the 1990s, RTÃ suggested the use of RTÃ Two's prime-time schedule for Irish language programming. The movement for a national Irish language television service was gaining momentum. However, this amounted to only 5% of the total programming broadcast by RTÃ, and was reduced significantly during the summer months.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, CiarÃ¡n Ã Feinneadha, one of the members of ''Coiste ar son TeilifÃ­s Gealtachta'', moved to [[Dublin]] and set up a similar organisation in the capital called ''Feachtas Naisiunta TeilifÃ­se'' (FTN). FTN outlined their demands:

* A television station to be set up in the [[Gaeltacht]] regions serving the [[Gaeltacht]] and Irish speakers across the country.
* It should be linked to RTÃ, but independent from both editorial and organisational points of view.
* A special authority set up to run it with representatives from RTÃ, the Department of Communications, and [[ÃdarÃ¡s na Gaeltachta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

It was also suggested that the cap on advertising on RTÃ be removed and the additional funds be designated for the new services. [[Ray Burke (Irish politician)|Ray Burke]] had limited the advertising minutes on RTÃ a few years previously. Hence, there would be no cost to the Exchequer, and funding would also come from the National Lottery and the television Licence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

FTN suggested two hours of programming each day with the rest of the broadcast hours to be used for [[Open University]] type programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===On the air===

The total cost in establishing the transmission and links networks, and the construction of the station's headquarters in the [[Connemara]] [[Gaeltacht]], was IRÂ£16.1 million. Annual running costs increased from IRÂ£10.2 million in 1996 to IRÂ£16 million in 2001, and â¬30 million in 2006.

[[File:Tnag425x250.jpg|thumb|left|TnaG Logo 1996 to 1999 at launch]]

In fewer than six months from the launch of TeilifÃ­s na Gaeilge, almost 65% of Ireland's television sets were able to receive the channel and the nightly audience had risen to 250,000 viewers. Three months later, in May 1997, independent research revealed that the station was able to attract audiences of 500,000, or 68% of television sets in Ireland, for at least one hour's viewing per week.

Very significant assistance in non-monetary terms comes from RTÃ which is required to provide over 360 hours of programming annually at no cost to TG4. It was not until 1996 that TnaG came on air. Their aim, initially, was to show one hour of Irish language programming each night, increasing to two hours by 1999.

Initial criticisms of the planned station came from journalist [[Kevin Myers]] who derided TnaG as a [[white elephant]] and called it 'TelefÃ­s De Lorean', in a reference to the ill-fated [[DeLorean Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/the-cheers-1501855.html The cheers], ''[[Evening Herald]]''  17 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish postal service, [[An Post]], celebrated ten years of the Irish language station in 2006 with a commemorative stamp. The station launched a book entitled ''TG4@10: Deich mBliana de TG4'' (Ten Years of TG4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galwayindependent.com/local-news/local-news/tg4-book-celebrates-milestone/|title=TG4 book celebrates milestone|date=22 October 2008|publisher=Galway Independent|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

TG4 became an independent statutory entity on 1 April 2007 (TeilifÃ­s na Gaeilge).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0004/sec0044.html#partvi-sec44 Broadcasting Act, 2001, Section 44]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, TG4 was accepted as a new member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. In 2008, TG4 became a founding member of [[World Indigenous Television Broadcasters Network]] (WITBN).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.witbn.org/?page_id=129#linkmaoritv&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2009, the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]] was signed into law. Many of the provisions of the Act relating to RTÃ also apply to TG4, with the station being subject to regulation from the new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland once the relevant provisions are commenced. The Act also changed the English language title of the Chief Executive of TG4 to &quot;Director-General&quot; in line with RTÃ, and in the Irish language from &quot;CeannasaÃ­&quot; to &quot;ArdstiÃºrthÃ³ir&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/corp/foir/foir.asp|title=AISEOLAS|publisher=TG4|language=Irish|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two Chief Executives of TG4, Cathal Goan (former [[Director-General of RTÃ]] from 1996 to 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/goanc.html|title=Director-General - Cathal Goan|publisher=RTÃ Press Office|accessdate=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current Director General, PÃ³l Ã GallchÃ³ir.

==Operation==
{{Main|TeilifÃ­s na Gaeilge (corporation)}}

The daily Irish language programme schedule is its central service, broadcasting approximately 2.5 hours a day of new Irish language programming, with an estimated 2.5 hours a day of repeated Irish language programmes. Currently, RTÃ supplies TG4 with one hour a day of Irish language programming. The remainder of the TG4 schedule is made up of acquisitions from other broadcasters particularly from US broadcasters.

Operating as a publisher and broadcaster, TG4 invests up to â¬20m annually in original indigenous programming from the independent production sector in [[Ireland]]. The Irish language [[soap opera]] ''[[Ros na RÃºn]]'' is one of its most popular programmes, and it also commissions a number of documentaries.

On 1 April 2007, TeilifÃ­s na Gaeilge became an independent [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|statutory corporation]], with former [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] [[president]] Peter Quinn becoming first chairman of the corporation.  The other members appointed to the authority were Joe Connolly, Padraig MacDonnacha, EilÃ­s NÃ­ Chonghaile, MÃ©abh Mhic Ghairbheith, MÃ©adhbh Nic an Airchinnigh, BrÃ­d NÃ­ NeachtÃ¡in, Feargal Ã SÃ©, and Regina Culliton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcmnr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Minister+for+Communications+Marine+and+Natural+Resources+Noel+Dempsey+T.D.+Announces+Members+of+Teil.htm Minister for Communications Marine and Natural Resources Noel Dempsey T.D. Announces Members of Teilifis na Gaeilge / AinmnÃ­onn Aire Nollaig Ã DÃ­omasaigh Baill TheilifÃ­s na Gaeilge - Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources | An Roinn CumarsÃ¡ide, Mara agus Ã­&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with TG4's independence from RTÃ, TG4 began to broadcast 24 hour news broadcaster [[France 24]] instead of [[Euronews]]. RTÃ holds a share in [[Euronews]], meaning TG4 could no longer broadcast the service.

===Scheduling===
During the first two years of TnaG, the service provided a &quot;blocked&quot; schedule. A distinct language schedule was created in line with their commitment to provide two hours of Irish language television each day. Children's television ran from 17:00 to 18:00, while the prime time Irish language block began at 20:00 and ended at 22:30 each night. In 1998, the channel began experimenting with their prime time schedule (due to low audience figures and pressure from independent producers). The prime time block was reduced by 30 minutes, ending at 22:00, while they tested Irish language programming in late night slots after English language programming, this schedule increased the audience for Irish programmes that followed English programmes. A new &quot;hammocking&quot; schedule was introduced. &quot;Hammocking&quot; is a term used in public service broadcasting meaning that shows with low audience appeal are placed between programmes with high appeal, thus increasing audience share for weaker programming. In 1999, the channel was renamed as TG4. The main aim of its new schedules was to provide &quot;national resonance&quot;{{clarify|post-text=Please explain this term|date=November 2011}} and to compete with [[BBC 2]] and [[Channel 4]] for Irish audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDubhghaill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/mercator/images/UinsionnMacDubhghaill.pdf|title=Harry Potter and the Wizards of Baile na hAbhann: Translation, subtitling and dubbing policies in Ireland's TG4, from the start of broadcasting in 1996 to the present day|last=MacDubhghaill|first=Uinsionn|publisher=ABER.ac.uk|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

TG4 lost its language-driven schedule and replaced it with a stronger audience-driven schedule, with key audiences delivered at key times. TG4 aims to be a mainstream channel for a niche audience. This new scheduling provided TG4 with a strong increase in audience share during the first six months of the newly re-branded channel, rising from 1% to 2% and, by 2005, TG4 had become the eighth most watched television channel with 2.4% audience share, just below BBC 2 and Channel 4, and well ahead of [[Sky One]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDubhghaill&quot; /&gt;

===Budget===
The [[Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources]] reduced TG4's grant-in-aid from the exchequer to â¬32.25m for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/assets/files/TB2010-B.pdf|title=TG4 Annual Report|publisher=TG4|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TeilifÃ­s na Gaeilge authority received a budget of â¬38m for 2008 and co-funded productions with the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]]'s sound &amp; vision fund received â¬4.6m. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources reduced their budget from the exchequer to â¬35m for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2009/0421-1.asp TG4 BOARD APPROVES REDUCED BUDGET FOR 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;In 2007, TG4 earned â¬3,596,000 in advertising revenue and had state funding of â¬24,914,000. They spent â¬17,716,000 on programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/docs/TB2007-B.pdf TG4 Annual Report 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, they spent â¬15,469,000 on commissioned programming and â¬7.5million on acquired shows. The latter consist mainly of children's programmes which are dubbed into Irish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/docs/TB2006-B.pdf TG4 Annual Report 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 has a 2.7% to 3% share of the Irish television market with an average daily viewership of 730,000.

On Saint Patrick's Day 2009, live coverage of the All-Ireland Finals in the AIB Club Championships on TG4 achieved very high audience ratings for the channel. Twenty five percent of afternoon television viewers on St. Patrick's Day were tuned into TG4. Over 1.1m viewers tuned on TG4 during the day, giving it an overall 8.2% national daily share and placing it in third place in the national daily viewing table for the first time ever.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tg4.ie/corp/pr/2009/0319-1.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Other major ratings successes for the channel include the All Ireland Ladies Football Final with 21% of all viewers tuned to that broadcast. A series of [[Westerns]] has also proven very popular. On 25 April 2010, TG4's coverage of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|Allianz Football League]] Finals in [[Croke Park]] saw them become the most watched channel, with 650,000 viewers watching some of the games. The Division One final had an average audience of 220,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/bearla/corp/pr/2010/0427-1.asp|title=VIEWING FIGURES FOR GAA BEO - ALLIANZ FOOTBALL LEAGUE FINALS 2010|date=27 April 2010|publisher=TG4|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TG4 provide their viewing figures each week on their website. As they only give the last two weeks of shows it is hard to find a constant reference for their viewing figures. Currently TG4's top ten programmes range from 40,000 to 100,000 viewers, but their top show can be has high as 250,000; like other television services they achieve their highest viewing figures with sporting events.&lt;ref name=&quot;tg4.ie&quot;&gt;http://www.tg4.ie/leir/luch.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most popular programmes included: [[GlÃ³r TÃ­re]] ([[country and western]] reality competition) â 90-110,000; RÃ¡saÃ­ na Gaillimhe (political comedy drama); [[Ros na RÃºn]] (soap opera), GAA Beo (GAA sport) â 50-100,000; [[FÃ­orscÃ©al]], Cogar (documentary); [[Seacht]] (university drama); [[Nuacht TG4]] (news); [[7 LÃ¡]] (weekly review); [[Paisean Faisean]] (dating programme), Feirm Factor (reality television); and An Jig Gig. These have had an audience search{{clarify|post-text=What is audience search?|date=November 2011}} of 3% to 12% of the total viewing audience, or 40,000 to 100,000 viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;tg4.ie&quot;/&gt;

===Subtitling and Dubbing===
====Adult and Prime Time Programming====

TG4 do not dub live action film or television programming into Irish. Some reality television programming have the English voice over replaced by Irish language voice over (which is also subtitled in English), however all contestants and presenters are not re-dubbed. In the early years of TnaG the channel broadcast many European programmes with Irish dubbing however this policy has since stopped in favour of US programming in English. Some non-English language films are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish. Most Irish language programmes are subtitled on screen in English, however no live programming (such as news and sport) is subtitled into English. Many Irish language programmes are also subtitled on teletext page 888 in Irish.

====Children's and Young People's Programming====

CÃºla 4, CÃºla 4 na nÃg and Ponc do not have subtitles during live introductions. Many of the Irish language cartoons are subtitled on page 888 for parents. TG4 broadcast all US teen programming in English, while Irish language programming is subtitled on screen in English. TG4 have re-dubbed a number of Hollywood children's films into Irish.
===Future Channels===
In February 2011 TG4 proposed 2 new services to the BAI for carriage on the [[saorview]] service. An Irish language service aimed at young people which is timeshared with TG4 +1 ({{lang-ga|TG a Ceathair Moide a hAon}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/rte-criticised-for-saorview-broadcast-fees-164604.html|title=RTÃ criticised for Saorview broadcast fees|last=McCÃ¡rthaigh|first=SeÃ¡n|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Irish Examiner|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Broadcasting Act 2009 out lines a provision for TG4 HD.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programmes broadcast by TG4}}
{{Prose|section|date=June 2011}}
TG4 has nurtured a reputation for innovative programming in film, arts, drama, documentaries, and sports. Much of TG4's programming is subtitled in [[English language|English]]. The station has a [[teletext]] service called ''[[TÃ©acs TG4]]''.

===Imported programming===
TG4 broadcasts many popular US shows ranging from dramas to comedies. TG4 often premiere such shows before other European broadcasters.

From 13 July 2009 all television broadcasts of ''[[Nuacht RTÃ]]'' broadcast from the Baile na hAbhann studios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282318&amp;tpl=archnewshome&amp;force=1 RTÃ's 'Nuacht' Moves to West Coast]&lt;/ref&gt; The main news anchor for ''Nuacht RTÃ'' is [[Siun Nic Gearailt]] who had been the main news anchor for TG4 from 2002 to 2004 before moving to RTÃ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/heres-the-news-rtes-nuacht-shifts-base-to-west-coast-1818889.html Here's the news RTÃ's Nuacht shifts base to west coast]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nuacht TnaG'' initially was broadcast at 22:00 each night, later moving to 20:00 and finally to 19:00 where it currently remains.

===Sports===
The channel extensively covers Irish sports, such as the secondary [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] competitions and club championships, and women's Gaelic football (it also broadcasts [[Celtic League (Rugby Union)|Celtic League rugby]]). These are events which generally do not appeal to a mass audience, but have a reasonably loyal following. Many of the sports that TG4 provide coverage to are sporting events that other Irish Broadcasters would not usually be interested in, they have gained a reputation for providing coverage to minority sporting events and repeat coverage to Rugby and Gaelic games under their programming strand ''RugbaÃ­ Gold'' and ''GAA Gold'', showing highlights of classic games from the archives. ''SeÃ³ SpÃ³irt'' broadcasts a round up of the weeks sporting news with a selected panel, it is hosted by Dara Ã CinnÃ©ide.

In 2010 TG4 won back the rights for [[Celtic League (Rugby Union)|Celtic League rugby]] with [[RTÃ]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], [[S4C]] and [[BBC Alba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/7813469/Celtic-Rugby-secure-improved-broadcast-deal-for-Magners-League-coverage.html|title=Celtic Rugby secure improved broadcast deal for Magners League coverage|last=Clutton|first=Graham|date=9 June 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2011 TG4 took a major coup in taking away exclusive highlights of the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup from RTÃ Sport, this led to TG4 having Live coverage of the new Pro12, which is what the Celtic League was rebranded in 2011 as well as highlights of the top matches in European Rugby.

On top of this they bought Irish language rights to the 2011 Rugby World Cup whereby they have lucrative rights to re-run matches from the Rugby World Cup 2011 in the afternoon.  Therefore Setanta Ireland have all matches live, RTÃ have 13 live matches including all Irish matches and every match from the quarter finals onwards and TG4 re-run all the big matches in the afternoon such as the Ireland v Austrailia match and England and Welsh matches so far. 

====Soccer====

TG4'S coverage of the [[French Open|Roland Garros]] Tennis began in 2008 which happened started with just highlights of everyday and the finals live, this proved popular so now TG4 coverage begins with Highlights until final week of the tournament when live coverage begins.

TG4 for a number of years showed the Northern Ireland Trophy Snooker event from the Belfast Waterfront Hall.  This started in 2005 and they showed every NI Trophy tournament until it was scrapped in 2009.  This was advertised as their season of sport which started in 2005 and started with Wimbledon, le Tour de France and finished with the NI Trophy.  This was firstly a non ranking event and then it became a ranking event and TG4 were the official broadcaster, their coverage was called Snucar Beo and featured analysis from Irish players such as Fergal O'Brien and Ken Doherty and Northern Ireland players such as Patrick Wallace who were not Irish speakers and would provide analysis in English before the presenter would go back talking in Irish.  This is what usually happens in sports coverage on TG4 were links to cameras, reports and commentary are usually in Irish and interviews and analysis in Rugby, Football and Snooker usually in English.  

===Entertainment===
Since its inception TG4 has provided a huge number of light entertainment programming to its Irish speaking audience, such as the chat show ''[[ArdÃ¡n]]'' and the fashion/dating show ''[[Paisean Faisean]]''.

''Cleamhas'' translated Matchmaker was TG4 first attempt at a blind date type of show. ''Cleamhas'' was presented by [[SeÃ¡n BÃ¡n Breathnach]] and later by PÃ¡idÃ­ Ã LionÃ¡ird. In ''Cleamhas'' the audience would be introduced to the contestant looking for love and then to one of their parents (generally the father of a male contestant and the mother of a female contestant), then the audience are introduced to three suitors. The father or the mother would then ask the suitors various questions about how they would treat their son or daughter, the presenter would then go into the audience to talk to the suitor's friends. It would then be up to the mother or father to choose which suitor would go on a blind date with their son or daughter. This show ran for a number of years and was eventually replaced by ''[[Paisean Faisean]]'' where three boys/men select clothes for a girl, she would then choose the boy, based on the clothes that they picked for her; this show was presented in the first three series by Aoife NÃ­ Thuairisg, and in the fourth series by BlathnÃ¡id Nic Dhonnacha and MÃ¡iread Ni Chuaig, MÃ¡iread was replaced in 2008 by [[SÃ­le Seoige]].

The producers of ''Paisean Faisean'' - [[Magma Films]] - have since sold the rights to [[Zoo Productions]] who will produce the series for MTV under the title ''[[Style Date]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4283010&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;only=1|title=MTV Shops for 'Paisean Faisean'|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Irish Film and Television Network|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 TG4 aired ''Hollywood Anocht'' (Hollywood Tonight) a movie show presented by [[SÃ­le Seoige]].

On 24 September 2007, TG4 began broadcasting [[South Park]] in Irish, on SÃ­le, with the more adult content removed but also made available on Saturday nights. In 2009 ''SÃ­le'' was replaced by ''[[Cula 4|Ponc]]''.

It follow a group of contestants in the blenkness of the [[Connemara]] landscape, left with nothing and to fend for themselves. It was a television version of [[Gay Byrne]]'s radio experiment from the 1980s.

In 2008 TG4 launched their search for the best farmer in Ireland. ''[[Feirm Factor]]'' had 12 farmers competing with each other to see who was the best, the Judging panel consisted of [[Maura Derrane]] (Former [[Ireland AM]] presenter),  [[Alan Dukes]] (Former Minister for Agriculture) and SeÃ¡n O Lionaird (Dairy farmer from Cork). The second series of ''Feirm Factor'' was broadcast from January to March 2010. Welsh television station [[S4C]] has started broadcasting their own version of the show in 2010, called ''Fferm Ffactor''.

Underdogs search for the best amateur football team from groups of men and women with no previous experience in Minor or Senior GAA football. The judging panel consisted of Geraldine Feerick, Jarlath Burns and Ãamon Ã Muircheartaigh.

Glas Vegas has a similar format to ''America's Got Talent'' and ''The All Ireland Talent Show'', while ''Nollig No. 1'' has a similar format to ''[[You're a Star]]'' as the judges search for a Christmas number one single. The 2008 winner was Mary Lee, she released the single &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot;, with the chorus as Geilge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHU67jJQk4o Mary Lee's winning video]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 another series from the same stable began the search for Ireland's best Irish dancing act, entitled An Jig Gig.

===Drama===
In the early years TG4 gained critical acclaim&lt;ref&gt;C.U. Burn won âSpiorad na FÃ©ileâ, at the Panceltic Televisiona and Film Festival 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[C.U. Burn]] a comedy series about a [[Donegal]] [[undertaker]] and ''Glenn Ceo'' a comedy about a small town [[Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na|Garda]] station in [[Donegal]].

It airs Tuesday and Thursday at 20:30, with an [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] edition at 22:30 each Sunday night. TG4 have also supported many Irish filmmakers with their Lasair short film programme fund.

In 2006 TG4 commissioned ''Teenage Cics'', their first youth drama. Set during the 1980s in the [[Donegal]] [[Gaeltacht]], it follows the exploits of young students from Belfast going to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish. This was followed by their successful teen drama ''[[Aifric]]''.

In 2007 TG4 won major critical acclaim for their political satirical comedy ''The Running Mate'' and for the programme ''[[Seacht]]'' which follows the lives of seven college students in [[Belfast]].

Their drama series ''RÃ¡saÃ­ na Gaillimhe'' (part funded by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|BAI]]'s Sound and Vision Fund) was a major hit for the channel, becoming their second most popular show just after [[GlÃ³r TÃ­re]]. Set during the week of the [[Galway Races]], it is a drama-comedy starring, [[Don Wycherley]], [[Ruth Bradley]], [[Olga Wherly]], [[Hughie McGarvey]] and [[Owen Roe]].

====Praise for TG4 Drama====
::&quot;The reality is that Irish language television dramas, no matter how acclaimed or however many awards they might win, are unlikely to show up in box set form in any DVD mega-store. TG4's viewership ranges from between 2 and 4 per cent of the population, enough to cost a politician an election but far too few viewers to send a show into the top 10 in the television ratings.

::A shame, because there are great things happening in the area. TG4's recent batch of mini-series RasaÃ­ na Gaillimhe, Paddywhackery and Na Cloigne (not to mention Aifric, Seacht and long-running soap Ros na RÃºn) have featured outrageous plots and wacky characters, and dare to be politically incorrect: they get away with it because they are in Irish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0319/1224266583816.html&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &quot;the first episode of An Crisis, a new six-parter from TG4, was laugh out loud funny â interspersed with a couple of knowing sniggers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0410/1224268015897.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's television===
{{Main|CÃºla 4}}

In 1996, TnaG started its children's programming under the strand ''Cullabulla'' (taken from [[Hiberno-English]]). Since then they have renamed and extended the strand as CÃºla4.

===Factual===
It also actively commissions documentaries such as the acclaimed and popular ''AmÃº'' series of travel programmes which launched the career of [[Hector Ã hEochagÃ¡in]], one of a number of TG4 presenters who have gone on to success at other channels. Others include newsreader [[GrÃ¡inne Seoige]]. As many of these programs are subtitled in English, they are often popular with recent immigrant populations, who find spoken English very fast on Irish produced television, as well as native Irish speakers.

They dub a French-Canadian documentary series under the name ''Fior ScÃ©al''. ''Nello'' was another well received travel show looking at life in middle America.

They have a documentary strand called ''Cogar''. ''EalÃº'' (Escape) was a series which looked at prison escapes around Ireland. They repeat the RTÃ shows ''Leargas'' (a new magazine show) and ''Scannal'' (reports on scandals that hit Ireland).

===Re-dubbed Programming===

In the early years of TG4 the service repeated the Welsh teenage drama series ''[[Jabas]]'' which was re-dubbed into Irish from Welsh. They also aired the French cartoon ''[[Bouli]]'' as part of their children's schedule. ''Jabas'' and ''Bouli'' had previously aired on [[RTÃ Television]]. Again the Welsh series ''[[Pris y Farchnad]]'' was translated into Irish under the title ''An Craiceann is a Luach''. In general however TG4 perceived that live action series aimed at adults re-dubbed into Irish was not an attractive proposition even for fluent Irish speakers, as is the cases for many bilingual northern European viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDubhghaill&quot; /&gt;  

Since its launch TG4 has significantly increased the number of re-dubbed children's programmes from 70 hours in its first year to 200 hours. TG4 only re-dub cartoons while live action series remain in English, such as the Australian drama ''[[H2O: Just Add Water|H2O]]'' and the American sitcom ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''. TG4 have re-dubbed [[Harry Potter]] into Irish as ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Harry Potter agus an Seomra Diamhair]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDubhghaill&quot; /&gt; Some other live action children's movies such as ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' have been re-dubbed into Irish.

===Film===
TG4 has a broad film policy which features a strong range of both independent and mainstream cinema. The channel places a strong emphasis on Irish films both in the Irish and English languages and European cinema which features films in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] among other languages. These films air under the strand '''Le Film'''. TG4 regularly broadcast  [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] under the strand ''An Western''.

Mainstream Hollywood cinema is represented by films from [[20th Century Fox]], [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] among others. TG4 regularly broadcast such films on Tuesday Nights as part of their ScannÃ¡n na Seachtaine (Movie of the Week) strand. They sometimes  re-dub children's films into Irish with English subtitles, the most notable being the [[Harry Potter]] films.

TG4 became the first channel to broadcast in full [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s classic ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'', a season of Kubrick's films followed including the European television premiere of ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''.  It also became one of the first channels in Europe to air the remastered director's cut version of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', even before the UK, as they were still only airing the edited version.

==TG4 On Demand==

As of 2011, TG4's Video on Demand (VOD) service is operated by '''[[TG4 Player]]'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tg4.ie/ie/tg4-player/tg4-player.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Previously, the service was supplied by TG4 Beo, this service was launched in 2003 (and more recently in 2010) ahead of most European broadcasters&lt;ref name=&quot;sbpost.ie&quot;&gt;http://www.sbpost.ie/mediaandmarketing/tg4-gets-the-picture-for-revamped-online-player-48202.html&lt;/ref&gt;. TG4 Player allows viewers globally to watch TG4 live and watch previously aired programming on demand.

The new service is designed and managed by Nordic telecommunications company [[TeliaSonera]]. The relaunched on-demand service will eventually carry interactive subtitling and social interaction platform. According to TG4 the catch-up service has had 2 million downloads over the last 12 months.

==On-air identity / Marketing==
TG4's on screen identity is very different from its counterparts drawing upon the stations original slogan '''SÃºil Eile''' (meaning ''another view'').

Its first idents were under their former name of TnaG. The music on TnaG's early ident sequences was produced by Irish composer [[Oisin Lunny]]. The opening sequence featured a number of Irish scenes from across the Island of Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, it finished with a light house, the light of which beamed the logo on to the screen. While the longer seqence went out at the beginning of each day and the end of the night, a shorter version went out before each programme. TnaG ran numerous marketing campaigns with this logo, their main features were the difference of the Irish, one ad featured [[Red Lemonade]], the slogan used in English was &quot;Because we're Different&quot; followed by the well known Irish slogan &quot;SÃºil Eile&quot;. Another marketing campaign featured the stars of the channel asking the question &quot;What more do you look for from a station?&quot;, they would be based a various stations such as Train stations and Space stations.

In 1999 with the onset of digital television, TnaG was rebranded as TG4 to strengthen the perception of the brand, from being niche Irish only language channel to mainstream channel with Irish language programmes. The TG4 ident continued with the difference aspect of the channel, that provides an alternative view, the slogan 'Suil Eile' translates literally as 'other eyes' but is also a pun in Irish meaning 'a different view'. The logo takes the G from the orgninal logo, separtates it from the T and the T loses its celtic script look. The promotion of the channel from TnaG to TG4 was done with the use of a caterpillar growing into a butterfly.

During its 1999 rebrand TG4 would now feature a [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] in the top right hand corner on all of TG4's programming, previously a TnaG DOG featured only on [[Oireachtas]] and [[QVC]] broadcasts.

The idents from 1999 to 2004 featured various people playing or messing in the background of the screen before the logo appear with the words SÃºil Eile below the logo.

In 2004, numerous new Idents were developed for the station: Fairies, Bridge, Launderette, Cars, Wrestlers etc. all feature on the new idents. TG4 promotions now feature the seasons Geimhreadh (Winter), Earrach (Spring), Samhair (Summer) and FÃ³mhar (Autumn). The opening ad break ident states &quot;Fan Linn&quot; (stay with us) and the ad break ends with &quot;Seo Linn&quot; (here we are). In Autumn 2010 the season theme was dropped and replaced by a blue cube logo, the idents were updated with the TG4 logo animating up in a different way.

==Northern Ireland==
TG4 was originally only available in [[Northern Ireland]] via 'overspill' of the terrestrial signal from the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In the 1998 [[Belfast Agreement]] there was provision for TG4 (then TnaG) to be made available in Northern Ireland, along with increased recognition of the Irish language. Similarly, while TG4, along with the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s other terrestrial channels, are carried on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Ireland]] there, it was not available to Sky subscribers in Northern Ireland until 18 April 2005 or on [[Virgin Media| Virgin Media NI]] until February 2007.

In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the [[Divis]] transmitter near [[Belfast]], as a result of agreement between the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Northern Ireland Office]] (N.I.O.). However, because of overcrowding on the frequency bands, only a low power signal can be transmitted and reception is still unavailable in many areas, even in parts of Belfast. The channel is, however, available on cable and on to Sky satellite subscribers. It is hoped that the channel can eventually be made available on digital terrestrial services (Freeview) and [[free-to-air]] on satellite.

A report from UK media regulator Ofcom, released in November 2007, suggests that TG4 will be carried on Freeview in the future. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/dttfuture/summary/&lt;/ref&gt;.

On 1 February 2010, the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s Minister for Communications [[Eamon Ryan]] signed an agreement with the UK's [[Ben Bradshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0202/1224263582384.html|title=RTÃ and TG4 to be freely available in North in 2012 | work=The Irish Times | date=2&amp;nbsp;February 2010|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement will enable viewers within [[Northern Ireland]] to watch [[RTÃ One]], [[RTÃ Two]] and TG4 on a [[free-to-air]] basis as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0201/communications.html|title=RTÃ News: Ryan signs TG4 agreement with the British government|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between both jurisdictions will also guarantee that viewers within the Republic will be able to view [[BBC One Northern Ireland]] and [[BBC Two Northern Ireland]] on the Republic's free-to-air service which is to debut in late 2010. A cross-border initiative has always been on the agenda for the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] in [[Ireland]]. However, it was later confirmed that [[BBC Northern Ireland]] services are now to be offered in the Republic on a 'paid for' basis and not the original free-to-air basis.
