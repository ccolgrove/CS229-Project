'''AnÃ­bal AntÃ³nio Cavaco Silva''', [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]] ({{IPA-pt|ÉËniÎ²ÉÉ« kÉËvaku ËsiÉ«vÉ}}; born 15 July 1939), is the President of [[Portugal]]. He won the [[Portuguese presidential election, 2006|Portuguese presidential election]] on 22 January 2006 and was [[Portuguese presidential election, 2011|re-elected]] on 23 January 2011, for a second five-year term. Cavaco Silva was sworn in on 9 March 2006.

He was previously [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] of [[Portugal]] from 6 November 1985 to 28 October 1995. His tenure of ten years was the longest of any Prime Minister since [[AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]], and he was the first Portuguese Prime Minister to have won an absolute parliamentary majority under the current constitutional system (which was established after the country's redemocratization following the [[Carnation Revolution]]).

==Early life and career==
He was born in [[Boliqueime]], [[LoulÃ©]], [[Algarve]], the son of Teodoro GonÃ§alves Silva ([[LoulÃ©]], [[Boliqueime]], Maritenda, 30 August 1912 - 30 September 2007) and wife (m. LoulÃ©, Boliqueime, 4 March 1935) Maria do Nascimento Cavaco (b. [[LoulÃ©]], [[Boliqueime]], Maritenda, 27 December 1912), AnÃ­bal AntÃ³nio Cavaco Silva was an undistinguished student at school. As a 13-year-old, he flunked at the 3rd grade of the Commercial School, and his grandfather put him working on the farm as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://diario.iol.pt/noticia.html?id=637824&amp;div_id=4071 Perfil de Cavaco Silva], [[iol.pt]]&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to school, Cavaco went on to become an accomplished student. Cavaco Silva then went to [[Lisbon]] enrolling at the ''Instituto Superior de CiÃªncias EconÃ³micas e Financeiras de Lisboa (ISCEF)'' of the [[Technical University of Lisbon]] (UTL) (currently the ''Instituto Superior de Economia e GestÃ£o (ISEG)'' of the Technical University of Lisbon), and obtained in 1963, with distinction, a degree in [[economics]] and [[finance]] (he scored a mark of 16 out of 20). While studying in Lisbon, Cavaco Silva was an athlete of [[Centro Desportivo UniversitÃ¡rio de Lisboa|CDUL]] [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] department from 1958 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.record.xl.pt/interior.aspx?content_id=258860 Ãs nas barreiras], [[Record (Portuguese newspaper)|Record]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he married Maria Alves da Silva, a lecturer in [[Germanic philology|Germanic]] [[philology]] at the [[University of Lisbon]], with whom he has two children (Bruno and PatrÃ­cia Maria), and took compulsory military service in the then Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]], as an official of military administration in [[Maputo|LourenÃ§o Marques]] (now the city of Maputo). His teaching career began in 1966 as assistant to ISCEF, but two years later Cavaco Silva went to the [[University of York]], in the [[United Kingdom]], where, in 1973, he was awarded a [[doctorate]] in [[economics]]. His thesis at York was a defense of (then popular) [[Keynesian economics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://puraeconomia.blogspot.com/2004/11/o-esquizofrnico-livro-do-professor.html O esquizofrÃ©nico livro do Professor Cavaco Silva, Pura Economia]&lt;/ref&gt; (Neo-Keynesianism would influence his thought as Prime Minister later and he still self-identifies as a Neo-Keynesian). Returning to Portugal, he took up a post as assistant professor in ISCEF (1974), professor at the [[Catholic University of Portugal]] (1975), extraordinary professor at the [[New University of Lisbon]] (1979) and finally director of the Office of Studies of the [[Bank of Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/lusa/2006/01/22/ult611u70070.jhtm Cavaco Silva - Perfil], source [[AgÃªncia Lusa]]; website [[UOL]] (January 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

He only became active in politics after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974, later that year joining the then PPD, a political party headed by [[Francisco SÃ¡ Carneiro]]. Cavaco Silva, was appointed Minister of Finance by [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] Francisco SÃ¡ Carneiro in 1980. He gained a reputation as an economic liberal, gradually dismantling regulations inhibiting free enterprise. He refused to serve in the [[Center Bloc]] coalition of [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialists]] and [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democrats]] (PSD) that governed from 1983 to 1985, and his election to the leadership of the PSD on 2 June 1985, portended the end of the coalition.

Professor Cavaco Silva has published several academic works in economics, including in subfields like [[monetary policy]] and [[monetary union]]s.

==Decade in power: 1985â1995==
The [[Portuguese legislative election, 1985|election that followed]] was complicated by the arrival of a new political party, the [[Democratic Renovator Party (Portugal)|Democratic Renovator Party]] (PRD) formed by the supporters of the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|President]], [[AntÃ³nio Ramalho Eanes]]. In the 250-member [[Assembly of the Republic]], the nation's legislature, the PRD won 45 seats - at the expense of every party except Cavaco Silva's PSD.  Despite winning less than 30 percent of the vote and 88 seats, the PSD was the only traditional political party not to suffer substantial losses; its 88 seats, in fact, represented a gain of 13 over the previous election. Cavaco Silva became Prime Minister on 6 November 1985.

Tax cuts and economic deregulation and the arrival of EU funds spurred several years of uninterrupted economic growth, which increased Cavaco Silva's popularity. He was hampered, however, by heading a minority government. On most issues, his Social Democrats could rely on the 22 votes of the [[Democratic and Social Centre â PeopleÂ´s Party|Social and Democratic Center Party]] (CDS), but the two parties' combined 110 votes fell 16 short of a parliamentary majority.  The [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialists]] and [[Portuguese Communist Party|Communists]] held 57 and 38 seats respectively; Cavaco Silva could govern if the 45 members of the PRD, who held the balance of power, abstained, as they frequently did. In 1987, however, the PRD withdrew its tacit support, and a parliamentary vote of no confidence forced President [[MÃ¡rio Soares]] to call [[Portuguese legislative election, 1987|an early election]].

The results of the election stunned even the most optimistic of Cavaco Silva's supporters. His Social Democrat party captured 50.2 percent of the popular vote and 148 of the 250 seats in the Assembly of the Republic. Far behind were the Socialists, with only 60 seats, and the Communists, with 31. The CDS and the PRD were virtually wiped out, left with only 4 and 7 seats, respectively.  This was the first time since the 1974 revolution that a single party had won an outright majority in the national parliament.

The [[Portuguese legislative election, 1991|1991 election]] was another triumph for Cavaco Silva; it yielded a majority even larger (50.6 percent) than the one of four years earlier. However, the 1993 European economic crisis, sparking a high unemployment rate, and the country's mistrust of [[Cavaco Silva's Cabinets (1985-95)|long-spanning governments]], eroded his popularity. He decided not to contest the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1995|1995 election]], and the PSD, lacking a leader of his stature, lost 48 seats and the election.

==Out of office: 1995â2006==
Cavaco Silva contested the 1996 [[Portuguese presidential election, 1996|presidential election]], but was defeated by the Mayor of [[Lisbon]], [[Jorge Sampaio]], the Socialist candidate. Retiring from politics, he served for several years as an advisor to the board of the [[Banco de Portugal]] (Bank of Portugal), but retired from this position in 2004. He then became a full professor at the School of Economics and Management of the [[Catholic University of Portugal]], where he taught the undergraduate and MBA programs.

He declined to support [[Pedro Santana Lopes]], whom he branded as a mediocre politician, in the [[Portuguese legislative election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], despite pressure from within his party.

He is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{en}}[http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid is an independent organization dedicated to strengthening democracy around the world by drawing on the unique experience and resources of its Members â 66 democratic former heads of state and government]&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary member of [http://www.raoulwallenberg.net The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation].

==Presidential candidacy and term==
[[File:Cavaco Silva and Barack Obama.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Cavaco Silva escorts US President Barack Obama from Belem National Palace after meeting, Nov 19, 2010]]
On 20 October 2005, Cavaco Silva announced his candidacy in the election, 2006.He was elected president on 22 January 2006 with 50.6% of votes cast, avoiding a run-off. He is the first elected [[centre-right]] president in Portugal since 1974.  He is also the second former Prime Minister to be elected president, following in the footsteps of [[MÃ¡rio Soares]].

He was sworn-in on 9 March 2006. He is also the Head of the [[Portuguese Council of State]].

Cavaco Silva's term was initially marked by a mutual understanding with the government led by Socialist [[JosÃ© SÃ³crates]], which he referred to as &quot;strategic co-operation&quot;. He also avidly encouraged the suppression of partisan differences between the political parties in parliament, as a means of working towards the greater national good, despite the absolute majority held by the Socialist Party. This has led to several controversies, with some branding Cavaco Silva, a practising Roman Catholic and a self-described believer in [[FÃ¡tima]] [[FÃ¡tima#Marian apparitions|apparitions]], as a traitor to the center-right and to some of his own personal beliefs. Nevertheless, this seems to have been a misconception with respect to his presidency. He has, in effect, resorted to his veto power more than MÃ¡rio Soares, who as a President was largely seen as too conflicting with the Government, in the latter's first term.

The most controversial moment of his presidency was when the Assembly of the Republic passed a bill for the holding of a pre-legislative referendum on the legalization of abortion in Portugal without any restrictions in the 10 first weeks of pregnancy. After the parliamentary approval of the bill summoning the referendum, Cavaco Silva referred the matter to the Portuguese Constitutional Court, which declared both the proposed legalization and the referendum constitutional by a narrow 7-6 margin. Cavaco Silva, who could still have vetoed the referendum bill, decided to sign it into law despite pressure from some pro-life sectors, and thus allowed the referendum. The majority of the Portuguese electorate abstained from the referendum, but the vote for legalization prevailed among those who chose to cast their ballot.

==Family==
He married at the Church of the [[Monastery of SÃ£o Vicente de Fora]], SÃ£o Vicente de Fora, Lisbon, on 20 October 1964 Maria Alves da Silva (b. [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]], [[SÃ£o Bartolomeu de Messines]], 31 October 1938), daughter of Francisco dos Santos Silva and wife Adelina de Jesus Pincho, with whom he has had two children:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=277263 AnÃ­bal AntÃ³nio Cavaco Silva], GeneAll.net&lt;/ref&gt;
