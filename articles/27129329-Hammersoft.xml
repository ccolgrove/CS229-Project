==History==
===2008-2010===
'''Sci-Fi Channel''' was a Japanese television channel broadcasting from 1 April 2008 until 1 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/entertainment/view/sci-fi-channel-to-begin-broadcasting-throughout-japan|title=SCI FI Channel to begin broadcasting throughout Japan|publisher=Japan Today|date=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnext.in/news/131/ARTICLE/1435/2008-05-30.html|title=NBC to launch SCI FI and Universal Channels|publisher=TV Next|date=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The was the result of an agreement between NBC Universal and [[Jupiter Telecommunications]] for NBC Universal to acquire Jupiter Telecommunications' subsidiary company JSBC2 and launch Sci Fi Channel on J:COM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/visual-effects/nbcu-goes-jupiter-japanese-sci-fi|title=NBCU Goes to Jupiter for Japanese Sci Fi|publisher=AWN News|date=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the terms of the agreement, NBC Universal acquired 100% of the equity of JSBC2, which held the broadcasting license for Reality TV on the [[SKY PerfecTV!]] platform in Japan.

Sci-Fi Channel was rebranded in the US on July 7, 2009 as [[Syfy]] as part of a global rebrand. Sci-Fi Channel in Japan did not adopt it because it was rebranded in the merger with [[Universal Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onscreenasia.com/article-6842-universalchannellaunchesinjapan-onscreenasia.html|title=Universal Channel launches in Japan|publisher=OnScreen Asia|date=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sci-Fi occupies a programming block on Universal Channel. The channel's website no longer exists, instead redirecting to The Universal Channel's website.
===2010===
On April 1, 2010, Sci-Fi Channel (Japan) was rebranded into Universal Channel (Japan); a Syfy programming block later premiered.
