'''Australian art''' incorporates art made in Australia or about Australian subjects since [[Prehistory of Australia|prehistoric]] times. This includes [[Australian Aboriginal art]], Australian Colonial art, [[Landscape]], [[Atelier Method|Atelier]], [[Modernist]] and [[Contemporary art]]. The visual arts have a long history in Australia, with evidence of Aboriginal art dating back at least 30,000 years. Australia has produced many notable artists from both [[Western art|Western]] and [[Indigenous Australian]] traditions including the late 19th century [[Heidelberg School]] impressionists, central Australian [[Hermannsburg School]] watercolourists, [[Western Desert Art Movement]], [[Heide Circle]] of Modernists, and the expatriates who worked in London in the nineteen sixties. Mid twentieth century Modernist figuration prevails in the Australian art market, prominent artists are [[Ian Fairweather]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Arthur Boyd]], [[Russell Drysdale]], [[Brett Whiteley]], [[John Brack]], [[Jeffrey Smart]] and [[Charles Blackman]]. [[Rosalie Gascoigne]], [[John Olsen (artist)|John Olsen]] and [[Fred Williams]] are exceptions whose landscapes border on abstractions. [[Harold Cazneaux]] and [[Max Dupain]] are noted for their modernist photography. Most of the celebrated artists of past decades have become less noted after their deaths, such as painters [[John Perceval]], [[William Dobell]], [[Lloyd Rees]] and [[Donald Friend]]. Since the late Nineteen-nineties, senior Indigenous artists and Baby Boomer and Generation X contemporary artists have commanded a rapidly increasing share of the Australian art market. 

Australia has a number of major museums and galleries, including the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]], [[National Portrait Gallery (Australia)|National Portrait Gallery of Australia]] and [[National Museum of Australia]] in Canberra, and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney. Notable Indigenous sites have been set aside as [[UNESCO]] listed areas such as those at [[Uluru]] and [[Kakadu National Park]].

[[William Barak]] (c.1824-1903) was one of the last traditionally educated of the [[Wurundjeri]]-willam, people who come from the district now incorporating the city of Melbourne. He remains notable for his artworks which recorded traditional Aboriginal ways for the education of Westerners (which remain on permanent exhibition at the [[Ian Potter Centre]] of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] and at the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]]. [[Margaret Preston]] (1875â1963) was among the early non-indigenous painters to incorporate Aboriginal influences in her works. [[Albert Namatjira]] (1902â1959) is one of the most famous Australian artists and an [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] man. His landscapes inspired the [[Hermannsburg School]] of art.&lt;ref&gt;www.hermannsburgschool.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Elizabeth Durack]] are notable for their fusion of Western and indigenous influences. Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints - with styles such as that of the [[Western Desert Art Movement]] becoming globally renowned 20th century art movements.

The [[National Gallery of Australia]] exhibits a great many indigenous art works, including those of the [[Torres Strait Islands]]  who are known for their traditional sculpture and headgear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/ATSIArt/Index.cfm nga.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1770-1900==

The first artistic representations of the Australia scene by European artists were mainly &quot;natural-history art&quot;, depicting the distinctive flora and fauna of the land  for scientific purposes. [[Sydney Parkinson]], the [[Botanical illustrator]] on [[James Cook]]'s 1770 voyage that first charted the eastern coastline of Australia, made a large number of such drawings under the direction of naturalist [[Joseph Banks]]. Many of these drawings were met with skepticism when taken back to Europe, for example claims that the [[platypus]] was a hoax. 

Despite Banks' suggestions, no professional natural-history artist sailed on the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, so until the turn of the century all drawings made in the colony were by soldiers, including British naval officers George Raper and [[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]], and convict artists, including [[Thomas Watling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot;&gt;James Gleeson, Australian Painting. Edited by John Henshaw. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these drawings are by unknown artists. Most are in the style of naval draughtsmanship. Most of these drawings were of [[Natural history]] topics, specifically birds, and a few depict the infant colony itself.

Several professional natural-history illustrators accompanied expeditions in the early 19th century, including [[Ferdinand Bauer]] (who travelled with [[Matthew Flinders]]), and [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], who travelled with a French expedition led by [[Nicolas Baudin]]. The first resident professional artist was [[John Lewin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt; who arrived in 1800 and published two volumes of natural history art, while ornothologist [[John Gould]] was renowned for his illustration's of the country's birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt;

As well as natural history, there were some ethnographic portraiture of [[Aboriginal Australian]]s, particularly in the 1830s. Artists included [[Augustus Earle]] in [[New South Wales]] and in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt;

Art in Australia from 1788 onward is often narrated as the gradual shift from a European sense of light to an Australian one. The lighting in Australia is notably different to that of Europe, and early attempts at landscapes attempted to reflect this.

[[Conrad Martens]] (1801â1878) worked from 1835 to 1878 as a professional artist, painting many landscapes and was commercially successful.  His work, though, is regarded as softening the landscape to fit European sensibilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt; Martens is remembered for accompanying scientist [[Charles Darwin]] on the [[HMS Beagle]].

Another significant landscape artist of this era was [[John Glover (artist)|John Glover]].

[[S. T. Gill]] (1818â1880) documented life on the Australian gold fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt;

A few attempts at art exhibitions were made in the 1840s, which attracted a number of artists but were commercial failures.  By the 1850s however, regular exhibitions became popular, with a variety of art types represented.  The first such was in 1854 in [[Melbourne]].  An art museum, which eventually became the [[National Gallery of Victoria]], was founded in 1861, and began to collect Australian works as well as gathering a collection of European masters.  Some of the artists of note included [[Eugene von Guerard]], [[William Strutt]], and [[Louis Buvelot]].

The colonial art market primarily desired landscape paintings, which were commissioned by wealthy landowners or merchants wanting to record their material success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/OceantoOutback/pdf/O2OEDUKIT.pdf nga.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knut Bull]] (1811â1889) was sentenced to fourteen years transportation in 1845, and after doing time at [[Norfolk Island]] arrived in [[Van Diemenâs Land]] in 1846. From 1849 he was permitted to work as an artist and by 1853 had received a conditional pardon. Bull created such history paintings as ''The Wreck of the George III'' in 1850 and is noted for his scenes of early colonial [[Hobart]].

[[William Piguenit]]'s (1836â1914) &quot;Flood in the Darling&quot; was collected by the National Gallery of New South Wales in 1895.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;McCulloch, Alan McCulloch, Susan McCulloch &amp; Emily McCulloch Childs: ''McCullochâs Encyclopedia of Australian Art'' Melbourne University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Withers]] (1854â1914) won the inaugural [[Wynne Prize]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Alan McCulloch, Golden Age of Australian Painting: Impressionism and the Heidelberg School&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first Australians artists to gain a reputation overseas was the impressionist [[John Peter Russell]] during the 1880s. Another notable expatriate artist of the era was [[Rupert Bunny]], a painter of landscape, allegory and sensual and intimate portraits.

The origins of distinctly Australian painting is often associated with the [[Heidelberg School]] of the 1880s-1890s. Artists such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Tom Roberts]] applied themselves to recreating in their art a truer sense of light and colour as seen in Australian landscape. Like the European Impressionists, they painted in the open air. These artists found inspiration in the unique light and colour which characterises the [[Australian bush]]. Some see strong connections between the art of the school and the wider [[Impressionist]] movement, while others point to earlier traditions of plain air painting elsewhere in Europe. Sayers states that ''&quot;there remains something excitingly original and indisputably important in the art of the 1880s and 1890s&quot;'', and that by this time ''&quot;something which could be described as an Australian tradition began to be recognized&quot;''.

Key figures in the School were [[Tom Roberts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; [[Arthur Streeton]] (1867â1943),&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Alan McCulloch, Golden Age of Australian Painting: Impressionism and the Heidelburg School&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick McCubbin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; and [[Charles Conder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Their most recognised work involves scenes of pastoral and wild Australia, featuring the vibrant, even harsh colours of Australian summers.  The name itself comes from a camp Roberts and Streeton set up at a property near [[Heidelberg, Victoria|Heidelberg]], at the time on the rural outskirts of [[Melbourne]].  Some of their paintings received international recognition, and many remain embedded in Australia's popular consciousness both inside and outside the art world. [[Jane Sutherland]] (1853â1928), noted for her [[En plein air]] technique, was a student of McCubbin.

Nature loving artists of previous generations are numerous, however some of the more idiosyncratic examples were [[Merric Boyd]] (1862â1940) and [[Sydney Long]] (1871â1955).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Long's early paintings were influenced by the symbolists, art nouveau and partly by the Heidelberg School.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

|accessdate=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early twentieth century saw some Australian artists making their careers in Europe. These include impressionist [[John Peter Russell]], bohemian painters like [[Rupert Bunny]] (1864â1947) and [[Agnes Goodsir]], printmaker Hall Thorpe, a religious man who intended to make spiritually uplifting work, and the internationally renowned sculptor [[Bertram Mackennal]].

Arthur Streeton was a plein air painter who continued to be highly successful in the first part of the twentieth century. The romanticist view of Australian rural scenes was shared with [[Hans Heysen]] (1877â1968), an artist famous for his luminous watercolour paintings of River Red Gums, won the Wynne Prize nine times from 1904 to 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

[[Bertram Mackennal]], (1863â1931) was a well known sculptor from this era, particularly for his rendition of Circe the Greek magic goddess.

Leading up to [[World War I]], the decorative arts, including miniature, watercolour painting, and functional objects such as vases, became more prominent in the Australian arts scene.  [[Norman Lindsay]]'s (1879â1969) watercolours of baccanalian nudes caused considerable scandal around the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Bernard: Lindsay, Norman Alfred William (1879â1969) Australian Dictionary of Biography [http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100676b.htm Lindsay, Norman Alfred Williams (1879â1969) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt; One famous drawing, ''Pollice Verso'' (1904), caused his first scandal, as it depicted [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] giving the thumbs down to [[Christ]] on the Cross.  There were the fashionable artists such as J.W. Tristram, who did misty Corot-influenced watercolors of the bush and beach.

[[George Washington Lambert]] was a prominent painter and sculptor of early twentieth century Australia who moved between decorative arts and portraiture, and is a notable war artist (World War I).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

After [[World War I]], early proponents of modernist art in Australia were cubist influenced [[Roy de Maistre]] (1894â1968).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; and [[Margaret Preston]], and the post-impressionist [[Grace Cossington Smith]]. European Modernist art had fierce critics such as Norman Lindsay, who wrote for the nationalist publication The Bulletin, and the idiosyncratic teacher Max Meldrum. Ironically the [[Max Meldrum]]-led [[Australian Tonalism]] movement, which rejected modernist art and promoted a unique form of painting in accordance with Meldrum's theories of art, has since been recognized as a precursor to Modernist forms of art, including Minimalism, and art historian [[Bernard William Smith]] noted that Meldrum is perhaps the only Australian artist to develop and practice his own fully formulated theory of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce McGrath, Bernard Smith. [http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100466b.htm Meldrum, Duncan Max (1875â1955)], [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]. Retrieved on 5 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Meldrum's student [[Clarice Beckett]] was rediscovered in the 2000s.

Popular illustrators of children's books were [[May Gibbs]], [[Ida Rentoul Outhwaite]] and [[Dorothy Wall]] (1894â1942) (the creator of [[Blinky Bill]] the Koala).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120406b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

1921 saw the founding of the [[Archibald Prize]], Australia's most famous art prize, for [[portrait]]ure, though defining portraiture has always caused controversy - most notably in 1943 when [[William Dobell]]'s semi caraciture portrait of an artist friend won the prize and was challenged in court on the basis that it was a caricature, not a portrait.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

Art deco made its mark in advertising posters, architecture and consumer goods, as well as fine art. In 1934 the [[ANZAC War Memorial|ANZAC Memorial]] in Sydney's [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] was built and featured the sculpture &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; by [[Rayner Hoff]] (1894â1937). The decorative art deco arches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge embody Australian fondness for the fashionable modernist style.  Australia's most iconic [[Art Deco]] painting, Australian Beach Pattern was painted by Charles Meere (1890â1961) in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Modernism in the fine arts, however, continued to be a fledgling movement in the 1930s.

Works of watercolour or pastel on paper have for many years been less marketable than [[oil painting]]s on board or canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedumba.org.au/speech_meagher.php Meagher, Roddy: Opening speech, Kedumba Drawing Award, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chanin, Eileen: Collecting art : masterpieces, markets and money. Roseville, N.S.W. Craftsman House, 1990. ISBN 978-976-8097-00-2&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reflected in the historical cheaper pricing of key Australian artists who worked on paper, including expressionist-surrealist [[Joy Hester]], romanticist landscape painter [[Hans Heysen]], modernists Frank and Muriel Medworth, landscape painters [[Albert Namatjira]] and Kenneth MacQueen, [[Bauhaus]] trained teacher [[Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack]] and the master printmaker [[Murray Griffin]], famous for his prints of birds.

[[Social realism]] in the forties and fifties involved Herbert Badham, Jacqueline Hick (1919â2004), [[Noel Counihan]] (1913â1986), [[Herbert McClintock]] (1906â1985) and [[Roy Dalgarno]] (1910â2001). [[Yosl Bergner]] (1920-) worked in Australia in this decade.

[[Cubism]] was an enduring influence on painting. [[Grace Crowley]] is remembered as one of the key cubist influenced painters. Abstractionist Godfrey Miller (1893â1964) was influenced by cubism and the mystical writings of [[Rudolf Steiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, John (ed): Godfrey Miller, Darlinghurst Galleries, 1965. in ''Godfrey Miller: An Abridged Chronology. [http://www.hugen.no/fedraheimen/miller04.htm hugen.no]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s a new generation of artists began experimenting with styles such as [[surrealism]] and other techniques. [[James Gleeson]] (1915â2008) eventually became recognised as Australia's most significant surrealist painter. [[Robert Klippel]] (1920â2001) a constructivist and surrealist influenced sculptor who was influenced by industrial settings. Klippel also collaborated with Gleeson.

In Melbourne [[Arthur Boyd]] (1920â1999)&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, Art Today. Phaidon Press Limited. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]] (1914â1999) were prominent,&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt; and a number of artists spent time at [[Heide Museum of Modern Art|Heide]], a house in Heidelberg - the site of the Heidelberg school several decades before.  Amongst the artists who spent time there were [[Joy Hester]] (1920â1960)&lt;ref&gt;Janine Burke, Joy Hester. Greenhouse, 1983. ISBN 909104603 : 0909104603&lt;/ref&gt;  and, the internationally well known painter [[Sidney Nolan]] (1917â1992), the best artist of the immediate postwar period, whose iconic [[Ned Kelly]] images are probably better known than the artist himself.  The effect of the [[Ern Malley]] poetry case, its cover illustrated by Nolan, also reflected around the art world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

[[Olive Cotton]] and [[Max Dupain]] went onto successful photography careers after studying with the early modernist photographer [[Harold Cazneaux]]. [[George Caddy]]'s beachobatics photography was influenced by what he saw in American Life magazine. [[Wolfgang Sievers]] (1913â2007) arrived in Australia in August 1938. He specialised in architectural and industrial photography.
In 1946, [[Helmut Newton]] (1920â2004) established himself as a fashion photographer in [[Melbourne]].

An art centre was established at [[Pukatja, South Australia|Ernabella]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24871790-16947,00.html | title=Cosmopolitan life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art centeres are an important factor in the story of the development of contemporary aboriginal art.

In the 1950s Scottish expatriate [[Ian Fairweather]] (1891â1974) settled on [[Bribie Island]], South-East Queensland, and produced calligraphic paintings influenced by the arts of China and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;James Gleeson, Australian Painting. Edited by John Henshaw. Landsdowne Press 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Various influences from Chinese art did not gain equal acceptance in Western art. The early acceptance of Fairweather as an artistic hero in the Forties is in sharp contrast to the resistance American composer [[John Cage]] faced when he debuted his alleatory compositions to American audiences in the Fifties.

[[Abstract expressionism]] was an influence in artists Ralph Balson (1890â1964), influential art teachers John Passmore and [[Desiderius Orban]], Carl Plate (1907â1977), [[Inge King]], [[Nancy Borlase]] (1914â2006), William Rose, [[Tony Tuckson]] (1921â1973) Tom Gleghorn, Ann Thomson, Stan Rapotec, [[Clement Meadmore]] (1929â2005) and Yvonne Audette (1930-). Meadmore became a well known artist in New York. Tuckson's work is featured on the cover of the 2006 edition of the prestigious McCullouch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art.

[[George Johnson (artist)|George Johnson]], a paragon of the Melbourne [[geometric abstraction]]ist joked about in [[David Williamson]]'s [[Emerald City (play)|Emerald City]] (1987), held his first exhibition in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

Artists demonstratively concerned with Australian identity [[Albert Tucker (artist)|Albert Tucker]], [[Clifton Pugh]], [[Barry Humphries]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Arthur Boyd]], [[Fred Williams]], for example) had great success with the public. The [[Fred Williams]] (1927â1982) exhibition &quot;Fred Williams - Landscapes of a Continent&quot; was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York in 1977. Williams is now regarded as one of the definitive painters of the Australian landscape. Williams is known for his aerial abstractions of the arid Australian inland, and suggest the viewer is in an aircraft, flying above the land.  [[Russell Drysdale]] (1912â1981), a painter of outback scenes, represented Australia at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1954. Drysdale, [[William Dobell]] (1899â1970), [[Eric Thake]] (1904â1982) and the cartoonist [[Paul Rigby]] (1924â2006) helped to shape the visual archetype of the plain, hearty Australian.

Figurative artists popular in the sixties also included [[Ainslie Roberts]] (1911â1993), [[Jeffrey Smart]],&lt;ref&gt;Smart, Jeffrey: Not quite straight: a memoir. Random House 2000. ISBN 978-0-09-184198-0&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Blackman]],&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt; [[Robert Dickerson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt; [[Donald Friend]] (1915â1989)&lt;ref name=&quot;James Gleeson 1971&quot; /&gt; and [[John Brack]] who is one of the highest regarded figurative painters today.

[[Richard Larter]] arrived in Australia in 1962 and started a long career in pop painting,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; with the female nude being the subject of many of his works. Mike Brown (1938â1997) and Peter Powditch were early Australian pop artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

[[Psychedelic|Psychedelia]] in 1960s Australian art was not common, a famous example is the cover of the Cream album [[Disraeli Gears]] (1967), created by [[Martin Sharp]]. [[Vernon Treweeke]] was briefly a star of psychedelic painting.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au&quot;&gt;Loxley, Anne: Mixed Media in Frame, Sydney Morning Herald, 31 December 2004. [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/31/1072546581425.html Mixed media in frame - www.smh.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vivienne Binns]] exhibition of paintings at Watters Gallery in 1967 was notoriously genre defying and established her position as a contemporary of the [[Feminist art movement]].

Definitive events in the late sixties included the exhibition of Hard Edged Abstraction ''The Field'' at the National Gallery of Victoria, Charlie Numbulmoore painting his famous Wandjina spirit figures, The [[Power Institute of Fine Arts]] was established in 1968 eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney]], and Christo and Jean-Claude's wrapping of Little Bay in Sydney.

In 1971-2 art teacher Geoffrey Bardon encouraged the Aboriginal people of Papunya to paint their Dreamtime stories on canvas, leading to the development of the Papunya Tula school, or 'dot art' which has become possibly Australia's most recognisable style of art worldwide. [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]] (1932â2002), Long Jack Phillipus Tjakamarra and William Sandy are some of the best known Papunya artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

The abstractionist John Passmore (1904â1984) was part of the inspiration for the artist Hurtle Duffield in [[Patrick White]]'s novel [[The Vivisector]] (1970). Decades later in 2003, Passmore's friends Elinor and Fred Wrobel converted a pub into the Passmore Museum. It is one of the few museums in Australia dedicated solely to one artist's life and work. Passmore was a teacher of [[John Olsen (artist)|John Olsen]] (1928-), an innovative and original landscape painter. Patrick White's art collecting efforts are to this day generally unadmired but he was a collector of modernist art and an early collector of the sort of art that later came to be known as [[Postmodernism]], including art by [[James Clifford (artist)|James Clifford]], [[Imants Tillers]], Frank Littler, Robert Boynes, Patricia Moylan, [[John Davis (sculptor)|John Davis]] (1936â1999), and Tony Coleing.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Helen Verity: Partick White, Painter Manque.

ISBN 978-0-7329-0824-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists founded alternate practices apart from commercial galleries and art museums. Performance art and interactive art in communities throughout Australia saw the development of public art and community projects. [[Vivienne Binns]] project &quot;Mothers' Memories Others' Memories&quot; at UNSW and Blacktown was a ground breaking participatory project. Other artists around Australia, such as Anne Newmarch in Adelaide were involved in these kinds of practices.&lt;ref&gt;National Foundation for Australian Women: Women's Art Movement (1976 - ) [http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE1034b.htm Women's Art Movement - Organisation - The Australian Women's Register]&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance artists of the 70s included Ken Unsworth, [[Mike Parr]], Mike Kitching, Philippa Cullen (1950â1975),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiadancing.org/apps/ad?action=ViewSubject&amp;id=4301&amp;resourceType=All Australia Dancing: Philippa Cullen (1950â1975)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haines, David: Open Source Art School, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan Durrant, Pat Larter (1936â1996) and Jill Orr. Installation artists of this decade included Kevin Mortensen, [[Rosalie Gascoigne]] (1917â1999), Ti Parks and Tony Trembath.

Building on the innovations of [[photomontage]] and artists such as [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925â2008), [[Man Ray]] (1890â1976), [[Gerhard Richter]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], urban Australian artists were fascinated by the creative nexus of photography and painting. Painters combined painterliness with the look of photography (Carl Plate, [[Richard Larter]], James Clifford (1936â1987),&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalano, Gary 1968&quot;&gt;Catalano, Gary: The Years of Hope - Australian art and art criticism 1959-1968.

Those artists found limited but enthusiastic audiences.

Julia Ciccarone circumvented the trend with her [[Trompe-l'Åil]] paintings. In the world of [[Rock music]], [[Richard Lowenstein]] was creating similar graphic effects using grainy overlays, as he did for the [[Hunters &amp; Collectors]] video &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot; (1982).

Experimental film and video was documented from the 1970s by Arthur and Corinne Cantrill, a couple of filmmakers with an interest in surrealist films publishing ''Cantrill's Filmnotes''. In this format, innovative art was made outside of the commercial and public gallery system. Innovative and internationally recognised art videos from this era were ''Despair'' (1982) by industrial music innovators [[SPK (band)|SPK]] and ''Human Jukebox'' (c.1986) by [[The Scientists]].

Some depictions of [[angst]] and human suffering in the late 20th century were:
[[Peter Booth]]'s [[dystopia]]n expressionist paintings.&lt;ref name=&quot;drury1987&quot;&gt;[[Nevill Drury|Drury, Nevill]]. ''New Art Series''  Roseville, New South Wales: Craftsman House 1987-1993&lt;/ref&gt;

David McDiarmid (1952â1995), Peter Tully (1947â1992) and society photographer William Yang used their art to raise awareness of the [[AIDS]] epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;*Ted Gott, et al., Don't Leave Me This Way : Art In The Age Of AIDS National Gallery of Australia, Canberra 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feneley, Stephen: William Yang and the Art of Society, The Space, ABC Online 2003 [http://www.abc.net.au/arts/visual/stories/s424388.htm]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Epidemic]] levels within Australia).

Their styles were akin to cinematic [[Black comedy]]. Tracey Moffatt's series &quot;Scarred for Life&quot; treated psychological suffering in a [[Camp (style)|camp]] but heartfelt way.  Bill Henson's unsettling depictions of teenager's suburbia were grim&lt;ref name=&quot;New South Wales 1990&quot;&gt;The readymade boomerang : certain relations in 20th century art : Art Gallery of New South Wales, Bond Stores 3/4, Millers Point, 11 April-3 June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; depictions of revelry.

[[Ken Done]]'s work has featured on the cover of the weekly Japanese magazine [[Hanako (magazine)|Hanako]] for over ten years. In 1999, Done was asked to create a series of works for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies programs of the Sydney [[2000 Olympic Games]]. Done and Hart became role models for artists who aspired to commercial success. Done's success is primarily as a designer of mass market goods, but he has gone on to be a painter, mainly of scenes of Sydney Harbour.

Redback Graphix produced some striking didactic poster art in the 80s and 90s, raising awareness of drink driving, sexually transmitted diseases, racism and workplace harassment.

The most famous performance piece of 1988 was [[Burnum Burnum]]'s planting of an Aboriginal flag on the [[white cliffs of Dover]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Burnum Burnum (1936â1997) was an Aboriginal rights activist protesting the lack of legal recognition of Aboriginal ownership of [[Terra Australis]] prior to British settlement.

The proliferation of [[Australia's big things]] developed an ironic cult following, and  Maria Kozic took the joke a step further with her schlock billboard &quot;Maria Kozic is BITCH&quot; (1989).&lt;ref name=&quot;New South Wales 1990&quot;/&gt; On the serious side, [[Cultural history|cultural historians]] in Australia joined the global vogue for writing about [[Car culture]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pickett, Charles 1998&quot;&gt;Pickett, Charles (ed): Cars and culture: our driving passions.

University of Western Sydney Institute for Cultural Research. 1997 ISBN 978-1-86341-506-4&lt;/ref&gt; In public art there was the introduction of sculptural features on concrete noise barriers along freeways.

A grunge art movement occurred, mainly in Sydney in the 90s.  It included Destiny Deacon,&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au&quot;/&gt; Nike Savvas, Hany Armanious and [[Adam Cullen]], amongst others. Cullen's works evolved out of an unfortunate place he calls &quot;Loserville&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Art and Australia (eds): Current: Contemporary Art from Australia and New Zealand.

Another angry artist was [[Gordon Bennett (artist)|Gordon Bennett]], whose paintings were of white Australia's mistreatment of Indigenous Australians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; Many artists chose distinctly more cheerful subject matter but they did not earn the esteemed reputation of [[Margaret Olley]], a painter of still life floral arrangements and domestic interiors.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Barry, with contributions by Barry Humphries, Jeffrey Smart, Christine France: Margaret Olley. Art Gallery of New South Wales, 1996. ISBN 978-0-7310-8898-0  0731094514&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboriginal artists using western medium such as [[Emily Kngwarreye]] (c.1910-1996), [[Rover Thomas]] (c.1926â1998) and [[Freddy Timms]] have become known internationally and [[Emily Kngwarreye]] is regarded as a &quot;genius&quot; by curator Akira Tatehata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboriginalartdirectory.com/news/feature/emily-kame-kngwarreye-in-osaka.php Aboriginal Art Directory: Emily Kame Kngwarreye in Osaka, 18.03.08]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Burn]], the leading conceptual artist, died in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;New South Wales 1990&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hutak.com/articles/1993/09/ian-burn-lost-in-rescue-drama.html Hutak, Michael: Ian Burn Lost in Rescue Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the few Australian artists to contribute to a new international art movement ([[Art and Language]]).

Expatriate artists made their mark in Britain. In 1979, [[Russell Mulcahy]] directed the influential [[Video Killed the Radio Star]] for [[The Buggles]]. The story of that video is featured in a documentary by the same name. [[Leigh Bowery]] (1961â1994) was a performance artist working in London, famously called &quot;modern art on legs&quot; by [[Boy George]]. [[Ron Mueck]] became known for his oversize lifelike sculptures. [[Marc Newson]] is a particularly successful industrial designer.

Sculptor [[Rosalie Gascoigne]]&lt;ref name=&quot;New South Wales 1990&quot;/&gt; was increasingly well known for her assemblages of cut up wood, most distinctively cut up road signs.

Juan DÃ¡vila specialised in sensationalised statements about social hipocrisy. Guan Wei, an artist of the post-[[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square Massacre]] era, delved into geopolitical issues of the Asia-Pacific. [[Tracey Moffatt]] was arguably the most celebrated Australian contemporary artist of the 1990s, her work involved the slickness of advertising and accurately diverse artistic representations of women. [[Stelarc]] is one of the country's most prominent performance artists and was known for his technology inspired transhuman pieces in the 1990s.

The late [[Arthur Boyd]] had donated the Shoalhaven River property [[Bundanon]] to the Australian people, and this property became a new focal point for artists in residence. Artist residencies began there in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; [[Michael Leunig]] the cartoonist followed [[Arthur Boyd]]'s prolific lyricism.

[[Garry Shead]] and John Kelly emerged as popular figurative painters in this decade.

A large proportion of artists work with paint on canvas, in styles such as classical realism, pop, magic realism, expressionism and abstraction.
A number of Australian artists have recently been official [[war artist]]s for the [[Australian War Memorial]] such as [[Wendy Sharpe]] and [[Rick Amor]] for the [[East Timor]] peacekeeping mission; [[George Gittoes]] in [[Somalia]]; [[Peter Churcher]] in the â[[War on Terrorism]]â, and [[Lewis Miller (Australian artist)|Lewis Miller]] in the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. [[Soundtrack to War|Gittoes is also a documentary maker.]]

[[Ricky Swallow]] represented Australia in Venice in 2005. Swallow became known for his wooden carvings of skulls and constructions of bicycles.  Artists making lifelike models has been a growing trend, and [[Patricia Piccinini]]'s [[Biotechnology|biotech]] showstopper The Young Family was publicised in 2003. A counterpoint to this is artists making crude models, wallowing in the materials used for their construction. [[Soft sculpture]] in Australian art may be traced back to Jutta Feddersen in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Jack, with Fay Bottrell and Wesley Stacey: The artist craftsman in Australia. Crows Nest, N.S.W. Jack Pollard Publications, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the newly updated [[Alan McLeod McCulloch|McCulloch]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Australian Art'' featured an extensive section on [[Indigenous Australian art|Aboriginal Art]].  Inclusion in the encyclopedia is dependent on the artist being included in a public gallery and or having won an art prize of note. The practice of [[carpetbagging]] has damaged the reputation of the Aboriginal art market and recently there has been the introduction of a royalty system for all Australian artists. Previously, the Australian Indigenous Art Trade Association and the Australian Commercial Galleries Association was formed to promote ethical standards across the art industry. Aboriginal art has also suffered from critics tending to compare it unfavourably to western ideals and standards. The art buying public has generally ignored these critiques. Collecting milestones in the noughties included the Molly Gowing donation to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, also the publication of ''Beyond Sacred: Recent painting from Australiaâs remote Aboriginal Communities: The Collection of Colin and Elizabeth Laverty''.  In 2011 the Felton Bequest gifted one of the greatest collections of Western Desert and Central Desert paintings to the National Gallery of Victoria.

Significant [[contemporary Indigenous Australian art]]ists include Polly Ngal, Lofty Bardayal Nadjamerrek, [[Bronwyn Bancroft]], Barbara Weir, [[Naata Nungurrayi]], Kathleen Ngala, Shorty Jangala Robertson, Jimmy Baker, Tommy Watson, [[Kathleen Petyarre]], [[Gloria Petyarre]], [[Paddy Bedford|Paddy Bedford (aka Goowoomji)]] (circa 1922 - 2007), [[John Mawurndjul]],&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.news.com.au&quot;/&gt; [[Minnie Pwerle]] (c.1915-2006), [[Makinti Napanangka]], Ningura Napurrula, Nurapayai Nampitjinpa (Mrs Bennett), Dorothy Napangardi Robinson, Bill Whiskey Tjapaltjarri (circa 1920-2008), Regina Wilson, Angelina Ngal, Abie Loy Kemarre, Sarrita King, Ian Abdulla, Helen McCarthy Tyalmuty, [[Wintjiya Napaltjarri]], [[Josepha Petrick Kemarre]], Tommy Mitchell, Willy Tjungurrayi, Cowboy Lou Pwerle, Brook Andrew,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Ken Thaiday. Anna Price Petyarre is one of the more dynamic mid-career painters.

Like their overseas counterparts, Australian artists of various generations have taken up the conveniences of the digital revolution with [[Electronic commerce]], artist blogging, photo sharing sites. Curating by computer, [[Modding]] and [[Street Art|street art]] are shared over the internet. A new breed of artists have to some extent bypassed gallery hire spaces and the art world establishment, posting homemade [[manga]] on [[DeviantArt]] and displaying art on sites like RedBubble and [[MySpace]]. Talented and unrepresented photographers often find their way onto [[Flickr]] and similar sites. These practices are for commercial reasons and sometimes art for art's sake. Oleh Witer was one of the early artists to exhibit artworks in the virtual world [[Second Life]].  Art auction houses began to hold auctions online. Art sellers started using sites not exclusively used for art such as [[EBay]].

Leading ceramacists and glass artists include [[Gwyn Hanssen Pigott]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Merran Esson, [[Thancoupie]] (1937â2011), [[Marea Gazzard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; Peter Rushforth,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; Noel Hart, Klaus Moje, Pippin Drysdale, Yasmin Smith and Cedar Prest. The ceramics scene in Australia is generally scholarly, restrained and less parochical than in other categories of Australian contemporary art. Studio glass artists tend to be more individualistic in comparison to potters.

[[Installation art]]ists include [[Fiona Margaret Hall|Fiona Hall]],&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.news.com.au&quot;/&gt; Guan Wei,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; Nike Savvas, [[Fiona Foley]], Scott Redford, [[Asher Bilu]], Justene Williams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/archived/2009/justene_williams|title=Justene Williams: Bighead garbageface guards ghost Derr Sonata |year=2009|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Berkowitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/main/read/7290|title=Lauren Berkowitz|work=Dictionary of Australian Artists Online|publisher=University of New South Wales|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronox, and Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Regional galleries became crucial players in the contemporary art scene. Significant shows at regional galleries included a survey of contemporary [[outsider art]] at Orange Regional Gallery, and a survey of the important commercial Gallery A and Anne Judell at Campbelltown Regional Gallery, [[Lawrence Daws]] at Caloundra Regional Art Gallery and the Janet Dawson survey at Bathurst Regional Gallery. Boofheads and Scrubbers Revenge at Penrith Regional Gallery reflected shifting patterns of wealth and social mobility during the noughties.

The major new private art galleries were the Sherman Contemporary Art Foundation, White Rabbit and MONA (Museum of Old And New Art). These galleries are predominantly devoted to contemporary art.

== Fraud ==
Like the larger art markets in the northern hemisphere, [[fraud]] is a problem in Australian art. There is no public database of known fraudsters to date, although they are known to come from Australia and other areas ranging from Europe, China to southeast Asia. In addition to the growing number of faked paintings of artists including Minnie Pwerle, Charles Blackman and Robert Dickerson, sometimes galleries and art dealers are impersonated over the internet. The major commercial art magazines have websites with the correct links to their client's websites.

Shoddy auction practices are common, for instance low attention to provenance, pseudo collections where art market dross is implied to be part of a collector's personal effects, and ramping, where prices for artworks are manipulated (inflated at auction).
