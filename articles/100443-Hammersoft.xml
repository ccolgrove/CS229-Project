'''Sheringham Park''' is a landscape park and gardens near the town of [[Sheringham]], [[Norfolk]], England.&lt;ref name=osexp252&gt;Ordnance Survey (2002). ''OS Explorer Map 252 - Norfolk Coast East''. ISBN 0-319-21888-0.&lt;/ref&gt; The park surrounds Sheringham Hall and has a [[British national grid reference system|grid reference]] of {{gbmappingsmall|TG133416}}. The Hall is privately occupied, but Sheringham Park is in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and open to visitors.

The park was designed by [[Humphry Repton]]&lt;ref&gt;Landscapes of Taste: The Art of Humphry Repton's Red Books (Classical Tradition in Architecture) (Hardcover) ISBN 0415415039&lt;/ref&gt; who presented his proposals in July 1812 in the form of one of his Red Books. He described Sheringham as his {{Cquote| favourite and darling child in Norfolk|10px|10px| Humphry Repton}} Abbot and Charlotte Upcher bought the Estate in 1811, and successive generations of the Upcher family did much to develop the estate, the Hall and the park, as well as building a [[school]].

There are fine mature [[woodland]]s and a large variety of [[rhododendron]]s and [[azalea]]s. In the early 20th century Henry Morris Upcher obtained rhododendron seeds of various types from [[plantsman]] [[Ernest Henry Wilson|Ernest &quot;Chinese&quot; Wilson]]. Plants from this source which can found at the garden include ''Rhododendron ambiguum'', ''calophytum'' and ''decorum'', among others.&lt;ref name=zea&gt;Zealand. K. ''[[The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]&amp;ndash;Sheringham Park guide'' (1998) Retrieved 25 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many other species of tree and shrub are represented in the garden,including fifteen kinds of [[magnolia]], large specimen [[pieris (plant)|pieris]]. Among the other trees are [[maples]], [[Acer (genus)|acer]]s, [[styrax]], [[eucryphia]], Pocket Handkerchief Tree [[davidia involucrata]] and a fine example of the Snowdrop Tree [[Halesia]]. Several overlook towers provide good views over the gardens, and of the nearby coast and surrounding countryside. A garden [[temple]] was constructed in the Park in 1975.

==Location==
Sheringham Park is located 2 miles south west of the coastal town of [[Sheringham]], 5 miles west of [[Cromer]] and 6 miles east of [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]]. The main entrance is at the junction of the [[A148 road|A148]] Cromer to Holt road and the [[B1157 road]] to [[Upper Sheringham]]. The [[Norfolk Coast Path]] passes through the property. A car park, cafe and visitor centre are near the  main entrance. [[waymarking|Waymarked]] paths through the estate link the gardens and visitors centre to the coast, and to the [[Weybourne]] station on the [[North Norfolk Railway]], a preserved steam railway. Pedestrian access to the park is from the village of [[Upper Sheringham]], which is adjacent to the park.

==Visitor centre==
The visitor centre is located within Wood Farm Barn at the southern end of the park, the barn also houses an exhibition the history and the wildlife of Sheringham Park. There is a reception desk and information kiosk. From the reception there are hearing loops available. There are also wheelchairs and powered mobility vehicles available at no charge although it is necessary to take a small test before use. The refreshment kiosk is also at Wood Farm Barn.

The exhibition area explores the life and work of the landscape architect [[Humphrey Repton]] and also of the Upcher family who owned the park. There are several examples of Humphrey Reptonâs red book of plans for the designs of the park. Part of the exhibition area has an area dedicated to the wildlife and nature of the park with identification games and interactive displays.

== Sheringham Hall ==
[[Image:Sheringham Park.jpg|thumb|200px| Sheringham Hall]]
The [[Regency architecture|Regency]], [[Grade II]] listed building is finished in grey, [[gault]], [[Lincolnshire]] brick was designed and built by Humphry Repton and his architect son, John Adey Repton. Due to the Norfolk coast's glacial winds, Repton chose a south facing site in the [[Lee side|lee]] of a wooded hillside. In July 1813 the Upcher family laid the foundation stones and the family hoped to move into the house in the summer of 1817, but the owner of the estate Abbot Upcher fell ill and died in 1819 at the age of 35. The hall remained empty for 20 years until Henry Ramey Upcher completed the house in 1839.&lt;ref name=zea/&gt;

The hall's 71-year lease is currently for sale at Â£2.35 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrylife.co.uk/news/article/174617/Sheringham_Hall039s_lease_for_sale.html  Country Life article] Retrieved January 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
