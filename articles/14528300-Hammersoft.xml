==Current major projects==
===Manned civil aircraft===
* [[Airbus A380]], [[Airbus A350|A350 XWB]], [[Airbus A340|A340]], [[Airbus A330|A330]] and the [[Airbus A320 family]], the A380 is the largest civil passenger plane in production. Its order book stands are nearly 200 aircraft and the wings were developed and are being built in the UK. Rolls-Royce offers its Trent 900 for the A380 and has so far secured 61% of the market based on operator decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolls-royce.com/civil_aerospace/products/airlines/trent900/market.jsp Rolls-Royce.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Iain Gray, former Airbus UK managing director, once said that an Airbus A380 with Rolls-Royce engines had a UK content of about 40-50%. The A350 XWB is the Airbus answer to the [[Boeing 787]] and has so far achieved close to 400 orders. The aircraft's wings are being developed at Filton and the final assembly of these will take place at Broughton. Rolls-Royce is currently the only engine supplier to the A350 XWB with the Trent XWB.

* [[Hawker 800]]XP, the Airbus plant in Broughton builds the fuselage and wings for the Hawker 800XP variant. This work employs about 450 people at the plant in North Wales.

* [[Bombardier Aerospace]] business jet and regional jet families, the Northern Irish facilities of Bombardier play an important role in nearly every Bombardier aircraft programme. The most notable are the production of the fuselage for the Learjet 40 and Learjet 45, the production of the centre fuselage for the Challenger 300 and other programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeroworldnet.com/10nr091002.htm Aeroworldnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For the newly proposed C-Series Belfast is planned to design and produce the wings, rear fuselage and nacelles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/Bombardier2/ Aerospace-technology.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In June 2011 the UK-based company [[HyperMach]] announced the launch of a project to develop a new [[supersonic]] passenger [[airliner]], [[SonicStar]], with the first flight planned for 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/engineers-say-a-new-design-for-a-supersonic-passenger-jet-would-provide-fast-travel-that-is-fuel-efficient/story-e6frg95x-1226082767746|title=Engineers say a new design for a supersonic passenger jet would provide fast travel that is fuel efficient |accessdate=28 June 2011|publisher=The Australian|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manned military aircraft===
[[File:CF-1 flight test.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]]]]

* [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], the British aerospace industry has a 37.5% share in the production of the Eurofighter Typhoon and a 33% share in the development of the aircraft. The main participants here are BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce and the current order book stands at 707 aeroplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofighter-typhoon.co.uk/Eurofighter/history.html Eurofighter Typhoon]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[BAE Hawk]], one of the best known advanced jet trainers in the world and has generated billions of pounds in exports for the British aerospace industry, here again BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce are the two main participants and so far over 900 Hawks have been sold. The latest variant is the &quot;AJT&quot; version, or &quot;Advanced Jet Trainer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vectorsite.net/avhawk.html Vectorsite.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[F-35 Lightning II]], the UK industry has a workshare of about 20% in the F35 Lightning II and has two companies in &quot;Team JSF&quot;, BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. BAE Systems designed and produces the aft fuselage, fuel system, horizontal and vertical stabilizers among other things. Rolls-Royce has a 40% workshare in the F136 alternative F35 Lightning II engine and provides the Liftfan for all F35Bs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.teamjsf.com/jsf/data.nsf/public/2826ACE7FD02555585257053004954B2/$file/BAEInvolvementChart_DEC2005.pdf Teamjsf.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Airbus A400M]], the UK is buying 22&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.fcaa49c524a729966e47c678092ef3de.151&amp;show_article=1]&lt;/ref&gt; A400Ms and thus has a workshare roughly equivalent to its share of procurement, which equates to about 14%. Due to traditional Airbus roles, Airbus UK developed the wings for the A400M and outsourced some of the manufacturing; however, the final assembly takes place in Filton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.european-defence.co.uk/a400m.html European Defence]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil and military UAVs and UCAVs===
[[Image:Farnborough 2006 1 001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[BAE Systems HERTI]]]]
[[Image:inview UAV medium.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The InView UAV twin tail variant, for use in scientific, commercial and state applications.]]

* [[BAE Taranis]] is a UCAV programme largely funded by the British government. Its aim is to fly by 2012 and thus inform the [[Royal Air Force]] about future UCAV operations. Final assembly will take place in Warton. Flight testing will probably occur in Australia.

* [[BAE Mantis]] is the worlds first autonomous drone which means it can fly the mission itself.and has the capabilities to fly for 24 hours. The crew put in the mission into Mantis and then send it off and it flies itself to the mission launches weapons or just observes (reconnaissance) and then flies itself back avoiding any obstacles (missiles etc). Its first flight was on November 2009, it's expected to enter service with the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] in 2015.

* [[BAE HERTI]] is an autonomous utility UAV, that has first flown in 2004 and is aimed at the near term military and commercial markets for UAVs. Unlike the Taranis, the HERTI will likely go into production as a first production variant, that has been developed and should be delivered to BAE Systems by end of November 2007.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

* [[QinetiQ]] Zephyr UAV, recently set up the unofficial world endurance record for UAVs. The longest flight of this UAV, according to QinetiQ, was 54 hours and thus the longest UAV flight ever. However, because no official representation was present the flight is not an official record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacewar.com/reports/QinetiQ_Zephyr_UAV_Exceeds_Official_World_Record_For_Longest_Duration_Unmanned_Flight_999.html Spacewar.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Thales UK/Elbit Systems [[Watchkeeper WK450|Watchkeeper]] programme is worth about 700 million pounds and is currently the largest UAV programme in Europe. The Israeli company, Elbit, provided the basic airframe design, from which Thales UK derived the Watchkeeper. These UAVs are being built in Leicester, with subsystems being sourced from throughout the United Kingdom and also beyond. Next to the United Kingdom, Israel has a significant workshare in this programme.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

* Selex S&amp;AS has developed a whole range of small battlefield UAVs such as the Strix, Otus and ASIO. Most of these have been developed in collaboration with Italian companies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

* Barnard Microsystems Limited has developed the [[InView Unmanned Aircraft System]] for use in scientific (measuring volcanic ash distributions), commercial (oil, gas and mineral exploration and production) and state (border patrol) applications. The focus in the development of the InView was on safety, automation (test and flight) and modularity. First flights of this twin engine unmanned aircraft took place in the U.K. in on 9 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnardmicrosystems.com/L4E_inview_development.htm#inview_01 InView IV-01 Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helicopters===
[[Image:EH101 Merlin HMS Monmouth 2007.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[AgustaWestland AW101]]]]

* [[AgustaWestland AW101]], developed from the WG.34 of Westland Helicopters, this project quickly turned into a collaboration with Italy as both countries realised they had similar requirements. In 1979, a joint company was set up and development commenced. Since 2004, Agusta and Westland are a single merged company and the EH101 has been renamed AW101. So far nine countries have ordered about 180 helicopters.

* AgustaWestland Future Lynx and AgustaWestland [[Westland Lynx|Super Lynx]] are developments of the basic Westland Lynx, which has seen tremendous international success with more than 400 Lynx helicopters sold so far. The Super Lynx has seen considerable success with Oman, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa and Algeria ordering the Super Lynx 300 in recent times. The United Kingdom ordered the development of the Future Lynx helicopters and the delivery of 70 helicopters (with 10 additional options) in a one billion pound contract in 2006. First flight is anticipated for 2009.

* [[AgustaWestland AW159]], in mid 2006, AgustaWestland confirmed that the Yeovil factory will take the lead in the development of this new helicopter.

===Engines===
[[Image:A380-trent900.JPG|right|300px|thumb|[[Rolls-Royce Trent|Rolls-Royce Trent 900]]]]
[[Image:Boeing 787first flight.jpg|right|300px|thumb|A [[Boeing 787]] powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]] engines.]]

* [[Eurojet EJ200]], Rolls-Royce has a 33% share in the development of the EJ200 engine for the Eurofighter Typhoon and a 36% share in the manufacture of this turbofan engine. The EJ200 is based on the XG.40 engine research programme carried out by Rolls-Royce and the UK MoD in the 1980s.

* [[General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136]], Rolls-Royce has a 40% workshare in the F136, the alternative engine for the F35 Lightning II. The work is led by the Rolls-Royce facility in Bristol with large packages of work being carried out in Indianapolis, USA.

* RRTM Adour MK951 is a British-French codevelopment for the Jaguar and later adopted for the Hawk trainer jet. Rolls-Royce has a 50% workshare in the Adour and the remaining final assembly line is in Bristol, United Kingdom.

* Europrop International TP400-D6, Rolls-Royce has a 25% workshare in the TP400D-6. Its work includes final assembly, the high pressure compressor, the low pressure shaft, the intermediate case and the bearing support structure. However, much of this work is carried out in Germany, such as the final assembly, because Rolls-Royce has a larger workshare in relation to the UK aircraft purchase. The solution is that Rolls-Royce Deutschland does some of the work and thus can claim a part of the German workshare in the aircraft.

* Rolls-Royce Liftfan is the STOVL component for the F35B. It is entirely developed and produced by Rolls-Royce. As with the Rolls-Royce share in the F136, the Liftfan development is led by the company's Bristol facility with considerable input from the Indianapolis offices.

* [[Rolls-Royce Trent|Trent 500]]/[[Rolls-Royce Trent|Trent 700]]/[[Rolls-Royce Trent|Trent 800]]/[[Rolls-Royce Trent|Trent 900]]/[[Rolls-Royce Trent|Trent 1000]]; the Trent XWB is the newest Rolls-Royce engine of the Trent series. It will power the A350 XWB and has currently achieved 800 orders. The Trent 1000 is the launch engine for all variants of the B787 and by November 2007, over 600 Trent 1000s have been ordered by 19 airlines. This gives the Trent 1000 a market share of slightly more than 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/showPR.jsp?PR_ID=40577 Rolls-Royce.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Trent 900 is Rolls-Royce's offering for the Airbus A380 and it has achieved a workshare of more than 50% against the [[Engine Alliance GP7000|Engine Alliance GP7200]]. The Trent 800 is offered on the B777 and the Trent 700 is offered on the A330, where it has achieved very large success. The Trent 500 is the only engine offered for the A340-500 and A340-600 and thus has achieved to win 100% of the market. All Trents are developed, produced and final assembled in the United Kingdom. In November 2007, Rolls-Royce declared that it will build a new factory in Singapore to final assemble some of the Trent XWBs and Trent 1000s, this is a factory in addition to the Derby factory, which will remain centre of excellence for large engines.

* RB211-524 and RB211-535, the RB211-524 engine is supplied by Rolls-Royce for the [[Boeing 747]]. It formed the basis for the development of the Trent engine series. The Rb211-535 is supplied for the [[Boeing 757]] and [[Boeing 767]].
