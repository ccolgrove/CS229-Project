'''''Fire Fighter''''', also known as '''''Firefighter''''', is a fireboat serving the [[New York City Fire Department]]. She was an active fireboat serving as Marine Company 9 until being retired in 2010. She was the most powerful diesel-electric [[fireboat]] when built in 1938.  She has fought more than 50 fires, including upon the [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']] in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrhpinv&quot;/&gt;

Other well known fires she participated in include the [[SS El Estero|SS ''El Estero'']] in 1943, and the fire following the collision of ''[[Esso Brussels]]'' and [[Sea Witch (container ship)|SS ''Sea Witch'']] in 1973.   On [[September 11, 2001]], ''Fire Fighter'', along with the rest of the FDNY Marine units and the ''[[John J. Harvey (fireboat)|John J. Harvey]]'', a retired fireboat being restored by volunteers, were in active service pumping water from the Hudson River into [[Ground Zero]] when the water mains failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;groundzero&quot;&gt;{{cite news
