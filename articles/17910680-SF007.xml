'''PlayOnLinux''' is a graphical front-end for the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software [[compatibility layer]] which aims to simplify the installation of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[application software|applications]] and especially [[PC game|games]] on [[Linux]].
The system provides wrapper [[shell script]]s with a .pol [[filename extension]] that specify the configuration of [[Wine (software)|Wine]] needed in order to install and run a particular application. 

It uses an online database of scripts to apply to different applications that need special configuration; if the game is not in the database, a manual installation can be performed. Aside from games, any other [[Computer program|program]] can be installed and each one is put in a different container (WINEPREFIX) to prevent interference of one program with another. This provides isolation in much the same way that [[CrossOver]]'s bottles work. PlayOnLinux allows users to install some of the most favorable applications in the Windows world, such as Apple [[iTunes]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Microsoft Office]], Microsoft [[Internet Explorer]] 6 and 7, [[AutoCAD]], [[mono (software)|Mono]], [[.NET Framework]] 2.0, [[Adobe Fireworks|Fireworks MX]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash MX]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Applications are installed and remain separate from each other. They may use different versions and configurations of Wine as appropriate. The installation of these is managed by the PlayOnLinux software itself without the requirement to install Wine separately.

Play on Linux is developed in a combination of [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
