'''''TTV''''' was a youth-aimed programming strand broadcast on [[RTÃ Two]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], from 17:00 - 19:00, on weekdays. ''TTV'' replaced [[iD Two]], which was basically the same show with few differences, on Monday 19 September 2005. On 7 September 2009, ''TTV'' was replaced by another youth-aimed programming strand, ''[[Two Tube]]'', presented by Dara Quilty (radio presenter, guitarist and all round hero.)
