'''WJAC-TV''' is the [[NBC]]-affiliated [[television station]] for the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] area of [[Pennsylvania]] that is licensed to [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]]. It broadcasts a [[High-definition television|high definition]] digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 34 from a transmitter northwest of the city in [[Laurel Ridge State Park]] along the [[Cambria County, Pennsylvania|Cambria]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] County line. Owned by [[Cox Enterprises]], the station has studios on Old Hickory Lane in Johnstown. [[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on the station includes ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly|Regis &amp; Kelly]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and ''[[Judge Judy]]''.

==Digital programming==

WJAC-TV's signal is multiplexed. The [[Retro Television Network]] began airing on WJAC-TV's second digital subchannel in late December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune-democrat.com/business/x519181524/WJAC-launches-classic-TV-network&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with sister station [[WPXI]], WJAC-TV 6.2 transitioned to [[Me-TV]] at 12:00am on June 13 2011 immediately following an episode of [[Ellery_Queen_(TV_series)|Ellery Queen]] at which point the channel was switched to the Me-TV feed for the start of [[Hogan's Heroes]].  Sister station WTOV continued airing RTV programming after June 13.

==History==
[[Image:RTN6_logo.jpg|thumb|left|Channel 6.2 logo from the RTN era.]]
WJAC-TV first began its broadcasting operations on 15th September, 1949&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjactv.com/60thanniversary/9198153/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt; originally owned by the '''J'''ohnstown '''A'''utomotive '''C'''ompany along with WJAC radio (AM 1400, now [[WKGE]] at AM 850, and FM 95.5, now [[WKYE]] at FM 96.5). At the time, it was the third smallest television station in the country [[media market|market]] wise to be granted a commercial license on or before December 31 behind [[CBS]] affiliate [[WBNG-TV]] in [[Binghamton, New York]] and fellow NBC affiliate [[WICU-TV]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]]. It originally aired an analog signal on [[VHF]] channel 13 before moving to VHF channel 6 in 1952. Upon its sign-on, it aired programming from all four networks of the time (NBC, CBS, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). CBS disappeared from WJAC-TV's schedule when WARD-TV channel 56 (now [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[The CW Television Network|CW]] affiliate [[WPCW]] on channel 19) signed-on in 1953 followed by DuMont when it shut down network operations in 1955. However, the station continued to air a few ABC shows into the 1980s. [[Image:WJAC-former-logo.png|right|thumb|WJAC-TV logo until October 2011]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambriacountyhistorical.com/newsletters/heritageqtrly/winter2004.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1960s, Johnstown Automotive sold the WJAC stations to the estate of Anderson H. Walters, the owner of ''[[The Tribune-Democrat]]'', who held them until 1984 when tightened [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) cross-ownership regulations forced the newspaper to sell off the radio stations. The Walters estate sold off the newspaper to [[MediaNews Group]] in 1987 but held on to Channel 6 until 1997 when it was sold to Sunrise Television. WJAC and new sister station [[WTOV-TV]] in the [[Steubenville, Ohio]]â[[Wheeling, West Virginia]] market were sold to Cox in 2000. The two stations and [[WPXI]] in Pittsburgh are now occasionally marketed together as a result.  WJAC-TV and WTOV were updated to WPXI's on-air graphics after being acquired by Cox, despite WPXI changing its own look in 2004.  Most of the graphics introduced to WJAC-TV after the acquisition were used until October 2011, when WJAC-TV updated to WPXI's current look.

WJAC-TV gained a reputation for its locally-produced programs at the station throughout the years. ''Scholastic Quiz'', a game show featuring local high school students, and ''Seniors Today'' (a public affairs program targeted to those 65 and older) would become mainstays of the station's programming and make host Ron Lorence (who would later build WADJ-AM, now [[WBHV (AM)|WBHV]], at 1330 AM and then buy WYSN-FM 101.7 now [[WCCL]] in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]]) a local household name. The station was also one of the stations across the country to produce a local version of the children's TV show â³[[Romper Room]]â³. In the 1950s and 1960s, WJAC-TV's slogan was &quot;Serving Millions From Atop the Alleghenies.&quot;

After the [[DTV transition|analog television shutdown and digital conversion]] that took place on 12th June, 2009 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyamerican.com/articles/2009/02/08/news/news/news894.txt&lt;/ref&gt;, WJAC-TV remained on its current pre-transition [[UHF]] channel number 34. &lt;ref name=&quot;FCCForm387&quot;&gt;[http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&amp;appn=101231099&amp;formid=387&amp;fac_num=73120 WJAC-TV FCC DTV status report]&lt;/ref&gt; However, through the use of [[PSIP]], digital television receivers will display the station's [[virtual channel]] as 6.&lt;ref&gt;http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=73120&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby mountain ridges had prevented most of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] and all of [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] from receiving the analog signal. Because the audio portion of VHF channel 6 was transmitted at 87.75 [[MHz]], it was possible to listen to the television station on most standard FM car radios (or any standard FM radio for that matter). This was a feature frequently employed by area residents. However, this is no longer an option after the digital conversion. 

===Out of Market Coverage===
WJAC-TV is carried on various cable systems in several counties that are located outside of the Johnstown-Altoona market. These counties include [[Armstrong County, Pennsylvania|Armstrong]], [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler]], [[Clarion County, Pennsylvania|Clarion]], [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.comcast.com/Customers/Clu/ChannelLineup.ashx?print=1&amp;CGID=2232&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.comcast.com/Customers/Clu/ChannelLineup.ashx?print=1&amp;CGID=2228&lt;/ref&gt; In West Virginia, it is carried in [[Petersburg, West Virginia|Petersburg]] (93 miles away), Dorcas, Moorefield and Keyser.

WJAC-TV is also broadcast over-the-air on a low-powered repeater, W54BG, in [[Moorefield, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=station_search&amp;callsign=W54BG#station&lt;/ref&gt; This repeater is owned by Valley TV Cooperative.

===60th anniversary===
On 15th September, 2009, WJAC-TV celebrated its 60th year of broadcasting. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjactv.com/60thanniversary/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; During that month, WJAC-TV aired several commercials advertising the anniversary. One featured a variation of the &quot;Serving Millions from Atop the Alleghenies&quot; slogan creating &quot;Serving Millions Across the Alleghenies.&quot; This old slogan was used in various ways in the station's broadcasts and  mixed with the station's then-current slogan &quot;Coverage You Can Count On&quot; to form &quot;Coverage You Can Count On Across the Alleghenies&quot; the year before.

[[Image:Wjac_dt2.png|thumb|right|WJAC-TV's logo for digital channel 6.2 during its tenure with RTV.]]

===Use of Digital Sub-channels===
With the introduction of sub-channels in the years leading up to the 2009 Digital Transition, WJAC-TV partnered with several different providers to provide quality content on its sub-channels.  Before its closure in 2008, WJAC-TV carried [[NBC Weather Plus]] on DT2.  In late 2008, WJAC-TV added the Retro Television Network to digital channel 6.2 to fill the spot left by the closure of NBC Weather Plus.  This relationship lasted until June 2011 when RTV was replaced by the Me-TV Network.

==News operation==
[[Image:WJAC_6News_open.png|thumb|left|Current 6 News open.]]

In the late 1960s and 1970s, WJAC-TV had a fifteen minute long news and weather show weekday afternoons at 1 known as ''The News Today''. Its 6 o'clock newscast was known as ''The News Tonight'' and the 11 p.m. broadcast was entitled ''11th Hour News''. The weather segment aired first and was titled &quot;Weather in Motion&quot; with its own sounder and graphics. The sports had a separate theme and was called &quot;Sports Wrap Up.&quot; WJAC-TV's weekday morning newscast began as a half-hour broadcast at 6:30 in 1985. In 1987, TCI Cable (now Comcast) in Centre County began producing a WJAC-TV newscast, known as the ''Centre County Report'', specifically targeted to that area. 

On 28th November, 2007, ''The Tribune Democrat'' reported that the shared news department of [[Fox Network|Fox]] affiliate [[WWCP-TV]] and ABC affiliate [[WATM-TV]] was going to shut down. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribune-democrat.com/local/local_story_332113055.html&lt;/ref&gt; Under that operation, WWCP had produced an hour-long 10 p.m. news starting in 1992. However, according to a written statement, WWCP and WATM had been operating at a loss for years and the move was needed. The closure resulted in all personalities being released from their contracts. WJAC-TV had on-air positions open but no personnel from those two stations were hired. 

Effective 14th January, 2008, WJAC-TV assumed production responsibility of the 10 o'clock broadcast on WWCP (still known as ''Fox 8 News at 10'') which was reduced to 35 minutes on weeknights and thirty minutes on weekends. The WJAC-produced news uses the same music package and some voice-overs seen during segment opens as the former operation had. A new graphics package slightly different from WJAC-TV and new logos similar to the WWCP promo logo introduced in 2007 were created specifically for the primetime broadcast. 

Because WJAC-TV has prior commitments with news and weather cut-ins during ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', WATM still produces its own ''[[Good Morning America]]'' news and weather cut-ins that are seen Tuesday through Saturday. Former WWCP co-anchor Sherry Stalley, who was still under contract when the news department shut down, hosts the updates.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune-democrat.com/homepage/x519154210/News-trio-delivers-final-broadcast&lt;/ref&gt; The cut-ins use news video from the previous day's WJAC-produced WWCP broadcast and the same graphics package. On Mondays, the cut-ins are filled by WATM promos. In addition, WJAC-TV's nightly 11 o'clock newscast was simulcasted on that station branded as ''ABC 23 News'' until March 2011 when it was replaced by syndicated episodes of Senifeld.

[[Image:Wjac news open.png|thumb|right|WJAC-TV News open used from 2008-2011.]]

On 8th August, 2008, WJAC-TV unveiled a new set designed by [[FX Group]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjactv.com/60thanniversary/17122940/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune-democrat.com/local/x519170492/WJAC-news-de-emphasizes-channel-number-undergoes-makeover&lt;/ref&gt; The station also unveiled a new graphics package and changed its on-air branding from its long standing &quot;Channel 6&quot; to &quot;WJAC-TV&quot; as different cable companies now carry the station on different channels.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune-democrat.com/local/x519170492/WJAC-news-de-emphasizes-channel-number-undergoes-makeover&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its main studios, the station operates bureaus in [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], and [[DuBois, Pennsylvania|DuBois]]. 

WJAC-TV officially changed the station's news branding from &quot;WJAC-TV News&quot; to &quot;6 News&quot; on 25 October 2011.  This change comes only three years after the change from &quot;Channel 6 News&quot;.  In addition to the new branding, WJAC-TV updated their on-air graphics and theme music to those of sister station WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh.
