At the time of the merger with United to form [[United Continental Holdings]], Inc., Continental was the fourth-largest airline in the US based on passenger-kilometers flown and the fifth largest in total passengers carried. Continental operates flights to destinations throughout the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions. Principal operations are from its four hubs at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]] ([[Houston]]), [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and [[Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport]] in Guam. The only Continental hubs to be rebranded are [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and Houston's [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continental.com/CMS/en-US/travel/Pages/airportupdates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The Newark hub began the rebranding process on October 19, 2011 with all United-operated ticket counters and gates to be rebranded in Phase One; Phase Two of rebranding at Newark will begin in 2012 with Continental ticket counters and gates to be rebranding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6867,53833,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of Continental Airlines dates to the 1934 formation of Varney Speed Lines which operated [[airmail]] and passenger services in the [[American Southwest]]. The carrier was renamed Continental Air Lines in 1937 and expanded its domestic U.S. network in the 1960s with jet aircraft. International flights to Southeast Asia and South Pacific destinations began in 1978 following [[Airline Deregulation Act|industry deregulation]]. Continental was embroiled in ownership struggles in the 1980s and entered bankruptcy in 1983 and 1990. The carrier exhibited a financial and operational turnaround after 1996,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|author=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and embarked on international route expansion in the 2000s.

Continental has ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers. Continental is a minority owner of [[ExpressJet Airlines]], which operates under the '[[Continental Express]]' trade name but is a separately managed and public company. [[Chautauqua Airlines]] also flies under the Continental Express identity, and [[Cape Air]], [[Colgan Air]], [[CommutAir]], and [[Gulfstream International Airlines]] feed Continental's flights under the [[Continental Connection]] identity. Continental does not have any ownership interests in these companies.

Continental Airlines left the [[SkyTeam]] alliance on October 24, 2009, and joined [[Star Alliance]] on October 27, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;StarOct&quot;&gt;[http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/continental-to-leave-skyteam-in-october Continental to leave Skyteam in October]&lt;/ref&gt; Together with its subsidiaries, Continental has more than 2,423 daily departures, serving 130 domestic and 132 international destinations and has 42,210 employees as of December 2009. Since 1998, Continental's marketing slogan has been &quot;''Work Hard, Fly Right''.&quot;

On Sunday, May 2, 2010, the Boards of Directors at Continental and United Airlines approved a stock-swap deal that would combine them into the world's largest airline in revenue passenger miles. The new airline will take on the United Airlines name, Continental's logo and be based in United's hometown of Chicago. The new United will be run by Continental's CEO, Jeffery Smisek, along with United Airline's CEO, Glenn Tilton, serving as non-executive Chairman of the board. The deal received approval from U.S. and European regulators in the summer of 2010. The shareholders of both airlines approved the deal on September 17, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters approve&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/17/us-ual-continental-idUSTRE68G3VM20100917|title=UAL and Continental shareholders approve deal|last=Peterson|first=Kyle|date=September 17, 2010|agency=Reuters  |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history (1931â1958)===
[[File:VarneyOrion.jpg|thumb||Varney Speed Lines [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion]] in [[Burbank, California]]]]

Continental Airlines began service in 1934 as '''Varney Speed Lines''' (named after one of its initial owners, [[Walter T. Varney]], who was also a founder of United Airlines) operating out of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and extending through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and Las Vegas, NM to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], CO. The airline commenced operations with the [[Lockheed Vega]], a single-engine plane that carried four passengers. The airline later flew other Lockheed planes, including the [[Lockheed Model 9 Orion]], the [[Lockheed Electra Junior]], and the [[Lockheed Lodestar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;&gt;Serling, Robert J., Maverick: The story of Robert Six and Continental Airlines (ISBN 0-385-04057-1), Doubleday &amp; Company, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

Following cancellation of all domestic airmail contracts by the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration in 1934, [[Robert Six]] learned of an opportunity to buy into the Southwest Division of Varney Speed Lines which needed money to handle its newly won Pueblo-El Paso route. Six was introduced to Louis Mueller (who would serve as Chairman of the Board of Continental until February 28, 1966). Mueller had helped found the Southwest Division of Varney in 1934 with Walter T. Varney. As an upshot of all this, Six bought into the airline with US$90,000 and became general manager on July 5, 1936. Varney was awarded a 17-cent-rate airmail contract between Pueblo and El Paso; it carried passengers as a sideline. The carrier was renamed '''Continental Air Lines''' on July 8, 1937. (&quot;Air Lines&quot; was later changed to &quot;Airlines&quot;.) Six relocated the airline's headquarters to Denver Union (later Stapleton) Airport in [[Denver]] in October 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;Davies, R.E.G., Continental Airlines : the first fifty years, 1934â1984, Pioneer Publications, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Six changed the name to &quot;Continental&quot; because he wanted the airline name to reflect his desire to have the airline fly all directions throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;COFacts&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://magazine.continental.com/200907-continental-facts Continental Facts].&quot; [[Continental (magazine)|Continental Magazine]].

[[File:4574 1950 CALstew DC3.jpg|thumb|left|Stewardess and passenger, Mother's Day, 1950]]

[[Robert Six|Robert F. Six]] was one of the colorful group of innovators, pioneers, and visionaries (including [[Juan Trippe]], [[William A. Patterson]], [[Jack Frye]], [[C.R. Smith]], and [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]) who established and built the U.S. airline industry. Throughout his life, Six had a reputation as a combative and risk-taking executive who presided forcefully over the airline that was largely forged in his image for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;&gt;Christian, J. Scott, former Continental employee and manager, Bring Songs to the Sky: Recollections of Continental Airlines, 1970â1986, Quadran Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

During World War II, Continental's Denver maintenance facilities became a conversion center where the airline converted [[B-17]]s, [[B-29]]s and [[P-51 Mustang|P-51s]] for the [[United States Army Air Force]]. Profits from military transportation and aircraft conversion enabled Continental to contemplate expansion and acquisition of new aircraft types which became available following the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt; Among those types were the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], the [[Convair 240]] and the [[Convair 340]]. Some of the DC-3s were acquired as surplus military aircraft following World War II. The Convairs were the first aircraft operated by Continental that were [[Cabin pressurization|pressurized]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

[[File:1254 CAL DC7B.jpg|thumb|A [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7B]] in flight, 1958]]

The airline's early route network was limited to the original [[El Paso]] to Denver route with routes being added during the Second World War from Denver and Albuquerque across Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1946, Continental had expanded new routes from Denver to Kansas City, Tulsa, and to Oklahoma City, and from El Paso and Albuquerque to San Antonio. Each of these routes included intermediate stops in several of 22 smaller cities. In 1953, Continental achieved its first major expansion by merging with [[Pioneer Airlines]], gaining access to 16 additional cities in Texas and [[New Mexico]]. These Pioneer destinations integrated well with Continental's post-World War II routes, and provided impetus for the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB), the industry regulator, to subsequently streamline CAL's routes from Denver to the principal traffic points in Texas, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. However, Continental was, like most U.S. carriers of the day, essentially a limited regional operation. Bob Six was highly dissatisfied with this situation. He vigorously petitioned the CAB for longer-haul routes to larger cities, a part of his plan to transform the regional into a trunkline like [[United Airlines|United]], [[TWA]], and [[American Airlines|American]]. Simultaneously, he was quietly discussing with [[Boeing]] for Continental to become one of the first among the world's airlines to operate the soon-to-be-launched [[Boeing 707|707]] jet aircraft. The timing was crucial, since the new routes would justify the 707s, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

===The &quot;Airline that needed to grow&quot; (1959â1969)===
[[File:corfsix.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Six]], in 1969]]

By the end of the 1950s, Six's strategy had succeeded. Continental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes, thanks to a responsive [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] and persistent efforts by Six, who frequently referred to his company as, &quot;the Airline that needs to grow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; In 1957, it flew for the first time from Chicago to Los Angeles (both nonstop, and via Denver); and nonstop from Denver and Los Angeles to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Continental Airlines introduced turboprop service with the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the new medium haul routes. The CAB permitted Continental to drop service at many of the smaller cities on the system, enabling the carrier's new aircraft to operate more economically between points with longer lengths-of-haul. Prior to the introduction of its Boeing 707 jets, Continental acquired the popular [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7s]] to operate its nonstop route from Los Angeles to Chicago, as well as Denver-Los Angeles and Chicago-Kansas City (see photos).&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} In 1960 Continental had more than triple the passenger-miles it had had in 1956.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Six clearly established himself as the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate. He correctly predicted that increased traffic, not higher fares, was the answer to the airline industry's problems. Six stunned the industry when he introduced the [[Economy class#Economy class|economy fare]] on the Chicago-Los Angeles route in 1962. He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which brought air travel to many who otherwise could not have afforded it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide economy excursion fare which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

As Six had planned, Continental was one of the earliest operators of the Boeing 707, taking delivery of its first of five 707-124s in spring 1959 and starting Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Having so few jets, Continental needed radical innovations to the 707 maintenance program. It developed an industry first: the innovative &quot;progressive maintenance&quot; program enabled Continental to fly its 707 fleet seven days a week, 16 hours a day, achieving greater aircraft utilization than any other jet aircraft operator in the airline industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} (The March 1961 OAG shows CO's five 707s flying seven round trips a day between Los Angeles and Chicago (not all nonstop); the only other jet service was a Continental/American interchange 707 Houston-El Paso-Los Angeles and back.)

Six, not being satisfied with 707 service alone, introduced exclusive innovations and luxe cuisine with Continental's 707 operations which were described as, &quot;... nothing short of luxurious&quot; by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and, &quot;... clearly, the finest in the airline industry&quot; by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

[[File:83476 CAL B707 LAX proctor.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 707]] at Los Angeles, 1967]]

Beginning in the early 1960s, Continental added routes from Los Angeles to Houston, both nonstop and with 1- and 2-stop services to Houston via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland-Odessa, Austin, and San Antonio. New service was also inaugurated from Denver to Seattle, Portland, New Orleans, and Houston (to Houston: both nonstop, and with 1- and 2-stop services via Wichita/Tulsa/Oklahoma City). In 1963, the company's headquarters were moved from Denver to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Total passenger-miles in 1967 were more than five times greater than in 1960, but 61% of the 1967 total was on unscheduled flights (mostly transpacific charters).

During the late 1960s, the company disposed of the last of its turboprop and piston-powered aircraftâone of the first U.S. airlines to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt; Continental replaced the Viscount fleet with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9s]] from Douglas Aircraft and began an aggressive acquisition of [[Boeing 727]] aircraft. These two types (DC-9 and B-727) were to become the workhorses of the Continental fleet from the late 1960s, and for the next twenty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt; The DC-9s were phased out and by the mid to late seventies, Continental used the 727 for its narrow body fleet. In 1968, a new systemwide Continental Airlines [[livery]] was launched, the orange and gold [[cheatline]]s adorned with a black &quot;jetstream&quot; logo (by Six's friend, the noted graphic designer [[Saul Bass]]) on the jets' tails (logo was later altered to red; see photo of 747). The marketing slogans adopted in 1968 and employed for about a decade were, &quot;The Airline That Pride Built&quot; and, &quot;The Proud Bird with the Golden Tail.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Continental had been awarded routes to New Zealand and Australia, in the Transpacific Case, but were cancelled by the Nixon Administration.

Throughout the [[Vietnam War]], Continental provided extensive cargo and troop transportation for [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] forces to Asian and the Pacific bases. Continental's 707-324Cs were the most common non-military aircraft transiting [[Saigon]] [[Tan Son Nhat]] airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; As a result of Continental's experience in Pacific operations, the carrier formed subsidiary [[Air Micronesia]] in May 1968, inaugurating [[island hopping]] routes between [[Yap]]/[[Saipan]]/[[Guam]], [[Majuro]], Rota, [[Truk]], Ponape ([[Pohnpei]]) and Honolulu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt; &quot;Air Mike&quot;, as it was known, initially operated with [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727â100]] aircraft specially outfitted with open-ocean survival gear, doppler radar, and a large complement of spare parts (including tires).&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt; A senior mechanic flew aboard every Air Mike flight until the late 1970s. Air Micronesia operated as subsidiary [[Continental Micronesia]] until 2010.

September 1969 saw the realization of a long-cherished goal: introduction of Continental service from Los Angeles to Honolulu/Hilo; and in 1970, Continental was awarded routes from Seattle and Portland to San Jose, Hollywood-Burbank Airport, and Ontario, Californiaâall rapidly growing airline markets. Nonstop San Francisco to Albuquerque and Dallas services were added in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;

====First African-American pilot====
In 1963, Continental was forced to hire the first African-American pilot to work for any major carrier in the United States, [[Marlon Green|Marlon D. Green]]. Although Continental Airlines first denied him a position as a pilot, after a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision allowed a [[Colorado]] anti-discrimination law to be applied to his case against Continental.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court, '''COLORADO COMM'N v. CONTINENTAL, 372 U.S. 714 (1963) 372 U.S. 714 COLORADO ANTI-DISCRIMINATION COMMISSION ET AL. v. CONTINENTAL AIR LINES, INC.''' CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO. No. 146. Argued March 28, 1963. Decided April 22, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Green flew with Continental Airlines for 13 years, between 1965 until his retirement in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;COFacts&quot;/&gt; Continental's hiring of Marlon Green paved the way for the hiring of minority pilots by all U.S. carriers, an industry milestone which was finally realized in 1977 after [[Southern Airways]] and [[Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989)|Piedmont]] hired their first minority pilots.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===The widebody era (1970â1976)===
At Six's insistence, Continental (with [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] and [[Trans World Airlines]]) was a launch airline for the [[Boeing 747]] aircraft. On June 26, 1970, Continental became the second carrier (after TWA) to put the 747 into U.S. domestic service. Its upper-deck first class lounge and main deck &quot;Polynesian Pub&quot; won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chef, Lucien DeKeyser.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; When asked by one Denver customer service agent in 1974 why he flew Continental wherever he could, Hollywood legend [[Henry Fonda]] remarked, &quot;This operation is class; strictly class!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

On June 1, 1972, Continental's widebody [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] service began. Six had insisted that Continental place a large order for DC-10s with manufacturer [[McDonnell Douglas]]. This decision again proved prescient, since the publicity associated with Continental's splashy 747 service in the Chicago-Denver-Los Angeles-Honolulu backbone corridor had stimulated not only increased market share, but increased traffic for all carriers in the markets. Additionally Denver, Houston and Seattle were experiencing very rapid growth. The DC-10s quickly assumed most of the duties of flying between Denver and Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle (and between Houston-Los Angeles).&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

[[File:7845 CAL FAs c1972.jpg|thumb|left|Flight attendant uniforms, 1972]]

During the 1970s, Denver continued to be the central hub of the Continental system. The 747s were focused on the Chicago-Los Angeles-Honolulu routes, with a single daily round trip through Denver. The DC-10 aircraft operated in large inter-city markets (usually from Los Angeles to Chicago, Denver, Houston and Honolulu; and from Denver to Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Houston). DC-9 and B-727 types predominated over the rest of the system, as well as supplementing frequencies in the DC-10 markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Next to [[Braniff]], Continental operated fewer aircraft types (four: the B-747, DC-10, B-727-200, and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC9-10]]) during this period than any U.S. trunkline, affording substantial savings in parts, maintenance, and crew training logistics and costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

The DC-10 enabled the airline to capitalize on the burgeoning traffic growth in western U.S. markets. Continental saw market share grow annually in each DC-10 market through the 1970s, until relative market parity was achieved with United, the principal competitor on most of the DC-10 routes. The same service innovations introduced to the 747 fleet were initially implemented on the DC-10s, including the &quot;Polynesian Pub&quot;; although after the [[1973 oil crisis]]-induced fuel price increases, higher seating capacity was needed to achieve profitable economics, and the DC-10 pubs would be removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Continental phased out its 747s in favor of the DC-10s. From the mid seventies until it was merged with Texas International, the airline operated just two types of aircraft, the DC-10 and the 727.

According to Six biographer Robert Serling, quality was the watchword in every detail of Continental's operations in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt; In one anecdotal indication of Six's passion for premium customer service, every page of the airline's Customer Service Manual was inscribed with these words: &quot;Nothing in this manual supersedes common sense.&quot; Bob Six relentlessly prowled the Continental system, as well as competitors' flights, to assure tight quality standards and to search for ideas that could be adopted to Continental's network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; The airline credits Six with instituting a culture promoting customer service.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Continental Airlines Ranked No. 1 World's Most Admired Airline by FORTUNE Magazine&quot;. Reuters (March 11, 2008). Retrieved on June 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1961 to 1982, Continental was headquartered at the western end of the [[Los Angeles International Airport]] property. The facility included the general offices, flight control, central maintenance facility, flight kitchen, and Los Angeles crew bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;''World Airline Directory''.

===Deregulation and expansion (1977â1980)===
[[File:Continental 747., Los Angeles, 1987.jpg|thumb|Continental [[Boeing 747]] at Los Angeles in 1987.]]
In 1974, after years of delays and legal proceedings, Continental inaugurated service between Houston and Miami, and on May 21, 1976, Continental was authorized to operate between San Diego and Denverâboth routes had been long-sought, and signaled a new era of rapid growth for Continental. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Civil Aeronautics Board chairman [[Alfred E. Kahn|Alfred Kahn]] had been promoting deregulation of the airline industry (see [[Airline Deregulation Act]]), which would dissolve the CAB and for the first time in industry history allow U.S. carriers to determine without government supervision where they would fly, and how much they could charge for their services. In this context, 1977 was an historic year for Continental and the industry at large, as the CAB began to loosen its regulatory grip. Continental began service from Denver to Miami/Ft. Lauderdale and Tampa/St. Petersburg in Florida. In that same year, President Carter authorized Continental to begin daily round trips between [[Air Micronesia]] destination [[Saipan]] and Japan, and approved a route for Continental from Los Angeles to Australia via [[Honolulu]], [[American Samoa]], Fiji, New Zealand and Australia. The South Pacific service began May 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

After the 1978 passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], Continental embarked on an aggressive program of route expansion. October 1978 saw Continental begin flights from the New York area airports to Houston and Denver, and from Denver to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; That same month, Continental inaugurated DC-10 service between Los Angeles and [[Taipei]], via Honolulu and [[Guam]]. Service between Houston and Washington, D.C., began in January 1979. In June 1979, Continental linked Denver with Washington, D.C., Las Vegas, San Francisco and San Jose and also began Houston-Tampa service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; The airline suffered in 1979 when the DC-10 was grounded nationwide. Given that Continental Airlines only operated the DC-10 and the 727 at the time, flights to Hawaii were cancelled during the grounding. By the time of the Texas Air Corp. acquisition in 1981, Continental's post-deregulation growth had allowed it to penetrate every major U.S. airline market (and all of the regional markets) from the hubs in Denver and Houston, and the rapid expansion in the air was answered with large-scale facilities expansions at each of these airports. In Denver, Continental's very rapid growth provided the final impetus for the construction of the new [[Denver International Airport]], which would be completed almost fifteen years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10-10 N68042.jpg|thumb|left|Continental DC-10 at Narita Airport, Japan]]

While deregulation allowed Continental to expand into new profitable areas, it hurt the company's existing business as consumers were for the first time able to choose lower fares over Continental's better service. During 1978, Continental explored the possibility of a merger with [[Western Airlines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; Western was also headquartered at Los Angeles International Airport ([[LAX]]) and operated a fleet consisting predominantly of the same 727 and DC-10 aircraft types as Continental. The route systems would have been complementary, with little overlap; because, although they both served the Western states, Continental had strength in Hawaii, southern-tier and the [[Great Plains]] states; Western's strengths were in the California intrastate market, Alaska, Mexico, and the [[Intermountain West]]. Both airlines served the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Rocky Mountain]] states, but along different routes from Los Angeles, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle and Phoenix. This merger was not consummated, however, and industry changes were to take Continental down a very different path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

Unlike some airlines (notably [[Braniff]] whose expansion was so rapid and unsustainable that the additional costs made investment recovery impossible, and the carrier was forced into bankruptcy and liquidation), Continental's rate of expansion following passage of the [[Airline Deregulation Act]] seems, in retrospect, to have been appropriate. The markets that were added were almost all profitable, absorbing some of the hits to its existing markets and helping it in its difficult times between 1982 and 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt;

===Acquisition by Texas Air Corporation (1981â1982)===
[[File:FAA Frank Lorenzo 6336.jpg|thumb|Frank Lorenzo, Continental CEO, 1981â1990]]
In 1981 [[Texas Air Corporation]], an airline holding company controlled by U.S. aviation entrepreneur [[Frank Lorenzo]], acquired Continental after a contentious battle with Continental's management who were determined to resist Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions also fiercely resisted, fearing what they termed as, &quot;Lorenzo's deregulation tactics,&quot; which meant that he wanted to make Continental a non-union airline. Lorenzo viewed the company as stuck in the pre-deregulation era and in need of serious changes to stay competitive. The airline was experiencing financial challenges both before and after Lorenzo's takeover, and he demanded immediate wage cuts and lay offs to keep the company afloat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009&quot;/&gt; During this struggle, Continental Airlines President, A. L. Feldman, committed suicide, on August 9, 1981, in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Continental Air Chief Dies, Apparent Suicide|work=New York Times|date=August 10, 1981|accessdate=July 16, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/10/us/continental-air-chief-dies-apparent-suicide.html?&amp;pagewanted=print|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, Texas Air Corp. prevailed. Frank Lorenzo became Continental's new Chairman and CEO. On October 31, 1982 Continental merged with [[Texas International]] (the merged carrier retained the Continental name, brand, and identity; the TI brand and identity disappeared), offering service to four continents (North and South America, Asia and Australia) with a fleet of 112 aircraft. The &quot;new Continental&quot; relocated its headquarters to Texas Air's base in Houston, Texas. The merger resulted in a large expansion of Continental's hub at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Houston Intercontinental Airport]] and extensive new routes to Mexico and the south central U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=William F. Jr.|volume=5|first2=Frank|last2=Lorenzo|journal=National Review|date=September 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airline unions fought Lorenzo and Continental at every step. In the Federal courts, they unsuccessfully sued to stop the company's reorganization. They were successful in working to persuade Congress to pass a new bankruptcy law preventing bankrupt companies from terminating contracts as Continental had successfully done. The law was too late to affect Continental and the cost cutting and changes that had rescued it from liquidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Delaney|first=Kevin J.|title=Strategic Bankruptcy: How Corporations and Creditors Use Chapter 11 to Their Advantage|isbn=0-520-07359-2|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First bankruptcy &amp; labor relations (1983â1984)===
Frank Lorenzo took Continental into [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy on September 23, 1983, after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate a lower pay rate with labor unions. This saved the company from liquidation, but required substantial reorganization, which began immediately. Following bankruptcy, Continental was freed of its contractual obligations and imposed a series of new labor agreements on its union workers, sharply reducing the airline's labor costs at the cost of employee morale.&lt;ref&gt;Moss Kanter, Rosabeth, Confidence â How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End (ISBN 1-4000-5290-4), Crown Business, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This move made Continental vastly more competitive with the new airline startups then emerging and thriving in the southwestern U.S., but had notable negative impact on employee attitudes and loyalty. The airline's decision to take bankruptcy workedâby the end of 1984, Continental recorded a $50&amp;nbsp;million profit. On June 30, 1986, Continental emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Pilots went on strike in 1983, but were unsuccessful due to Continental pilots and new hires who crossed the picket line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/27/us/continental-s-pilots-suspend-picketing-but-continue-strike.html Continental's Pilots Suspend Picketing but Continue Strike], The New York Times. September 27, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation causes rapid growth (1985â1989)===
[[File:AmericaTowerHoustonTX.JPG|thumb|The [[American General Center|America Tower]] in [[Neartown, Houston|Neartown Houston]], Continental's headquarters from 1983 to 1998]]
On April 28, 1985, Continental began its rebound, as signaled by the inauguration of its first ever scheduled service to Europe with flights from Newark and Houston to London. Soon thereafter, services to Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Munich were added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; However, the airline was still facing significant challenges with consistently low reliability rankings and a high level of customer complaints compared with its competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. 2009&quot;/&gt;

In October 1985, Texas Air Corp. made an offer for a Denver-based regional carrier, [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]], opening a bidding war with [[People Express]], which was headed by Lorenzo's former TI associate [[Donald Burr|Don Burr]]. People Express paid a substantial premium for Frontier's high-cost operation. The acquisition, funded by debt, did not seem rational to industry observers from either the route integration or the operating philosophy points of view, but was in the opinion of most industry analysts rather an attempt by Burr to best his former boss, Frank Lorenzo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;/&gt;

On August 24, 1986, Frontier filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. With People Express hemorrhaging cash, Texas Air acquired People Express on September 15, 1986, at the same time gaining Frontier, whose strong network in the Great Plains and intermountain West reinforced Continental's already formidable Denver hub. Because it had been the largest airline operating in the New York market, the People Express hub at Newark would permit Continental to expand its East Coast services dramatically for the first time in its history. Continental soon became the third-largest airline in the U.S. and the predominant force in the New York, Denver and Houston airline markets. Continental emerged from bankruptcy in 1986 with improved asset and cash flow positions and a more competitive route structure with routes radiating to every large U.S. city from major hubs at Denver and Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delaney&quot;/&gt;  Continental also began developing its Midwest hub at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] in 1986, just as United Airlines began to transfer its Cleveland hub operations to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Fairfax County, Virginia.

On February 1, 1987, [[People Express]], [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier]], [[New York Air]], and several commuter carriers were merged into Continental Airlines to create the third-largest U.S. airline (and sixth largest airline in the world). In so doing, Continental became an even larger player in the northeastern markets. 1987 saw the creation of Continental's OnePass frequent flier program (jointly with [[Eastern Airlines]]); and, in 1988 Continental formed its first strategic partnership (and the first international [[airline alliance]] of its kind) with [[Scandinavian Airlines System|SAS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt;

===Second bankruptcy &amp; new management success (1990â1997)===
[[File:Continentalarena002.jpg|thumb|Continental's reemergence from its second bankruptcy was signaled by its taking on the naming rights to New Jersey's [[Continental Airlines Arena]], which it held until 2007]]
[[File:Continental Airlines DC-10.jpg|thumb|A Continental [[Douglas DC-10]]]]
In 1990, Frank Lorenzo retired after 18 years at the helm of Texas International and later Texas Air and Continental Airlines, selling the majority of his Jet Capital Corporation to [[Scandinavian Airlines System|Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS)]]. According to [[William F. Buckley]], in his September 17, 1990 article on ''[[National Review]]'', the sale to SAS was conditioned on Lorenzo leaving the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckley&quot;/&gt;

On December 3, 1990, Continental filed for its second bankruptcy in a decade. Circumstances behind the second bankruptcy included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/business/continental-bankruptcy-study-seen.html|work=The New York Times|title=Continental Bankruptcy Study Seen|first=Eric|last=Weiner|date=October 24, 1990|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lorenzo had dedicated himself almost full time to [[Eastern Air Lines]] acquisition and labor relations issues;
* the 1990 [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] and the resultant [[Gulf War]] had prompted a dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel
* People Express had been highly leveraged at the time of its merger with Continental, having purchased [[Frontier Airlines (1950-1986)|Frontier Airlines]] just two years before.

In addition to Lorenzo embarking on deals which saddled the airline with other carriers' debts, he also began consolidating the different airlines into one system. That resulted in a fleet comprising numerous aircraft types, evident in the patchwork array of liveries in the Continental fleet that lasted until Gordon Bethune ordered all planes to be painted into the current livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/112407683.html?dids=112407683:112407683&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+30%2C+1993&amp;author=Suzanne+Wooton&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=Despite+foes%2C+Lorenzo+applies+to+start+Friendship+Airlines&amp;pqatl=google|title=Despite foes, Lorenzo applies to start Friendship Airlines|publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com|date=March 30, 1993|accessdate=May 4, 2010|first=Suzanne|last=Wooton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, following a dramatic reduction of service by United Airlines and an unsuccessful attempt by [[USAir]] to establish point-to-point service, Continental expanded at [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and established what would become its third-largest system hub. Continental quickly gained nearly all of the gates in the C concourse (once dominated by United), and later expanded that concourse to 24 gates in addition to eventually constructing a new Concourse D in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53656072.html|title=Continental Airlines to Expand Cleveland Hub. â Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News &amp;#124; HighBeam Research â FREE trial|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=January 27, 1999|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:continental b757-200 n18119 landing arp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing 757|Boeing 757â200]] in 1991âcurrent livery]]

On February 12, 1991, Continental unveiled its new and current blue and gray livery and the &quot;globe&quot; logo. These continue to be the identity for Continental's fleet and facilities identification and will be the foundation of the livery of the post-merger United Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5469475_ITM|title=Article: Strategy, not failure.

In 1993 [[Air Canada]], [[Air Partners]] and [[Texas Pacific Group]], enabled Continental to emerge from bankruptcy by investing $450&amp;nbsp;million in the airline. Under the leadership of former Boeing executive [[Gordon Bethune]], who became President in October 1994, Continental began a successful transformation project. When Bethune took over in 1994 as COO and President of Continental Airlines the troubled airline had twice faced bankruptcy and was again headed that direction. A search firm hired by Continental's board of directors suggested Bethune, who had recently completed an Advanced Management Course at the Harvard Business School, to salvage the company.

Bethune quickly made his mark on the carrier recognizing that a good airline was defined by customer satisfaction, not just cost per available seat mile. Bethune ascended to the role of CEO and was elected chairman of the board of directors in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22519369.html|title=CONTINENTAL CEO IS NOW CHAIRMAN, TOO â The Record (Bergen County, NJ) &amp;#124; HighBeam Research â FREE trial|publisher=Highbeam.com|date=October 2, 1996|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continental went from being ranked last in every measurable performance category to winning more J.D. Power and Associates awards for Customer Satisfaction than any other airline in the world. ''BusinessWeek'' magazine named Bethune one of the top 25 Global Managers in 1996 and 1997. Under his leadership Continental's stock price rose from $2 to over $50 per share. ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' named Continental among the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America for six consecutive years. In his final year piloting the airline ''Fortune'' magazine ranked Continental 2004's No. 1 Most Admired Global Airline, a title it earned again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.[1] Bethune released his book, ''[[From Worst to First]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bethune, Gordon, From Worst to First: Behind the scenes of Continental's remarkable comeback (ISBN 978-0471356523), Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 detailing his success at that carrier.

While at Continental, Mr. Bethune created the Go-Forward plan, to fix problems with the airline, which included employee morale, the quality of the product, and the route structure, among others. He is credited, along with his management team, for saving Continental from extinction. Bethune began by ordering new aircraft in an effort to convert to an all-Boeing fleet. After the opening of Denver airport on February 28, 1995, Continental management decided that the Denver hub â its historic operational base and heart of the system for almost 60 years â would be abruptly reduced to spoke status (with service only to Houston, Newark, and Cleveland). This decision centered on cost-reductions, since DIA charges and landing fees were substantially higher than those at [[Stapleton International Airport|Stapleton]], which DIA had replaced.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Between 1993 and 1995, Continental experimented with an 'airline within an airline' by launching ''CALite'', later renamed ''[[Continental Lite]]'', which provided all-economy, low-fare, no-frills service between primarily leisure destinations. Continental Lite operated with a dedicated fleet of 100 [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] and [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737â200]] aircraft, each repainted with the 'Lite' livery and stripped of its first class cabin. (The Continental Lite experiment was rumored to be the result of &quot;extra&quot; aircraft on hand following the closure of Continental's Denver hub.) This service was based primarily at Continental's existing hub in [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport|Cleveland]] as well as a new hub established in [[Piedmont Triad International Airport|Greensboro, NC]]. The experiment, which had been developed and launched by Bethune's predecessor, Robert Ferguson, proved unsuccessful and the brand was dissolved in 1995. Continental's short-lived [[Piedmont Triad International Airport|Greensboro]] hub was dismantled in the process.

On March 26, 1996, Continental launched the first phase of its website.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18130509.html CONTINENTAL AIRLINES FLIES ONTO THE INTERNET].&quot; ''PR Newswire''. March 26, 1996. Retrieved on May 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period Continental was the subject of hostile takeover bids submitted by then Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. The final deal struck, as described by Bethune in his book, with Northwest allowed Continental to keep its corporate identity but all major decisions, mergers and alliances, were controlled by means of a &quot;golden share&quot; owned by Northwest Airlines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===International expansion begins (1997â2007)===

Beginning in 1998, Continental again embarked on a program to expand its international operations. In that year it inaugurated services to Ireland and Scotland, and in October 1998 the airline received its first [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] aircraft, allowing [[non-stop flight]]s from Newark and Houston to [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo, Japan]], and from Newark to [[Ben Gurion International Airport|Tel Aviv, Israel]]. Continental in the same year launched partnerships with [[Northwest Airlines]], [[Copa Airlines]], [[Avant Airlines]], [[Transbrasil]], and [[Cape Air]], and Continental and [[America West Airlines]] became the first two US airlines to launch interline electronic ticketing.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/company/history/1991-2000.aspx].&quot; ''Continental Airlines Expands''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Continental Airlines started service between Newark and Zurich, Switzerland, and from Cleveland to London. The Cleveland to London originally flew from Cleveland Hopkins International to London's Gatwick Airport, but moved in 2009 to London Heathrow. Due to the economic situation, this flight was suspended.

In 1998 Continental expanded its flycontinental.com functionality, including the addition of [[WebTV]] and [[Windows CE]] functionality and expanding services to Canadian users.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/vendors/default.aspx?i=%2Fweb%2Fen-US%2Fcontent%2Fcompany%2Fnews%2Frelease%2F1998-10-13-02.html Continental Airlines Expands Flycontinental.com Service].&quot; Continental Airlines.

On March 1, 2001, Continental launched non-stop service from Newark to [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]], operating over the North circumpolar route. This service was the first non-stop long-haul route for any airline with flying duration exceeding 16 hours. The [[SARS]] outbreak in Asia caused service to be suspended until August 1, 2003. The launch in 2001 initiated a brief battle between Continental, United Airlines and [[Cathay Pacific]] over rights to non-stop flights between Hong Kong and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/30/opinion/from-newark-over-the-north-pole.html|work=The New York Times|title=From Newark Over the North Pole|date=March 30, 2001|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 non-stop daily services were started between Newark and Geneva, Switzerland and between Newark and Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. On September 13, 2004 Continental entered SkyTeam alliance along with Northwest/KLM and CSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2004/09/13/daily3.html|title=Continental joins SkyTeam Alliance â Houston Business Journal|publisher=Houston.bizjournals.com|date=September 13, 2004|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental introduced new non-stop services to Oslo, Norway and Edinburgh, Scotland in 2004. In 2005, Continental expanded service from Newark to Beijing after being awarded the China route. During the same year, five new European destinations were added: Stockholm in Sweden, Belfast and Bristol in the United Kingdom, and Hamburg and Berlin in Germany. Services were added to Copenhagen, Denmark and Cologne, Germany in 2006, and to Athens, Greece in 2007. Among U.S. airlines, only Delta (with its extensive network of legacy routes dating from Delta's acquisition of Pan American's European network) serves more European destinations than Continental.

In 2005 service to Asia was expanded as Continental introduced daily nonstop service between Newark and New Delhi, India.

United and [[US Airways]] were in advanced merger talks in late April 2008, following the announcement that Continental had broken off talks with United.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/28/us-united-usair-merger-idINN2830615720080428 UAL, USAir in &quot;very advanced&quot; merger talks: sources], Reuters, April 28, 2008. Retrieved July 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, CEOs of both United Airlines and Continental Airlines signed an alliance pact presaging their eventual merger. The alliance is an agreement to link international networks and share technology and passenger perks. This agreement is basically a &quot;virtual merger&quot; that includes many of the benefits of a merger without the actual costs and restructuring involved. The alliance took effect about a year after [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[Northwest Airlines]] completed their merger, as that released Continental from the SkyTeam contract and allowed for the required nine-month notice. Additionally, Continental joined the Star Alliance, as Delta and Northwest merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-fri-united-alliance-uaua-caljun20,0,3619794.story|title=United, Continental join forces|author=Johnsson, Julie|work=Chicago Tribune|date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Airlines was reported to be in serious merger discussion with US Airways in early April 2010. A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report indicated that a deal was close. Union consent was cited as a major hurdle for negotiators to clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/united-and-us-airways-hold-merger-talks/?ref=business|title=United and US Airways Said to be in Merger Talks|work=New York Times|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 2010, United announced that it would not pursue a merger with [[US Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Dan|url=http://www.usatoday.com/MONEY/usaedition/2010-04-22-us-airways-ends-merger-talks-united-airlines_NU.htm?csp=34|title=Irked US Airways ends merger talks with United|work=USA Today|date=April 22, 2010|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Directors at Continental and United airlines approved a stock-swap deal that would combine them into the world's largest airline on Sunday, May 2, 2010.

Currently, more than three hundred planes from both United and Continental have been painted in the new United livery.
There has been some public negative reaction to the new United livery among United employees and frequent flyers and fans,
with petitions on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to save the pre-merger United [[Saul Bass#Logos and other designs|Saul Bass]] logo and livery. Management may have taken note of this negative reaction when it changed the font of the new livery to the current ALL CAPS 
san serif font closer to the latest United Airlines font, from the originally proposed
title caps serifed font similar to the latest Continental font,
though management has never publicly provided a reason for this change.

The company's CEO has stated repainting all aircraft quickly into the new livery, in order to have a &quot;uniform livery&quot; will be a priority now that the merger has been approved. As of late July 2010, United Airlines had suspended all repaints into their then current livery. N794UA, a Boeing 777â200 was the last aircraft to receive United's blue and white livery.

The new United will be the [[World's largest airline|second largest airline]] in terms of fleet size, while [[Delta Air Lines]] remains the largest. The combined airline houses a fleet of nearly 700 aircraft, surpassing [[American Airlines]]' 621. There are also 118 aircraft on order, 50 from United, and 68 from Continental. The combined fleet features a mixture of [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] aircraft: [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A319]]s, [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]]s, [[Boeing 737]]s, [[Boeing 747]]s, [[Boeing 757]]s, [[Boeing 767]]s, and [[Boeing 777]]s with orders of [[Airbus A350]]s and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s.

Both airlines have taken losses in the recession and expect the merger to generate savings of more than {{Nowrap|$1 billion}} a year.&lt;ref name=BBCmerger&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10095080.stm|title=United and Continental Airlines to merge|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined airline will serve up to 370 destinations, from the 10 hubs listed below.

===Environmental record===
Continental Airlines has made efforts to minimize the negative environmental effects of commercial aviation. For example, the carrier invested over $12&amp;nbsp;billion for the purchase of the current 270 fuel-efficient aircraft and related equipment that make up part of the airline's fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;saipantribune&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Continental gets EPA award for PreKote use|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=5&amp;newsID=79091|work=[[Saipan Tribune]]|date=April 18, 2008|accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have contributed to significant reductions of greenhouse gas and noise emissions, and have decreased fuel consumption by 45% per mainline revenue passenger mile over the past decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;saipantribune&quot;/&gt; Continental Airlines was also one of the first carriers in the world to fit [[winglets]] to as much of its fleet as it could, reducing fuel burn by 3â5%.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;API Performance Enhancing Winglets&quot; â ''[[Airliner World]]'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Continental has implemented a program that gives passengers the opportunity to offset their carbon emissions per flight for a fee of $2. Funds collected from the [[carbon offset]] scheme are directed for tree planting in reforestation areas. Passengers can also contribute $50 or more to fund renewable-energy projects such as wind- or solar-power projects, or to re-establish algae in oceans or large scale reforestation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bizweekbiofuel&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Pallavi|last=Gogoi|title=Carbon Offsets Take Flight|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_437700.htm|work=BusinessWeek  |date=March 28, 2008|accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) &quot;Design for the Environment Program&quot; has recognized Continental (2008) for use of a non-chromium aircraft surface pre-treatment that is environmentally compatible. Continental Airlines is the first carrier in the world to utilize this technology on their aircraft. The product, &quot;PreKote&quot;, eliminates hazardous chemicals that are usually used in the pre-treatment phase before painting an aircraft. This technology provides improved environmental conditions for maintenance employees, while also reducing wastewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;saipantribune&quot;/&gt;

Continental Airlines is planning flight tests using aircraft powered by [[biofuel]] rather than traditional Jet-A1. On January 7, 2009, Continental partnered with [[GE Aviation]] to conduct a biofuel demonstration flight, making the airline the first U.S. carrier to conduct tests using biofuels. The test bed, a Boeing 737â800 (registered as N76516), ran one of its engines on a mix of 50% [[kerosene]], 6% [[algae]], and 44% [[jatropha]], a weed that bears oil producing seeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-biofuel8-2009jan08,0,761065.story&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=2265|title=Airline industry advances use of biofuels|accessdate=May 6, 2008|work=[[Biodiesel Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine running partly on biofuel burned 46&amp;nbsp;kg less fuel than the conventional engine in 1 and a half hours while producing more thrust using the same volume of fuel. Continental's CEO, Larry Kellner, commented &quot;This is a good step forward, an opportunity to really make a difference to the environment&quot; citing jatropha's 50â60% lower CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions as opposed to Jet-A1 in its lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Greener Future?&quot; â ''Aircraft Illustrated'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destinations==
{{Main|Continental Airlines destinations}}
Continental, together with Continental Express and Continental Connection, offered more than 2,400 daily departures throughout the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The summer 2008 schedule saw Continental serving 130 domestic and 132 international destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Continental Airlines Announces New Policy for Same-Day Flight Changes.|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS161663+26-Jun-2008+PRN20080626?symbol=CAL.N|work=Continental Airlines News Release|publisher=via [[Reuters]]|date=June 26, 2008|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continental Airlines operated primarily a hub-and-spoke route network with North American hubs in Cleveland, Houston, and Newark, and a west Pacific hub in Guam. The majority of Continental flights were operated from its hubs, with a few exceptions (Seattle-Anchorage, Los Angeles-Honolulu, and Los Angeles-Havana, Laguardia â Aruba). Some affiliated airlines used the [[Continental Connection]] name also operate flights not involving hubs, such as [[Gulfstream International Airlines]], which operated intra-Florida and Florida-Bahamas services.

[[File:IAH Aerial.jpg|thumb|Continental is the dominant operator at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]]]]

For almost 40 years, Continental operated a very large hub in [[Denver]], Colorado, but took the decision to close that hub in 1995 immediately after the opening of [[Denver International Airport]] (D.I.A), which represented a significantly higher-cost operation than the former Stapleton Airport, which D.I.A. had replaced. The abrupt nature of this change came as a shock to Denver, which was experiencing dramatic growth. The void left by Continental's departure allowed the establishment of the &quot;new&quot; [[Frontier Airlines]] (a startup, rather than the original carrier of that name). Both Frontier and Southwest Airlines (which entered the Denver market after Continental's dehubbing) have expanded quickly to fill the vacuum created by Continental's closing of its Denver hub.

For the first forty years of its existence, Continental was a domestic airline; however, especially after the incorporation of [[Texas International Airlines|Texas International]] routes, it has served more Mexican destinations than any other U.S. carrier since the mid-1980s.

Continental first entered the transatlantic market in April 1985, with the introduction of a Houston-[[Gatwick Airport|London-Gatwick]] service. Long prevented from serving [[London Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]] because of the provisions of the Bermuda II agreement, Continental maintained its London services at Gatwick, where in 2007 as many as six flights a day were offered to Newark, Houston, and Cleveland.

In March 2008, an [[Open Skies Agreement]] between the U.S. and the European Union became effective, invalidating Bermuda II restrictions that had limited the number of carriers and cities in the U.S. that could serve London-Heathrow. In November 2007 Continental announced that new, nonstop, twice-daily service from its hubs at [[Houston-George Bush Intercontinental]] and [[Newark-Liberty]] to London-Heathrow would be offered; and this service was inaugurated on March 29, 2008. The service replaced existing frequencies to London-Gatwick and are offered with a combination of [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] and [[757-200]] equipment, with flat beds guaranteed in the BusinessFirst cabin.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=85779&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1078367&amp;highlight= Continental Airlines to Launch Twice-Daily Nonstop Flights to Heathrow From Both New York and Houston]&quot;, ''Continental Airlines''&lt;/ref&gt; Continental has grown its presence at London-Heathrow to seven daily flights; two to Houston-Intercontinental and five to Newark.

[[File:Houston Bush Airport.jpg|thumb|Continental operates international flights from Terminal E at [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]], Houston, Texas.]]

During the [[Vietnam War]], Continental's extensive military charter operations established a presence in the Pacific region that formed the basis for the [[Air Micronesia]] operation. Service to Japan was initiated in the 1970s from Guam and Saipan, and by the late 1980s, nonstop service between Seattle and Tokyo was briefly offered with [[Boeing 747|747]] equipment, soon to be replaced with a direct Honolulu-[[Narita International Airport|Tokyo (Narita)]] flight. Through the 1990s, Continental maintained a minimal presence in the long-haul trans-Pacific market, until the delivery of 777-200ERs in 1998 which saw the addition of nonstop Tokyo service from Houston and Newark. By 2007, Hong Kong and Beijing were added to the network, and in 2009 Shanghai was added, all from the Newark hub. Continental has served Australia in the past with DC-10&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4804460.html Continental to cut Fiji service in response to Australian protest. (Continental Airlines)]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&quot;, ''[[Travel Weekly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Boeing 747]] service from Hawaii; Continental withdrew from much of the Australian market, but continues Air Micronesia [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737â800]] services between Cairns and Guam on a 4x weekly basis.  Beginning in June 2011, it initiated service to [[Hilo]], Hawaii, providing that city the only nonstop air service to and from any destination outside the state of Hawaii. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.airlinesanddestinations.com/airlines/continental-to-begin-serving-hilo-in-hawaii-in-june-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

Continental offers the most destinations of any of the U.S. carrier to India, Japan, Mexico, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and is the only U.S. airline to fly to the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Norway, and Vietnam. Continental began service from Newark to [[Mumbai]], India on October 1, 2007 making that city Continental's second Indian destination.

===Codeshare agreements===

==Fleet==
Continental's all-[[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing]] fleet consisted of four types (737, 757, 767, and 777) in ten variants, with two variants of the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] scheduled to enter service in 2011. The company's daily aircraft utilization is usually at the top of the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot;/&gt; The [[List of Boeing customer codes|Boeing customer code]] for Continental Airlines is 7x7-x24.

First Class is offered on Domestic Flights. BusinessFirst is offered on Transatlantic/Transpacific Flights.
&lt;/center&gt;

Continental Airlines was one of three carriers (with [[American Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]]) to sign an exclusivity agreement with Boeing in the late 1990s. When Boeing acquired [[McDonnell Douglas]], the European Union forced Boeing to void the contracts. Both parties have been adhering to the terms under a [[gentlemen's agreement]].

Continental was one of the first major airlines to fly the Boeing 757 on transatlantic routes. There have been some instances of range limitations on west-bound transatlantic flights due to strong headwinds resulting in a fuel stop which does not appear on the timetable, but these stops are not common. The use of the 757 with its smaller [[seating capacity]] has allowed for &quot;thin&quot; routes (routes with less passenger traffic) to be economically viable. It has allowed non-stop service from smaller cities, such as [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland and [[Hamburg]], Germany to the New York gateway. Previously, customers originating at these and similar cities needed to connect at European gateways like London, Paris or Frankfurt in order to travel to New York.

All of Continental's Boeing 737s and 757s had [[wingtip device|winglets]].

===Cabin===
Continental Airlines had a two-class service configuration, First/BusinessFirst and Economy Class, for aircraft in the mainline fleets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/aircraft/default.aspx Continental Airlines Aircraft Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

====BusinessFirst====
Continental had begun deploying BusinessFirst seats that allows customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing 6Â½ feet (2 m) of sleeping space in the fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft. The Flat Bed Seat offered a seat measuring up to {{convert|25|in|mm}} wide when the adjustable armrest is positioned flush with the seat cushion. Electronic controls enabled customers to easily move the seats to an infinite combination of seat adjustments, including lumbar support, leg and foot rests. iPod connectivity is available in the Flat Bed Seat. The new BusinessFirst seats have a six-way adjustable head rest, an individual overhead reading light and an adjustable seat light allowing customers to read in bed without disturbing their neighbor and a privacy shell that allows for seclusion from other travelers. BusinessFirst customers also receive one of the highest crew to passenger ratios (1:8) among all international business class products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.continental.com/web/en-GB/content/bf.aspx Continental Airlines â BusinessFirst]. Continental.com. Retrieved on December 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Continental Airlines BusinessFirst gen1 777.jpg|thumb|left|Previous generation 777 BusinessFirst seats, Replaced in 2010]]
The new BusinessFirst seats were featured on all of Continental's [[Boeing 777]]s and [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757â200]]'s. Installation on the [[Boeing 767]] fleet will follow in 2011. The anticipated completion of the roll-out across Continental's entire international fleet is August 2012. In addition, all 787 deliveries will have the seats installed.

Continental considered BusinessFirst to be its signature onboard product, and the service is a frequent subject of advertising campaigns. Customers seated in the BusinessFirst cabin on longhaul flights from the United States to Europe, Asia, select cities in South America, and the Middle East receive special ground services, including EliteAccess priority bag service at check-in, expedited security screening (where available), access to Continental's Presidents Club or affiliated Star Alliance lounges, personalized Continental Concierge service, and dedicated boarding procedures.

[[File:Continental Airlines BusinessFirst entree.jpg|thumb|In-flight meal in BusinessFirst]]

Onboard, multi-course meals were designed by Continental's Congress of Chefs, beverages are selected by Continental's Wine Masters, and service is provided by flight attendants from separate International crew bases at Newark and Houston. Most flights have at least two meal services. Entertainment is offered at each individual seat, and passengers on Boeing 777 and 757 aircraft have access to a new Audio-Video On Demand system with touch-screen controls. 767 aircraft feature older, looped-video multi-channel entertainment systems, generally with a wider programming selection than Economy Class. 767 aircraft are expected to receive AVOD in the near future. Customers also are provided headphones, a large pillow, wool blanket, and amenity kit prior to departure. Upon arrival, BusinessFirst customers have access to shower facilities and arrival lounges at most airports.

Continental offered a modified BusinessFirst service on flights from the United States mainland to Hawaii. All flights offer the same suite of EliteAccess ground services, along with a similar main meal service onboard. Amenities such as pillows and headsets also are the same, but no amenity kits are offered. On flights from Newark and Houston to Honolulu, Continental operates Boeing 767-400ER equipment with typical recliner-style BusinessFirst seats. On flights from Los Angeles and Orange County to Honolulu/Kahului with [[Boeing 737]] equipment, domestic First Class seats are substituted. Nonstop flights from Guam to Honolulu were exempt from most of these modifications and more closely resemble the standard BusinessFirst service.

No complimentary upgrades were offered to Continental OnePass Elite members on any intercontinental flights offering BusinessFirst service. However, on 767-operated BusinessFirst services to Hawaii, Continental offers a day-of-departure buy up fee for any revenue coach class fare, provided seats are available. Mainland-Hawaii was the only BusinessFirst market where such upgrades are available. In addition, OnePass Elites were eligible for complimentary automatic upgrades on Continental-operated flights from California to Hawaii.
[[File:Continental Airlines domestic First Class dinner.jpg|thumb|left|Domestic First Class dinner]]

====Domestic First Class/International Business Class====
Domestic First Class was offered on domestic flights. It was available on all Boeing 737 family aircraft, as well as Boeing 757â300 aircraft. Seats range from 20.75 to {{convert|21|in|mm}} wide, and have between 37 and {{convert|38|in|mm}} of pitch. Passengers aboard this class receive free meals, refreshments, and alcoholic beverages. Passengers can watch movies on overhead television screens located throughout the cabin. Beginning in 2009, Continental plans to add [[LiveTV]] television and [[Wi-Fi]] services to all next-generation Boeing 737s and Boeing 757-300s which will be free of charge to First Class customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;LiveTV&quot;&gt;[http://www.continental.com/web/en-US/apps/vendors/default.aspx?i=PRNEWS Continental Airlines To Add LiveTV and Wi-Fi To Next-Gen 737 and 757-300 Aircraft] (Official Press Release: January 29, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

On international flights to Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean, and select cities in South America, Continental's Domestic First Class service weas re-branded as International Business Class. These customers received access to Continental's Presidents Club and affiliated Star Alliance lounges on day-of-departure. Also, meal choices were frequently substituted to reflect the local cuisine of destinations served, especially on flights to Latin America.

====International Economy Class====

==OnePass==
[[File:Continental Airlines OnePass logo.png|200px|right|]]
Established in 1987 in cooperation with now defunct [[Eastern Airlines]], OnePass was the [[frequent flyer program]] for Continental Airlines, [[Copa Airlines]] and [[AeroRepÃºblica|Copa Airlines Colombia]]. OnePass offered regular travelers the privilege to obtain free tickets, First Class upgrades on flights, discounted membership for its airport lounge ([[Continental Airlines#President's Club|President's Club]]), and other types of rewards. Customers accumulated miles from flight segments they fly or through Continental Airlines partners. OnePass elite tiers were Silver, Gold, and Platinum Elite which have benefits such as free upgrades, mileage bonus, priority check-in, priority boarding, and much more. Continental previously had a frequent flyer program prior to OnePass called TravelBank, which was started not long after American Airlines started its frequent flyer program in 1981 and when most large United States airlines followed, but this was merged with Eastern Airlines' frequent flyer program in 1987 to form OnePass.&lt;ref&gt;personal collection of Eastern Airlines frequent flyer program newsletters from 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideflyer.com/articles/o2_sidebar.php?key=4 InsideFlyer.com: The First Frequent Flyer Programs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;OnePass&quot; refers to the ability to accumulate miles on two major airlines, namely Continental and Eastern, in one frequent flyer program.

*March 16, 1954
** Flight 46, on a flight from Midland, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri suffers vibration just after takeoff and goes into a dive; the flight crew managed to make a wheels-up landing in an open field.
* May 22, 1962
** A passenger intent on claiming money from life insurance planted a bomb on the aircraft which departed [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago-OâHare]], destined for [[Kansas City Municipal Airport]]. The bomb exploded, breaking off the aircraft's tail, and the plane crashed on a farm near [[Unionville, Missouri]]. All 45 on board died. This aircraft had previously been subject to an attempted hijacking to Cuba, although the hijackers were captured in [[El Paso, Texas]].
* July 8, 1962
** Damaged beyond economic repair when the propellers struck the runway shortly after take-off. A wheels-up landing was made in a wheat field.
* January 29, 1963
** Flight 290 enroute from [[Midland International Airport|Midland, Texas]] to Kansas City crashed on approach, near the south end of the runway and burst into flames.
* April 13, 1973
** After bringing [[Robert Six|Bob]] and [[Audrey Meadows|Audrey Six]] to their Colorado ranch, the Sabreliner crew departed MTJ&lt;!-- don't use abbreviations I don't understand!! MTJ??--&gt;, for the return flight to Los Angeles (LAX). The thrust reverser of the aircraft was deployed in flight shortly after takeoff. The Sabreliner descended from {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, struck the ground, and was destroyed.
* August 15, 1975
** Flight 426, bound for [[Wichita, Kansas]], crashed near the departure end of runway shortly after takeoff. The aircraft encountered severe windshear at an altitude and airspeed which precluded recovery to level flight. The aircraft descended at a rate which could not be overcome even though the aircraft was flown at or near its maximum lift capability throughout the encounter. The windshear was generated by the outflow from a thunderstorm which was over the aircraft's departure path. All passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The aircraft was a total loss.
* March 1, 1978
** Flight 603 was scheduled to fly to [[Honolulu International Airport|Honolulu, HI]] from Los Angeles. The DC-10 overran the runway at Los Angeles ([[LAX]]) during an aborted takeoff as a result of a tire explosion resulting in a fire engulfing the aircraft. The aircraft was a total loss.
* July 8, 1987
** Near collision with a [[Delta Air Lines]] [[Lockheed L-1011]]. Both the Delta (London-Cincinnati) and Continental (London-Newark) were heading to the U.S. with nearly 600 people total on both aircraft. The Delta flight strayed {{convert|60|mi|km}} off course during its flight and came within {{convert|30|ft|m}} of colliding with the 747 as the L-1011 flew under it in Canadian airspace. It was nearly the deadliest aviation accident in history.
* November 15, 1987
** Flight 1713 bound for [[Boise, Idaho]] crashed on take-off during a snowstorm at Stapleton Intl. Airport.
* February 19, 1996
** Flight 1943 landed wheels up on runway 27 at the Houston Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas.
* July 25, 2000
** Flight 55 caused the crash of [[Air France]] [[Concorde]] [[Air France Flight 4590|Flight 4590]] in Paris. The Continental jet dropped a strip of titanium alloy from its [[thrust reverser]] on the runway during takeoff. When AF4590 subsequently departed, Concorde's left main landing gear tires struck the strip of metal and were punctured. The tires then exploded and tire rubber fragments penetrated Concorde's wing fuel tanks, starting fires in engines 1 and 2, leading to the crash which killed all aboard and four people on the ground. According to the official report on the accident, the strip of metal installed on the Continental jet was made from a different alloy than had been approved by the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] or the engine manufacturer.

** Continental Airlines was found criminally responsible for the disaster to Concorde (Air France Flight 4590) at Gonesse on July 25, 2000 (at which one hundred passengers and nine crew members on board the flight died) by a Parisian court and was fined â¬200,000 ($271,628) and ordered to pay Air France â¬1&amp;nbsp;million. Continental mechanic John Taylor was given a 15-month suspended sentence, while another airline operative and three French officials were cleared of all charges. The court ruled that the crash resulted from a piece of metal from a Continental jet that was left on the runway; the object punctured a tyre on the Concorde and then ruptured a fuel tank. Another Continental employee, Stanley Ford, was found not guilty.
