'''Doe v. Cahill''', [[Case citation|884 A.2d 451]] (Del. 2005), is a significant case in the realm of anonymous internet speech and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. While similar issues had been tackled involving criticism of a publicly traded company &lt;ref name=AOL&gt;''In re Subpoena to AOL'',[2000 WL 1210372, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 220] (Va. Cir. Ct. 2000), [revâd on other grounds, 542 S.E.2d 377] (Va. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;, the case marks the first time a U.S. State Supreme Court addressed the issue of anonymous internet speech and defamation &quot;in the context of a case involving political criticism of a public figure.&quot; &lt;ref name=Doe&gt;''Doe v. Cahill'', [https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/Doe_v_Cahill/doe_v_cahill_decision.pdf 884 A.2d 451] (Del. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2004 an anonymous internet user, referred to in the decision as Doe, posted comments under the alias &quot;Proud Citizen&quot; on a website called the &quot;Smyrna/Clayton Issues Blog&quot; regarding the performance of Patrick and Julia Cahill as City Councilman of [[Smyrna, Delaware|Smyrna]]. The website was sponsored by the Delaware State News. The guidelines for use of the blog simply stated &quot;[t]his is your hometown forum for opinions about public issues.&quot;

On September 18, 2004 Doe posted the following statement:
&lt;br /&gt;
:If only Councilman Cahill was able to display the same leadership skills,
:energy and enthusiasm toward the revitalization and growth of
:the fine town of Smyrna as Mayor Schaeffer has demonstrated! While
:Mayor Schaeffer has made great strides toward improving the
:livelihood of Smyrnaâs citizens, Cahill has devoted all of his energy to
:being a divisive impediment to any kind of cooperative movement.
:Anyone who has spent any amount of time with Cahill would be keenly
:aware of such character flaws, not to mention an obvious mental
:deterioration. Cahill is a prime example of failed leadership â his
:eventual ousting is exactly what Smyrna needs in order to move
:forward and establish a community that is able to thrive on its own
:economic stability and common pride in its town.

On September 19, 2004 Doe added:
&lt;br /&gt;
:Gahill  [sic] is as paranoid as everyone in the town thinks he is. The
:mayor needs support from his citizens and protections from
:unfounded attacksâ¦

It was these two internet postings that formed the basis for the legal action discussed below.

==Legal timeline==
The legal actions that led to the Delaware Supreme Court case proceeded as follows:
* November 2, 2004: The Cahills file suit against Doe (and 3 other anonymous internet posters) claiming [[defamation]] and [[invasion of privacy]].
* The Cahills conduct a pre-service deposition of Independent Newspapers (which owned the internet blog) and obtained the [[IP address]]es associated with Doe's postings.
* The Cahills learn that these IP addresses are owned by the [[Comcast|Comcast Corporation]] and obtain a court order requiring Comcast to disclose Doe's identity.
* Comcast notifies Doe of the Cahills' request to disclose identity, as required by federal law.&lt;ref name=subscriber&gt;''Protection of Subscriber Privacy'',[http://vlex.com/vid/sec-protection-subscriber-privacy-19258063 47 U.S.C. 551].&lt;/ref&gt;
* January 4, 2005: Doe files an &quot;Emergency Motion for a Protective Order&quot; to block Comcast from disclosing his identity to the Cahills.
* June 14, 2005: Superior Court trial judge denies Doe's motion for a protective order, using a &quot;good faith&quot; standard for &quot;determining when a defamation plaintiff could compel the disclosure of the identity of an anonymous plaintiff.&quot; &lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;
* June 28, 2005: Doe appeals the decision by Superior Court and the case is accepted by the Delaware Supreme Court.

==Adoption of standard==
As this was the first trial of its kind, the court took upon itself the task of establishing an acceptable standard for deciding a discovery request to reveal the identity of an anonymous defendant alleged to have posted defamatory material on the internet by a public figure plaintiff. The court began by reviewing the possible spectrum of applicable standards over which the court must chose as the standard for this and similar cases. In ascending order the possible standards are &quot;good faith basis to assert a claim, ...pleading sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss, [and] ...showing of ''prima facie'' evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgement.&quot; &lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

The Superior Court permitted discovery of Doe's identity under the good faith standard. This good faith standard was famously applied in ''In re Subpoena to AOL'',&lt;ref name=AOL /&gt; where the court concluded that anonymous identities should be revealed only if:

# The court is satisfied with pleadings and evidence
# The party bringing suit or subpoena had legitimate, good faith basis for actions
# The identity information is central to the claim

The Delaware Supreme Court disagreed with this standard. The court rejected the good faith standard due to the danger of bringing suit simply to reveal identity without any intention of pursuing the defamation action to a final decision. This, the court concluded, would have a [[chilling effect]] on free speech on the internet in contradiction to the First Amendment.

The Supreme Court then turned to ''Ramunno v. Cawley'' &lt;ref name=Ramunno&gt;''Ramunno v. Cawley'', [Ramunno v. Cawley, 705 A.2d 1029, 1034] (Del. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; as an example of the motion to dismiss standard being applied to a similar case. The court used ''Ramunno'' as an example of a motion to dismiss standard failing to screen &quot;silly or trivial defamation suits.&quot; &lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

Thus, the court concluded, that in order to provide sufficient protection of anonymous internet speech and the First Amendment, a summary judgement standard is necessary. The court chose to base its summary judgement standard off of the precedent set by ''[[Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3]]''.&lt;ref name=Dendrite&gt;''Dendrite International v. Doe'', [http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4359061627359648045&amp;amp;q=Dendrite+International+v.+Doe&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=2002 342 N.J. Super. 134, 775 A.2d 756] (App. Div. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dendrite'' the court held that a summary judgement standard &quot;is the appropriate test by which to strike the balance between a defamation plaintiffâs right to protect his reputation and a defendantâs right to exercise free speech anonymously.&quot; &lt;ref name=Doe /&gt; The Dendrite test developed in this decision has four prongs as described in Doe v. Cahill:

(1) to undertake efforts to notify the anonymous poster that he is the 
subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure, 
and to withhold action to afford the anonymous defendant a 
reasonable opportunity to file and serve opposition to the 
application. In the internet context, the plaintiffâs efforts should 
include posting a message of notification of the discovery request 
to the anonymous defendant on the same message board as the 
original allegedly defamatory posting; 

(2) to set forth the exact statements purportedly made by the 
anonymous poster that the plaintiff alleges constitute defamatory 
speech; and 

(3) to satisfy the {{lang|la|[[prima facie]]}} or âsummary judgment standard.â 

Finally, after the trial court concluded that the plaintiff has presented a prima 
facie cause of action, the Dendrite test requires the trial court to: &lt;br /&gt;
(4) balance the defendantâs First Amendment right of anonymous 
free speech against the strength of the {{lang|la|prima facie}} case presented 
and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendantâs 
identity in determining whether to allow the plaintiff to properly 
proceed.&lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;

In this case, the court holds that only the first and third prongs of the Dendrite test are relevant, and thus adopts a summary judgement standard based on these two prongs.

==The decision==
Applying the summary judgement standard described above, the judgement of the superior court was reversed, the case was remanded back to the superior court with instructions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim with prejudice. Therefore, Doe was permitted to remain anonymous.

==Aftermath of the precedent==
Doe v. Cahill represented another victory for the protection of free anonymous speech on the internet. The precedent was notably applied in [[Mobilisa, Inc. v. Doe]] in 2007 &lt;ref name=Mobilisa&gt;''Mobilisa Inc. v. Doe'', [http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16268521309978372777&amp;q=Mobilisa,+Inc.+v.+Doe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5&amp;as_vis=1 170 P.3d 712] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and still serves as the standard for anonymous internet speech and defamation &quot;in the context of a case involving political criticism of a public figure.&quot; &lt;ref name=Doe /&gt;
