The '''donkey''' or '''ass''', ''Equus africanus asinus'',&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; is a [[Domestication|domesticated]] member of the [[Equidae]] or horse family. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the [[African Wild Ass]], ''E. africanus''.
In the western [[United States]], a small donkey is sometimes called a ''[[wikt:en:burro#Spanish|burro]]'' (from the Spanish word for the animal).

A male donkey or ass is called a '''jack''', a female a [[Jenny (donkey)|jenny]], and an offspring less than one year old a [[foal]] (male: [[colt (horse)|colt]], female: [[filly]]).

While different species of the [[Equidae]] family can interbreed, offspring are almost always sterile. Nonetheless, horse/donkey [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s are popular for their durability and vigor. A [[mule]] is the offspring of a jack (male donkey) and a [[mare (horse)|mare]] (female horse). The much rarer successful mating of a male horse and a female donkey produces a [[hinny]].

Asses were first [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name=Rossel/&gt; or 4000&amp;nbsp;BC, probably in [[Egypt]] or [[Mesopotamia]],&lt;ref name=nowak&gt;{{cite book|last=Nowak|first=Ronald M.|title=Walker's Mammals of the World|year=1999|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, MD|isbn=9780801857898|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7W-DGRILSBoC|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today.  While domesticated species are increasing in numbers,  the African wild ass and another relative, the [[Onager]], are [[endangered species|endangered]]. As &quot;[[Working animal|beasts of burden]]&quot; and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.

==Scientific and common names==
Traditionally, the scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus asinus asinus'' based on the [[Priority (nomenclature)|principle of priority]] used for scientific names of animals. However, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] ruled in 2003 that if the domestic species and the wild species are considered subspecies of each other, the scientific name of the wild species has priority, even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies.&lt;ref name=Opinion2007/&gt; This means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is ''Equus africanus asinus'' when it is considered a subspecies, and ''Equus asinus'' when it is considered a species.

Until recently the [[synonym]] ''ass'' was the more common term for the donkey, as in ''jackass'', meaning &quot;male donkey&quot;. The first written use of ''donkey'' is as recent as 1785.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; While the word ''ass'' has [[cognate]]s in most other [[Indo-European languages]], ''donkey'' is an [[etymology|etymologically]] obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified. Hypotheses on its derivation include the following:
* Perhaps a diminutive of ''[[dun gene|dun]]'' (dull grayish-brown), a typical donkey colour.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;
* Perhaps from the name ''Duncan''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD4donkey&quot;/&gt;
* Perhaps of imitative origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHD4donkey&quot; /&gt;
The [[homonym]]ity in the United States with a vulgar term ''ass'' for &quot;buttocks&quot; may have influenced its gradual replacement by ''donkey'' there, though this does not account for the parallel change in Britain and Australia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Characteristics==

Donkeys vary considerably in size, depending on breed and management. The height at the [[withers]] ranges from {{convert|80|to|160|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and the weight from {{convert|80|tonocomma|480|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}. Donkeys have a lifespan of 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref name=alberta/&gt;

Donkeys are adapted to marginal [[desert]] lands, and have many traits that are unique to the species as a result. Wild donkeys live separated from each other, unlike tight [[wild horse]] and [[feral horse]] herds. Donkeys have developed very loud vocalizations, which help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert. The best-known call is referred to as a &quot;bray,&quot; which can be heard for over three kilometers. Donkeys have larger ears than horses. Their longer ears may pick up more distant sounds,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and may help cool the donkey's blood. Donkeys in the wild can defend themselves with a powerful kick of their hind legs as well as by biting and striking with their front hooves.

===Breeding===
[[File:Equus asinus KadzidÅowo 001.jpg|thumb|200px|A 3 week old donkey]] 
Jennies are normally pregnant for about 12 months, though the gestation period varies from 11 to almost 14 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta2&quot;/&gt; Jennies usually give birth to a single foal. Twins are very rare: only about 1.7 percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins, and both twins survive in only about 14 percent of cases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

===Nutrition===
[[File:Baudet.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Baudet de Poitou|Poitou donkeys]].]]

Donkeys' tough [[horse anatomy|digestive system]] is somewhat less prone to [[horse colic|colic]] than that of horses, can break down near-inedible vegetation and extract moisture from food very efficiently. As a rule, donkeys need smaller amounts of [[equine nutrition|feed]] than horses of comparable height and weight. Because they are [[easy keeper]]s, if overfed, donkeys are also quite susceptible to [[laminitis]].
[[File:Burrito de pÃ¡ramo (PÃ¡ramo baby donkey).jpg|left|thumb|Woolly [[paramo]] donkey]]
Donkeys evolved to spend 14â16 hours per day browsing and foraging for food. In their native arid and semi-arid climates this would often be a poor quality, scrubby fiber. Domesticated donkey owners face the challenge of feeding their donkey enough low energy fiber in order to meet their appetite, but in temperate climates the forage available is often too rich and abundant, resulting in weight gain and obesity with further implications including [[laminitis]], [[hyperlipidemia]] and [[gastric ulcer]]s.&lt;ref name=Burden2009/&gt; Although the donkeyâs gastrointestinal tract has no marked differences in structure to that of the horse, it is well documented that &quot;donkeys are more efficient at digesting food than horses and, as a consequence, can thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony&quot;.&lt;ref name=smith2008/&gt; Donkeys need to eat approximately 1.5 percent of their body weight per day in dry matter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood2005&quot;/&gt; compared with 2-2.5 percent for horses. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors but it is thought that they may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses. Another possibility is increased gut retention time compared to ponies.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

Donkeys gain most of their daily energy needs from [[Dietary fiber|structural carbohydrates]]. An average, healthy donkey only requires free choice feeding of low-calorie fiber-rich [[forage]] such as [[straw]] (preferably barley straw), supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer and [[hay]] in the winter. A donkeyâs requirement for protein and fat are so low that in practice once the energy requirements are met so too are the protein and fat requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood2005&quot;/&gt; Cereal based feeds designed for horses are often too high in energy levels and will exceed the daily requirements of donkeys.&lt;ref name=Burden2009/&gt; Even a small amount of grazing or fresh [[fodder]] during the spring and summer will provide adequate vitamin levels, so for a normal, healthy donkey a diet of straw plus a little grazing or hay meets their nutritional needs without need for concentrated feeds. A low-calorie vitamin and mineral supplement is recommended for donkeys year-round when on a restricted diet, and to all donkeys during the winter months.

===Behaviour===

Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of &quot;self preservation&quot; than exhibited by horses.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with man, it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason. Once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Although formal studies of their [[ethology|behaviour]] and [[animal cognition|cognition]] are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.

===Communication===
[[File:The W(estminster) just-asses a braying - or - the downfall of the E. O. table by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|right|Satirical use of braying in a political cartoon]]
Braying is the characteristic sound made by an ass, donkey, and most mules. Donkeys use this sound to communicate and will bray more frequently when a new donkey is encountered. The sound typically lasts for twenty seconds.&lt;ref name=canacoo/&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehead/&gt; The sound may be rendered [[onomatapoeia|onomatapoeically]] as &quot;''[[eeyore]]''&quot; and so this was used as the name of the donkey in [[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]. Donkeys may be trained to bray or not to bray upon command. This may be used as a form of [[mockery]].&lt;ref name=tel/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Braying may be considered a [[simile]] for loud and foolish speech. For example,&lt;ref name=tryon/&gt;{{quote|''There are braying men in the world as well as braying asses; for what's loud and senseless talking and swearing, any other than braying''|[[Sir Roger L'Estrange]]}}

==History==
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Panehsi 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Donkey in an [[Egypt]]ian painting c. 1298-1235 BC]]
The ancestors of the modern donkey are the [[Nubia]]n and [[Somalia]]n subspecies of [[African wild ass]].&lt;ref name=Clut/&gt;&lt;ref name=Albano/&gt; Remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium BC have been found in [[Ma'adi]] in Lower Egypt, and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle, sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia BC. Donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in [[Nubia]], and they supplanted the [[ox]] as the chief pack animal of that culture. The domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures, having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to [[chewing the cud|chew their cud]], and were vital in the development of long-distance trade across Egypt. In the [[Dynasty IV]] era of Egypt, between 2675 and 2565 BC, wealthy members of society were known to own over 1,000 donkeys, employed in agriculture, as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt; In 2003, the tomb of either [[Narmer|King Narmer]] or [[Hor-Aha|King Hor-Aha]] (two of the first Egyptian pharaohs) was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans. These burials show the importance of donkeys to the early Egyptian state and its ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,336755,00.html|title=Egyptian Tomb Holds First Known Domesticated Donkeys|date=March 11, 2008|publisher=Fox News Network|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the fourth millennium BC, donkey had spread to Southwest Asia, and the main breeding center had shifted to [[Mesopotamia]] by 1800 BC. The breeding of large, white riding asses made [[Damascus]] famous, while Syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds, including one preferred by women for its easy [[horse gait|gait]]. The Muscat or Yemen ass was developed in [[Arabia]]. By the second millennium BC, the donkey was brought to Europe, possibly at the same time as [[viticulture]] was introduced, as the donkey is associated with the Syrian god of wine, [[Dionysus]]. Greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies, including those in what are now Italy, France and Spain; Romans dispersed them throughout their empire.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt;

[[File:2003ass.PNG|thumb|left|Ass headcount in 2003]]
The first donkeys in the [[New World]] arrived in 1495 on a supply ship to [[Christopher Columbus]], with four jacks and two jennies in the cargo delivered to [[Hispaniola]]. These were used to breed mules for expeditions to mainland America, with males preferred for pack animals and the females for riding. The first shipment of mules, including three jacks and twelve jennies, arrived in Mexico from Cuba ten years after the conquest of the [[Aztec]]s.  Mules were used in silver mines, and each Spanish outpost in the empire bred its own mules from its own jack. Donkeys arrived in large numbers in the western United States during the nineteenth century [[gold rush]]es, as pack animals and for use in mines and ore-grinding mills. The major use of donkeys came to an end with the end of the mining boom and the introduction of railroads in the West. With little value, many animals were turned loose to become the populations of free-roaming donkeys that inhabit the West today.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt; 

[[Miniature donkey]]s originally developed on [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] in the Mediterranean, but are now almost extinct on those islands. Breeders in the United States have spent decades breeding what they term the Miniature Mediterranean Donkey, a mix of Sicilian and Sardinian strains, following the establishment of a [[breed registry]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/other/donkey/mini/index.htm|title=Miniature|publisher=Oklahoma State University|accessdate=2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large, draft-type donkeys originated with the [[Andalusian donkey|Andalusian-type donkey]], and today are seen in the United States as the [[American Mammoth Jack]], a mix of many other donkey breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=myQBSVVEhagC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=mammoth+jack+donkey#v=onepage&amp;q=mammoth%20jack%20donkey&amp;f=false|page=373|title=The Official Horse Breeds Standards Guide: The Complete Guide to the Standards of All North American Equine Breed Associations|author=Lynghaug, Fran|publisher=Voyageur Press|year=2009|isbn=0-7603-3499-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2007 there were estimated to be around 44 million donkeys worldwide. The majority of these are used for agriculture and transportation, although most donkeys in the US (a population of about 55,000, about half of which are [[Miniature donkey]]s) are used for recreation or as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_rsPVUCdS04C&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=donkeys+in+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=donkeys%20in%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Livestock Guardians: Using Dogs, Donkeys and Llamas to Protect Your Herd|author=Dohner, Janet Vorwald|publisher=Storey Publishing|year=2007|isbn=158017695X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys are increasing in popularity in Canada and the US, where they are used as pack animals, riding animals and for pulling wagons. They are also used to halterbreak [[calf|calves]] and as guard animals for flocks of sheep, protecting them from coyotes and dogs.&lt;ref name=IMH/&gt; According to British food writer [[Matthew Fort]], donkeys were, until recently, used in the [[Italian Army]]. The Mountain Fusiliers each had a donkey to [[pack animal|carry]] their gear, and in extreme circumstances the animal could be [[horsemeat|eaten]].&lt;ref name=Vespa/&gt; They have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|war in Afghanistan]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6194874.ece|title=Donkey 'suicide' bombing is latest tactic against patrols|date=April 30, 2009|author=Evans, Michael|journal=The Times|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/jl/saa26.htm|title=Syria and Terrorism|publisher=Jewish Center for Public Affairs|work=Survey of Arab Affairs|author=Ganor, Boaz|date=November 15, 1991|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures that prohibit women from working with [[oxen]] in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys, allowing them to be used by both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XxBrq6hTs_UC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=donkeys+in+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gender in agriculture sourcebook|page=290|author=[[World Bank]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]]|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2009|isbn=0821375873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present status==
About 41 million donkeys were reported worldwide in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; [[China]] has the most with 11 million, followed by [[Pakistan]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Mexico]]. Some researchers believe the actual number is somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starkey 1997&quot;/&gt; The number of breeds and percentage of world population for each of the FAO's world regions was in 2006:&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

In 1997 the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow, as it had steadily done throughout most of history; factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population, progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations, conversion of [[forest]]s to farm and range land, rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel, and the popularity of donkeys as pets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starkey 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blench 2000&quot;/&gt;
More recently, the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking, falling from 43.7 million to 43.5 million between 1995 and 2000, and to only 41 million in 2006.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

The Domestic Animal Diversity Information System ([[DAD-IS]]) of the [[FAO]] listed 189 breeds of ass in June 2011.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; In 2000 the number of [[List of donkey breeds|breeds of donkey]] recorded worldwide was 97, and in 1995 it was 77. The rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the FAO's Animal Genetic Resources project.&lt;ref name=mon/&gt;
{{See also|List of donkey breeds}}

In prosperous countries, the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has recently become a concern, and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up. The largest is the Donkey Sanctuary of England, which also supports donkey welfare projects in Egypt, Ethiopia, [[India]], [[Kenya]], and Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS 2006&quot;/&gt;

==Economic use==

The vast majority of donkeys are used for the same types of work that they have been doing for 6000 years. Their most common role is for transport, whether riding, pack transport, or pulling carts. They may also be used for farm tillage, threshing, raising water, milling, and other jobs. Other donkeys are used to sire mules, as companions for horses, to guard [[sheep]], and as pets. In the past, donkey skin was used in the production of [[parchment]].&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

A few donkeys are milked or raised for meat;&lt;ref name=&quot;Starkey 1997&quot;/&gt; in Italy, which has the highest consumption of equine meat in Europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes, only about 1000 donkeys were slaughtered in 2010, yielding approximately 100 tonnes of meat.&lt;ref name=istat/&gt; Asses' milk may command good prices: the average price in Italy in 2009 was â¬15 per litre,&lt;ref name=latte/&gt; and a price of â¬6 per 100 ml was reported from Croatia in 2008; it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes. The niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;
[[File:Donkey cart in Mozambique.JPG|left|thumb|Donkey cart being loaded in [[Mapai, Mozambique]]]]
Donkeys are often pastured or stabled with horses and ponies, and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses. If a donkey is introduced to a [[Mare (horse)|mare]] and [[foal]], the foal will often turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mother.&lt;ref name=ypte/&gt;

Donkeys are now commonly{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} kept as [[pet]]s in countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared. [[Donkey rides]] for children are also a popular{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} pastime for children in holiday resorts or other leisure contexts.{{-}}

Working donkeys may need to be shod. Donkey shoes are similar to [[horseshoe]]s, but usually smaller and without toe-clips.

==Feral donkeys and wild asses==
In some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established [[feral]] populations, such as the [[Burro]] of North America and the [[Asinara donkey]] of [[Sardinia]], Italy, both of which have protected status. Feral donkeys can also cause problems, notably in environments that have been evolutionarily free of any form of [[equid]], such as Hawaii.&lt;ref name=&quot;feral&quot;/&gt; In Australia, where there may be 5 million [[Feral donkeys in Australia|feral donkeys]],&lt;ref name=roots/&gt; they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment. They may compete with livestock and native animals for resources, spread weeds and diseases, foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;

===Wild asses, onagers, and kiangs===
With the domestication of almost all donkeys, few species now exist in the wild. They include the [[African Wild Ass]], ''Equus africanus'', and its critically endangered subspecies the [[Equus africanus somaliensis|Somali Wild Ass]], ''Equus africanus somaliensis'', and [[Equus africanus africanus|Nubian Wild Ass]], ''Equus africanus africanus'', the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt; Extinct species include the [[European Ass]], ''Equus hydruntinus'', which became extinct during the [[Neolithic]], and the [[Equus africanus atlanticus|North African Wild Ass]], ''Equus africanus atlanticus'', which became extinct in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.&lt;ref name=mon /&gt;

There are also five subspecies of Asiatic Wild Ass or [[Onager]], ''Equus hemionus'', and three subspecies of the [[kiang]], ''Equus kiang'', of the Himalayan upland. 

In the wild asses can reach top speeds equalling [[zebra]]s and even most [[horse]]s.

==Donkey hybrids==
A male donkey (jack) can be crossed with a female horse to produce a [[mule]]. A male horse can be crossed with a female donkey (jennet or jenny) to produce a [[hinny]]. A female donkey in the UK is called a ''mare,'' or ''jenny''.

Horse-donkey [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s are almost always [[infertility|sterile]] because horses have 64 [[chromosome]]s whereas donkeys have 62, producing offspring with 63 chromosomes. Mules are much more common than hinnies. This is believed to be caused by two factors, the first being proven in cat hybrids, that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher, fertility rates drop (as in the case of stallion x jennet). {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss. In addition, there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology. Due to different [[mating]] behavior, jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennys. Further, mares are usually larger than jennys and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb, resulting in a larger animal at birth. It is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies, making them more desirable for breeders to produce, and it is unquestioned that mules are more common in total number{{Citation needed|reason=to make this statement, one needs data indicating the greater prevalence of mules|date=August 2009}}.

The offspring of a [[zebra]]-donkey cross is called a zonkey, [[zebroid]], zebrass, or zedonk;&lt;ref name=zorse/&gt; ''zebra mule'' is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. ''Zebra hinny, zebret'' and ''zebrinny'' all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras.&lt;ref name=zedonk/&gt; There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; there is no such limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.

==Cultural references==
[[File:Automobile of the Orient NGM-v31-p259.jpg|thumb|A North African donkey in a 1917 issue of [[National Geographic Magazine]]]]

The long history of human donkey use has created a rich store of cultural references:

===Religion, myth and folklore===

Donkeys (or asses) are mentioned many times in the [[Bible]], beginning in the first book and continuing through both [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. They are generally seen as work animals, used for agricultural purposes, transport and as beasts of burden, and terminology is used to differentiate age and gender. In contrast, horses were shown in use only in the context of war - ridden by the [[cavalry]] or pulling [[chariot]]s. Owners were protected by law from loss caused by the death or injury of a donkey, showing their value in that time period. Narrative turning points in the Bible (and other stories) are often marked through the use of donkeys - for instance, leading, saddling, or mounting/dismounting a donkey are used to show a change in focus or a decision having been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5yz04U3SlSMC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=donkeys+in+hebrew+proverbs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zmLATvChDKioiQKt09y0Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=donkeys%20in%20hebrew%20proverbs&amp;f=false|pages=71â72|title=Animal imagery in the book of Proverbs|author=Forti, Tova|series=Volume 118 of Supplements to Vetus Testamentum|publisher=BRILL|year=2008|isbn=9004162879}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used as a measure of wealth in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:43,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/book.php?book=Genesis&amp;chapter=30&amp;verse=43|title=Genesis Chapter 30|work=King James Bible|publisher=King James Bible Online|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Genesis chapter 34, the prince of [[Shechem]] (the modern [[Nablus]]) is named Hamor (&quot;donkey&quot; in Hebrew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Genesis-Chapter-34/|title=Genesis Chapter 34|work=King James Bible|publisher=King James Bible Online|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-shaped marking present on donkeys' backs and shoulders supposedly celebrates the animal bearing Jesus into [[Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]], and hairs from this cross (or contact with a donkey) were used as [[folk remedies]] to cure illness, including [[measles]] and [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fRXbm84C2nYC&amp;pg=PT39&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=tail+of+donkey+as+cure&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E0KYqvCniR&amp;sig=waeuJOIS-kv6l7dPnmjTPLs9fxM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=loXCTvDgMObA2gXrw83HDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Black Cats &amp; Four-Leaf Clovers: The Origins of Old Wives' Tales and Superstitions in Our Everyday Lives|author=Oliver, Harry|publisher=Penguin|year=2010|isbn=0399536094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1400 AD, one physician listed riding backwards on a donkey as a cure for [[scorpion]] stings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XdoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA556&amp;lpg=PA556&amp;dq=tail+of+donkey+as+cure+for+scorpion+stings&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WhYo3MEg6J&amp;sig=hbe4gAsjEvbzv1PS9bXftDoG0_g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jonCTtmAG8WL2AXuzcDNDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=Popular Mechanics|page=556|date=October 1923|title=Hundreds of Odd Remedies found in Old Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being associated with Jesus, the donkey was also the symbol of the Egyptian god [[Ra]] and the Greek god [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SImTll3uupIC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=donkey+as+symbol+of+dionysus&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cJvCTuOjE8Pd0QGV3sCHDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=donkey%20as%20symbol%20of%20dionysus&amp;f=false|title=The Signs and Symbols Bible: The Definitive Guide to Mysterious Markings|page=238|author=Gauding, Madonna|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=1402770049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Donkeys also appear repeatedly in the [[Hindu]] and [[Islam]]ic religions.

In the [[Jewish]] religion, donkeys are considered ''avi avot hatuma'' or the ultimate impure animal. They are considered doubly &quot;[[Unclean animals|impure]]&quot;, as they are both non-ruminants and non-cloven hoofed. However, they are the only impure animal that is falls under the [[mitzvah]] (commandment) of firstborn consecration that also applies to humans and pure animals. In Jewish [[Talmud|Oral Tradition]], the [[Messiah|son of David]] was prophesied as riding on a donkey if the [[Israelites#Biblical Israel|tribes of Israel]] are undeserving of redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/6870#.TsfcwlYavrB|title=Parshat Bo: The So Holy Donkey|author=Morrison, Chanan|date=January 24, 2007|accessdate=2011-11-19|publisher=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary [[Israel]], the term &quot;[[The Messiah's Donkey|Messiah's Donkey]]&quot; (Chamoro Shel Mashiach ××××¨× ×©× ××©××) stands at the center of a controversial religious-political doctrine, under which it was the Heavenly-imposed &quot;task&quot; of secular [[Zionists]] to build up a [[Jewish State]], but once the state is established they are fated to give place to [[Orthodox Jews|the Religious]] who are ordained to lead the state. The secularists in this analogy are &quot;The Donkey&quot; while the religious who are fated to supplant them are a collective &quot;Messiach&quot;.

===Literature and film===
Donkeys hold a significant place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come mainly from the [[Bible]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys were found in the works of [[Homer]], [[Aesop]] and [[Apuleius]], where they were generally portrayed as stupid and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the [[lower class]]. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's ''[[The Ass in the Lion Skin]]'', representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown as stupid, clumsy and slow. [[Shakespere]] popularized the use of the word &quot;ass&quot; as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600). In contrast, a few years later, [[Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' shows a more positive slant on the donkey, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/1/1/56/pdf|title=The Mirror Has Two Faces: Contradictory Reflections of Donkeys in Western Literature from Lucius to Balthazar|author=Bough, Jill|journal=Animals|year=2011|pages=56â68|doi=10.3390/ani1010056|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works as symbols of service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the [[New Testament]] [[Nativity]] narrative. Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Balaam]]'s ass, and are seen in a positive light through the story of [[Jesus]] riding into [[Jerusalem]] on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was beginning to be seen with more favoritism by popular authors. [[William Wordsworth]] portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem ''[[Peter Bell]]'', using the donkey as a Christian symbol. However, in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1879 ''[[Travels with a Donkey]]'', the animal is seen by the narrator as no more than a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in [[Juan Ramon Jimenez]]'s ''[[Platero and I]]'' and the melancholy [[Eeyore]] in ''[[Winnie the Pooh]]'' (first release in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature. Donkeys continue to appear in literature during the 20th century, including in [[George Orwell]]'s 1951 ''[[Animal Farm]]'', where [[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]] the donkey is portrayed as resilient and loyal.&lt;ref name=Mirror/&gt; Portrayals at this time were not always positive however, as with the well-meaning but easily manipulated donkey [[Puzzle (Narnia)|Puzzle]] in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s 1956 ''[[The Last Battle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jsaw.lib.lehigh.edu/viewarticle.php?id=459&amp;layout=html|title=Philip K. Dick and C.S.

===Colloquialisms, proverbs and insults===
Many cultures have colloquialisms and proverbs that include donkeys or asses. American ones include &quot;better a donkey that carries me than a horse that throws me&quot;, &quot;a donkey looks beautiful to a donkey&quot;, and &quot;a donkey is but a donkey though laden with gold&quot;, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AbJ1tVGmiTgC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=proverbs+donkey&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=91nATuTUMMnZiAKg0LzcCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=proverbs%20donkey&amp;f=false|title=A Dictionary of American Proverbs|author=Meider, Wolfgang; Stewart A.

===Politics===

Donkeys feature in political systems, symbols and terminology in many areas of the world. A &quot;[[donkey vote]]&quot; is a vote that simply writes down preferences in the order of the candidates (1 at the top, then 2, and so on), and is most often seen in countries with [[preferential voting]] and [[compulsory voting]] such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2010/guide/glossary.htm#donkey_vote|title=Glossary of Election Terms - Donkey Vote|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donkey is a common symbol of the [[Democratic Party of the United States]], originating in a [[cartoon]] by [[Thomas Nast]] of [[Harper's Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoons.osu.edu/nast/kicking_lion.htm|title=Thomas Nast Portfolio|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;''ruc catalÃ ''&quot; or &quot;''burro catalÃ ''&quot; ([[Catalan donkey]]) is a relatively recent [[Catalan symbols|symbol of Catalonia]]. It was chosen when the need was felt in [[Catalonia]] to produce something genuinely Catalan to oppose to the Spanish [[Osborne bull]]. The bull was perceived by Catalans as a [[centralism|centralistic]] symbol of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], alien to their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.barcelona-metropolitan.com/articles/all-ears|title=All ears: the Catalan donkey|author=Montgomery, David|date=July 1, 2007|accessdate=2011-11-12|journal=Metropolitan Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;
