The dengaku celebrated for rice planting was performed by villagers either at the [[new year]] or during the planting season in early summer.  It was only in the 14th century that these dances were brought to the cities and incorporated into Noh theater, notably by the playwright and actor [[Kanami]].   

The instrument of dengaku is the sasara (a wooden percussive instrument clapper), though there are other instruments that can be used.  In the [[Eiga Monogatari]] there is a detailed description of the rice-planting dengaku. After being brought to the aristocrats, dengaku flourished till the end of the [[Heian period]] and became the main performing art of the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] and part of the [[Muromachi period]].  By the end of the Muromachi though, dengaku was eclipsed by [[sarugaku]].  Today it barely survives as a folk performing art.         

Dengaku was closely linked with the native Japanise religion of [[Shinto]]. Ritualistic elements of this was incorporated with [[Sarugaku]] to form [[Noh]] theatre.
