'''Starbucks Corporation''' ({{nasdaq|SBUX}}) is an international coffee and [[List of coffeehouse chains|coffeehouse chain]] based in [[Seattle]], Washington. Starbucks is the largest [[coffeehouse]] company in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;hoovers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoovers.com/company/Starbucks_Corporation/rhkchi-1.html|title=Starbucks â Company Overview|work=Hoovers|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 17,009 stores in 55 countries, including over 11,000 in the United States, over 1,000 in Canada, over 700 in the United Kingdom, and over 150 in [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;10K2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loxcel.com/sbux|title=Starbucks Map|date=December 15, 2010|work=Starbucks Coffee Company|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starbucks sells [[drip brew|drip brewed coffee]], [[espresso]]-based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, coffee beans, salads, hot and cold sandwiches and panini, pastries, snacks, and items such as mugs and tumblers. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and [[Hear Music]] brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand [[ice cream]] and coffee are also offered at [[grocery stores]].

From Starbucks' founding in later forms in Seattle as a local [[coffee bean]] roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. The first store outside the United States or Canada opened in the mid-1990s, and overseas stores now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/Company_Profile.pdf|title=Company Profile|date=February 2008|work=Starbucks Coffee Company|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company planned to open a net of 900 new stores outside of the United States in 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;seekingalpha&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/88153-starbucks-f3q08-qtr-end-6-30-08-earnings-call-transcript|title=Starbucks F3Q08 (Qtr End 6/30/08) Earnings Call Transcript|date=July 31, 2008|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has announced 900 store closures in the United States since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire|title=Starbucks Will Close 300 More Stores|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/business/29sbux.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=June 6, 2011|date=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Original Starbucks.jpg|left|thumb|The Starbucks store at 1912 Pike Place. This is the second location of the original Starbucks, which was at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971 to 1976.]]
[[File:Baristas first starbucks.jpg|right|thumb|Baristas work inside the Seattle store at 1912 Pike Place.]]

===Founding===
The first Starbucks was opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 1971 by three partners: English teacher [[Jerry Baldwin]], history teacher [[Zev Siegl]], and writer [[Gordon Bowker]]. The three were inspired by entrepreneur [[Alfred Peet]] (whom they knew personally) to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment.&lt;ref name=Pren2523&gt;Prendergrast, pp. 252â53&lt;/ref&gt; The name is taken from ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; after ''Pequod'' was rejected by one of the co-founders, the company was named after the first mate on the ''Pequod'', Starbuck.

From 1971â1976, the first Starbucks was at 2000 Western Avenue; it then was relocated to 1912 Pike Place, where it remains to this day. During their first year of operation, they purchased green coffee beans from [[Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea|Peet's]], then began buying directly from growers.

[[File:Starbucks Headquarters Seattle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Starbucks Center]], [[Seattle]]. The company HQ, in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building]]

Entrepreneur [[Howard Schultz]] joined the company in 1982 as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing, and after a trip to [[Milan]], advised that the company should sell coffee and espresso drinks as well as beans. Seattle had become home to a thriving countercultural coffeehouse scene since the opening of the [[Last Exit on Brooklyn]] in 1967, the owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them, coffee was something to be prepared in the home, but they did give away free samples of pre-made drinks. Certain that there was money to be made selling pre-made drinks, Schultz started the ''Il Giornale'' coffee bar chain in April 1986.&lt;ref name=Pendergrast301&gt;Pendergrast, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale and expansion===
In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by [[Jerry Baldwin]], took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at [[Waterfront Station (Vancouver)|Waterfront Station]] in Vancouver, [[British Columbia]], and Chicago, [[Illinois]], that same year. At the time of its initial public offering on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.

===International expansion===
Currently Starbucks is present in more than 55 countries.

In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of [[Seattle's Best Coffee]] and [[Torrefazione Italia]] from [[AFC Enterprises]], bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival [[Diedrich Coffee]] announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based [[Coffee People]] chain. Starbucks converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/15/business/fi-diedrich15|title=Diedrich to Sell Cafes to Rival|last=Hirsch|first=Jerry|date=September 15, 2006|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007.

===Restaurant experiment===
In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia.&lt;ref name=&quot;circadia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/1999/10/18/newscolumn3.html|title=Starbucks still seeking a rhythm for Circadia|last=Tice|first=Carol|date=October 15, 1999|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These restaurants were soon &quot;outed&quot; as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.

===Corporate governance===
[[File:Howard-Schultz-Starbucks.jpg|thumb|upright|Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks]]
[[Orin C. Smith]] was President and CEO of Starbucks from 2001 to 2005.

Starbucks' chairman, [[Howard Schultz]], has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kiviat | first = Barbara | title = The Big Gulp at Starbucks | journal=TIME | date = December 10, 2006 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1568488,00.html | accessdate =January 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.

In January 2008, Chairman [[Howard Schultz]] resumed his roles as President and CEO after an eight year hiatus, replacing [[Jim Donald (CEO)|Jim Donald]], who took the posts in 2005 but was asked to step down after sales slowed in 2007. Schultz aims to restore what he calls the &quot;distinctive Starbucks experience&quot; in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including [[McDonald's]] and [[Dunkin' Donuts]]. Starbucks announced it will discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally intended to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on coffee, but the sandwiches were reformulated to deal with complaints and the product line stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard |first=Hannah |url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2008/07/starbucks-breakfast-sandwiches-no-smelly.html |title=Seriouseats.com |publisher=Seriouseats.com |date=July 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 23, 2008, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30â9:00&amp;nbsp;pm local time to train its baristas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.marketingdoctor.tv/2008/03/19/tantillo-on-the-news-emergency-starbucks-retrains.aspx &quot;Tantillo On The News: (Emergency) Starbucks Retrains&quot;] Marketing Doctor Blog.

===Recent changes===
In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks [[shareholders]]. Schultz introduced Starbucks' &quot;state of the art espresso system&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/pressdesc.asp?id=848 Starbucks Coffee Company to Acquire the Coffee Equipment Company and its Revolutionary Clover Brewin]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thermoplan AG]] manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801 (known internationally as the Thermoplan Black &amp; White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market.

In early 2008, Starbucks started a community website, My Starbucks Idea, designed to collect suggestions and feedback from customers. Other users comment and vote on suggestions. Journalist Jack Schofield noted that &quot;My Starbucks seems to be all sweetness and light at the moment, which I don't think is possible without quite a lot of censorship&quot;. The website is powered by the [[Salesforce]] software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/24/netbytes.starbucks?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=technology|title=Starbucks lets customers have their say|last=Schofield|first=Jack|date=March 24, 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=March 18, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, a [[loyalty program]] was introduced for registered users of the Starbucks Card (previously simply a gift card) offering perks such as free [[Wi-Fi]] Internet access, no charge for soy milk &amp; flavored syrups, and free refills on brewed drip coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/cardrewards/ |title=Card Rewards |publisher=Starbucks.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Wi-Fi Internet access varies in different regions. US &amp; Canadian card holders can access 2 hours of Internet access through [[AT&amp;T]] in the United States and through [[Bell Canada]] within Canada. In Germany customers can get 2 hour of free Wi-Fi through [[BT Openzone]], and in Switzerland and Austria customers can get 30 minutes with a voucher card (through [[T-Mobile]]).

===VIA &quot;Ready Brew&quot; instant coffee===

Starbucks introduced a brand new line of instant coffee packets called VIA &quot;Ready Brew&quot;, in March 2009. It was first unveiled in New York City with subsequent testing of the product also in Seattle, Chicago and London. The first two VIA flavors include Italian Roast and Colombia, which were then rolled out in October 2009, across the U.S. and Canada with Starbucks stores promoting the product with a [[blind study|blind]] &quot;taste challenge&quot; of the instant versus fresh roast. Many people could not tell the difference between the instant and fresh brewed coffee. Some analysts theorized that by introducing instant coffee, Starbucks will devalue its own brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125418430092348015.html/ The Wall Street Journal â Starbucks Takes New Road With Instant Coffee]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the VIA was successfully launched, they introduced the Decaf Italian Roast as well as a sweetened version called &quot;iced&quot;. In October 2010, Starbucks expanded the VIA selection by introducing four new presweetened flavored versions: Vanilla, Caramel, Cinnamon Spice and Mocha. With the holiday season in mind in 2010, Starbucks also introduced the Christmas Blend and Decaf Christmas blend. Also as a celebration of their 40th year anniversary Tribute Blend VIA was introduced in March 2011.

===Store closures===

In 2003 Starbucks closed all six of its locations in Israel, citing &quot;on-going operational challenges&quot; and a &quot;difficult business environment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.starbucks.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=200 |title=Facts about Starbucks in the Middle East |publisher=News.starbucks.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/israel/starbucks.asp |title=Starbucks closes outlets in Israel |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 underperforming company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Coffee Crisis?

Starbucks also announced in July 2008 that it would close 61 of its 84 stores in Australia by August 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allison |first=Melissa |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2008079196_websbuxaustralia29.html |title=The Seattle Times: Starbucks closing 73% of Australian stores |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Wailes, an expert in strategic management of the [[University of Sydney]], commented that &quot;Starbucks failed to truly understand Australiaâs cafe culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausfoodnews.com.au/2008/07/31/starbucks-what-went-wrong.html |title=Australian Food News &amp;#124; Starbucks: What went wrong? |publisher=Ausfoodnews.com.au |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 underperforming stores and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Starbucks to Close More Stores | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123317714771825681.html |work=Wall Street Journal | date=January 28, 2009 | accessdate=January 28, 2009 | first=Janet | last=Adamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether, from February 2008 to January 2009, Starbucks terminated an estimated 18,400 U.S. jobs and began closing 977 stores worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Melissa (March 3, 2009), [http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/coffee/2009/03/03/no_more_layoffs_at_starbucks_s.html &quot;No more layoffs at Starbucks, Schultz says&quot;], The Seattle Times Blog.

Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in [[Minden, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/q?db=tm&amp;asned=STARBUCKS%20U.S.%20BRANDS,%20LLC |title=USPTO.gov |publisher=Assignments.uspto.gov |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name===
The company is named in part after [[Starbuck (Moby-Dick)|Starbuck]], [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]]'s [[first mate]] in the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp (''Starbo'' or ''Storbo'') on [[Mount Rainier]]. According to [[Howard Schultz]]'s book ''Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time'', the name of the company was derived from ''Moby-Dick'', although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name &quot;Pequod&quot; (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, &quot;No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!&quot; Heckler suggested &quot;Starbo&quot;. [[Brainstorming]] with these two ideas resulted in the company being named after the ''Pequod'''s first mate, Starbuck.&lt;ref name=&quot;pouryourheart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Howard |coauthors=Dori Jones Yang |title=Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time |year=1997 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=0-7868-6315-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo===
In 2006, Valerie O'Neil, a Starbucks spokeswoman, said that the logo is an image of a &quot;twin-tailed [[siren]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pi-logo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Insider: Principal roasts Starbucks over steamy retro logo |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=September 11, 2006 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/284533_theinsider11.html |accessdate=May 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which was based on a 16th-century &quot;[[Norsemen|Norse]]&quot; [[woodcut]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pouryourheart&quot;/&gt; the Starbucks siren was [[toplessness|topless]] and had a fully visible double fish tail.&lt;ref&gt;name=Pren253&gt;Prendergrast, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; The image also had a rough visual texture and has been likened to a [[melusine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rippin|first=Ann|year=2007|title=Space, place and the colonies: re-reading the Starbucks' story|journal=Critical perspectives on international business|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|volume=3|issue=2|pages=136â149|issn=1742-2043|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/2900030202.html|doi=10.1108/17422040710744944}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second version, which was used from 1987â92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her [[navel]] was still visible.  The fish tail was cropped slightly, and the primary color was changed from brown to green, a nod to Bowker's [[Alma Mater]], the [[University of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004269831_bowker09.html Starbucks co-founder talks about early days, launching Redhook and Seattle Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; In the third version, used between 1992 and 2011, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original &quot;woodcut&quot; logo has been moved to the Starbucks' Headquarters in Seattle.

At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot-drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/business/18969709.html |title=Group finds Starbucks logo too hot to handle |publisher=Startribune.com |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media.

===Parodies and infringements===
Starbucks has been a target of parodies and imitations of its logo, and has used legal action against those it perceives to be infringing on its intellectual property. In 2000, San Francisco [[cartoonist]] [[Kieron Dwyer]] was sued by Starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics; later placing it on coffee mugs, t-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. Dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to [[free speech]] under U.S. law. The case was eventually settled [[Settlement (litigation)|out of court]], as Dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with Starbucks. The judge agreed that Dwyer's work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially &quot;profiting&quot; from using a &quot;confusingly similar&quot; image of the Starbucks siren logo. Dwyer is currently allowed to display the image as an expression of free speech, but he can no longer sell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbldf.org/pr/001130-starbucks.shtml |title=Cartoonist Kieron Dwyer Sued By Starbucks |date=November 30, 2000 |accessdate=May 23, 2007 |publisher=Comic Book Legal Defense Fund }}{{dead link|url=http://www.cbldf.org/pr/001130-starbucks.shtml|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar case, a New York store selling stickers and T-shirts using the Starbucks logo with the words &quot;fâk off&quot; was sued by the company in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-village-starbucks-was-not-amused.html|title=Starbucks Was Not Amused|last=Moynihan|first=Colin|date=July 11, 1999|work=New York Times|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Starbucks v.

Other successful cases filed by Starbucks include the case won in 2006 against the chain Xingbake in Shanghai, China for [[trademark infringement]], because the chain used a green-and-white logo with a name that sounded phonetically similar to the Chinese for Starbucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4574000/4574400.stm|title=Starbucks wins Chinese logo case|date=February 1, 2006|work=BBC News |accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starbucks did not open any stores after first registering its trademark in Russia in 1997 and in 2002 a Russian lawyer successfully filed a request to cancel the trademark. He then registered the name with a Moscow company and asked for $600,000 to sell the trademark to Starbucks, but was ruled against in November 2005.&lt;ref name=Russia/&gt; Sam Buck, who owns a coffee store in Oregon, was prohibited from using her name on the shop front in 2006.&lt;ref name=struck/&gt;

In 2003, Starbucks sent a cease-and-desist letter to &quot;HaidaBucks Coffee House&quot; in [[Masset, British Columbia]], Canada. The store was owned by a group of young [[Haida people|Haida]] men, commonly referred to as &quot;bucks.&quot; After facing criticism, Starbucks dropped its demand after HaidaBucks dropped &quot;coffee house&quot; from its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malone |first=Michael| url=http://www.williams.edu/go/native/names.htm |title=Fightin' Words | work=Restaurant Business |date= March 5, 2005 |accessdate=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cases have gone against the company. In 2005 Starbucks lost a trademark infringement case against a smaller coffee vendor in South Korea that operates coffee stations under the name Starpreya. The company, Elpreya, says Starpreya is named after the [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Norse goddess]], [[Freyja|Freja]], with the letters of that name changed to ease pronunciation by Koreans. The court rejected Starbucks' claim that the logo of Starpreya is too similar to their own logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/11/bloomberg/bxstarbucks.php |title=Starbucks loses lawsuit on trademark in Korea}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bar owner in Galveston, Texas, USA won the right to sell &quot;Star Bock Beer&quot; after a lawsuit by Starbucks in 2003 after he registered the name, but the 2005 federal court ruling also stated that the sale of the beer must be restricted to Galveston, a ruling upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wichita.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2007/04/23/story7.html|title=Star Bock Beer case runs dry as high court denies petition|last=Barr|first=Greg|date=April 20, 2007|work=Houston Business Journal|accessdate=April 18, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate social responsibility==
In 2009, Starbucks released an annual [[Corporate social responsibility]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/csr.asp|title=Starbucks Corporate Social Responsibility|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
[[File:Starbucks Grounds for your Garden.jpg|thumb|upright|Grounds for your Garden]]
In 1999, Starbucks started &quot;Grounds for your Garden&quot; to make their business more [[environmentally-friendly]]. This gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and lobby their local store to begin the practice.

In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 816.5 metric tons (1.8&amp;nbsp;million pounds).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/osw/conserve/2004news/04-star.htm EPA.gov]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Wastes May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Starbucks was ranked No.15 on the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National 25 Green Power Partners |url=http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/toplists/top25.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' newspaper reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4&amp;nbsp;million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a '[[dipper well]]' in each of its stores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1771553.ece|title=The great drain robbery|last=Lorraine|first=Veronica|coauthors=Flynn, Brian|date=October 6, 2008|work=The Sun |location=UK |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is often required by governmental [[Food safety|public health code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/newsdata/restaurant-inspections/locality/hampton/restaurant/popeyes-chicken-omni-1/240461 |title=An example of government requirement to operate a dipper well |publisher=Hamptonroads.com |date=February 24, 2009 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, in response to concerns over its excessive water consumption, Starbucks re-evaluated its use of the dipper well system. In September 2009, company-operated Starbucks stores in Canada &amp; the United States successfully implemented a new water saving solution that meets government health standards. Different types of milk are given a dedicated spoon that remains in the pitcher and the dipper wells were replaced with push button metered faucets for rinsing. This will reportedly save up to 150 gallons of water per day in every store.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

====Recycling====
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in [[food packaging]] for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.starbucks.com/csrnewsletter/winter06/csrEnvironment.asp Starbucks.com]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} Starbucks Social Responsibility Environment May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Starbucks bought 2.5&amp;nbsp;billion cups for stores in North America in 2007. The 10% recycled paper cups used by Starbucks are not recyclable, because the plastic coating that prevents the cup from leaking also prevents it from being recycled. The plastic cups used for cold drinks are also non-recyclable in most regions. Starbucks cups were originally made using plastic No.1 (polyethylene terephthalate, PETE) but were changed to plastic No.5 (polypropylene, PP). The former type of plastic can be recycled in most regions of the U.S. whereas the latter cannot. Starbucks is considering using biodegradable material instead of plastic to line the cups, and is testing composting of the existing cups. The exception to this is stores in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where paper cups are recycled to a local company called &quot;Wriggler's Wranch&quot;, where they are composted. The majority of Starbucks stores do not have recycling bins; only 1/3 of company-owned stores recycled any materials in 2007,&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt; however improvements have since been made and recycling bins are popping up in more stores (the only thing hindering Starbucks' ability to have bins in every store is the lack of facilities for storage and collection of recycling in certain areas.){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
[[Allen Hershkowitz]] of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10% recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more.&lt;ref&gt;www.organicconsumers.org Organic Consumers Association May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Starbucks gives customers a 10-cent discount when they bring their own reusable cup, and it now uses corrugated cup sleeves made from 60 percent post-consumer recycled fiber.&lt;ref name=seattletimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004412179_starbucks14.html|title=Starbucks struggles with reducing environmental impacts|last=Allison|first=Melissa|date=May 14, 2008|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair trade===
[[File:Starbucks coffee beans.jpg|thumb|Starbucks coffee beans]]
In 2000, the company introduced a line of [[fair trade]] products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060414062317/http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0048/news-fefer2.php Seattleweekly.com].

Groups such as [[Global Exchange]] are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64&amp;nbsp;kg) for high-quality coffee beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/bizofcoffee.asp |title=Premium Prices and Transparency}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50â$0.60 in 2003â04. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

After a long-running dispute between Starbucks and Ethiopia, Starbucks agreed to support and promote Ethiopian coffees.
An article in BBC NEWS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6225514.stm |title=Starbucks in Ethiopia coffee vow |work=BBC News  | date=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that Ethiopian ownership of popular coffee designations such as Harrar and Sidamo is acknowledged even if they are not registered. The main reason Ethiopia fought so hard for this acknowledgement was to allow its poverty-stricken farmers a chance to make more money. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. In 2006 Starbucks says it paid $1.42 per pound for its coffee. At,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Starbucks.com |title=Official Starbucks Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the coffee Starbucks bought for $1.42 per pound had a selling price, after transportation, processing, marketing, store rentals, taxes and staff salary and benefits of $10.99 per pound. As of August 2010, Starbucks sells only one Ethiopian coffee on its website and it is proclaimed by the website to be new.

===Ethos water===
[[File:Starbucks Ethos water.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A display of Ethos water]]
[[Ethos water|Ethos]], a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating &quot;helping children get clean water&quot;, referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2007-03-22/news_story4.php NOW Magazine]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} Maybe they're not trying to sell anything on World Water Day, but every other day of they year they are selling water.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shareholder.com/visitors/dynamicdoc/document.cfm?CompanyID=SBUX&amp;DocumentID=1382 |title=Starbucks Corporation 2006 Annual Report |publisher=Shareholder.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, R.

===Community===
Starbucks has developed various community service projects based around local Starbucks branches. In April 2011 Starbucks became involved in Global Month of Service.  Starbucks formed over 1400 community service projects, using 60,000 volunteers from 30 countries on 4 continents. 156,000 hours of community service were counted after 30 days. The efforts provided approx 3.3 million USD of fiscal value in communities by service. Starbucks provides more local opportunities to become involved in service through their website and community cafes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starbucks.com/blog/60000-volunteers-30-countries-30-days/1047&lt;/ref&gt;

===Youth Action===
The Starbucks Foundation was formed in 1977 focusing on developing youth literacy programs. Since then the Foundation has moved into providing grants to youth programs and community development.  Starbucks Shared Planet Youth Action Grants focuses on funding community service projects developed by youth and focused on youth action. The Starbucks Foundation reviews community service project admissions on an annual basis. These programs are then chosen to receive grants based on quality and relevance as required by the Starbucks Foundation Grant Guidelines. Starbucks has partnered with many grant organizations providing funds for youth action.
The goals of the youth action forum were stated, to engage 50,000 young people and contribute 1 million hours of community service per year by the year 2015. In 2010 the Starbucks Global Responsibility Report documented a 2.8% growth rate of community service hours delivered, reaching 191,224 hours of community service in 2010. In 2010 Starbucks reached their youth action goal involving a total of 53,736 youth in 2010.

Starbucks has begun focusing on Green Building for all cafes and outlets. In 2010 Starbucks finished their part in the pilot phase of the U.S. Green Building Councilâs LEED Volume Certification pilot program. Ten stores were approved by the USGBC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
The focus of Starbucks infrastructure is energy savings, water conservation, installations of post-industrial material when possible, improving lighting efficiency, using recycled flooring tiles, using wood products that are Forest Stewardship Council certified when they are available, and using paints with lower amounts of volatile organic chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starbucks.com/responsibility/environment/green-building&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
[[File:Two Starbucks stores.jpg|thumb|right|Two Starbucks stores in one shopping center in Queens, New York]]

===Market strategy===
Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position, including buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., [[Market saturation|saturating the market]]), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, N. (2001). ''No Logo'' New York: Flamingo, pp. 135â140&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3086727.stm |title=Store Wars: Cappuccino Kings |date=June 9, 2004 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, Starbucks greatly increased its &quot;licensed store&quot; system, which permits Starbucks licenses only if they contribute to less than 20% of the licensee's gross income, are inside other stores or in limited or restricted access spaces, as to not [[Brand dilution|dilute the brand]] image. License agreements are rare in volume and usually only made with Fortune 1000 or similar sized chain stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbuckseverywhere.net/LicensedStoresList.htm |title=the vast majority of this list is chain stores |publisher=Starbuckseverywhere.net |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensed store system can create the illusion of 2 or more Starbucks cafes in the same [[shopping plaza]], when one is a standalone company owned, and the others are licensed. The menus of licensed stores can be the same or trimmed or modified versions of the cafes, or be positioned as independent cafes that happen to sell Starbucks products (ex. [[Barnes &amp; Noble#CafÃ©s|Barnes &amp; Noble]]).

===Labor disputes===

In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the [[IUOE|International Union of Operating Engineers]]. Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allison&quot;/&gt;

===Opening without planning permission===
Starbucks has been accused by local authorities of opening several stores in the United Kingdom in retail premises, without the [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|planning permission]] for a change of use to a restaurant. Starbucks has argued that &quot;Under current planning law, there is no official classification of coffee shops. Starbucks therefore encounters the difficult scenario whereby local authorities interpret the guidance in different ways. In some instances, coffee shops operate under A1 permission, some as mixed use A1/A3 and some as A3&quot;.&lt;ref name=pinner/&gt;

In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed on St. James's Street in [[Kemptown]], [[Brighton]], England, despite having been refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council, who claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St James's Street residents' victory over Starbucks |url=http://www.brightonandhovegreenparty.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/press_releases/ALL/533//}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Starbucks protesters condemn store &quot;arrogance&quot; |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/display.var.2295866.0.antistarbucks_protesters_condemn_store_arrogance.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starbucks appealed the decision by claiming it was a retail store selling bags of coffee, mugs and sandwiches, gaining a six month extension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/generalnews/display.var.2365800.0.st_jamess_street_starbucks_not_a_coffee_shop.php|title=St James's Street Starbucks â 'not a coffee shop'|last=Lumley|first=Ruth|date=June 26, 2008|work=Brighton Argus|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the council ordered Starbucks to remove all tables and chairs from the premises, to comply with planning regulations for a retail shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7766582.stm|title=Shop told to stop cafe operation|date=December 5, 2008|work=BBC News |accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2500 residents signed a petition against the store,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/sections.php?section_link=in_the_back&amp;issue=1233|title=Starbucks are the dregs..|date=April 3, 2009|work=Private Eye|accessdate=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after a public inquiry in June 2009 a government inspector gave permission for the store to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8128534.stm|title=Coffee shop wins planning consent|date=July 1, 2009|work=BBC Sussex|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To this date, 8 years after the court case, the Starbucks is still operating as a takeaway outlet.

===Alleged relationship with the Israeli military===

There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the [[Israeli military]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/pressdesc.asp?id=976&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This charge is leveled due to the fact that the President, Chairman and CEO of Starbucks [[Howard Schultz]] is Jewish.

{{Main|Hear Music}}
[[File:Hearmusic riverwalk.jpg|thumb|Starbucks' second Hear Music Coffeehouse at the South Bank development adjacent to the [[San Antonio River Walk|River Walk]] in downtown [[San Antonio, Texas]].]]

Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990, adding a few retail locations in the San Francisco Bay Area. Hear Music was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as [[Luciano Pavarotti]], followed in March 2007 by the hit CD &quot;Memory Almost Full&quot; by [[Paul McCartney]], making McCartney the first artist signed to New Hear Music Label sold in Starbucks outlets. Its inaugural release was a big non-coffee event for Starbucks the first quarter of 2007.

In 2006, the company created Starbucks Entertainment, one of the producers of the 2006 film ''[[Akeelah and the Bee]]''. Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release and sold the DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6340569.html |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5j7VkJQ72 |title = Starbucks rocks with Berry DVD |author=Ault, Susanne |accessdate =August 18, 2009 |archivedate = August 18, 2009 |date = June 2, 2006 |publisher=[[Video Business]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership with Apple===
Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to collaborate on selling music as part of the &quot;coffeehouse experience&quot;. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the [[iTunes Store]], selling music similar to that played in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that customers would be able to browse the iTunes Store at Starbucks via Wi-Fi in the US (with no requirement to login to the Wi-Fi network), targeted at [[iPhone]], [[iPod touch]], and [[MacBook]] users. The iTunes Store will automatically detect recent songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users the opportunity to download the tracks. Some stores feature LCD screens with the artist name, song, and album information of the current song playing. This feature has been rolled out in [[Seattle]], New York City, and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and was offered in limited markets during 2007â2008.&lt;ref name=informationweek&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201804347 Apple Builds Ecosystem With iPod Touch Screen]. (2007-09-05) Retrieved September 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the &quot;Song of the Day&quot; promotion in 2007, and a &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; card is now available at Starbucks for a free song download. Since 2011 Starbucks also gives away a &quot;Pick of the Week&quot; card for app downloads from the App Store. A Starbucks app is available in the iPhone [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].

===Partnership with MSNBC===
Starting on June 1, 2009, the [[MSNBC]] morning news program ''[[Morning Joe]]'' has been presented as &quot;brewed by Starbucks&quot; and the show's logo changed to include the company logo. Although the hosts have previously consumed Starbucks coffee on air &quot;for free&quot; in the words of MSNBC president [[Phil Griffin]], it was not paid placement at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/media/01joe.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss NYtimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The move was met with mixed reactions from rival news organizations, viewed as both a clever partnership in an economic downturn and a compromise of journalistic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/277914-_Morning_Joe_Starbucks_Sponsorship_Gets_Mixed_Reactions.php |title=Broadcastingcable.com |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
