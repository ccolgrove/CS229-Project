'''Wireshark''' is a [[Free and open source software|free and open-source]] [[packet analyzer]]. It is used for [[computer network|network]] troubleshooting, analysis, software and [[communications protocol]] development, and education. Originally named '''Ethereal''', in May 2006 the project was renamed Wireshark due to trademark issues.

Wireshark is [[cross-platform]], using the [[GTK+]] [[widget toolkit]] to implement its user interface, and using [[pcap]] to capture packets; it runs on various [[Unix-like]] operating systems including [[Linux]], [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X]], [[BSD]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and on [[Microsoft Windows]]. There is also a terminal-based (non-GUI) version called TShark.  Wireshark, and the other programs distributed with it such as TShark, are [[free software]], released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]].

== Functionality ==

Wireshark is very similar to [[tcpdump]], but has a [[Graphical user interface|graphical]] [[front-end and back-end|front-end]], plus some integrated sorting and filtering options.

Wireshark allows the user to put the network interfaces that support [[promiscuous mode]] into that mode, in order to see all traffic visible on that interface, not just traffic addressed to one of the interface's configured addresses and broadcast/multicast traffic.  However, when capturing with a packet analyzer in promiscuous mode on a port on a [[network switch]], not all of the traffic traveling through the switch will necessarily be sent to the port on which the capture is being done, so capturing in promiscuous mode will not necessarily be sufficient to see all traffic on the network.  [[Port mirroring]] or various [[network tap]]s extend capture to any point on net; simple passive taps are extremely resistant to [[malware]] [[Tamper resistance|tampering]].

On Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X, with [[pcap|libpcap]] 1.0.0 or later, Wireshark 1.4 and later can also put [[Wi-Fi]] adapters into [[monitor mode]].

== History ==

In the late 1990s, Gerald Combs, a computer science graduate of the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], was working for a small {{abbr|ISP|Internet Service Provider}}. The commercial protocol analysis products at the time were priced around $1500&lt;ref&gt;InfoWorld Nov 17, 1997 [http://books.google.com/books?id=PzwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA101-IA9&amp;dq=netXray&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7sCYTs2ALaTy0gGt3fmbBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=netXray&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and did not run on the company's primary platforms (Solaris and Linux), so Gerald began writing Ethereal and released the first version around 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protocoltesting.com/gerald_combs_interview.html |title= Q&amp;A with the founder of Wireshark and Ethereal| work = Interview with Gerald Combs|publisher=protocolTesting.com |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethereal [[trademark]] is owned by Network Integration Services. 

In May 2006, Combs accepted a job with CACE Technologies.  Combs still held copyright on most of Ethereal's source code (and the rest was re-distributable under the GNU GPL), so he used the contents of the Ethereal [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] repository as the basis for the Wireshark repository.  However, he did not own the Ethereal trademark, so he changed the name to Wireshark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wireshark.org/faq.html#q1.2 |title=What's up with the name change? Is Wireshark a fork? |work=Wireshark: Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Riverbed Technology]] purchased CACE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverbed.com/us/company/news/press_releases/2010/press_102110.php |title=Riverbed Expands Further Into The Application-Aware Network Performance Management Market with the Acquisition of CACE Technologies |publisher=Riverbed Technology |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took over as the primary sponsor of Wireshark. Ethereal development has ceased, and an Ethereal security advisory recommended switching to Wireshark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00024.html |title=enpa-sa-00024 |publisher=Ethereal |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combs continues to maintain the overall code of Wireshark and issue releases of new versions of the software. The product website lists over 500 additional contributing authors.

== Features ==

Wireshark is software that &quot;understands&quot; the structure of different networking protocols. Thus, it is able to display the encapsulation and the fields along with their meanings of different packets specified by different networking protocols. Wireshark uses [[pcap]] to capture packets, so it can only capture the packets on the types of networks that pcap supports.

* Data can be captured &quot;from the wire&quot; from a live network connection or read from a file that recorded already-captured packets.
* Live data can be read from a number of types of network, including [[Ethernet]], [[IEEE 802.11]], [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]], and [[loopback]].
* Captured network data can be browsed via a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], or via the terminal ([[Command line interface|command line]]) version of the utility, TShark.
* Captured files can be programmatically edited or converted via command-line switches to the &quot;editcap&quot; program.
* Data display can be refined using a display filter.
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plug-ins]] can be created for dissecting new protocols.
* [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] calls in the captured traffic can be detected. If encoded in a compatible encoding, the media flow can even be played.
* Raw [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] traffic can be captured with Wireshark.&lt;ref&gt;^http://www.wireshark.org&lt;/ref&gt;This feature is currently available only under Linux.

Wireshark's native network trace file format is the libpcap format supported by [[pcap|libpcap and WinPcap]], so it can exchange files of captured network traces with other applications using the same format, including [[tcpdump]] and [[CA, Inc.|CA]] [[NetMaster]].  It can also read captures from other network analyzers, such as [[snoop (software)|snoop]], [[NetScout Systems, Inc.|Network General]]'s Sniffer, and [[Microsoft Network Monitor]].

== Security ==

Capturing raw network traffic from an interface requires elevated privileges on some platforms.  For this reason, older versions of Ethereal/Wireshark and tethereal/TShark often ran with [[superuser]] privileges.  Taking into account the huge number of protocol dissectors that are called when traffic is captured, this can pose a serious security risk given the possibility of a bug in a dissector. Due to the rather large number of vulnerabilities in the past (of which many have allowed remote code execution) and developers' doubts for better future development, [[OpenBSD]] removed Ethereal from its ports tree prior to OpenBSD 3.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/net/ethereal/Attic/Makefile?hideattic=0&amp;only_with_tag=HEAD |title=CVS log for ports/net/ethereal/Attic/Makefile |publisher=Openbsd.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elevated privileges are not needed for all of the operations.  For example, an alternative is to run [[tcpdump]], or the [http://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/dumpcap.html dumpcap] utility that comes with Wireshark, with superuser privileges to capture packets into a file, and later analyze the packets by running Wireshark with restricted privileges. To make near real time analysis, each captured file may be merged by [[mergecap]] into growing file processed by Wireshark. On wireless networks, it is possible to use the [[Aircrack]] wireless security tools to capture [[IEEE 802.11]] frames and read the resulting dump files with Wireshark.

As of Wireshark 0.99.7, Wireshark and TShark run dumpcap to do traffic capture.  On platforms where special privileges are needed to capture traffic, only dumpcap needs to be set up to run with those special privileges: neither Wireshark nor TShark need to run with special privileges, and neither of them should be run with special privileges.
