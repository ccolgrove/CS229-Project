{{about|the Australian television station}}
'''QQQ''' (also known as '''Southern Cross Central''') is an [[Australia]]n [[television station]] broadcasting in remote eastern, southern and central areas of Australia, owned by [[Macquarie Media Group]] (following their purchase of [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] in 2007). The station is available via satellite and terrestrial platforms â mostly through community retransmission sites, although it also transmits into the town of [[Mount Isa, Queensland]] under the [[call sign]] '''ITQ'''. The station is primarily affiliated with the [[Seven Network]], while carrying a limited amount of sport programming from [[Network Ten]].

== History ==
In December 1998 the ITQ and QQQ signals â then known as ''Queensland Satellite Television'', or QSTV, and owned by [[Telecasters Australia]] Limited (previously Telecasters North Queensland) â were officially aggregated with that of [[Imparja Television]] into a ''Remote Eastern and Central Australia'' licence area. Previously, QSTV serviced remote [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]], while Imparja serviced the [[Northern Territory]] (excluding [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]), and remote [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], plus far-western New South Wales. As part of the aggregation, the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]] further extended the combined licence area to cover more remote areas of New South Wales, Victoria and [[Tasmania]], who were not fully served by regularly licensed terrestrial television services.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Broadcasting Authority (23 December 1998). [http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_90786  Additional television services in remote regions of Australia]. Retrieved on 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 01-02-1999, QSTV changed its affiliation from predominantly [[Network Ten]], in line with Telecasters' stations in regional Queensland ([[TNQ]], now [[Southern Cross Ten]]), to the Seven Network, becoming ''Seven Central''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/0604.html Alice Springs News, 24 February 1999]. Retrieved on 2 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This closely followed the introduction of a Seven Network-affiliated service, [[TND|''Seven Darwin'' (TND)]], to Darwin in 1998.

Telecasters Australia was purchased by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] (SCB) in July 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://southerncrossbroadcasting.com.au/files/2001%20Annual%20Report.pdf Southern Cross Broadcasting 2001 Annual Report]. Retrieved on 2 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and its official name was eventually changed to ''Southern Cross Central''. However, unlike other Southern Cross-owned stations â including TND, which is now a dual Seven/Ten affiliate under the [[Southern Cross Television]] brand â QQQ/ITQ simply carries the Seven Network branding unchanged, leading some people to continue to refer it as &quot;Seven Central&quot;. The station carries a simple &quot;SCTV&quot; text watermark in lieu of independent branding, denoting the origin of the signal. (Previously, the watermark has read &quot;TAL&quot; and &quot;SCB&quot;, denoting the previous owners. &quot;MSCM&quot; was used briefly after the Macquarie acquisition.)

On 19 May 2010, the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) approved a license for a third digital-only TV channel. This channel is a joint venture by Imparja and Southern Cross Central and is expected to be launched in 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_312142].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Southern Cross News Update ==
Short ''Southern Cross News Update'' bulletins are aired from Monday-Friday, featuring local news headlines from the central regions of Australia. The updates consist of the anchor reading the day's relevant news, with no video footage. The weather for most central towns is also displayed during the update. The 60-second updates are currently presented by [[Caitlin Street]].

== Availability ==
Southern Cross Central is delivered through the [[Viewer Access Satellite Television|VAST]] and [[Optus Aurora]] satellite platforms to areas in remote central and eastern Australia, though in some locations it is also broadcast terrestrially.

Southern Cross Central is also available in [[Port Moresby]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] though the [[HiTRON subscription television service]] (shown on channel list as ''7 Central'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitron.com.pg/mmds_2006.html HiTRON Limited - Papua New Guinea :: MMDS TV - top programming - more channels - better reliability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
