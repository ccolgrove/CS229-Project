The '''Commonwealth System of Higher Education''' is the organizing body of [[Pennsylvania]]'s &quot;'''state-related'''&quot; schools, which allows the independent control of the universities while supplying them with the public funds needed for operations at each institution. Universities in the System are considered public universities, but are under independent control rather than that of the state. Because of their independent status, universities in the Commonwealth System tend to have higher tuition costs compared to the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]].  They are exempt from Pennsylvania's Open Records law except for a few minor provisions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08048/858150-298.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Pitt, Penn State escape parts of open records law | first=Bill | last=Schackner | date=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Before the creation of the &quot;state-related&quot; legal status in the early 1970s, Lincoln University, Temple University and University of Pittsburgh were private.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Previously, the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) was repeatedly defined as a &quot;state-owned university&quot; in numerous official acts and Pennsylvania Attorney General opinions from its resurrection as a &quot;land grant&quot; institution, the Pennsylvania State College in 1855, as applicable to having its road system and buildings on state campuses constructed using state funding, paying its employees through state-issued checks and having them eligible to collect state employee retirement system benefits. In 1989, Penn State asserted a public status in court for the purpose of not having a private bank branch's operations on its University Park campus subject to local county taxes, while simultaneously asserting private status for the purpose of not having to reveal the salaries of its top administrative employees.&lt;ref&gt;Roy v. Pennsylvania State University, 568 A.2d 751, 130 Pa.Commw. 468 (1990); Pennsylvania State University v. County of Centre, 615 A.2d 303, 532 Pa. 142 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the enabling legislation changing the failing Williamsport (PA) Area Community College to the affiliated &quot;Pennsylvania College of Technology&quot; in 1989, Penn State was again designated as a &quot;state-related&quot; institution.
