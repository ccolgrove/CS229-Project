'''TheÃ³doros &quot;TeÃ³&quot; PapaloukÃ¡s''' (Greek: ÎÎµÏÎ´ÏÏÎ¿Ï &quot;Î¤ÎµÏ&quot; Î Î±ÏÎ±Î»Î¿ÏÎºÎ¬Ï; born May 8, 1977) is a Greek professional [[basketball player]]. He currently plays as a [[point guard]] for the [[Israeli Basketball Super League|Israeli League]], [[Adriatic League]] and [[Euroleague]] club [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]]. 

Papaloukas started his career in 1995 for his local club of Ampelokipi, before being transferred two years later to [[Dafni BC|AO Dafni]] and, in 2001, to [[Panionios BC|Panionios]]. His performances with the latter earned him a transfer to [[Euroleague]] traditional powerhouse [[Olympiacos BC|Olympiacos]], where he won his first title, the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]], in 2002. His journey for the reds turned out to be a short stint, as he moved to Moscow and the club that he would help regain its past glory, [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]], thus becoming a perennial [[All-Euroleague Team|All-Euroleague]] selection and competition icon.&lt;ref name=&quot;euroleague1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euroleague.net/competition/all-decade/main-page/i/64902/4259/euroleague-all-decade-selection-theodoros-papaloukas?lang=en&amp;itemid=-1 |title=All-Decade Selection article |publisher=Euroleague.net |date=January 11, 2010 |author= |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After making a minimal impact during the first two seasons in the Russian capital, he evolved into a major contributor of CSKA's success coming off the bench both in the [[Euroleague]] and the [[Russian Basketball Super League|Russian league]] in the [[Euroleague 2004-05|2004â05 season]]. By his fourth season with CSKA in [[Euroleague 2005-06|2006]], he earned his first [[All-Euroleague Team|All-Euroleague]] selection and led his team to their first Euroleague title in 35 years, being voted the [[Euroleague Final Four MVP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;euroleague1&quot;/&gt; The following year he was named the [[Euroleague Season MVP]] before falling short of a second Euroleague title in a row, losing in the [[Euroleague 2006-07|championship's final]]. In [[Euroleague 2007-08|2008]], he won his second Euroleague title with CSKA in what would be his last year in Moscow. In the summer of 2008 Papaloukas returned to Olympiacos and reached another two [[Euroleague Final Four]]s, thereby holding a record of eight consecutive, alongside his former teammate [[Jr Holden|JR Holden]].

Papaloukas led the [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national team]] to a [[EuroBasket]] title in [[EuroBasket 2005|2005]] as well as a [[FIBA World Championship]] silver medal in [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]] coming off the bench, being elected to the All-Tournament Team in both competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/p/rpp//q/papaloukas/pid//_//players.html FIBA.com profile]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he was named the [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year|FIBA Europe]] [[European Basketball Player of the Year Awards|European Player of the Year]],  and one of the [[50 Greatest Euroleague Contributors|50 greatest Euroleague contributors]] in 2008. A revolutionary figure in basketball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euroleague.net/competition/all-decade/main-page/i/64902/4259/euroleague-all-decade-selection-theodoros-papaloukas?lang=en&amp;itemid=-1 |title=All-Decade selection article |publisher=Euroleague.net |date=January 11, 2010 |author= |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papaloukas symbolizes the rise of European basketball in the new millennium.

==Pro career==
===Greece===
A native of [[Athens]], Greece, Papaloukas began his career at the small local Athens junior team Ethnikos Ellinoroson. He then played for another small, but at the time rising club called [[Ampelokipoi, Athens|Ampelokipoi]], with whom he began his pro career with in 1995. He then transferred to [[Dafni BC|Dafni]] of the [[A2 Ethniki|Greek A2 League]] in 1997, and transferred again two years later to [[Panionios Forthnet|Panionios]], a traditional basketball club of the [[A1 Ethniki|Greek A1 League]]. In 2001, Papaloukas finally moved to [[Olympiacos BC|Olympiacos]], a long-time Greek League power as well as one of the perennial contenders in the [[Euroleague]]. 

With [[Dafni BC|Dafni]], Papaloukas won the [[A2 Ethniki|Greek A2 League]] title and the Player of the Year award in the 1998â99 season. With [[Olympiacos BC|Olympiacos]], he led the [[A1 Ethniki|Greek A1 League]] in assists in the 2000â01 season. After the 2001â02 season, he left [[Olympiacos BC|Olympiacos]] and moved to another [[Euroleague]] powerhouse, the [[Russian Basketball Super League|Russian Superleague]] club [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] in 2002.

On June 20, 2008, Papaloukas was released from his contract by [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] and he signed a 3 year contract  with [[Olympiacos BC|Olympiacos]], making a return to Greece and his former team. Papaloukas signed through the 2010â11 season, with an annual salary of [[Euro|â¬]]3.5 million euros [[net income]]. He also has a [[Nike sponsorships#Basketball|Nike shoe contract]].

===CSKA Moscow===
With 19 points in the [[Euroleague 2005-06]] semifinal against [[FC Barcelona BÃ squet|FC Barcelona]], and another 18 points at the final against back-to-back [[Euroleague|European]] Champion [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]], Papaloukas was awarded the [[Euroleague 2005-06]] [[Euroleague Final Four MVP|Final Four MVP]], having also been named the best point guard of the Euroleague for the 2005â06 season. Alongside him on the first team were the best shooting guard [[Juan Carlos Navarro (basketball)|Juan Carlos Navarro]] of [[FC Barcelona Basquet|BarÃ§a]], best small forward [[Anthony Parker]] of Maccabi (the [[Euroleague 2005-06]] [[MVP]]), best power forward [[Luis Scola]] of [[Saski Baskonia|TAU CerÃ¡mica]], and best center [[Nikola VujÄiÄ]] of Maccabi.

In 2007, Papaloukas was voted the [[Euroleague MVP]] of [[Euroleague 2006-07]] for the regular season. [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]] advanced to the final against [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]], held on the Greens' home court, the [[Olympic Indoor Hall|Athens Olympic Indoor Hall]] (which had been chosen as the site more than a year in advance). Panathinaikos won the game by a score of 93â91 in a very exciting game. Papaloukas scored 23 points and dished out 8 assists, but a number of sportswriters intimated that he did not receive adequate support from his CSKA teammates and thus his team lost the final. Papaloukas was also a key member of CSKA's [[Euroleague 2007-08]] championship team. 

Papaloukas has been pursued by the [[Boston Celtics]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and the [[Miami Heat]] to fill their point guard spot. On July 7, 2007, Greek newspapers reported that Papaloukas agreed to a newly-structured 3-year contract with CSKA, worth [[Euro|â¬]]10.5 million euros [[net income]]. He had the option to leave his contract with no buyout at any time, and he did so just one year later, when he signed with [[Olympiacos BC|Olympiacos]]. 

On August 13, 2011, Papaloukas signed a contract with [[Euroleague]] finalists of 2011, [[Maccabi Tel Aviv BC|Maccabi Tel Aviv]].

Papaloukas was a core element of the senior men's [[Greece national basketball team|Greek National Basketball Team]]. He played at the [[EuroBasket|FIBA European Championships]] of [[EuroBasket 2001]] in [[Turkey]], [[EuroBasket 2003]] in Sweden, [[EuroBasket 2005]] in [[Serbia and Montenegro]], and [[EuroBasket 2007]] in Spain.

Papaloukas, who was already well-established in European basketball as a result of appearances in three consecutive [[Euroleague Final Four]]s with CSKA Moscow, achieved an acclaimed position among the elite of European basketball at the [[EuroBasket 2005]] in Serbia and Montenegro. After a series of mediocre performances in the first round, he led Greece to a victory over the [[Russia national basketball team|Russian National Basketball Team]] in the quarterfinals and orchestrated a major comeback against the [[France national basketball team|French National Basketball Team]] in the semifinal, when Greece was down 7 points with 47 seconds left on the clock.

In the final against the [[Germany national basketball team|German National Basketball Team]], led by the prodigious [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star]] [[Dirk Nowitzki]], Papaloukas scored 22 points, leading Greece comfortably to its second European title, eighteen years after its first win at the [[Eurobasket 1987]]. As such, Papaloukas was selected to the All-Tournament Team of the [[EuroBasket 2005]], along with fellow Greek team player [[Dimitris Diamantidis]], [[Spain national basketball team|Spanish National Basketball Team]] shooting guard [[Juan Carlos Navarro (basketball)|Juan Carlos Navarro]], [[France national basketball team|French National Team]] [[swingman]] and NBA player [[Boris Diaw]], and Nowitzki, who also claimed the [[MVP]] title.

Papaloukas also joined the elite club of players who have achieved the European title at both the national and club levels during the same year, as he won the [[Euroleague]] title with [[PBC CSKA Moscow|CSKA]] at the [[Euroleague Final Four|Final Four]] in [[Prague]], April 28â30, 2006. 

Papaloukas climbed to the second position of global basketball as he, along with his fellow Greek team players, drove Greece to the final of the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] in Japan, losing there in the final to the [[Spain national basketball team|Spanish National Basketball Team]]. In [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]]'s win over [[United States national basketball team|Team USA]] in the semifinal, by a score of 101â95, Papaloukas had 12 assists, 8 points and 5 rebounds. He also earned a place on the All-Tournament Team, which also included the tournament [[MVP]] [[Pau Gasol]] of [[Spain national basketball team|The Spanish Team]], Gasol's teammate [[Jorge Garbajosa]], [[United States national basketball team|Team USA's]] [[Carmelo Anthony]], and [[Manu GinÃ³bili|Manu Ginobili]] of the [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina National Basketball Team]].

His most formidable personal recognition came on January 26, 2007, when he was voted by fans and journalists as the [[FIBA Europe Player of the Year]] for 2006, topping the likes of Nowitzki, Gasol, and [[Tony Parker]]. In the summer of 2008, Papaloukas became the [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of Greece's national team.

==Player profile==
Papaloukas is a 2.00 m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/competition/players/showplayer?pcode=ATW&amp;clubcode=OLY&amp;seasoncode=e2010 |title=PAPALOUKAS, THEODOROS |publisher=Euroleague.net |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (6&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in) tall (102 kg (225 lb.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurojohnbball.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=56 |title=Theo PapaloukasâOlympiacosâGreece |publisher=Eurojohnbball.com |date=August 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; player who can play as either a [[point guard]], [[shooting guard]], or [[point forward]] on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court. He is a pass-first play maker, or &quot;pure point guard&quot; with a distinctive style of play. His play making ability and pass first or &quot;pure&quot; point guard skills at his height, combined with his versatility to play multiple positions on the basketball court on both ends of the floor make him an extraordinary player. 

He is also the [[ULEB]] era [[Euroleague]]'s all time record holder in both career [[Steal (basketball)|steals]] and [[Assist (basketball)|assists]]. Papaloukas was selected to the [[Euroleague]]'s 50th anniversary [[50 Greatest Euroleague Contributors|Euroleague's 35 Greatest All-Time Players]] list in 2008. Papaloukas is widely known by the nicknames of TeÃ³ and Thodoris. He has also sometimes been given other much less used nicknames, such as The Computer, due to his ability to analyze the court, The Thread, because of his unique ability to complete passes through opposing defenses, like threading a needle, and other nicknames like Paps, Pappas, and The Tsar.
