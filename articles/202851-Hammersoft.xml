'''Daniel Pearl''' (October 10, 1963 â February 1, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[journalist]] who was kidnapped and killed by [[Al-Qaeda]].

At the time of his [[kidnapping]], Pearl served as the [[South Asia]] Bureau Chief of the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'', and was based in [[Mumbai]], [[India]].  He went to [[Pakistan]] as part of an investigation into the alleged links between [[Richard Reid (terrorist)|Richard Reid]] (the &quot;shoe bomber&quot;) and Al-Qaeda.  He was subsequently [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by his captors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,490640,00.html On the Trail of Daniel Pearl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/EF28Df02.html Who killed Daniel Pearl?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Daniel Pearl was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], and grew up in the upscale [[Encino, California|Encino]] district of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he attended [[Portola Middle School (Tarzana)|Portola Middle School]] and [[Birmingham High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Rd0H8Q5zLNIC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=%22daniel+pearl%22+%22january+23%22&amp;ei=JRFlS5i1EZaqzQS0-ImyDg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22daniel%20pearl%22%20%22january%2023%22&amp;f=false ''At home in the world: collected writings from the Wall Street Journal'', Daniel Pearl, Editor	Helene Cooper, Simon and Schuster, 2002, ISBN 0-7432-4317-X, accessed January 31, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Judea Pearl]], is currently a [[professor]] of [[Computer Science]] and [[Statistics]] and director of the Cognitive Systems Laboratory at [[UCLA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html UCLA Cognitive Systems Laboratory (Experimental) Index: Judea Pearl - Home] Access date: February 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Ruth is of [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi Jewish]] descent. 
&lt;!-- The history of the family and its connections to Israel are described by [[Judea Pearl]] in a book by [[Alan Dershowitz]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=Ur2fub6vAyUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=what+israel+means+to+me&amp;ei=lRBlS96FEo30ygTSnviICw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false What Israel Means to Me]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz, Alan (Editor). ''*What Israel Means to Me*'', John Wiley &amp; Sons (2006) pp. 279-86&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
The history of the family and its connections to Israel are described by Judea Pearl in the LA Times article, [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-pearl-bisharat16-2008may16,0,150720.story Roots in the Holy Land].&lt;ref&gt;Pearl, Judea, [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-pearl-bisharat16-2008may16,0,150720.story Roots in the Holy Land], Los Angeles Times, May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danny, as he was known throughout his life, attended [[Stanford University]] from 1981 to 1985, where he stood out as a [[communications]] major with [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors, a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] Fraternity, and co-founder of a student newspaper called the ''Stanford Commentator''. Pearl graduated from Stanford with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Communications]], after which he spent a summer as a Pulliam Fellow intern at the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'', and a winter bussing tables as a ski bum in [[Idaho]]. Following a trip to the then-[[Soviet Union]], [[China]], and [[Europe]], he joined the ''[[North Adams Transcript]]'' and the ''[[Berkshire Eagle]]'' in western [[Massachusetts]], then moved on to the ''[[San Francisco Business Times]]''.

Pearl began at the ''Wall Street Journal's'' Atlanta bureau in 1990, moving to the [[Washington, D.C.]], bureau in 1993 to cover [[telecommunications]], and then to the [[London]] bureau in 1996. He wrote articles such as the October 1994 story of a [[Stradivarius]] [[violin]] allegedly found on a highway on-ramp,&lt;ref&gt;Pearl, Daniel. [http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/pearl101794.htm ''Stradivarius Violin, Lost Years Ago, Resurfaces but New Owner Plays Coy'']. The Wall Street Journal Archive: October 17, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and a June 2000 story about [[Persian pop music|Iranian pop music]]. His most notable investigations covered the ethnic wars in the [[Balkans]], where he discovered that charges of one alleged [[genocide]] committed in [[Kosovo]] were unsubstantiated, and the American missile attack on a supposed military facility in [[Khartoum]], which he proved to be a [[pharmaceutical]] factory.

Later, he met and married [[Mariane Pearl|Mariane Van Neyenhoff]]. Their son, Adam Daniel Pearl, was born in [[Paris, France]] on May 28, 2002, almost four months after Pearl's death.

== Abduction ==
On January 23, 2002, on his way to what he thought was an interview with [[Sheikh]] [[Mubarak Ali Gilani]] at the ''Village Restaurant'' in downtown [[Karachi]], Pearl was kidnapped near the Metropole Hotel by a militant group calling itself ''The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=7igVvi3aO-8C&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22daniel+pearl%22+%22january+23%22&amp;ei=JRFlS5i1EZaqzQS0-ImyDg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=peral&amp;f=false ''In the line of fire: a memoir'', [[Pervez Musharraf]], [[Simon and Schuster]], 2006, ISBN 0-7432-8344-9, accessed January 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The group claimed Pearl was a spy andâusing a [[Hotmail]] e-mail address&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pellegrini| first=Frank| title=Daniel Pearl: 1963-2002 | publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' | date= 2002-02-21 | url =http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,212284,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;âsent the United States a range of demands, including the freeing of all Pakistani [[War on Terror|terror]] detainees, and the release of a halted U.S. shipment of [[F-16]] fighter jets to the Pakistani government.

The message read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We give you one more day if America will not meet our demands we will kill Daniel.  Then this cycle will continue and no American journalist could enter Pakistan.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Photos of Pearl handcuffed with a gun at his head and holding up a newspaper were attached.  There was no response to pleas from Pearl's editor, nor from his wife Mariane.

===Beheading===

Nine days later, Pearl was beheaded. On May 16 his severed head and decomposed body were found cut into ten pieces, and buriedâalong with the jacket of a tracksuit Pearl was wearing when photographed by his kidnappersâin a shallow grave at [[Gadap]], about 30 miles north of Karachi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/may/18/pressandpublishing.pakistan McCarthy, Rory, &quot;Body parts believed to be of murdered US reporter; Clues found in nearby hut are linked to Daniel Pearl,&quot; ''The Guardian'', May 18, 2002, accessed January 30, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=%22daniel+pearl%22+%22january+23%22&amp;ei=JRFlS5i1EZaqzQS0-ImyDg&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=15#v=onepage&amp;q=%22daniel%20pearl%22%20%22january%2023%22&amp;f=false ''Blood evidence: how DNA is revolutionizing the way we solve crimes'', enry C. Lee, Frank Tirnady, Basic Books, 2003, ISBN 0-7382-0602-4, January 30, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the police found Pearl's remains, [[Abdul Sattar Edhi]], one of the most active philanthropists in Pakistan, arrived promptly on the scene, personally collected all ten body parts, and took them to the morgue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mydailyclarity.com/2009/04/abdul-sattar-edhi-revisited/ The Daily Clarity, ''Abdul Sattar Edhi revisited'', April 19, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Pearl's body was returned to the U.S., and was interred in the [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

No [[autopsy]] was performed.  The subsequent video (''see'' next section) made the sequence of events clear.

== The Pearl video ==
[[File:DanielPearl.PNG|thumb|Daniel Pearl stating his identity in the video produced by his captors. The text reads {{lang-ar| Ø§Ø³ÙÛ Ø¯Ø§ÙÛØ§Ù Ø¨ÛØ±ÙØ Ø§ÙØ§ ÛÚ¾ÙØ¯Û Ø§ÙØ±ÛÚ©Û}} {{lang-en|My name is Daniel Pearl, an American Jew}}]]
On February 21, 2002, a videotape was released titled ''The Slaughter of the Spy-Journalist, the Jew Daniel Pearl''. The video shows Pearl's mutilated body, and lasts 3 minutes and 36 seconds.

The [[English language|English]] transcript of the text reads ''{{Sic}}'':
:&quot;My name is Daniel Pearl. I am a Jewish American from [[Encino, California]] [[USA]]. I come from, uh, on my father's side the family is [[Zionist]]. My father's Jewish, my mother's Jewish, I'm Jewish. My family follows [[Judaism]]. We've made numerous family visits to [[Israel]]. Back in the town of [[Bnei Brak]] there is a street named after my great grandfather Chaim Pearl who is one of the founders of the town.&quot;

Pearl continued to talk in the video:

:&quot;Not knowing anything about my situation... not being able to communicate with anybody... only now do I think about some of the people in Guantanamo Bay must be in a similar situation... and I've come to realize that...&quot;

:&quot;...this is the sort of problem that Americans are going to have anywhere in the world now.&quot;

:&quot;We can't be secure, we can't walk around free as long as our government policies are continuing and we allow them to continue.&quot;

:&quot;We Americans cannot continue to bear the consequences of our government's actions, such as the unconditional support given to the state of Israel. Twenty-four uses of the veto power to justify massacres of children. And the support for the dictatorial regimes in the Arab and left-wing world. And also the continued American military presence in Afghanistan.&quot;

A caption in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is shown along the way. Pictures of dead [[Muslim]]s and similar scenes are superimposed around the image of Pearl. Other images shown are those of [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] shaking hands with [[Israel]]i [[Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]], and those of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[civilians]] killed by Israeli soldiersâincluding that of a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] boy [[Muhammad al-Dura]]âof whose death the [[Israeli Defence Force]] was accused.

In the video, Pearl's body is shown naked from the waist up, with his throat slit at about 1 minute and 55 seconds into the video. A man then decapitates Pearl.

A few more images are shown near the image of Pearl's head. The last 90 seconds of the video show the list of demands scrolling, superimposed on an image of Pearl's severed head being held by the hair.

The English transcript of the text reads:
&lt;!--DO NOT CORRECT THE MISPELLINGS OR MISCAPITALIZATIONS AT ALL! SIC!--&gt;
: National Movement For The Restoration Of [[Pakistan]] Sovereignity (NMRPS)

: We still demand the following:

* The immediate release of U.S. held prisoners in [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba|Guatinamo Bay, Cuba]] [sic].&lt;!--SIC means Sic! The video said &quot;Guatinamo, NOT Guantanamo--&gt;
* The return of [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] prisoners to Pakistan.
* The immediate end of U.S. presence in Pakistan.
* The delivery of [[F-16]] planes that pakistan [sic] had paid for and never received.&lt;!--The p in pakistan is stated as in Lower case, received is spelled wrong - DO NOT CORRECT THE MISTAKES--&gt;

: We asure [sic]&lt;!-- This is how it is spelled in the video -- DO NOT Correct this mistake --&gt; Americans that they shall never be safe on the [[Muslim]] Land of Pakistan.

: And if our demands are not met this scene shall be repeated again and again...

== Arrests ==
Daniel's father expressed concern in February 2002 that his son's Israeli [[citizenship]] would have an adverse effect on the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=133733&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=0&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 Haaretz article February 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three suspects were caught after the [[IP address]] of those who sent the [[ransom]] e-mail was traced by the [[Karachi]] police. The arrests were carried out after investigation by Pakistani detective Mir Zubair Mahmood, assisted by Pakistan [[CIA]] computer experts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Rory. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/feb/06/pressandpublishing.pakistan ''Pakistan holds three as net closes on US reporter's kidnappers'']. Guardian February 6, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The mastermind of the kidnapping, [[Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh]], surrendered to a former [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] officer, Brig. [[Ijaz Shah]], who concealed Sheikh's whereabouts from the Karachi police for a week.  Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh had been in an [[India]]n prison in connection with [[1994 Kidnappings of Western tourists in India]], and had been freed by the Indian government in exchange for passengers aboard hijacked [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] in December 1999.

On March 21, 2002, in [[Pakistan]], Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and three other suspects were charged with murder for their part in the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl. They were convicted on July 15, 2002, and Sheikh was sentenced to death. Sheikh has appealed the sentence, but hearings in his case were postponed repeatedlyâover 30 timesâand no definitive date had been set.

In his book ''[[In the Line of Fire (book)|In the Line of Fire]]'', then-[[President of Pakistan]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] stated that Sheikh was an agent of [[MI6]], who at some point became a [[double agent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GulfTimes060929&quot;&gt;{{cite news

On March 10, 2007, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], an alleged [[Al Qaeda]] operative reported to be third in command under [[Osama Bin Laden]], claimed responsibility, before his [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]], for the murder of Daniel Pearl. He claimed to have beheaded him.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtKhalidSheikhMohammed&quot;&gt;

In a confession read during his Tribunal hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is on record repeating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheJurist070319&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They said they had always acknowledged that their client played a role in Pearl's murder, but they had always argued that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the actual murderer. They plan for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's confession to play a central role in their appeal of their client's [[death sentence]].

According to an investigative report published in January 2011 by [[Georgetown University]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] used [[vein matching]] to determine that the perpetrator in the video of the killing of Pearl was most likely Mohammed, notably through a &quot;bulging vein&quot; running across his hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired-20110120-implicate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackerman|first=Spencer|url=http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/01/qaeda-killers-veins-implicate-him-in-journos-murder/|title=Qaeda Killerâs Veins Implicate Him In Journoâs Murder|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal officials had been concerned that the confession obtained though waterboarding would not hold up in court and used this forensic technique to bolster their case.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC-20110120-murder&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blackburn|first=Bradley|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/report-justice-served-murder-daniel-pearl/story?id=12721909|title=Report Says Justice Not Served in Murder of Daniel Pearl, Wall Street Journal Reporter|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=January 20, 2011|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
A collection of Pearl's writings (''[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB111634569601635866.html?mod=2_1150_1 At Home in the World]'') was published posthumously in 2002, demonstrating his &quot;extraordinary skill as a writer&quot; and his &quot;eye for quirky storiesâmany of which appeared in ''The Wall Street Journal'''s &quot;middle column&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;home&quot;&gt;Pearl, Daniel.

ISBN 0-7432-4317-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Six of these stories were adapted by composer Russell Steinberg into an album: ''Stories from My Favorite Planet'', a trio for violin, piano, and reader.

The ''Daniel Pearl Foundation'' was formed by Pearl's family and friends to continue Pearl's mission, and to address what they consider the root causes of his death, in the spirit, style, and principles that shaped Pearl's work and character.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialSite&quot;&gt;

LÃ©vy was criticized for the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;AsiaTimes030628&quot;&gt;

[[HBO Films]] produced a 79-minute documentary titled ''The Journalist and the Jihadi: The Murder of Daniel Pearl''. It premiered on [[HBO]] on October 10, 2006. The documentary chronicles Pearl's life and death, and features extensive interviews with his immediate family. It is narrated by [[Christiane Amanpour]], and was nominated for two [[Emmy Awards]].

Pearl's parents edited and published a collection of responses sent to them from around the globe, entitled ''[http://jewishlights.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=JL&amp;Product_Code=1-58023-183-7 I Am Jewish: Personal Reflections Inspired by the Last Words of Daniel Pearl]'' (Jewish Lights Publishing, 2004). At one point on the video, Pearl said: &quot;My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish,&quot; after which Pearl added one obscure detail, that a street in Israel's Bnei Brak is named after his great grandfather, who was one of the founders of the town.&lt;ref name=iamjewish&gt;Pearl, Ruth &amp; Judea, eds. ''[http://jewishlights.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=JL&amp;Product_Code=1-58023-183-7 I Am Jewish: Personal Reflections Inspired by the Last Words of Daniel Pearl]''. Jewish Lights Pub., January 2004. ISBN 1-58023-183-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The family has written that it understands this last detail authenticates Daniel's own voice and demonstrates his willingness to claim his identity. Judea Pearl has written that at first this statement surprised him, but he later understood it to be a reference to the town-building tradition of his family contrasted with the destructive aims of his captors. Judea Pearl then enlarged the idea by inviting responses from artists, government leaders, authors, journalists, scientists, scholars, [[rabbi]]s, and others. All wrote personal responses to what they thought upon hearing that these were Pearl's last words. Some responses are one sentence, others several pages.

The book is organized by five themes: Identity; Heritage; Covenant, Chosenness, and Faith; Humanity and Ethnicity; Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) and Justice. Contributors include [[Theodore Bikel]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Larry King]], [[Amos Oz]], [[Shimon Peres]], [[Daniel Schorr]], [[Elie Wiesel]], [[Peter Yarrow]], and [[A.B. Yehoshua]].

== Legacy ==
[[Soka University of America]]'s student news magazine, titled ''the Pearl'', is named in honor of Daniel Pearl.

In 2002, Pearl posthumously received the [[Elijah P. Lovejoy|Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] Award from [[Colby College]] and in 2007, the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] Moral Courage Award from the [[Holocaust Museum Houston|Houston Holocaust Museum]].

In 2005, ''The Wall Street Journal'', in conjunction with the [[Sciences Po|Ãcole de Journalisme de Sciences Po]], gave the first Daniel Pearl Prize to Louis-Ãtienne Vigneault-Dubois from Canada, at a ceremony held on June 10 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danielpearl.org/news_and_press/press_releases/journalism_award.html WSJ and Sciences Po Journalism School Award 1st Daniel Pearl Prize to Louis-Ãtienne Vigneault-Dubois] - June 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[minimalist music|minimalist]] composer [[Steve Reich]] wrote his 2006 work ''[[Daniel Variations]]'', jointly commissioned by the Daniel Pearl Foundation and the [[Barbican Centre]], which interweaves Pearl's own words with verses from the [[Book of Daniel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[The Guardian]]| title=Steve Reich on the most political work of his career. | date=2006-09-06 | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/sep/06/classicalmusicandopera.usa | accessdate =2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2007, Pearl was added to the [[Holocaust Memorial on Miami Beach]] as the first non-[[Holocaust]] victim. His father gave his consent for the induction in order to remind generations to come that &quot;The forces of barbarity and evil are still active in our world. The Holocaust didn't finish in 1945.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Associated Press]]| title=''Slain Journalist Daniel Pearl Honored With Holocaust Victims''.  | publisher = ''Editor &amp; Publisher'' | date= 2007-04-16 | url =http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/departments/newsroom/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003572119 | accessdate =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Bradley Burston]] criticized the addition of a post-Holocaust victim to the memorial, saying &quot;it diminishes the uniqueness of the Holocaust&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Burston, Bradley.

In May 2007, the Communications Technology Magnet School at [[Birmingham High School]] was renamed the [[Daniel Pearl Journalism and Communications Magnet]].

In July 2009, [[Daniel Pearl Magnet High School]] (DPMHS) became a stand-alone high school in the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD).

Shortly after Pearl's death, his parents founded the [[Daniel Pearl Foundation]]. The foundation's mission is to promote cross-cultural understanding through journalism, music, and dialogue.  The honorary board of the Daniel Pearl Foundation includes [[Christiane Amanpour]], former President [[Bill Clinton]], [[Abdul Sattar Edhi]], Danny Gill, [[John L. Hennessy]], [[Ted Koppel]], Her Majesty [[Queen Noor of Jordan]], [[Sari Nusseibeh]], [[Mariane Pearl]], [[Itzhak Perlman]], Harold Schulweiss, Craig Sherman, Paul Steiger, and [[Elie Wiesel]].

The Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture at UCLA was established by the foundation in 2002. [[Christopher Hitchens]] delivered the most recent lecture on March 3, 2010. Other lecturers have included [[Anderson Cooper]]; [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]]; [[Ted Koppel]]; [[Larry King]]; [[Jeff Greenfield]]; [[Daniel Schorr]] and [[Thomas Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lee,[http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/christopher-hitchens-at-ucla-154692.aspx &quot;Christopher Hitchens decries anti-Semitism in lecture at UCLA&quot;], UCLA newsroom, March 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;,[http://www.international.ucla.edu/burkle/calendar/pearlseries.asp &quot;The Daniel Pearl Memorial Lecture Series&quot;], UCLA&lt;/ref&gt;

In western Massachusetts, with help from the newspapers there for which Pearl worked early in his career (the ''[[North Adams Transcript]]'' and the ''[[Berkshire Eagle]]''), friends of Pearl established the Daniel Pearl Berkshire Scholarship, awarded annually beginning in 2003.

In East Brunswick Township, Temple B'nai Shalom renamed their Hebrew School 'The Daniel Pearl Education Center' after Pearl. Additionally, the Synagogue has created a &quot;Daniel Pearl Education Scholarship&quot; in his honor.  

Since 2003, Stanford's Department of Communication has awarded a paid summer internship with ''The Wall Street Journal'', known as the &quot;[http://communication.stanford.edu/internships/pearl/ Daniel Pearl Journalism Internship].&quot; Its most recent recipient was Devin Banerjee, a former editor-in-chief of ''[[The Stanford Daily]]''.

On December 10, 2007, President George W. Bush and Laura Bush
invited Ruth and Judea Pearl, parents of Daniel Pearl to the
[[White House Hanukkah Party|White House Chanukah]] reception, to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEUGyOQU9bc&amp;feature=related light the menorah] that once belonged to Daniel's great grandparents, Chaim and Rosa Pearl,
who brought it with them when they moved from Poland to Israel in 1924 to establish the town of Bnai-Brak.

On May 19, 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama enacted the [[Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act]], which protects US journalists around the world. The act is also designed to use tools from the Secretary of State to ensure that freedom of press is upheld in other countries.
