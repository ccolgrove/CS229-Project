The '''2012 Summer Olympic Games''', officially known as the '''Games of the XXX Olympiad''' or &quot;London 2012 Olympic Games&quot;, are scheduled to take place in [[London, England|London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] from 27 July to 12 August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/london/index_uk.asp|title=International Olympic Committee â London 2012 |publisher=IOC |accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; London will become the first city to officially host the modern Olympic Games [[London Olympics|three times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4654821.stm|title=Coe promises Olympics to remember |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Athens]] has also hosted three [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]-organised events, in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] and the [[Intercalated Games]] in [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906]]. However, the 1906 games are no longer officially recognised by the IOC, as they do not fit with the quadrennial pattern of the modern Olympics.&lt;/ref&gt; having previously done so in [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7361921.stm|title=London's first Olympics |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=26 April 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2008 |first=Mark |last=Barden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/olympics_1948_gallery.shtml|title=The 1948 London Olympics Gallery |publisher=BBC History |accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London was selected as the host city on 6 July 2005 during the [[List of IOC meetings|117th]] [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] Session in [[Singapore]], defeating [[Moscow]], [[New York City]], [[Madrid]] and [[Paris]] after four rounds of voting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Election&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.olympic.org/en/content/Olympic-Games/All-Future-Olympic-Games/Summer/London-2012/ |title = London 2012: Election |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate = 2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful bid was headed by former Olympic champion [[Sebastian Coe]].

The Olympics prompted a redevelopment of many of the areas of London in which the games are to be held â particularly themed towards [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/plans/sustainability/getting-ready/index.php|title=Building a sustainable Games|publisher=London 2012|accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the budgetary considerations have generated some criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/4025027.stm|title=London plan at-a-glance |date=5 June 2005|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/briefings-guides/issue-briefs/culture-media-and-sport/london-2012-olympics-$366671.htm|title=What is the London 2012 Olympics?|date=24 April 2008|publisher=politics.co.uk|accessdate=2 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Games will make use of [[Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics|many venues]] which were already in place before the bid, including [[Wembley Stadium]], [[Wembley Arena]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon All England Club]], [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], [[The O2 Arena (London)|The O2 Arena]], [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]], [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]], and the [[ExCeL London|Excel Centre]].

==Bidding process==
{{Main|Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics}}
By the bid submission deadline of 15 July 2003, nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Olympics. These cities were [[Havana]], [[Istanbul]], [[Leipzig]], London, [[Madrid]], Moscow, New York City, Paris and [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/3068323.stm|title=Olympic bids: The rivals |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2004, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), as a result of a scored technical evaluation, reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York, and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3725157.stm|title=London bid team delighted  |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=18 May 2004 |accessdate=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 19 November 2004, all five candidate cities had submitted their candidate file to the [[International Olympic Committee]].  The IOC inspection team visited the five candidate cities during February and March 2005.  The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits and a report coming out that [[Guy Drut]], one of the key members of the Paris bid team and IOC member, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrongb&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=GamesBids|accessdate = 9 March 2005 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1110389129|title =  Day One Of Paris 2012 Inspection By IOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2005, the [[International Olympic Committee]] released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities.  Although these reports did not contain any scores or rankings, the evaluation report for Paris was considered the most positive, now followed closely by London which had narrowed down most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004 regarding Paris.  Also New York and Madrid obtained very positive evaluation reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrongc&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=GamesBids|accessdate = 6 June 2005 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1118060827|title =  Paris, London and New York Get Glowing IOC Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the process and up to the vote at the [[117th IOC Session]], Paris was widely seen as the favourite to win the nomination, particularly as this was its third bid in recent history.  Originally London was seen lagging Paris by considerable margin; however, this started to improve with the appointment of [[Sebastian Coe]] as new head of London 2012 on 19 May 2004.  In late August 2004, some reports started emerging predicting a London and Paris tie in the 2012 bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrongd&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=GamesBids|accessdate = 31 August 2004 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1093970849|title =  London And Paris Tie In 2012 Bid}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final run-up to the 117th IOC Session, London and Paris appeared to be increasingly in a neck-and-neck race.  On 1 July 2005, [[Jacques Rogge]], when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press:  &quot;I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogge quote&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[International Sailing Federation]] |accessdate=2007-03-06 |url=http://www.sailing.org/news/12257.php |title=Rogge Arrives in Singapore |date=2005-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the [[Raffles City|Raffles City Convention Centre]] in Singapore, where the 117th IOC Session was held. Here [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] was the only leader of the five candidate cities' countries to make a personal lobby (he had also been the only one to attend the 2004 Olympics).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC |accessdate = 5 June 2007|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4618507.stm|title = Why London won the Olympics|author=Francis Keogh and Andrew Fraser | date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two cities left in contention were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes, defeating Paris's 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/4655555.stm |work=BBC News  | title=London beats Paris to 2012 Games | date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various French publications blamed the Paris loss on French President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s statements before the vote that &quot;We can't trust people [the British] who have such bad food. After Finland, it's the country with the worst food.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/london-will-host-2012-olympics |title=London will host 2012 Olympics |date=6 July 2005 |work=[[National Business Review]] |accessdate=15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two current members of the [[List of members of the International Olympic Committee|International Olympic Committee]] are from Finland.  Several other news sources cited Bertrand DelanoÃ«'s complaint regarding Tony Blair's secret late night meetings with numerous (African) IOC representatives as having a more significant impact on final vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4657613.stm|title=London tactics upset Paris mayor|publisher=BBC News |date=6 July 2005|accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reporting London's win, British media covered the expectant crowds in both France and Britain (and in the other bid cities), and contrasted the jubilant reaction in London to the reaction of the crowd in Paris, where many had gathered in hope of a French win.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/07/olympics2012.olympicgames|title=Patriotism and pop mark victory celebrations|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=7 July 2005|accessdate=22 August 2008  | first=Mark | last=Honigsbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/06/olympics2012.olympicgames2|title='The outlook for France is like the sky ... grey'|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 July 2005|accessdate=22 August 2008  | first=Kim | last=Willsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4656603.stm|title=Olympic losers react to London's win |publisher=BBC News |date=6 July 2005|accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the celebrations in London were overshadowed when [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London's transport system was attacked]] by terrorists less than 24 hours after the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/sep/02/london.Olympics2012|title=The party that never was: capital marks the games at lastâEight weeks after Olympic celebrations were cut short by bombings, London puts on a low-key spectacle to show it means business|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=6 July 2005|accessdate=22 August 2008 | first=Andrew | last=Culf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, it was alleged by Alex Gilady, a senior IOC official, that London had won the right to host the Olympics only because of a voting error. A London 2012 spokesman dismissed this, saying &quot;At the end of the day, it was a secret ballot. This is the opinion of one individual. The result is what matters and we are not going to be drawn into speculation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4553116.stm Voting error gave Olympics to London], BBC News.

==Development and preparation==
===Since the 2005 bid===
{{Main|2012 Summer Olympic development}}
The [[LOCOG|London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games]] was created to oversee the staging of the Games after the success of the bid, and held their first board meeting on 3 October 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;temp board&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lda.gov.uk/news-and-events/media-centre/press-releases/2005/locog-formally-established-at-first-meeting-of-london-2012-transition-board.aspx |title=LOCOG formally established at first meeting of London 2012 Transition Board â London Development Agency |publisher=Lda.gov.uk |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee, chaired by [[Sebastian Coe|Lord Coe]], is in charge of implementing and staging the games, while the [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] (ODA) is in charge of the construction of the venues and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;temp board&quot;/&gt; In April 2006 the Olympic Delivery Authority board was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/2006/07/lemley-chairs-first-oda-board-meeting.php |title=Lemley chairs first ODA board meeting &amp;#124; July 2006 |publisher=London 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government Olympic Executive]] (GOE), a unit within the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS), is the lead Government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. The GOE reports through the DCMS Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Sports and the Olympics. It focuses on oversight of the Games, cross-programme programme management and the [[London 2012 Olympic Legacy]] before and after the Games that will benefit London and the UK. The organisation is also responsible for the supervision of the Â£9.3&amp;nbsp;billion of public sector funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/2012_olympic_games_and_paralympic_games/default.aspx |title=Department for Culture Media and Sport â 2012 olympic games &amp; paralympic games |publisher=Culture.gov.uk |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, some security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/sports/london-rioting-prompts-fears-over-soccer-matches-and-the-olympics.html|title=London Rioting Prompts Fears Over Soccer and Olympics|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011|work=The New York Times|first1=Juliet|last1=Macur|first2=Eric|last2=Pfanner}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the [[2011 England riots]], with a few countries expressing fear over the safety of the Games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8690809/London-riots-China-raises-questions-over-safety-of-2012-Olympic-Games.html|title=London riots: China raises questions over safety of 2012 Olympic Games|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Peter|last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s assurance that the riots will not affect the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/aug/09/london-riots-2012-olympics|title=London riots will not affect 2012 Olympic security, says IOC|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK|first=Jamie|last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed their ninth visit to London in October 2011. They concluded that London has been making excellent progress and that the 2012 games would leave a lasting legacy. The commission will make their final visit to London in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/other_news/1216135922.html |title=IOC Ends Ninth Visit To London 2012 |publisher=GamesBids.com |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; London was awarded the [[2017 World Championships in Athletics]] in November 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/other_news/1216135963.html London Defeats Doha to host 2017 International Athletics Championships]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venues and infrastructure===
{{Main|Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics}}
[[File:Olympic Park, London, 14 June 2011 (2) cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] in June 2011]]
The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games will use a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. Some of the new facilities will be reused in their Olympic form, while others, will be resized or relocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.excel-london.co.uk/mediacentre/pressoffice/london2012 |title=ExCeL : London 2012 |publisher=Excel-london.co.uk |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of venues have been divided into three zones within [[Greater London]]: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition to these are those venues that, by necessity, are outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy]] on the [[Isle of Portland]] in Dorset which will host the sailing events, some 125 miles (200&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of the Olympic Park. The football tournament will be staged at several grounds around the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7758646.stm |title=BBC Sport â Olympics 2012 venue guide |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work began on the Park in December 2006 when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6179069.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Other Sport... &amp;#124; Olympics 2012 &amp;#124; Work begins on 2012 Olympic Park |publisher=BBC News  |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-14896476 |title=BBC News â Osprey Quay Olympic village topping out ceremony |publisher=BBC  |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004 the 500 acre Olympic Park plans were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3990319.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Other Sport &amp;#124; Olympics 2012 &amp;#124; London reveals Olympic Park plans |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 November 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans for the site were passed in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3639130.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; 2012 Olympic Park gets go ahead |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 September 2004 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required [[Eminent domain|compulsory purchase]] orders of property. The London Development Agency and the London and Continental Railways had a dispute about the orders in November 2005. The LCR accused the LDA of killing off development in the area. The LDA planned alongside the Olympic Park to buy land for the Stratford City development project, which the 180-acre site of the former Stratford Rail Lands into a mixed-use development, including 4,500 new homes, office space, hotels and shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4408396.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Other Sport... &amp;#124; Olympics 2012 &amp;#124; Olympic Park land row rumbles on |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 November 2005 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in 2011 with the completion of the largest urban shopping centre in Europe being operated by Westfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14022954 |title=BBC News â Westfield Stratford City shopping centre opens |publisher=BBC  |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2006 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction, this lead to an enquiry being set up. 206 companies had to relocate by July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4753045.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; Probe into Olympic land evictions |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 May 2006 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, residents who opposed the eviction tried to find way to stop it by setting up campaigns. However they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a Â£9&amp;nbsp;billion regeneration project started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Assistant Producer, Building the Olympic Dream |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7937133.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Olympics &amp;#124; Stratford's last stand |publisher=BBC News  |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were some issues with the original venues due to not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. For example, the road racing at the Olympics Games was originally scheduled to take place in Regent's Park and on Hampstead Heath. Instead the Olympic road races will start and finish on The Mall in central London and head out into Surrey to the south and include loops around Box Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/games/olympic-sports/cycling-road.php |title=London 2012 website on road cycling |publisher=London2012.com |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Mountain bike event will take place at Hadleigh Farm after the event was moved from Weald Country Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7554020.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Olympics &amp;#124; London 2012 &amp;#124; Essex venue to host 2012 biking |publisher=BBC News  |date=11 August 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the UCI labeled the course at the park &quot;too easy&quot; in July 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/7222807.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Olympics &amp; Olympic sport &amp;#124; London 2012 &amp;#124; Mountain bike course 'too easy' |publisher=BBC News  |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was touted that the course could be created in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7483538.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Wales &amp;#124; Coe dampens mountain bike hopes |publisher=BBC News  |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A location in Kent was also considered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Keith Bingham |url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/olympics/346292/lord-coe-selects-hadleigh-in-essex-as-2012-olympic-mtb-venue.html |title=Lord Coe selects Hadleigh in Essex as 2012 Olympic mtb venue &amp;#124; Olympics 2012 |publisher=Cycling Weekly |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public transport ===
[[File:St Pancras railway station MMB 01 395018.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Javelin]] service]]
London's public transport was an element of the bid which was scored poorly in the IOC's initial evaluation, however they felt that if the improvements were delivered in time for the Games then London would cope.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Host_city_elections/2012_OG-Report_of_the_Evaluation_Commission.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transport for London]] (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the [[London Overground]]'s [[East London Line]], upgrades to the [[Docklands Light Railway]] and the [[North London Line]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/london-olympics/ |title=London Olympics Transport Upgrade |publisher=Railway Technology |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of a new &quot;[[Olympic Javelin|Javelin]]&quot; high-speed rail service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3957867.stm |work=BBC News  | title=High-speed rail links confirmed | date=27 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Hitachi|Hitachi Corporation]]'s &quot;bullet&quot; trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7779224.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Javelin train speeds into London | date=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7024783.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Japanese bullet train on display | date=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6960549.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Japanese bullet train docks in UK | date=23 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 it was discovered that the platforms at [[Stratford International station]] were not at the right height for the Javelin trains. The platforms were raised with wood, which could be removed after the Games as the platforms were originally designed for Eurostar trains, and it is hoped that Eurostar will stop at the station after 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14812035 |work=BBC News  | title=Stratford platforms raised to host Javelin trains | date=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to network rail an additional 4,000 train services will run during the Games, with train operators putting on longer trains during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13534021 |work=BBC News  | title=Extra trains planned for visitors to London 2012 venues | date=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TfL also propose the construction of a Â£25&amp;nbsp;million [[cable car]] across the [[River Thames]], the &quot;[[Thames Gateway Cable Car]]&quot;, to link 2012 Olympics venues.&lt;ref name=&quot;CableBBC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Thames cable car to link 2012 Olympic Games venues|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/10501313.stm|publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 July 2010 | date=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will cross the Thames river between [[Greenwich Peninsula]] and the [[Royal Docks]], carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour 50 metres in the air. It is designed to cut journey times between the [[The O2 (London)|O2 arena]] and the [[ExCeL London|ExCel exhibition centre]] â both of which are Olympic locations. The [[private finance initiative|privately-funded]] system could provide a crossing every 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;tfl-annoucement&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Plans unveiled for a new Thames crossing with London's first cable car system|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/16125.aspx|accessdate=5 July 2010|publisher=Transport for London|date=4 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They also plan to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmtran/588/588i.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - HC 588 Volume I final.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the organisers planned to have 93% of athletes within 30 minutes of their event.&lt;ref name=&quot;transport&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/4025027.stm |work=BBC News  | title=London plan at-a-glance | date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3866209.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Free travel plan for Olympic bid | date=5 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;transport&quot;/&gt; Two park-and-ride sites were off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park and ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet which would have capacity for 9,000 cars were spectators could board a 10 minute shuttle bus.&lt;ref name=&quot;transport&quot;/&gt; To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park and ride schemes were set up. Spectators would be dropped off at [[Windsor Racecourse]] with a bridge going over the Thames linking the racecourse to the rowing venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-14911974 |title=BBC News â Olympics 2012: Park and ride schemes for Dorney Lake events |publisher=BBC  |date=14 September 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:London 2012 train.jpg|thumb|right|A [[London Underground]] train decorated to promote London's Olympic bid â this coincided with plans for investment in the city's public transport network]]
Concerns have been expressed at the logistics of spectators traveling to the events scheduled for outside of London. In particular, the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy|sailing event]]s at [[Portland, England|Portland]] are in an area with no direct motorway connection, and with local roads that are heavily congested by existing tourist traffic in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panamericanchauffeurs.com/london_olympics_2012_airport_transfers.html |title=2012 London Olympic Games &amp;#124; London Chauffeur Limo Service |publisher=Panamericanchauffeurs.com |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the Weymouth area did undergo a major upgrade on its road infrastructure. A Â£77&amp;nbsp;million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6529709.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Go-ahead won for Â£77m relief road | date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-12769307 |work=BBC News  | title=Weymouth Olympic relief road is opened | date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Â£16&amp;nbsp;million pounds was put aside for the rest of the improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8323724.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Olympics road plans put on show | date=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaddtion the plans removed 5 roundabouts to ease congestion and replaced them with traffic lights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10255538 |work=BBC News  | title=Business fears over Weymouth Olympic transport works | date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/8594642.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Roundabouts to get Olympic money | date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some residents were unhappy that the roundabouts were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/8575468/Olympic-backlash-spreads-to-Weymouth.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph  | first=David | last=Millward | title=Olympic backlash spreads to Weymouth | date=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the [[South East England]] regional transport board criticised plans published by the Olympics Development Authority for not providing plans of a credible long term [[Coach transport in the United Kingdom|coach network]] saying ''&quot;The ODA has been working on an extensive network of coach services... [but] the lack of reference to this work [in the plan] is both intriguing and at the same time concerning.&quot;'' On 15 February 2010, the ODA announced that [[FirstGroup]] was the preferred bidder for the provision of bus and coach services for the games. This will involve the provision of venue shuttle and park and ride services, services connecting peripheral park and ride sites on the [[M25 motorway|M25]] with the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] and [[Ebbsfleet Valley|Ebbsfleet]], and a nationwide network of express coaches to the Olympic Park, and the [[Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy|Weymouth and Portland sailing venue]]. The services will require around 900 vehicles in total, although some will be sub-contracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/local_transport_today/news/?ID=18702|title=ODA plays down South Eastâs fears about Olympic legacy coach network|work=Local Transport Today|date=22 January 2010|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Statement re Bus and Coach contract at London 2012 Games | url = http://www.firstgroup.com/corporate/latest_news/?id=005071 | publisher=FirstGroup | accessdate = 16 April 2010}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===
The costs of mounting the Games are separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure, and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games are privately funded, the venues and Park costs are met largely by public money.

On 15 March 2007, [[Tessa Jowell]] announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] a budget of Â£5.3&amp;nbsp;billion to cover building the venues and infrastructure for the Games, at the same time announcing the wider regeneration budget for the Lower Lea Valley budget at Â£1.7&amp;nbsp;billion.

On top of this, she announced various other costs including an overall additional contingency fund of Â£2.7&amp;nbsp;billion, security and policing costs of Â£600&amp;nbsp;million, VAT of Â£800&amp;nbsp;million and elite sport and Paralympic funding of nearly Â£400&amp;nbsp;million. According to these figures, the total for the Games and the regeneration of the East London area, is Â£9.345&amp;nbsp;billion. Then Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] pledged the Games Organising Committee would make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BBC |accessdate = 22 April 2007|date=15 March 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6453575.stm|title =Olympics budget rises to Â£9.3bn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs for staging the Games (Â£2&amp;nbsp;billion) are funded from the private sector by a combination of sponsorship, merchandising, ticketing and broadcast rights. This budget is raised and managed by the London 2012 Organising Committee. According to Games organisers, the funding for this budget broadly breaks down as:
*64% from Central Government;
*23% from [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]
*13% from the [[Mayor of London]] and the [[London Development Agency]]

On 18 August 2007, ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]'' reported that jubilation over winning the right to stage the Olympic Games was becoming more muted as realisation dawns on the public of the enormous costs involved in creating facilities for the athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Belfast Telegraph|accessdate = 18 August 2007|date=18 August 2007|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/opinion/article2874458.ece|title =Viewpoint: Olympic gold snatched from Ulster |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927191937/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/opinion/article2874458.ece |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grassroot sport cuts will fund the Olympics, government figures suggested on 19 August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate = 19 August 2007|date=19 August 2007|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/london_2012/article2284338.ece|title =Sport cuts will fund Olympics|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, [[Edward Leigh]] MP, criticised the organisers for significantly under-estimating the cost of staging the games, suggesting they had either &quot;acted in bad faith or were incompetent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7094992.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=2012 Chiefs Face Costs Criticism | date=14 November 2007 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2007, Tessa Jowell announced confirmation of the budget announced earlier in 2007. In June 2007, the Ministerial Fundersâ Group (established to manage the allocation of contingency to the ODA within the overall budget) met and agreed a first allocation of contingency to the ODA, being Â£360&amp;nbsp;million out of the Â£500&amp;nbsp;million of initial contingency announced in March, to enable the ODA to manage early cost pressures.

Following its second meeting on 26 November 2007, the Fundersâ Group has now agreed a baseline budget and scope proposed by the ODA. The total budgeted base cost to be met by the public sector funding package remains at Â£6.090&amp;nbsp;billion including tax and excluding general programme contingency as announced in March. This includes the allocation to the ODA of the remaining Â£140&amp;nbsp;million from the initial Â£500&amp;nbsp;million contingency announced in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=DCMS|accessdate = 10 December 2007|date=10 December 2007|title= Olympic Delivery Authority budget|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2007/dcms_TJ-odabaselinebudget_10dec07.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have, however, been concerns over how the Olympics are to be funded. In February 2008, a London Assembly culture and sport committee report expressed concerns over the funding of the games taking away money from London's sports and arts groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7262307.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Olympics Â£440m 'drain on culture' | date=25 February 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been complaints that funding towards the Olympics has been to the detriment of funding other areas of the UK. In [[Wales]], there has been criticism from [[Plaid Cymru]] about the games depriving Wales of money, by using UK-wide funding rather than English funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_headline=shocking-8216-cost-8217-to-wales-of-olympics&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19904883&amp;siteid=50082-name_page.html |title=Shocking cost to Wales of Olympics |publisher=Icwales.icnetwork.co.uk |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wales on Sunday]] newspaper claimed former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] broke his promise to not use [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] funding for the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/news/columnists/2008/01/20/broken-promises-cause-games-anger-91466-20370587/ |title=Broken promises cause games anger |publisher=Icwales.icnetwork.co.uk |date=20 January 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7188957.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=MPs back Olympic funds transfer | date=15 January 2008 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at December 2009, the Delivery Authority had allocated Â£702&amp;nbsp;million of Programme and Fundersâ contingency, largely to cover the decisions to publicly fund the Village and Media Centre after it became clear private funding could not be secured on acceptable terms during the 2008 to 2010 economic crisis. According to the [[Government Olympic Executive]] and [[Olympic Delivery Authority]] risk assessments the remaining Â£1,270&amp;nbsp;million contingency is sufficient to manage risks to the Delivery Authorityâs programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0910/2012_olympics.aspx |title=Preparations for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games: Progress report February 2010 |publisher=Nao.org.uk |date=26 February 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also from May 2010, the Olympic budget will be cut by Â£27&amp;nbsp;million as part of the Â£6.2&amp;nbsp;billion cuts by the new Conservative-Liberal coalition government.

On 19 July 2011, Hugh Robertson, Sports &amp; Olympic Minister,revealed that he expected the project to be delivered on time and under budget.  &quot;With one year to go to London 2012, the Games construction is 88 per cent complete and ahead of time and under budget. That is an extraordinary thing for a Government Minister to be able to say a year out from the Games.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/13628-london-2012-has-qsalvaged-reputation-of-british-construction-industryq-claims-olympics-minister |publisher=insidethegames | title=London 2012 has &quot;salvaged reputation of British construction industry&quot; claims Olympics Minister | date=19 July 2011 | accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ticketing===
Organisers estimate that some 8&amp;nbsp;million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games, and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million tickets for the Paralympic Games.{{cn|date=November 2011}} Ticket sign-up, in Great Britain, was launched on 22 March 2010 and the application website was opened on 15 March 2011 until 26 April 2011. Ticket prices range from Â£20 for many events to Â£2,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Ticket allocations for oversubscribed events was decided by a random ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London 2012: Ticket applications 'hit the roof'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13187438|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2011|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time in Olympic history the sailing events will be tickteted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ISAF |url=http://www.sailing.org/london2012/news/36364.php |title=ISAF: London 2012 Olympic Games Sailing Competition : What Is The Weymouth And Portland International Regatta? |publisher=Sailing.org |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOGOC) have admitted that further tickets, up to one million, will be released later in 2011 for events that have failed to sell out in the initial allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallop|first=Harry|title=London 2012: more tickets available later this year|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/news/8474155/London-2012-more-tickets-available-later-this-year.html|accessdate=26 April 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half the people who applied got no tickets in Great Britain. The second round of ticket sales took place over a 10 day period between the 23 June and 3 July 2011, with priority given to those who were unsuccessful in the first allocation process. At this point there were about 1.7&amp;nbsp;million tickets for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball, among other sports with 1.5&amp;nbsp;million tickets priced between Â£20 and Â£50. Unfortunately due to the amount of people buying tickets and because the ticketmaster website did not update immediately, 15,000 had their application rejected, but 90% of people did get some tickets; as some events sold out in 15 minutes and by 8&amp;nbsp;am 10 sports had sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13918958 |work=BBC News  | title=2012 Hopefuls Miss Out On Tickets | date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who were successful in the first round of tickets were allowed to buy more during the period 8â17 July 2011. By this point 1.5&amp;nbsp;million tickets were available for football, 40,000 for Volleyball and 8,000 for freestyle wrestling on a first come first served basis. However by 10 July all the tickets for Volleyball had been sold, as 3.5&amp;nbsp;million tickets had been sold in total. Another round of tickets was promised to go on sale in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic tickets on sale in 'second chance' phase|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14066068|publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 August 2011|date=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce traffic, ticket holders will be entitled to free use of London's public transportation network on the day of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ticketing at London 2012 |url=http://www.london2012.com/plans/ticketing/index.php|publisher=London 2012 website |accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 82% of available Olympic tickets and 63% of Paralympic tickets will be sold.

There was a huge demand for tickets as 20 million tickets were bought by 1.8&amp;nbsp;million people, three times the 6.6 million tickets available in the first round lot, with 95% of the applications from Great Britain. More than 50% of the sessions went to a random ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/london_2012/13209306.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Olympic ticket demand passes 20m | date=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consumer group questioned the point of taking money out of people's bank accounts before they knew what tickets they had successfully purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14008482 |work=BBC News  | title=750,000 Olympics tickets sold in 'second chance' round | date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barclays Bank ended up declining its customers tickets, stating that it was a unusual purchase and looked like fraud, before they and LOCOG tried to process them for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13576179 |work=BBC News  | title=London 2012: Ticket payment gaffe by Barclaycard | date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many athletes and ex-Olympians also questioned the way the tickets were sold, with Triple Olympic Champion [[Bradley Wiggins]] labeling the process a shambles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/13892584.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Wiggins angry at 2012 'shambles' | date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lord Coe and the LOCOG insisted that the process was fair, and that there was no 'perfect' system.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.wikipedia.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Townsend_(LOCOG)#The_London_2012_Olympics |title=Chris Townsend (LOCOG) â Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1390663/LONDON-2012-OLYMPICS-Lord-Coe-insists-ticketing-fair.html |location=London |work=Daily Mail  | title=Coe insists ticketing system for London Olympics is fair but not perfect | date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Countdown ===
[[File:2012 Summer Olympics Clock.jpg|150px|thumb|Countdown clock in [[Trafalgar Square]]]]
A digital clock, located in [[Trafalgar Square]], commenced a countdown to the opening ceremony on 14 March 2011. However, less than 24 hours after it was switched on, it suffered a technical failure, and stoppedâdisplaying &quot;500  (days) 7 (hours) 06 (minutes) 56 (seconds).&quot; It was quickly repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) appointed Prestige Ticketing Limited to operate the London 2012 Prestige Ticketing programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012 Hospitality |url=http://prestigeticketing.london2012.com/About-us.aspx|publisher=Prestige Ticketing |accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prestige Ticketing on-site hospitality packages includes top-category tickets, fine dining and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prestigeticketing.london2012.com/Hospitality-packages.aspx ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hospitality tickets were on sale until 15 March 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;T tickets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eventplanning.about.com/od/olympics2012and2016/a/How-To-Obtain-Tickets-And-Hospitality-Packages-For-London-2012-Olympic-Games.htm |title=London 2012 Tickets â Olympics Hospitality â Olympics Tickets |publisher=Eventplanning.about.com |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scheduling issues===
Some representatives of Muslim countries have complained that the 2012 Olympic Games will take place during the month of [[Ramadan]], which in 2012 occurs from 20 July to 19 August. During Ramadan, Muslims are to fast from sunrise to sunset, which may put Muslim athletes at a disadvantage during the Games. Some Muslims have called for the Olympics to be rescheduled outside this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=London 2012 Games To Be Held During Ramadan|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&amp;id=1160922510|publisher=GamesBids.com |accessdate=22 April 2007|date=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo===
There have been two London 2012 logos: one for the bidding process created by Kino Design and a second as the brand for the Games themselves. The former is a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green, and red stripes winding through the text &quot;LONDON 2012,&quot; making the shape of the [[River Thames]] in East London. The latter, designed by [[Wolff Olins]], was unveiled on 4 June 2007 and cost Â£400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6718243.stm|title=London unveils logo of 2012 Games|publisher=BBC Sport  |date=4 June 2007|accessdate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new logo is a representation of the number 2012, with the [[Olympic symbols|Olympic Rings]] embedded within the zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/about-newlook-video.html|title=The new London 2012 brand|publisher=London 2012|date=4 June 2007|accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070606204757/http://www.london2012.com/about-newlook-video.html |archivedate = 6 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wide image|All London 2012 logos.svg|600px|The [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]] logo (far left) and the different official colour combinations for the [[Wolff Olins]] main logo design}}

This will be the first time that the same essential logo is to be used for both the Olympic ''and'' Paralympic games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6718243.stm|title=London 2012 logo to be unveiled|publisher=BBC Sport  |date=4 June 2007|accessdate=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard colours are green, magenta, orange and blue; however the logo has incorporated a variety of colours, including the [[Union Flag]] to promote the handover ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/handover/index.php Get involved: Handover â London 2012]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The flexibility of the logo has also enabled sponsors to incorporate their corporate colours into a personalised version, such as [[Lloyds TSB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydstsb.com/about_ltsb/sponsorship.asp |title=London Olympics 2012 |publisher=Lloyds TSB |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[British Airways]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/london-2012/public/en_gb |title=Official airline partner of London 2012 |publisher=British Airways |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adidas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2007-09/adidas-welcomed-as-tier-one-partner.php |title=News: adidas welcomed as Tier One Partner |publisher=London 2012 |date=20 September 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London 2012 has stated that the new logo is aimed at reaching young people. Sebastian Coe stated that it builds upon everything that the organising committee has said &quot;about reaching out and engaging young people, which is where our challenge is over the next five years.&quot; One observer, a managing director of an advertising agency, noted that the logo bore a strong resemblance to the logo for the 1974â1982 children's television programme ''[[Tiswas]]'', commenting that appealing to young people is difficult, and that they will see right through attempts to patronise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title='Oh no' logo|author=Tom Geoghegan|date=5 June 2007|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6719805.stm|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early public reaction to the logo, as measured by a poll on the [[BBC]] website, was largely negative: more than 80% of votes gave the logo the lowest possible rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/6718243.stm?dynamic_vote=ON|title=BBC  poll measuring public reaction to the new London Olympics logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several newspapers have run their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers. ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' displayed a design by a [[Macaque|macaque monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/06/news/brits.php &quot;British turn up their noses at London Olympics logo&quot;] International Herald Tribune, retrieved on 7 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the logo resembles  the cartoon character [[Lisa Simpson]] performing [[fellatio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/art/2007/06/how_lisa_simpson_took_the_olym.html |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=How Lisa Simpson got ahead at the Olympics | first=Jonathan | last=Glancey | date=5 June 2007 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have complained that it looks like a distorted [[Swastika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/no_go_logo/Uh-Oh%20Logo |title=Uh-Oh Logo |accessdate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, [[Iran]] complained that the logo appeared to spell out the word &quot;[[Zion]]&quot; and threatened to boycott the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=2012 London logo draws ire of Iran |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=6167220 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[ESPN]] |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran submitted its complaint to the [[International Olympic Committee]], describing the logo as &quot;racist&quot;, asking that it be withdrawn and the designers be &quot;confronted&quot;. The IOC &quot;quietly&quot; rejected the demands, and Iran announced it would not boycott the Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12724166 &quot;London Olympics: Iran to compete despite logo complaint&quot;], BBC, 12 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A segment of animated footage released at the same time as the logo was reported to trigger seizures in a small number of people with [[photosensitive epilepsy]]. The charity [[Epilepsy Action]] received telephone calls from people who had had [[seizure]]s after watching the sequence on TV. In response, a short segment was removed from the London 2012 website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6724245.stm|title=Epilepsy fears over 2012 footage|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 June 2007|date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Livingstone]], then London Mayor, said that the company who designed the film should not be paid for what he called a &quot;catastrophic mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/07/nlogo307.xml Online petition against Olympic logo closed], [[The Daily Telegraph]], 8 Jun 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A blogger at the BBC said that &quot;London 2012's new logo has got the country talking [although] not in the manner the organisers would have hoped.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Claire Stocks |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/sporteditors/2007/06/why_we_should_give_london_2012.html |title=Why we should give London 2012 logo a chance |publisher=BBC News  |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One employee at a design firm described it as &quot;well thought out&quot; and anticipated it would &quot;become a source of pride for London and the Games.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Coudal Partners |url=http://coudal.com/olympics.php |title=London Broil |publisher=Coudal.com |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, it was reported that clothing branded with the logo accounted for 20% of sales at Adidas' flagship Oxford Street store, despite occupying just 5% of floor space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/advertising/itrsquos-a-new-brand-day-for-uk-olympics-the-london-olympic-logo-takes-off-959147.html|title=Itâs a new brand day for UK Olympics: The London Olympic logo takes off

===Handover ceremony===
{{Main|2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony}}
The handover ceremony marked the moment when the previous games in [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing in 2008]] handed over the [[Olympic flag#Flag|Olympic Flag]] to the new host city of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/plans/culture/now-to-2012/handover-and-ceremonies.php |title=London 2012.com |publisher=London 2012.com |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mayor of London]] [[Boris Johnson]] received the flag from Mayor of Beijing [[Guo Jinlong]], on behalf of London. The next section was entitled &quot;From London, 'With a whole Lotta love.&quot;The handover ceremony featured the urban dance group ZooNation, the [[Royal Ballet]] and Candoco, a disabled dance group, all dressed as typical London commuters waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. Whilst Olympic Champions [[Chris Hoy]], [[Victoria Pendleton]] and BMX World Champion [[Shanaze Reade]]; however due to Reade's broken wrist from her event [[Jamie Staff]] replaced her;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7578133.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Beijing bids farewell to Olympics | date=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; cycled around the stadium. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium to music composed by [[Philip Sheppard (musician)|Philip Sheppard]] eventually stopping and transforming into a privet hedge featuring famous London landmarks such as [[Tower Bridge]], [[30 St Mary Axe|The Gherkin]] and the [[London Eye]]. [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Leona Lewis]] then performed the [[Led Zeppelin]] classic [[Whole Lotta Love]] and [[David Beckham]] kicked a football into the crowd of athletes accompanied by violinist [[Elspeth Hanson]] and cellist Kwesi Edman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--lead container name--&gt;Eight minute wonder |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2008/06/17/adrian_eight_minutes_feature.shtml |title=The BBC |publisher=The BBC |date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london2012.com/documents/locog-publications/olympic-ho-guide-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For the London 2012 Games, 'Take Up The Challenge' is the leading contender to be the music that will inspire a new generation of athletes. The anthem was composed by Rob Cremona, an Anglo-Maltese trumpeter and multi-instrumentalist from Woking in Surrey. Meanwhile, the handover has been celebrated in a UK-wide series of events. The BBC broadcast &quot;The Visa London 2012 Party&quot; on BBC One and Radio 2, the free concert on [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] in central London had 40,000 tickets available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2008-06/london-2012-invites-the-uk-to-party.php |title=Official London 2012 Announcement |publisher=London2012.com |date=16 June 2008 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nations and regions around the UK there were live screens that showed the activities from Beijing, the Closing Ceremony and then the concert itself. Local communities around the UK also hosted their own events.

===Year to go===
[[File:2012 Olympic Medals revealed.jpg|thumb|right|First glimpse of the medals in Trafalgar Square.]]
On 27 July 2011, London celebrated the one year to the start of the games with a special event in [[Trafalgar Square]]. There were other events around the city such as Lord Coe and [[Colin Jackson]] cast their feet in clay at St Pancras Station, whilst the Aquatics Centre opened, with Tom Daly marking the event with a dive from the 10 metre platform.

In December 2010, it was announced that the [[Royal Mint]] would produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11989437 |work=BBC News  | title=London 2012 medals deal struck for Royal Mint in Llantrisant | date=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Mint expected to produce around 4,700 medals for the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/Corporate/media/London-2012-Olympic-games-victory-medals.aspx |title=London 2012 Olympic Games victory medals to be made by the Royal Mint |publisher=Royalmint.com |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medals are 7mm thick and weigh between 375-400g. They are designed by David Watkins. Each medal will have the sport and the discipline engraved on the rim. Like the last few Olympic medal designs the front will once again have Greek goddess of victory, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], stepping from Parthenon. The reverse side has the Games logo, and a ribbon depicting the [[River Thames]] with a grid symbolising pulling together and radiating energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;1 year medals&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14291544 |work=BBC News  | title=London 2012: Olympic medals timeline | date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medals will have a purple ribbon attached to them which symbolises Royalty and protocol. [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] unveiled the design of the Olympic medals.
In a poll by the Telegraph just 66% of the people who voted liked the design. Designer David Watkins said &quot;I knew it was a take it and love it design. If not â sorry. There was no plan B.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/8665946/London-2012-Olympics-medal-designs-unveiled.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | first=Jacquelin | last=Magnay | title=London 2012 Olympics: medal designs unveiled | date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Test events===

{{main|London Prepares series}}
Many test events will be held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as Wimbledon or as a specially created event held under the banner of ''London Prepares''. Some events are closed to the public, others are ticketed. Basketball and BMX were the first events to be tested within the Olympic Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/9397066.stm |work=BBC News  | title=London 2012 test events unveiled | date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Games==
===Participating nations===
Athletes from 204 NOCs are expected to participate. The [[Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee]], which had planned to continue functioning after the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]], had its membership withdrawn by the IOC Executive Committee at the [[123rd IOC Session|IOC session of June 2011]]. However, Dutch Antillean athletes who
qualify for the 2012 Olympics will be allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Curtain comes down on 123rd IOC Session|url=http://www.olympic.org/ioc?articlenewsgroup=-1&amp;articleid=133159|publisher=IOC|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Listed below are NOCs who have qualified at least one athlete. As of 26 November 2011, 144 nations have qualified at least one athlete.

{{See also|Category:2012 Summer Olympics events}}
The 2012 Summer Olympic programme features 26 sports and a total of 38 disciplines. The 2012 Paralympic Games programme has 20 sports and 21 disciplines. London's bid featured 28 sports, in line with other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and [[softball]] from the 2012 Games two days after it selected London as the host city. The IOC reinforced its decision to drop both sports during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] after they lost votes for reconsideration. They will remain Olympic sports, despite being scheduled for the last time at [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing in 2008]].&lt;ref name=SportsDropped&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2005-07-08-baseball-softball-dropped_x.htm|title=Baseball, softball bumped from Olympics|first=Vicki|last=Michaelis|accessdate=17 August 2008|date=8 July 2005|work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the decision to drop the two sports, the IOC held a vote on whether or not to replace them. The sports considered were [[karate]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], golf, [[roller sports]], and [[rugby sevens]]. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.&lt;ref name=SportsDropped/&gt; The IOC has given the approval for the addition of golf and rugby sevens for the 2016 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.irb.com/newsmedia/news/newsid=2024837.html |title=Rugby in the Olympic Games |work=International Rugby Board |date=20 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/8292584.stm |publisher=BBC News  |title=Golf &amp; rugby voted into Olympics |date=9 October 2009  | accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Olympic Committee executive board met on 13 August 2009 and approved the addition of women's boxing to the programme. The [[International Boxing Federation]] has proposed that 40 athletes compete in five different weight classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=IOC backs golf, rugby for 2016 Olympics; women's boxing for 2012 |publisher=CTV Olympics|url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news-centre/newsid=14036.html?cid=rsstsn|last=Wilson|first=Stephen|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=13 August 2009|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea was backed by then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], suggesting that it would encourage more girls and young women to play sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/35597/Gordon-Brown-backs-Olympic-netball |title=Gordon Brown backs Olympic netball|work=Daily Express |location=UK |accessdate=10 September 2008|date=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC eliminated demonstration sports following the 1992 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/innovations_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1996 |title=International Olympic Committee â Olympic Games |publisher=Olympic.org |accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, special tournaments have been run for non-Olympic sports during the games, such as the [[Wushu Tournament Beijing 2008|Wushu tournament]] at the 2008 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name=&quot;islondon&quot;/&gt; There has been speculation that the [[London Sevens]] tournament held at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] as part of the [[IRB Sevens World Series]] could be put back to coincide with the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic-rugby.org/news/7s_world_cup_dropped_in_favour_of_olympic_rugby |title=7s World Cup dropped in favour of Olympic rugby |publisher=Olympic-rugby.org |date=2 June 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the awarding of the 2012 Olympic Games to London, the government announced that [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom#The 2012 Olympics|special dispensation]] would be granted to allow the various shooting events to go ahead, as had been the case previously for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

== Calendar ==
The final official schedule was released on 15 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London 2012 Olympic Games schedule released|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/london_2012/9397378.stm|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=15 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{2012 Summer Olympics calendar}}

==Broadcasting==
{{Main|List of 2012 Summer Olympics broadcasters}}
[[File:International Broadcast Centre, 14 June 2011 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The International Broadcast Centre in June 2011]]
The London 2012 Olympic Games will be the tenth Olympic Games (counting both Summer and Winter Games) where Panasonic's digital technologies will be used as the official recording format, dating since the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games. The official international video will be produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) in London Olympic Park, in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format.&lt;ref&gt;Let's Go Digiral&lt;/ref&gt; Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD will be the official recording format for capturing the Games. Olympic Broadcasting Services London (OBSL), the Host Broadcaster, will use [[P2 (storage media)|P2]] HD series equipment to support the broadcast of the competition. The cameras that will be used are the AG-HPX250, the companyâs first P2 HD handheld camcorder with AVC-Intra recording and two new AVCCAM HD handheld camcorders, the AG-AC160 and AG-AC130, with Full HD imagers and a new, wider 21X HD zoom lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panasonic Announces 3D P2 HD Shoulder-Mount Camcorder and First P2 HD Handheld with AVC-Intra Recording at National Association of Broadcasters Convention  DVCPRO HD Named Official Recording Format for London 2012 Olympic Games|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110410005065/en/Panasonic-Announces-3D-P2-HD-Shoulder-Mount-Camcorder|publisher=Panasonic|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing the IOC's commitment to providing over-the-air television coverage to as broad a worldwide audience as possible, London 2012 is scheduled to be broadcast by a number of regional broadcasters. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) is the home broadcaster for the Olympics and [[Channel 4]] the home broadcaster for the Paralympics. The BBC aims to broadcast by various channels all 5,000 hours of the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roger Mosey Blog&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |date=29 September 2010 |title=Roger Mosey|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/rogermosey/2010/06/highlighting_an_issue.html |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the actual broadcasting is originated by the [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] (OBS).  The United States television rights currently owned by [[NBC]] account for over half the rights revenue for the IOC.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Many television broadcasters granted rights to the games have bureaux and studios in London, but since at least the [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Olympic Winter Games]] in Calgary, rights-holder operations are hosted in the dedicated [[International Broadcast Centre]] (IBC).  London's IBC is planned to be inside the security cordon of the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]].

Social media will be important for the Games.  Online technology is being developed for the London 2012 Olympics and YouTube will stream highlights of the Games to countries all over the world as part of an IOC deal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Olympic flag==
On 26 September 2008 the [[Olympic flag|Olympic]] and [[Paralympic flag]]s were raised outside [[City Hall (London)|City Hall]] formally mark London becoming host city for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Beijing Gold medalist [[Christine Ohuruogu]] raised the Olympic flag, whilst Paralympic Champions, [[Helene Raynsford]] and [[Chris Holmes (swimmer)|Chris Holmes]] raised the Paralympic flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/videos/flag-raising.jsp |title=Mayor of London â Video clips: Olympic and Paralympic flags raised at City Hall |publisher=Legacy.london.gov.uk |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=18998 |title=1948 Olympians and 2012 hopefuls join Beijing heroes as Olympic and Paralympic flags raised at City Hall |publisher=Legacy.london.gov.uk |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco-policy==
The [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] will incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes.  Local waterways and riverbanks are to be enhanced as part of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/news/archive/2009-02/new-biodiversity-plan-sets-out-future-for-olympic-park-wildlife.php |title=New biodiversity plan sets out future for Olympic Park wildlife |work=London 2012 |accessdate=5 March 2009 |date=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy will also feature at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now be as little as 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-13034546 |title=London 2012 Olympics 'to miss renewable energy target'|work=BBC |accessdate=7 June 2011 |date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and [[hydroelectric]] generators in the River Thames. However, these plans were scrapped for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10234665 |title=Olympic Games site wind turbine scrapped|work=BBC |accessdate=7 June 2011 |date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus has since moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste.

Food packaging at the Olympics will be made from compostable materials â like starch and cellulose-based [[bioplastics]] â where it cannot be re-used or re-cycled. This will include fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used many of these materials will be suitable for [[anaerobic digestion]] (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/news/compostable-bioplastics-set-for-big-win-at-london-olympics |title=Compostable bioplastics set for big win at London Olympics|work=NNFCC|accessdate=31 May 2011 |date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism and the 2012 Games==
[[File:Olympic walks 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kate Hoey]] MP at the launch of Blue Badge 2012 Guided Walks]]
The 2012 Games park near Stratford is attracting new tourists to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4656771.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title=Games a 'Â£2bn UK tourism boost' | date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The upgraded [[Greenway, London|Greenway]] cycle and walking path provides an ideal viewing point for the park while the site remains closed to the public. 

There are daily public walking tours&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alpha State |url=http://www.tourguides2012.co.uk/tours.php/ |title=Tourguides2012.co.uk |publisher=Tourguides2012.co.uk |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; running alongside the 2012 site led by qualified [[Blue Badge Tourist Guides|Blue Badge tourist guides.]]   The guided walks  â which leave from Bromley-by-Bow tube station at 11&amp;nbsp;am  â are attended by over 1000 people each month. They are run by guides who are specifically trained to talk about the 2012 Games and the history and traditions of the local area. 

In 2010, Blue Badge Guides led 220 visits from colleges and schools to the 2012 Games site and nearby Olympic venues. During summer they guided over 1000 new visitors and tourists a day around East Londonâs 2012 sites.

In 2011, a new initiative to bring tourists and visitors into the area will involve a public waterbus âhop-on hop-offâ route, from Limehouse Basin to waterways near the Olympic Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic park waterbus service|url=http://www.britishwaterways.co.uk/newsroom/all-press-releases/display/id/2874|publisher=British Waterways|accessdate=25 May 2011|date=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Olympiad==
The [[Olympic Charter]], the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and the governing the Olympic Movement states that &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The OCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire
period during which the Olympic Village is open.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic Charter|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Olympic%20Charter/Charter_en_2010.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=6 May 2011|page=80|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; London's Cultural Olympiad includes 500 events spread over four years and culminating in the [[London 2012 Festival]]. The cost of the events is around Â£40&amp;nbsp;million and funding has been provided by [[Arts Council England]], [[Legacy Trust UK]] and the [[Olympic Lottery Distributor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Olympiad|url=http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/cultural-olympiad/index.php|publisher=London 2012 website|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Osborn|first=Michael|title=Why we have a Cultural Olympiad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7598013.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=6 May 2011|date=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those announced as being involved in the festival, which will run from 21 June to 9 September 2012, include [[Academy Award|Oscar]] winning actress [[Cate Blanchett]], director [[Mike Leigh]], musician [[Damon Albarn]] and artists including [[David Hockney]], [[Lucian Freud]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cultural Olympiad reveals celebrity line-up|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11934812|publisher=BBc News |accessdate=6 May 2011|date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Mark|title=Cultural Olympiad's London 2012 festival lines up arts world A-list|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/dec/07/cultural-olympiad-london-2012-festival|accessdate=6 May 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cultural Olympiad has been criticised for its refusal to include [[Cornish language]], [[Sport in Cornwall|sport]] and [[Cornish culture|culture]] amongst celebrations within its South West region. [[University College Falmouth]] had put a bid in for funding from the [[Legacy Trust]] for an event, An Gwary Meur (The Great Play), combining theatre and sport, participant and audience, story-telling and physical endeavour. This was backed by a wide range of partners including the [[Cornish Pilot Gig Association]], [[Cornish wrestling|Cornish Wrestling Association]], [[Cornwall Rowing Association]], [[Cornwall Rugby Football Union]], the [[Cornwall Cultural Partnership]] and the [[Cornish Language Partnership]]. The refusal of this application has been viewed as ''&quot;a direct barrier to people in Cornwall celebrating their distinct [[Cornish people|Cornish identity]].&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Ian Saltern, Cornish National Minority Report 2 - http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/downloads/cornish_minority_report_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
===Stamps===
In August 2009 the [[Royal Mail]] commissoned artists and illustrators to create 30 stamps which were released in batches of 10 during 2009 to 2011. The 30 stamps symbolise that the Games take place during the 30th Olympiad. Each stamp featured an Olympic or Paralympic sport and in addition had the London 2012 logo on each stamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalmailgroup.com/news/2009/royal-mail-launches-major-series-olympic-stamps-london-2012 |title=Welcome to Royal Mail Group |publisher=.royalmailgroup.com |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Mail had initially approched photographers to be included as well but this was abandoned as the photos would have to be of dead people as the only living person allowed to feature on stamps in the United Kingdom is the Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/13670-royal-mail-releases-final-set-of-2012-olympic-stamps |title=Royal Mail releases final set of 2012 Olympic stamps &amp;#124; London 2012 |publisher=insidethegames.biz |date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stamps with an Olympic theme go back to the very first games in Athens 1890; when the organisers commissoned the sale of stamps in order to balance the books and construct the last four venues. When London first held the Games in 1908 no stamps were commissoned. On that occasion and for the 1912 are the only time when stamps were not issued. When London last held the Games in 1948, just four stamps were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/summer-olympics/2012/5249-royal-mail-delivers-london-2012-stamp-deal |title=Royal Mail delivers London 2012 stamp deal &amp;#124; London 2012 |publisher=insidethegames.biz |date=24 August 2009 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 July 2011 the last of the 30 stamps were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14244890 |work=BBC News  | title=Year-to-go Olympic stamps unveiled by Royal Mail | date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchandise===

On 21 July 2009 the LOCOG announced that [[Hornby Railways|Hornby Plc]] had won the license to develop and market a range associated with the Games. The license allowed the company to sell products across its Corgi, Hornby, Scalextric and Airfix brands.

==Criticism==
The [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] has drawn criticism&lt;ref&gt;[http://svt.se/2.21335/1.2621682/iok_vill_censurera_os-idrottarna &quot;IOK Vill Censurera OS-Idrottarna&quot;] - &quot;IOC Wants To Censor Olympic Athletes&quot;, SVT (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spn.dk/article2621539.ece &quot;Ytringsfriheden pÃ¥ spil under OL&quot;] - &quot;Freedom of speech under threat during Olympics&quot;, Jyllandsposten (Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; for its [http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Games_London_2012/IOC_Social_Media_Blogging_and_Internet_Guidelines-London.pdf social media guidelines] which, commentators argue, appear to infringe on athletes' right to free speech. The guidelines appear to prohibit athletes from commenting on other participants, promoting their own sponsors, or using the word &quot;Olympic&quot; (with certain specific exceptions) on their personal websites. Further criticism has been levelled at the IOC's creation of a [http://www.olympicgamesmonitoring.com website] intended to allow the reporting of suspected breaches of the guidelines.
