'''Dudley Do-Right''', created by [[Alex Anderson (cartoonist)|Alex Anderson]], is the [[eponym]]ous hero of a segment on ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'' which parodied early 20th century [[melodrama]] and [[silent film]] (by using only a [[piano]] as a musical background) in the form of the [[Northern (Genre)|Northern genre]].
==Overview==
Dudley Do-Right is a  dim-witted [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Canadian Mountie]] who is always trying to catch his nemesis [[Snidely Whiplash]], more often succeeding by pure luck than anything else. He romantically pursued Nell Fenwick, the daughter of Inspector Fenwick, the head of the Mountie station. However, a [[running gag]] throughout the series was Nell's interest in his horse (called Horse), to the point that she scarcely noticed Dudley's interest.

Dudley Do-Right once made a cameo in a &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club&quot; segment, playing the hero in &quot;She Can't Pay the Rent&quot;, a play staged by [[Boris Badenov]]. Rocky and Bullwinkle also appeared as cameo in an episode called &quot;Mountie Bear&quot;.

In the standard intro, Dudley is seen riding his horse backwards.

== Dudley Do-Right Show ==
''The Dudley Do-Right Show'' is an animated television series assembled by P.A.T. Film Services, consisting of cartoons produced by [[Jay Ward Productions]] and Total Television, which aired Sunday mornings on ABC-TV from April 27, 1969 to September 6, 1970. Each half-hour show included two segments each of ''Dudley Do-Right Of The Mounties'' and ''The World Of Commander McBragg'', along with one segment each of ''Tooter Turtle'' and ''The Hunter''. ''Dudley Do-Right'' was a Jay Ward production, while the other segments were products of Total Television. Both companies used Gamma Productions, a Mexico-based animation studio.

The U.S. syndicated version of the show, called ''Dudley Do Right And Friends'', differs from ''The Dudley Do-Right Show'', featuring most of the same recurring cartoon segments, but a different episode selection. The syndicated package features ''Dudley Do-Right Of The Mounties, The World Of Commander McBragg, The King And Odie,'' and ''The Hunter''. The latter two originally appeared as part of ''King Leonardo And His Short Subjects'', a series that aired between October 15, 1960 and September 28, 1963 on NBC-TV. Twenty-six new segments of both series were produced for CBS-TV's ''Tennessee Tuxedo And His Tales'' in 1963, and these later segments are included in the syndicated ''Dudley Do Right And Friends''.

Actors (voice overs) included:
* [[Bill Scott (voice actor)|Bill Scott]] - Dudley Do-Right
* [[June Foray]] - Nell Fenwick
* [[Hans Conried]] - Snidely Whiplash
* [[Paul Frees]] - Inspector Fenwick/Narrator
* [[William Conrad]] did several (but not all) of the narrations.

One segment originally seen on ''[[The Bullwinkle Show]]'', &quot;Stokey the Bear&quot;, had been withheld from all reissues of the series because the [[U.S. Forest Service]] objected to the image of a bear that ''started'' forest fires. The segment was finally released on home video in 2005.

{{see|Dudley Do-Right (film)}}

In 1999, a [[Dudley Do-Right (film)|live-action film]] starring [[Brendan Fraser]] (as Dudley), [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] (as Nell), [[Alfred Molina]] (as Snidely), and [[Robert Prosky]] (Inspector Fenwick) was released. The movie was a box-office failure, as it had an opening weekend gross (domestically) of $3,018,345, which then went on to have a &quot;domestic total gross&quot; of $9,974,410. The movie was made on a budget of $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gray |first=Brandon |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com |title=Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theme park attraction ==
Dudley Do-Right is the theme of a log flume attraction at the [[Islands of Adventure]] [[theme park]] titled &quot;[[Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls]]&quot;. Guests enter a queue themed to resemble a theater, with Dudley, Nell, Snidely and Horse presented as actors. Riders board cartoon logs and journey &quot;into&quot; the story, where Snidely has sinisterly captured Nell Fenwick. Horse and Dudley make their first appearance in front of a [[cyclorama]] backdrop, theatrically &quot;charging&quot; to the rescue.

The ride system contains three drops, the last and tallest of which is 75 feet. It is a hybrid flume/coaster that utilizes steel track to not only shoot guest-filled logs down the final drop, but under the water's surface and over a bunny hill.  The ride system was designed and built by [[Mack GmbH]] and opened in 1999.
