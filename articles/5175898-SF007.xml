'''MediaCoder''' is a [[transcoding]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It has been developed by Stanley Huang since 2005.

MediaCoder uses various [[open source]] audio and video [[codec]]s, among several proprietary codecs and tools to transcode different audio/video formats and has many extra features. Common uses for the program include [[Data compression|compression]], file type conversion and extraction of audio from video files. Many formats are supported, including [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), [[Windows Media Audio]] (WMA), [[RealAudio]], [[WAV]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]], [[MPEG-4 Part 2]], [[MPEG-2]], [[Audio Video Interleave]] (AVI), [[Video CD]] and [[DVD-Video]].

MediaCoder is free of charge and is supported by bundling [[OpenCandy]] software recommendation service in its installer. There are no ads in the software GUI, although by default a web page containing ads is loaded on every startup. This behavior qualifies the program as [[adware]].

Prior to 2008, MediaCoder was a [[free and open-source]] software application and was available on [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |url = http://sourceforge.net/projects/mediacoder/
  |title = Media Coder
  |work = [[SourceForge]]
  |publisher = Geeknet, Inc
  |accessdate = 13 May 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; MediaCoder was a nominee of ''SourceForge.NET 2007 Community Choice Award of Best Project for Multimedia'' along with [[Audacity]], [[InkScape]] and [[FFDShow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2009 however, Stanley Huang announced that the project is no longer hosted on SourceForge and no longer open-source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate = 16 May 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has become a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[adware]] for which no source code is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Following these changes, on 10 June 2009, a ticket was opened on [[FFmpeg]]'s development site, alleging &quot;Possible MediaCoder [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] violation&quot;. Although the author of MediaCoder participated in the discussion, the issue is yet to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then MediaCoder was listed on the &quot;Hall of Shame&quot; page on FFmpeg project page that names the projects that violate the (L)GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
