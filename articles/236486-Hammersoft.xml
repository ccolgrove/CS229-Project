Eventually the seal evolved and changes some details and features, but the principal devices remained unaltered. The new design was patterned after the national standard of Spain, the seal consist of [[fleur-de-lis]]  surrounded by quartered flag of Castille and Aragon represented by thwo golden castles located on the red field and two red lions on a white field. The seal was later adopted by Spanish colonial government.

At this time, the Manila coat of arms adopted by Spanish colonial government was still in use until 1905 when [[Philippine Commission]] adopted the &quot;new arms and great seal of the Philippine Islands&quot; designed by Gaillard Hunt of the US State Department.

After almost two years of studying, The committee recommend certain modifications to the coat of arms of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. They recommend that the eight ray Philippine sun must be the point of honor.
