==Childhood and early life==
Cornell was born and raised in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] and attended [[Christ the King School (Seattle, Washington)|Christ the King, Catholic elementary school]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Chris Cornell|author=Scaggs, Austin|publisher=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/chris_cornell_interview.html|date=2005-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shorewood High School (Washington)|Shorewood High School]]. His parents are Ed Boyle (a pharmacist from an [[Irish Catholic]] background) and Karen Cornell (an accountant from a [[American Jews|Jewish]] background).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell Biography|url=http://www.barrystickets.com/concert-tickets/chris-cornell-tickets.php|publisher=barrystickets.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell Biography (1964â)|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=278911|publisher=biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has five siblings: older brothers Peter and Patrick, and younger sisters Katy, Suzy, and Maggie.  Peter, Katy and Suzy all performed in the band Inflatable Soule in the 1990s.  Peter is currently the [[frontman]] for the New York-based rock band Black Market Radio.  Katy performs as lead vocalist for the [[Seattle]] band Happy Hour Hero.

Cornell spent a two-year period between the ages of nine and eleven solidly listening to [[The Beatles]] after finding a large collection of Beatles records abandoned in the basement of a neighbor's house. Cornell was a loner; however, he was able to deal with his anxiety around other people through rock music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell: Biography|author=Prato, Greg|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p66582|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before becoming a successful musician, he worked at a seafood wholesaler and was a sous-chef at a restaurant named Ray's Boathouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;stout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=As a Paris restaurateur and family man, life is now good for Audioslave rocker|author=Gene Stout|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/pop/267486_cornell21.html|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Cornell was a member of a cover band called The Shemps that performed around Seattle.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book | last = Anderson | first = Kyle | title = Accidental Revolution | publisher = St. Martin's Griffin | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-312-35819-8 |pages=112â116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shemps also featured bassist [[Hiro Yamamoto]]. Following Yamamoto's departure from The Shemps, the band recruited guitarist [[Kim Thayil]] as its new bassist.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Cornell and Yamamoto stayed in contact, and after The Shemps broke up Cornell and Yamamoto started [[jam session|jamming]] together, eventually bringing in Thayil to join them.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

==Recording career==
===1984â1997: Soundgarden===
{{Main|Soundgarden}}
[[Soundgarden]] was formed in 1984 by Cornell, Thayil and Yamamoto with Cornell originally on drums and vocals. In 1985, the band enlisted [[Scott Sundquist]] as the drummer to allow Cornell to concentrate on vocals.&lt;ref&gt;George-Warren, Holly, Patricia Romanowski, and Jon Pareles. ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll''. Rolling Stone Press. 2001. ISBN 978-0-671-43457-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's first recordings were three songs that appeared on a compilation for [[C/Z Records]] called ''[[Deep Six (album)|Deep Six]]''. In 1986, Sundquist, who by that point had a wife and a child, decided to leave the band and spend time with his family.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; He was replaced by [[Matt Cameron]], the drummer for [[Skin Yard]], who became Soundgarden's permanent drummer.

Soundgarden signed to [[Sub Pop]], releasing the ''[[Screaming Life]]'' [[EP (format)|EP]] in 1987 and the ''[[Fopp (EP)|Fopp]]'' EP in 1988 (a combination of the two was issued as ''[[Screaming Life/Fopp]]'' in 1990). Though the band was being courted by major labels, in 1988 they signed to [[SST Records]] to release their debut album, ''[[Ultramega OK]]'' (1988), for which they earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In 1989, the band released their second effort, and their first for a major label, ''[[Louder Than Love]]''. Following the release of ''Louder Than Love'', Yamamoto left the band to finish his Master's degree in Physical Chemistry at [[Western Washington University]]. He was replaced by former [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] guitarist [[Jason Everman]]. Everman was fired following Soundgarden's tour supporting ''Louder Than Love''. In 1990, the band was joined by a new bassist, [[Ben Shepherd]].

[[File:SG Down on the Upside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Thayil, Cornell, Shepherd and Cameron displayed on the disc of the Soundgarden album ''[[Down on the Upside]]'' (1996).]]
Along with [[Alice in Chains]], Nirvana, and [[Pearl Jam]], Soundgarden became one of the most successful bands from Seattle's emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s. With Shepherd, the new line-up recorded ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'' in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene. ''Badmotorfinger'' included the singles &quot;[[Jesus Christ Pose]]&quot;, &quot;[[Outshined]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Rusty Cage]]&quot;. The three singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the videos for &quot;Outshined&quot; and &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; gained considerable airtime on [[MTV]]. The song &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; and its music video was the subject of widespread controversy in 1991, and the video was removed from MTV's playlist. &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; was later covered by [[Johnny Cash]] on his 1996 album, ''[[Unchained (Johnny Cash album)|Unchained]]''. It also appeared on the fictional radio station [[Radio X]] on the [[video game]] ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' and in the 32-bit version of ''[[Road Rash]]''. &quot;[[Room a Thousand Years Wide]]&quot; was released previously as a single in 1990, but not to promote the album. It was released (with the song &quot;HIV Baby&quot;) as a 7&quot; through Sub Pop's ''Single of the Month'' club a full year before the release of ''Badmotorfinger''. The song was re-recorded for this album. ''Badmotorfinger'' was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;/&gt; It was also ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of ''[[Guitar World]]'' on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chud.com/forums/showthread.php?t=93854 &quot;Guitar World's (Readers Choice) Greatest 100 Guitar Albums Of All Time&quot;]  {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5QDGLgdGU|date =2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Superunknown]]'' became the band's breakthrough album.

The band's final album was 1996's self-produced ''[[Down on the Upside]]''. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;[[Pretty Noose]]&quot;, &quot;[[Burden in My Hand]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Blow Up the Outside World]]&quot;. The album was notably less heavy than the group's preceding albums, and marked a further departure from the band's grunge roots. Soundgarden explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Turman, Katherine|title=Soundgarden: Seattle's Sonic Boom|url=http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/hypno_1996.shtml|publisher=Hypno|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Browne of ''Entertainment Weekly'' said, &quot;Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Browne|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292725,00.html|title=Down on the Upside|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-10-19| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5nDYr4jhe | archivedate = 2010-02-01| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tensions within the group arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell reportedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Colapinto|title=Soundgarden Split|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2008-10-19|url=http://web.stargate.net/soundgarden/articles/rs_5-29-97.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite favorable reviews, the album did not match the sales of ''Superunknown''.&lt;ref name=&quot;search&quot;/&gt; In 1997, Soundgarden received another Grammy nomination, for the lead single &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9702/grammy/other.categories/rock.html |title=GRAMMY NOMINEES FOR OTHER ROCK AND ALTERNATIVE CATEGORIES |publisher=[[CNN|CNN.com]] |accessdate=2008-08-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080421225848/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9702/grammy/other.categories/rock.html |archivedate = April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to tensions within the band, reportedly due to internal strife over its creative direction, Soundgarden announced it was disbanding on April 9, 1997.

===1998â2000: Solo career===
In 1998, Cornell began working on material for a solo album on which he collaborated with [[Alain Johannes]] and [[Natasha Shneider]] of the band [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]]. The album, entitled ''[[Euphoria Morning]]'', was released on September 21, 1999. The album proved commercially unsuccessful although the album's single &quot;[[Can't Change Me]]&quot; was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance|Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] at the [[42nd Grammy Awards|2000 Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grammy2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/grammys.htm |title=42nd Grammy Awards â 2000 |publisher=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Euphoria Morning'' includes &quot;Wave Goodbye&quot;, Cornell's tribute to his late friend [[Jeff Buckley]]. It has been noted that ''Euphoria Morning'' is influenced by Buckley's songwriting and distinctive vocal style. He also contributed the song &quot;Sunshower&quot; (a bonus track on the Japanese release of ''Euphoria Morning'') to the soundtrack of the 1998 film, ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'', and a reworked version of the track &quot;Mission&quot;, retitled &quot;Mission 2000&quot;, was used on the [[Mission: Impossible II (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 2000 film, ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]''. In 2000, Cornell embarked on a tour in support of the album.

===2001â2007: Audioslave===
{{Main|Audioslave}}
[[File:Chris Cornell Montreux Jazz Festival 2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cornell performing with Audioslave at the 2005 [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].]]
[[Audioslave]] was formed after [[Zack de la Rocha]] left [[Rage Against the Machine]] and the remaining members were searching for another vocalist. Producer and friend [[Rick Rubin]] suggested that they contact Cornell. Rubin played the remaining Rage Against the Machine band members the Soundgarden song &quot;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers&quot; to showcase his ability. Cornell was in the writing process of a second solo album, but decided to shelve that and pursue the opportunity to work with [[Tom Morello]], [[Tim Commerford]] and [[Brad Wilk]] when they approached him. Morello described Cornell: &quot;He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And... when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV.com: Audioslave&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Audioslave: Unshackled, Ready To Rage|author=Moss, Corey; Parry, Heather|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/audioslave/news_feature_112202/|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal and began working in the studio in late May 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pushing Forward Back&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Clare. &quot;Pushing Forward Back.&quot; ''Zero Magazine''.

Their debut album, ''[[Audioslave (album)|Audioslave]]'', released in November 2002, spawned hits such as &quot;[[Cochise (song)|Cochise]]&quot;, &quot;[[Like a Stone]]&quot; and &quot;[[Show Me How to Live (song)|Show Me How to Live]]&quot;, and has reached triple platinum status in the United States. The band was nearly derailed before the album's release; Cornell was going through alcohol problems and a slot on the [[Ozzfest]] tour was canceled.&lt;ref name=&quot;stout&quot;/&gt; During this time, there was a rumor that Cornell had checked himself into [[drug rehabilitation]]. He later confirmed it in an interview with ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' that was conducted from a clinic payphone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ewing| first = Jerry| title = Straight Outta Rehab| journal = [[Metal Hammer]]| issue = 108|date=December 2002| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[San Diego CityBeat]]'' article, Cornell explained that he went through &quot;a horrible personal crisis&quot; during the making of the first record, staying in rehab for two months and separating from his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Diego CityBEAT â A Career in Slavery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A Career in Slavery|author=Sculley, Alan|publisher=[[San Diego CityBeat]]|url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/article.php?id=3132|accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems were ironed out and he has remained [[sobriety|sober]] since this time. The band toured through 2003, before resting in 2004 to record their second album.

Audioslave's second album, ''[[Out of Exile]]'', was released in May 2005 and debuted at number one on the U.S. charts. The album has since gone on to achieve platinum status.

In early 2006 the band returned, recording their third album as they had written most of the material during the tour. The band released the album, titled ''[[Revelations (Audioslave album)|Revelations]]'', in September 2006. ''Revelations'' was influenced by 1960s and 70s [[funk]] and [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Morello Swings His Hammer|author=Rogulewski, Charley|publisher=Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10146985/tom_morello_swings_his_hammer?rnd=1146173101411&amp;has-player=true&amp;version=6.0.12.872|accessdate=2007-08-20|date=2006-04-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080418023418/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10146985/tom_morello_swings_his_hammer%3Frnd%3D1146173101411%26has-player%3Dtrue%26version%3D6.0.12.872 |archivedate = April 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two singles were &quot;[[Original Fire]]&quot; and &quot;[[Revelations (Audioslave song)|Revelations]]&quot;.

Despite the exposure to other forms of media and the positive critical buzz for their third album, Audioslave did not tour behind the release. They went into hiatus to allow Cornell to complete &quot;You Know My Name&quot;, the theme song for the 2006 James Bond film, ''Casino Royale'', and Morello to pursue his own solo work under the moniker of [[The Nightwatchman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;harris&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Cornell Working On Solo LPâBut Dismisses Rumors Of Audioslave Split|author=Harris, Chris|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537179/20060726/cornell_chris.jhtml?headlines=true|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2006-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Audioslave's lyrics were written by Cornell, while all four members were credited with writing the music.

Cornell has done a number of meet and greet showings with his fanbase. On April 18, 2009, it was announced on his official website that he would be doing a meet and greet appearance at the &quot;Electric Fetus&quot; record store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Fans who caught on to the message were able to meet Cornell for pictures and autographs before the concert at the &quot;Myth&quot; in Maplewood, Minnesota.

Though not officially released onto CD, an hour-long acoustic concert Cornell performed on September 7, 2006 at O-Baren in [[Stockholm]], is widely available for [[Music download|download]] under the title ''Chris Cornell: Unplugged in Sweden''. A promotional CD for his solo album, ''Carry On'', was released in March 2007, entitled ''[[The Roads We Choose - A Retrospective]]''. The 17-song [[Compact Disc|CD]] included songs from Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave and Cornell's solo work.

On June 5, 2007, Cornell released his second solo album, ''[[Carry On (Chris Cornell album)|Carry On]]'', produced by [[Steve Lillywhite]]. It debuted at number 17 on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. Among the artists who accompanied him on his second solo release was friend [[Gary Lucas]], who contributed [[acoustic guitar]] to some of the tracks. Cornell has stated that he is always writing, and that there are some songs that he was not able to put onto an Audioslave album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell solo album|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/music/archives/105814.asp|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While recording his second solo album, Cornell was involved in a [[motorcycle]] accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Hits: Chris Cornell|url=http://fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=297588|publisher=fmqb.com|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was apparently &quot;[[Rear-end collision|rear-ended]] by a truck in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]]'s [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]] while riding his motorcycle&quot; and &quot;catapulted 20&amp;nbsp;feet into the air.&quot; He was able to walk away from the accident, but had severe cuts and bruises. He returned to the studio later that day.

In 2007, Cornell appeared as support to [[Aerosmith]] on at least two legs of their 2007 world tour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerosmith â With Chris Cornell, The Feeling and ARCKID|url=http://www.last.fm/event/148144|publisher=[[Last.fm]]|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;â[[Dublin]], London, and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]âand to [[Linkin Park]] in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linkin Park Concerts â  Sunday 14 October 2007 at Rod Laver Arena|url=http://www.last.fm/event/298450|publisher=[[Last.fm]]|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These shows formed part of his own ongoing world tour which began in April 2007 and continued into 2008 and 2009. Cornell has described his touring bandâcomprising guitarists [[Yogi Lonich]] and Peter Thorn, bassist Corey McCormick and drummer [[Jason Sutter]]âas &quot;musicians that could get the whole picture&quot; playing music by Soundgarden and Audioslave, as well as his solo material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A conversation with Chris Cornell|url=http://www.chriscornell.org.uk/articles/conversationwithchriscornell.htm|publisher=chriscornell.org.uk|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Cornell was featured on the Main Stage of Linkin Park's [[Projekt Revolution]] tour. Joining Linkin Park and Cornell on the Main Stage were [[Busta Rhymes]], [[The Bravery]], and [[Ashes Divide]]. The Revolution Stage featured [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]], [[10 Years]], [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Armor for Sleep]], and [[Street Drum Corps]]. During this tour, Cornell has stated that he plans to &quot;jump on stage&quot; with other artists as the opportunity arises; this may set the stage for future Cornell collaborations, outside his work with Timbaland. Throughout the tour, Cornell collaborated with [[Chester Bennington]] from Linkin Park while performing &quot;Hunger Strike&quot;, and with Street Drum Corps for a number of his Soundgarden tracks. While Linkin Park would perform their Grammy-winning song &quot;[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]&quot;, he would appear on stage singing the second verse of the song, the outro, and harmonies [[Aaron Lewis]] provided for the ''[[Reanimation]]'' version.

Cornell worked with producer [[Timbaland]] on his most recent album, ''[[Scream (Chris Cornell album)|Scream]]'', which was released on March 10, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell Official site news|url=http://www.chriscornell.com/news/default.aspx?nid=20104|accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timbaland has referred to the recording sessions as &quot;The best work I've done in my career,&quot; and predicted that Cornell will be the &quot;first rock star in the club.&quot; Cornell called the new album &quot;a highlight of my career.&quot; The album was largely panned by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On April 2, 2009, Cornell took over Atlanta Rock station, Project 961, [[WKLS|WKLS-FM]]. For 24 hours the station became &quot;Chris-FM&quot; and included a two hour special of Cornell DJing and playing his favorite songs of his career with the stories behind them leading up to a rebroadcast of his solo show from the previous night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris-FM|url=http://www.project961.com/pages/chrisfm/chris_cornell.html|publisher=project961.com |accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 2009, Cornell performed [[John Lennon]]'s &quot;[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]&quot; on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''. On October 30, 2009 it was reported that Cornell is working with Jordan Zadorozny and Michael Friedman to rework the ''[[Scream (Chris Cornell album)|Scream]]'' album, which was completely untrue. Never Far Away and Long Gone were the only songs that were reworked and not the full album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativeaddiction.com/musicnews/article/1554/Cornell-To-Rework-Scream-Into-Rock-Album |title=Chris Cornell to rework entire &quot;Scream&quot; album into rock album |publisher=AlternativeAddiction |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell's voice is also sampled on the song &quot;Mister Dirt&quot; from Joshua David's album ''Good. Night. Melody.'' which was released on November 17, 2009.

In January 2011 Cornell announced his solo acoustic 'Songbook' tour, following on from a series of acclaimed solo acoustic shows in Los Angeles during 2009 and 2010. The first leg of the sold-out tour began on April 1, 2011 and continued through the US and Canada until May 6. The tour received universally positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell's new Sound Garden|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/showandtell/2011/04/chris-cornells-new-sound-garden|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 Cornell released âThe Keeperâ, an original song written for the [[Marc Forster]] directed 2011 film [[Machine Gun Preacher]]. For the first 24 hours of release, the song was exclusively available as part of the &quot;Donate to Download&quot; campaign for [[Sam Childers]]' Angels of East Africa children's charity. The song will also be the lead track on the filmâs soundtrack album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell's The Keeper Available Now|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/chris-cornell-s-the-keeper-available-now/9049318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soundgarden Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cornell, Cameron and Shepherd performing with Soundgarden at [[Lollapalooza]] 2010.]]
On January 1, 2010, Cornell alluded to a [[Soundgarden]] reunion via his [[Twitter]] account, writing: &quot;The 12-year break is over and school is back in session. Sign up now. Knights of the Soundtable ride again!&quot; The message linked to a website that features a picture of the group performing live and a place for fans to enter their e-mail address to get updates on the reunion. Entering that information unlocks an archival video for the song &quot;Get on the Snake&quot;, from Soundgarden's second studio album, 1989's ''[[Louder Than Love]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1628964/20100104/soundgarden.jhtml |title=Soundgarden's Chris Cornell announces reunion |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=January 4, 2010 |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Soundgarden announced plans to headline [[Lollapalooza]] 2010. Soundgarden made the announcement through their website and email list. On April 16, 2010, Soundgarden held a secret show at the Showbox Theater on First Avenue in downtown Seattle, Washington, publicized via the band's mailing list. The show was billed as Nudedragons, an anagram for Soundgarden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=138636|title= Reunited SOUNDGARDEN To Perform As NUDEDRAGONS At Tonight's Concert|publisher=BlabberMouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked in August 2010 if Soundgarden will record new material, Cornell replied, &quot;it would be exciting to record one song, to hear how Soundgarden-ish that might be this much time later. But for me, it's been more of a trip relearning the songs and playing them together. Some of the songs we're approaching we've never played live.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=144703|title=Soundgarden: After 13 Years, The Grunge Gods Return.

Soundgarden made their first television appearance since their reunion on [[Conan O'Brien]]'s second episode of ''[[Conan (TV series)|Conan]]'' November 9, 2010 on TBS and toured North America in summer 2011.

In mid/late September 2011 Chris Cornell stopped by Rolling Stone to perform a few acoustic songs &amp; conducted an interview where he spoke about what it's like being back with Soundgarden &amp; revealed that in early 2012 a new Soundgarden album consisting of new material would be released. The album would pick up exactly where the Down on the upside album released in 1996 left off.

==Other musical projects==
===Center for Disease Control Boys===
{{Main|Center for Disease Control Boys}}
From 1986 to 1987, Cornell was also a member of the satirical [[Western swing]] band [[Center for Disease Control Boys]].

===Temple of the Dog ===

|description  = &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; was the first single released from ''Temple of the Dog''. The song was written by Cornell and features a duet between Cornell and [[Eddie Vedder]].
}}
While still in Soundgarden, Cornell recorded an album with members of what would become Pearl Jam. This collaboration went under the name [[Temple of the Dog]], and the [[Temple of the Dog (album)|self-titled album]] was released in 1991. The album is a tribute to their mutual friend, and Cornell's former roommate, [[Andrew Wood (singer)|Andrew Wood]]. Wood, the former lead singer of [[Mother Love Bone]], died of a heroin overdose the year before. [[Jeff Ament]] and [[Stone Gossard]] of Mother Love Bone teamed up with [[Mike McCready]], [[Dave Krusen]], and new vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] in 1990, forming Pearl Jam. ''Temple of the Dog'' has gone on to sell more than a million copies, thanks in large part to the singles &quot;[[Say Hello 2 Heaven]]&quot; and &quot;[[Hunger Strike (song)|Hunger Strike]]&quot;, the latter of which features a duet between Cornell and Vedder. This was the first time Vedder was recorded professionally. During a 2003 Pearl Jam show at the [[Santa Barbara Bowl]], Cornell appeared as a surprise guest. After playing a short acoustic set, Cornell joined Vedder and the rest of the band to perform &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; and &quot;Reach Down&quot;.  On October 6, 2009, Cornell made a surprise appearance during a Pearl Jam concert at the Gibson Amphitheater in Los Angeles.  The reunited Temple of the Dog played Hunger Strike.  At the end of the concert, Cornell took a bow with the band along with Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, thus having three of the four major grunge bands of the early 1990s represented on stage, with only Nirvana missing.

===Alice Mudgarden===
{{Main|Alice Mudgarden}}
Cornell, together with [[Mark Arm]] of [[Mudhoney (band)|Mudhoney]], contributed vocals on the [[Alice in Chains]] song &quot;Right Turn&quot; from the 1992 EP, ''[[Sap (album)|Sap]]'', although the band given credit for this song is [[Alice Mudgarden]].

===M.A.C.C.===
In 1992, Cornell and three other former members of Temple of the Dog played under the name [[M.A.C.C.]], recording the song &quot;Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)&quot; for the 1993 album, ''[[Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''.

===Collaborations===
Cornell worked as a co-producer and [[backing vocalist]] on the [[Screaming Trees]]' 1991 album, ''[[Uncle Anesthesia]]''. He acted in a cameo role and an onstage performance in [[Cameron Crowe]]'s 1992 Seattle-based film, ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]''. He also contributed his solo song &quot;Seasons&quot;, and Soundgarden's song &quot;Birth Ritual&quot;, to the ''Singles'' [[Singles (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. Cornell contributed vocals on [[Alice Cooper]]'s &quot;Stolen Prayer&quot; and &quot;Unholy War&quot; (which he also wrote) from the 1994 album, ''[[The Last Temptation (Alice Cooper album)|The Last Temptation]]''. In 1997, Cornell collaborated with [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] on a rendition of the song, &quot;[[Ave Maria (musical settings)|Ave Maria]]&quot;, for the Christmas compilation album, ''[[A Very Special Christmas 3]]''. Cornell has also performed live with the band [[Linkin Park]].

It was incorrectly believed (for many years) that Cornell had written the [[Eleven (band)|Eleven]] song &quot;Someone to Die For&quot; on the 2004 ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' [[Spider-Man 2 (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], but this was corrected in an interview in April 2007. The song is performed by [[Jimmy Gnecco]] of [[Ours (band)|Ours]] and [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Cornell had recorded a demo of the song some time earlier, which was released only to members of the Eleven [[street team]].

Cornell co-wrote (with [[Brian Howes]]) [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]]'s first post-''[[American Idol]]'' album single, &quot;[[Light On]]&quot;, released in 2008. And in 2009, he contributed vocals on the song, &quot;Mister Dirt&quot;, from the album, ''Good.Night.Melody'', by [[Joshua David]]. Cornell sang one song (which he co-wrote) on ''[[Slash (album)|Slash]]'', [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]'s solo record released in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bosso, Joe.

Cornell appears on the [[Carlos Santana]] album ''[[Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time]]'', where he sings on the cover of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Whole Lotta Love]]&quot;.

In September 2011, he joined members of [[Pearl Jam]] for a [[Temple Of The Dog]] live reunion at the 2-day [[PJ20]] Festival in Alpine Valley, WI.&lt;ref&gt;Lettkemann, Jessica.

==Musical style==

Chris Cornell's songwriting often features non-standard chord progressions and melodies that do not conform with one diatonic scale. A prominent example is ''Black Hole Sun'', which not only involves many kinds of open chords and several key changes in short sequences, but also very unique melody phrases with large-interval jumps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Best Of Soundgarden (Guitar Tab &amp; Vocal)
  | publisher = Cherry Lane Music
  | year = 1995
  | isbn = 978-0895249036
}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A recurrent characteristic is the usage of major-only chord sequences (''Euphoria Morning''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
 |url=http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/c/chris_cornell/sweet_euphoria_tab.htm
 |title=Sweet Euphoria Tab

  | publisher = HAL LEONARD CORPORATION

  | isbn = 978-1423433255
}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which also leads to more subtle key changes.

While a most intensive concentration of Chris Cornell's songwriting style can still be found on the Euphoria Morning album&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |author=Rog The Frog Billerey-Mosier
 |date=September 1999
 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, later works, with Audioslave or on the later solo albums, tend to be more conventional, only sometimes containing short but inventive interlude parts (e.g. ''Like a stone''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Personal life==
Cornell was previously married to Susan Silver, the manager of [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Soundgarden]]. He had a daughter with Silver, Lillian Jean, in June 2000. He and Silver divorced in 2004. In December 2008, Cornell reported via his official website that he had finally won back his collection of 15 guitars after a four-year court battle with Silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Cornell Celebrates The Return Of His Guitars|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/12/17/chris_cornell_celebrates_the_return_of_h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently married to Vicky Karayiannis (ÎÎ¯ÎºÏ ÎÎ±ÏÎ±Î³Î¹Î¬Î½Î½Î·),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cornell Loses $30,000 in Argentine Flood|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/category?blogid=7&amp;cat=1022|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Paris-based American publicist of Greek heritage.

When asked how Cornell beat all his addictions he stated, &quot;It was a long period of coming to the realization that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help, and I'm not....it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, but the bottom line is really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, The individual kinda has to want it...not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock N Roll Experience's interview w/ Chris Cornell|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rock/e4/chriscornell.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 interview,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 News New Zealand interview with Chris Cornell|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Chris-Cornell-talks-Soundgarden-and-life---full-interview/tabid/551/articleID/215669/Default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Cornell said the major change with the reformed Soundgarden is a lack of alcohol: &quot;The biggest difference I noticed.. and we haven't even really talked about it: There are no bottles of Jack Daniels around or beers. And we never talked about.. it's just not there.&quot;

==Discography==
