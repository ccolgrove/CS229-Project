The first graduating class, in 1901, consisted of four women who received credentials to teach in the Arizona Territory. In 1925, the Arizona State Legislature allowed the school, which was now called the Northern Arizona State Teacher's College, to grant the Bachelor of Education degree. The school became Northern Arizona State Teacher's College.{{cn|date=December 2011}}
