The '''United Islamic Front''' (United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, UIF, Jabha-yi Muttahid-i Islami-yi Milli bara-yi Nijat-i Afghanistan), known in the West and Pakistan as the '''Northern Alliance''', was a military-political [[umbrella organization]] created by the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] in 1996 under the leadership of [[Defense Minister]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. The organization united all ethnic groups of [[Afghanistan]] fighting against the Afghan [[Taliban]] who were supported by neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden's]] [[Al Qaeda]]. The United Front included [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Hazara people|Hazaras]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] and others.
	
In late 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil that killed 3,000 people, the United Front succeeded in retaking most of Afghanistan from the Taliban with assistance from the [[United States armed forces]], [[United States Special Forces|U.S. special forces]], [[British armed forces]] and [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British Special forces]]. Despite fears of a return to the chaos similar to that of the [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1992â1996)|1992â1996 civil war]], all the different UIF factions accepted the new interim [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] led by [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]].

==Commanders and factions==
Beside [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] the best-known commanders of the United Front were: 

*(from the north) [[Bismillah Khan Mohammadi]], [[Atta Muhammad Nur|Atta Mohammad Noor]], Mohammad Daoud Daoud, Qasim Fahim, Gul Haider, Haji Mohammad Mohaqeq, Rashid Dostum, Qazi Kabir Marzban;
*(from the east) Haji [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)|Abdul Qadir]], Hazrat Ali, Jaan Daad Khan and Abdullah Wahedi, Qatrah and Najmuddin;
*(from the south) Qari Baba, Noorzai and Hotak;
*(from the west and southwest) [[Ismail Khan]], Doctor Ibrahim, and Fazlkarim Aimaq;
*(from central Afghanistan) [[Hussain Anwari]], Said Hussein Aalemi Balkhi, Said Mustafa Kazemi, Akbari, Mohammad Ali Jawed, Karim Khaili and Sher Alam.

The political parties (factions) in contrast to the commanders played only a minor role in the war against the Taliban: 
*[[Jamiat-i Islami|Islamic Party of Afghanistan]] - ''Jamiat-i Islami'' - Made up of mainly Persian-speaking Sunni [[TÄjik people|Tajiks]] officially led by [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]].
*[[Islamic Movement of Afghanistan]] - ''Harakat-i Islami'' -  Shia Tajiks and Hazaras led by [[Ayatollah]] [[Muhammad Asif Muhsini]].
*[[Hezb-i Wahdat|Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan]] - ''Hezb-i Wahdat'' - Made up of Shia [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] and supported by Iran, led by [[Mohammed Mohaqiq]] and [[Karim Khalili]].
*[[National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan]] - ''Junbish-i Milli'' - Made up of [[Uzbeks]] and former communists, led by [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]].
*[[Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan]] - ''Ittihad-i Islami'' - Sunni [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], led by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]].
*Eastern Shura - Sunni Pashtuns led by [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)|Abdul Qadir]]


The two main political candidates in the Afghan Presidential Elections of 2009 both worked for the United Front:
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] (was a close friend of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and the foreign minister of the alliance)
*[[Hamid Karzai]] (his father was killed by the Taliban, he subsequently went on a diplomatic mission to gather support for Massoud in Europe and the U.S. in 2000/2001)

==History==
===Background===
[[File:1996afghan (1).png|thumb|Map of the situation in Afghanistan in late 1996; [[Ahmad Shah Massoud|Massoud]] (red), [[Abdul Rashid Dostum|Dostum]] (green) and [[Taliban]] (yellow) territories.]]
After the fall of the [[communist]] [[Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords).&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date= |url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peshawar Accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt; From the first day of its founding until late 1994, the newly-created Islamic State of Afghanistan (ISA) came under attack by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-i Islami]] militia armed, financed and instructed by neighboring Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan expert [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'': 

{{blockquote|Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in [[Central Asia]]. [...] [[Islamabad]] could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders [...] to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. [...] Had it not been for the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]'s logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets, Hekmatyar's forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;}}

[[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and his [[Junbish-i Milli]] militia joined an alliance with Hekmatyar in early 1994. In addition, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]] - as competitors for regional [[hegemony]] - supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=352| publisher = I.B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd., London New York | isbn=1-85043-437-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Human Rights Watch, Iran was assisting the [[Shia]] [[Hazara people|Hazara]] [[Hezb-i Wahdat]] forces of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]], as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date= |url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;&gt;GUTMAN, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia supported the [[Wahhabite]] [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] and his [[Ittihad-i Islami]] faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war. The capital city [[Kabul]] saw extremely violent fighting during that period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Power was highly decentralized.

Meanwhile, southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1994, the [[Taliban]] (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor in [[Kandahar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994â1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp.25â6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

In late 1994, most of the militia factions ([[Hezb-i Islami]], [[Junbish-i Milli]] and [[Hezb-i Wahdat]]) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily in Kabul by forces of the Islamic State's [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;&gt;Amnesty International. &quot;DOCUMENT - AFGHANISTAN: FURTHER INFORMATION ON FEAR FOR SAFETY AND NEW CONCERN: DELIBERATE AND ARBITRARY KILLINGS: CIVILIANS IN KABUL.&quot; 16 November 1995 Accessed at: http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA11/015/1995/en/6d874caa-eb2a-11dd-92ac-295bdf97101f/asa110151995en.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International Committee of the Red Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1995|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jly2.htm |title =Afghanistan: escalation of indiscriminate shelling in Kabul| publisher =International Committee of the Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide [[political process]] with the goal of national [[Democratic consolidation|consolidation]] and [[democratic]] elections, also inviting the [[Taliban]] to join the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = | title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |pages=310  | publisher =  Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban declined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; They started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;/&gt; On September 26, 1996, as the Taliban with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat from Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;Coll, ''Ghost Wars'' (New York: Penguin, 2005), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Islamic State government remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban's Islamic Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. The Taliban imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their political and judicial interpretation of Islam issuing edicts forbidding women to work outside the home, attend school, or to leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physicians for Human Rights&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1998 |url = http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/documents/reports/talibans-war-on-women.pdf |title = The Taliban's War on Women. A Health and Human Rights Crisis in Afghanistan| publisher = [[Physicians for Human Rights]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the United Front===
Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum, two former archnemesis, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI see video] The United Front included beside the dominantly [[Tajik people|Tajik]] forces of Massoud and the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] forces of Dostum, Hazara factions and Pashtun forces under the leadership of commanders such as [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]], Haji [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan leader)|Abdul Qadir]], Qari Baba or diplomat [[Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai]]. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[GhÅr Province|GhÅr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]]. 

The Taliban defeated Dostum's Junbish forces militarily by seizing Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile.

===Ahmad Shah Massoud===
[[File:Massoud 2000.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ahmad Shah Massoud in August 2000 conferring with advisers.]]
{{rquote|left|The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274 Inside the Taliban] [[National Geographic]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ahmad Shah Massoud remained the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview: 
:&quot;The Taliban say: âCome and accept the post of prime minister and be with usâ, and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But for what price?! The difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state. We can not accept their conditions of compromise, or else we would have to give up the principles of modern democracy. We are fundamentally against the system called âthe Emirate of Afghanistanâ.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.orient.uw.edu.pl/balcerowicz/texts/Ahmad_Shah_Masood_en.htm |title =The Last Interview with Ahmad Shah Massoud | publisher = Piotr Balcerowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&quot;There should be an Afghanistan where every Afghan finds himself or herself happy. And I think that can only be assured by democracy based on consensus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; /&gt;
Massoud wanted to convince the Taliban to join a political process leading towards democratic elections in a foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Proposal for Peace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1998|url =http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm |title =Proposal for Peace, promoted by Commander Massoud | publisher = peace-initiatives.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated:
:&quot;The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced from the people now. They are weaker than in the past.

On September 9, 2001, two Arab [[suicide attack]]ers, allegedly belonging to Al Qaeda, posing as journalists, detonated a bomb hidden in a video camera while interviewing [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]] in the Takhar province of Afghanistan. Commander Massoud died in a helicopter that was taking him to a hospital. He was buried in his home village of [[Bazarak, Panjshir|Bazarak]] in the [[Panjshir Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/17/world/rebel-chief-who-fought-the-taliban-is-buried.html &quot;Rebel Chief Who Fought The Taliban Is Buried&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral, although taking place in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq-zqA1DMWs Sad day] (video clip).

The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on U.S. soil which killed nearly 3000 people and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. [[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the FBI until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the World Trade Center (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, John OâNeill told two of his friends, 
:&quot;We're due. And we're due for something big. ... Some things have happened in Afghanistan [referring to the assassination of Massoud]. I donât like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan. ... I sense a shift, and I think things are going to happen. ... soon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |url =http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/script.html|title =The Man Who Knew | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John O'Neill died on September 11, 2001, when the south tower collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt; 

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, United Front troops ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul with American air support in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], using intelligence reports offered by Iran during the [[Six plus Two Group on Afghanistan|Six plus Two Group]] meetings at the United Nations Headquarters. In November and December 2001 the United Front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the post-Taliban interim government of Hamid Karzai in late 2001.

==Human rights (1997â2001)==
The human rights situation during combat was heavily dependent on the specific commander and his troops. The situation for different leaders and their troops of the United Front thus shows sharp contrasts. Also, the quality of life of the Afghan population was heavily dependent on the specific leader that was directly controlling the area in which they lived. Sharp contrasts could also be witnessed regarding life and structures in those areas. 

=== Area of Massoud ===

Massoud directly controlled the Panjshir, some other parts of Parwan and Thakar province. Some parts of Badakshan were under his influence while others were controlled by Burhanuddin Rabbani with whom Massoud had some non-violent disputes. (Badakshan is the home region of Rabbani.)

Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes or abuses for Massoud's troops in the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001. Massoud created democratic institutions which were structured into several committees: political, health, education and economic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; In the area of Massoud women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; They were allowed to work and to go to school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; In at least two known instances Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |pages=310  | publisher =  Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it was Massoud's stated conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion that could only be achieved through education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; 

Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled the Taliban to the areas of Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a huge humanitarian problem because there was not enough to eat for both the existing population and the refugees. In 2001 Massoud and a French journalist described the bitter situation of the refugees and asked for humanitarian help.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament (2)&quot;/&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw see video]

=== Area of Dostum ===

Until the defeat of Dostum by the Taliban in 1998 he controlled the following provinces: Samangan, Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab, and Baghlan provinces. According to Human Rights Watch many of the violations of international humanitarian law committed by the United Front forces date from 1996-1998&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/afghan-bck1005.htm#uf  |title = Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, October 2001| publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Dostum controlled most of the north. 

According to Human Rights Watch in 1997 some 3,000 captured Taliban soldiers were summarily executed in and around Mazar-i Sharif by Dostum's Junbish forces under the command of Gen. Abdul Malik Pahlawan. The killings followed Malik's withdrawal from a brief alliance with the Taliban and the capture of the Taliban forces who were trapped in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;/&gt; With the U.S. War on Terror, troops loyal to Dostum also returned to combat. In December 2001 during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] between 250 and 3,000 (depending on sources) [[Taliban]] prisoners were shot and/or suffocated to death in metal truck containers, while being transferred by [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Front]] (troops loyal to Dostum) soldiers from [[Kunduz]] to [[Sheberghan]] prison through the Dasht-i-Leili desert in [[Afghanistan]]. This became known as the so-called Dasht-i-Leili massacre&lt;ref name=Iol2002-05-02&gt;

Dostum belonged to those commanders making their own, often draconian, laws. Human Rights Watch has released documents alleging widespread crimes targeted against the civilian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;/&gt; Human Rights Watch asked to actively discourage and refuse support in any way to any group or coalition that includes commanders with a record of serious violations of international humanitarian law standards, specifically naming Abdul Rashid Dostum; Haji Muhammad Muhaqqiq, a senior commander of the Hezb-i Wahdat; Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the erstwhile Ittihad-i Islami; and Abdul Malik Pahlawan, a former senior Junbish commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==

[[Image:Northern Alliance troops line a runway at Bagram Airbase.jpg|thumb|United Front troops lined up next to the runway at [[Bagram Air Base]] in [[Afghanistan]], December 16, 2001.]]The United Front, from 1996 to 2001, blocked the Taliban, Pakistan and Al Qaeda from gaining total control over all of Afghanistan. Many refugees found shelter in areas controlled by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, on U.S. soil (which killed 3000 people) ground troops of the United Front ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul. In November and December 2001 the United Front gained control of much of the country. This was facilitated by extensive bombing of Taliban forces and military infrastructure by the United States during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|U.S.-led attack on Afghanistan]]. Had it not been for the United Front the U.S. would have needed to deploy hundreds of thousands of ground troops to Afghanistan already in October 2001.

The United Front was extremely influential in the [[List of Afghan Transitional Administration personnel|transitional Afghan Government]] of [[Hamid Karzai]] from 2001 until 2004. Notably, Mohammed Qasim Fahim became the Vice President and Minister of Defense, [[Yunus Qanuni]] became the Minister of Education and Security Advisor and Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]] became the Foreign Minister. Most foreign observers expected this dominance to continue and for Fahim or Qanuni to be selected as Karzai's Vice President in the 2004 elections. However, Karzai instead selected [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]], younger brother of the former United Front leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. Karzai easily won the 2004 Presidential election with 55.4% of the vote, followed by three former leaders of the UIF, Quanuni (16.3%), Mohaqiq (11.7%) and Dostum (10%). 

Some of the military strength of the UIF has now been absorbed into the [[Military of Afghanistan]], while many of the remaining soldiers were disarmed through a nationwide [[disarmament]] program. The existence and strength of the [[Afghan National Army]] has significantly reduced the threat of the former UIF elements attempting to use military action against the new [[NATO]]-backed government. Most of the country's senior military personnel are former members of the UIF, including [[Afghan Ministry of Defense|Defense Minister]] [[Abdul Rahim Wardak]] and General [[Bismillah Khan (Afghanistan)|Bismillah Khan]].

Some members of the alliance are now part of the [[United National Front (Afghanistan)]] which is led by Rabbani and includes some former leaders of the UIF such as Parliamentary Speaker Yunus Qanuni, Mohammed Fahim, and Abdul Rashid Dostum. The United National Front has positioned itself as a &quot;loyal&quot; opposition to Karzai. Others like Abdul Sayyaf claim to be loyal to Hamid Karzai while, however, following their own agenda. Sayyaf has strong ties to the Saudi establishment and wants to create a strong Wahhabi influence on Afghanistan.

Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], a [[doctor of medicine]] and one of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]'s closest friends (who is said to have been close to him politically also), ran as an independent candidate in the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 Afghan presidential election]] and came in second place. On November 1, 2009, Abdullah, however, quit the [[runoff election]] because of widespread allegations of election fraud against Hamid Karzai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091101/ap_on_re_as/as_afghanistan Afghan's Karzai effectively handed 2nd term]&lt;/ref&gt; His followers wanted to take to the streets but Abdullah held them back in order not to endanger the fragile stability of the government. [[Massoud Khalili]], another of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]'s close friends, became ambassador to India and subsequently to Turkey, while the younger brother of Massoud, Ahmad Wali Massoud, serves as ambassador to the United Kingdom. Massoud's ex-commander Bismillah Khan was army chief of staff for a long time rebuilding the Afghan armed forces until he was shifted to the position of interior minister in 2010 by Karzai. One of Massoud's close intelligence agents, [[Amrullah Saleh]], became director of the Afghan National Directorate of Security in 2004 but had to resign in 2010 because of disagreements with Hamid Karzai over how to proceed against the Taliban and Pakistani support to the Taliban.
