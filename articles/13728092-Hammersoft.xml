The '''Battle of Thoppigala''' was a battle between the Sri Lanka Army and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) fought during a period of the first half of 2007 over control of the LTTE-dominated peak of [[Thoppigala]] (also known as ''Baron's Cap''), located 40&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Batticaloa, in eastern [[Sri Lanka]].

==Background==
[[Thoppigala]], also known as Baron's Cap and Kudumbimalai, is a large rock standing at {{convert|1753|ft|m}} above sea level. The rock is surrounded by thick jungle and rocky terrain,&lt;ref name=&quot;largest bases&quot; /&gt; and has a number of natural caves.&lt;ref name=&quot;description&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/070708/Plus/pls12.html|title=Thoppigala: A land of many wonders|last=Salgado|first=Upali |date=8 July 2007|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) was active in the country during the period of 1987â1990, they had carried out operations in the Thoppigala area to find LTTE cadres hiding there. However, General A.S. Kalkat, the then commander of the IPKF, later said that they had made no attempt to capture the area since it had been of no military significance to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;indian invlovement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.lk/2007/07/29/newsfe3.htm|title=Peace accord did not fail : Gen. Kalkat |last=Noyahr|first=Keith |date=29 July 2007|publisher=The Nation|accessdate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1993, the Sri Lankan military conducted operations in the East to evict the LTTE from the region. Military bases were established in and around Thoppigala during these operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/20070819/interviews.htm|title=Human rights violations are unacceptable|last=Handunnetti|first=Dilrukshi |date=19 August 2007|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of [[Eelam War IV]], the Sri Lankan military started a campaign to capture the [[Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|Eastern Province]] from the LTTE. The Sri Lanka Army [[Battle of Sampur|captured]] the town of [[Sampur]] and surrounding areas on 3 September 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;sampur&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/04/asia/AS_GEN_Sri_Lanka.php|title=Sri Lankan military captures key rebel territory, Tigers vow to keep fighting |date=3 September 2006|work=The Associated Press|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Eastern_Theater_of_Eelam_War_IV#Battle_of_Vakarai|capture of Vakarai]] on 19 January 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;vakarai&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2007/01/070119_vakaraitaken.shtml|title=Government forces take Vakarai|date=19 January 2007|work=BBC News|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sri Lanka Police|Police]] [[Special Task Force]] launched an operation code named &quot;[[Operation Definite Victory|Definite Victory]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vakarai&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20070130_01|title=Two more LTTE camps fall to STF - Kangikadaichi Aru |date=2 February 2007|publisher=Ministry of Defence of Sri Lanka|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; through which the Sri Lankan military captured several LTTE bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;definite victory&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/16/asia/AS-GEN-Sri-Lanka-Torture-Chambers.php|title=Sri Lankan military says rebels' torture chambers found, rebels deny|date=15 January 2007|work=The Associated Press|publisher=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE was eventually restricted to the Thoppigala area, which had become its last stronghold in the Eastern Province,&lt;ref name=&quot;act two&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.lk/2007/07/01/newsfe1.htm|title=Eelam War IV: Act Two|last=Senpathi|date=7 January 2007|work=The Nation|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 11 April 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;LTTE restricted to thoppigala&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2007/04/13/fea02.asp|title=Hope-filled New Year dawns for Eastern residents freed from LTTE tyranny |last=Wijayapala|first=Ranil|date=13 April 2007|work=Daily News|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest LTTE bases in the eastern province was located in the Thoppigala area.&lt;ref name=&quot;largest bases&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/aditi-phadnis-guerilla-in-retreat/00/09/346928/|title=Guerilla in retreat|last=Phadnis|first=Aditi |date=24 January 2009|publisher=Business Standard|accessdate=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==

On 27 February 2007, the LTTE launched an [[artillery]] attack on [[Batticaloa]] targeting two helicopters carrying foreign [[diplomat]]s. The ambassadors of the [[United States]], [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] were injured in this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2007/20070228/world.htm#1|title=US, Italian, German envoys hurt in LTTE attack |date=27 February 2007|work=Reuters|publisher=The Tribune|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE later announced that they were not aware of the diplomats arriving at Batticaloa, and accused the government of not informing them. The LTTE also accused that the Sri Lankan military had used the targeted location to launch provocative artillery attacks earlier on the same day. In response to this, a government spokesman said that &quot;Everyone knew that foreign diplomats were visiting the area today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/02/28/2003350367|title=German, Italian and US ambassadors injured in Sri Lanka|date=28 February 2007|work=AFP|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sri Lanka Air Force later bombed the Thoppigala area, which the military said was used to organize the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2007/02/28/103463/Ambassadors-injured.htm|title=Ambassadors injured in Sri Lanka shelling|last=Jayasinghe |first=Amal |date=28 February 2007|work=AFP|publisher=The China Post|accessdate=14 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoppigala was isolated and cut off from reinforcements after the Sri Lanka Army captured several LTTE bases around it.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyond consolidation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saag.org/common/uploaded_files/note376.html|title=Sri Lanka: Looking beyond consolidation |last=Hariharan|first=R |date=3 April 2007|publisher=South Asia Analysis Group|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army captured the Unnachchi tank, LTTE bases at Vavunathivu and Kohombagasthalawa, {{convert|33|km|mi}} of the A5 road and the road leading to Thoppigala by 11 April 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuwan Tharanga&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/03/16/mag04.asp|title=Corporal Nuwan Tharanga: Fallen Hero At Thoppigala|date=16 March 2008 |publisher=Sunday Observer|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lanka Army announced that they had launched a military operation to capture Thoppigala on 14 April 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;army overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.lk/operations01.php?take=65|title=Thoppigala Final Operation|date=12 July 2007|publisher=Sri Lanka Army|accessdate=9 February 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (Sri Lanka)|LRRP]] units from the [[Sri Lanka Army Commando Regiment|Army Commando Regiment]] were used extensively in this operation, making it the first operation in the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] where such deep penetration units were used in a large scale. Four eight member teams from the Zulu Company of the 3 Commando Regiment were deployed to eliminate LTTE leaders and disrupt supplies and communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;showdown&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.lk/2007/07/22/militarym.htm|title=How Thoppigala fell like nine pins|last= Fernando|first=Santhush|date=22 July 2007|work=The Nation|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SLA estimated around 1,000 LTTE cadres were fighting in the area in a network of trenches and tunnels.

During the period of 8â9 June 2007, Sri Lankan army captured 4 LTTE military bases at Ibbanvila, Akkarathivu (Egodadoova), Mawadi-ode (Mahavaedi-oda), and Veppanveli (Kohomba-vaella) in Pankudavaella North, and Naarakmulla, South of the Thoppigala area. During the confrontation, around 30 LTTE cadres and 1 SLA personnel died. The SLA captured 6 Multi Purpose Machine Guns (MPMG), 21 T-56 assault riffles, 4 Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) launchers, and a large quantity of Anti Personnel (AP) mines and Ammunitions.

On 19 June 2007, 3 LTTE satellite camps East of Narakkamulla in the Thoppigala area were completely destroyed by the SLA. As per military sources around 25-30 LTTE were killed and a large quantity of anti-personnel mines (APM's) and other military quipment were captured.

==Battle==
Fierce fighting erupted between the LTTE and the SLA at the final forward defence line (FDL) of LTTE, at their Beirut complex in Narakamulla, Thoppigala area between 22â24 June 2007. The FDL was fortified with 6 bunker lines and 3 minor camps. The LTTE did not vacate their positions due to SLA's heavy barrage of artillery and tank gun fire. Finally, around 50 SLA commando's infiltrated the LTTE bunkers and killed 30 of them. Three LTTE cadres committed suicide. This series of events turned the tide of the battle of Thoppogala against the LTTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baron's cap battle-2007-06-09&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | title = Sri Lanka says 33 Tigers die in battle  | publisher = Reuters | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKCOL2375920070609  | accessdate = 9 June 2007 | date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fierce battle North of Narakamulla, in the Thoppigala area on 6 July 2007 morning, killed 6 Sri Lankan army personnel including an officer called Colonel Samantha Ranathunga, and injured 7, due to heavy mortar fire by the LTTE. The Sri Lankan military retaliated with artillery and aerial bombardment to control the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baron's cap battle-2007-07-06&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

After 13 years, the Sri Lankan military captured the final strong hold of LTTE in the East, Thoppigala (Baron's Cap), on the morning of 11 July 2007, nearly after a year of military action. According to the country's military history, the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), with around 20,000 soldiers attacked this area in the year 1988 but failed to capture the area (at that time LTTE was led by Colonel Karuna). In 1994 the SLA withdrew their military bases from this area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baron's cap battle-2007-07-11&quot;&gt;
