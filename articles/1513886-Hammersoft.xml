The '''University of WisconsinâGreen Bay''' (also known as '''UWâGreen Bay''', '''UWGB''' or '''GB''') is a public university located in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States|USA]]. It is part of the [[University of Wisconsin System]] and offers both bachelor and master degrees.

UWâGreen Bay, founded in 1965, originally had an environmental sustainability emphasis, and now offers a wide array of degrees.  The university, unofficially, has the nickname &quot;Eco U&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwgb.edu/univcomm/about-campus/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The university's mascot is the [[UWâGreen Bay Phoenix|Phoenix]].

==History==
By 1958, the [[University of Wisconsin-Extension]]'s Green Bay center had swollen to 500 students, and was the second-largest of UW-Extension's eight freshman-sophomore centers.  It grew to become the largest by 1965.  Demand soon grew for a full-fledged four-year campus serving northeastern Wisconsin.  Rudy Small, a vice president of the Paper Converting Machine Company, and Jake Rose, president of Kellogg Bank, took the lead in pushing for a new university in the region.  In 1963, the Coordinating Committee for Higher Education unanimously recommended building a new university in the Fox Valley.  However, [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] [[Warren Knowles]] was somewhat cool to the idea.  Eventually, he compromised by proposing that the freshman-sophomore campuses in Green Bay and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]] be expanded to four-year institutions (the Kenosha institution eventually became the [[University of Wisconsin-Parkside]]).  The bill was signed into law on September 2, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwgb.edu/univcomm/GBhistory/FTBframes/chapt2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

UW-Green Bay officially came into being in the fall of 1968, with the first classes being held at the Deckner Center, home to the old Green Bay extension center. It moved to its current location in the fall of 1969. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwgb.edu/univcomm/about-campus/history2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==

In 2011, student enrollment was approximately 6,600, including 6,389 undergraduate students. The freshman average ACT score was 22.9, with a high school GPA of 3.32. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwgb.edu/admissions/explore/quickfacts.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2011, the official head count was 6,665. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwgb.edu/oira/enrollment&lt;/ref&gt;

UWâGreen Bay, which brands itself athletically as &quot;Green Bay&quot;, is an NCAA Division I school, and is a member of the [[Horizon League]].

The Green Bay women's basketball team has won or tied for the Horizon League regular-season championship nine times, including the last eight years.[http://horizonleague.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/110504aac.html] They have been to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA]] tournament eight times, including four of the last five years. They have also made two appearances in the [[Women's National Invitation Tournament]] (WNIT).

The team received its first national ranking in 2003, when it was ranked as high as #16 in both the [[Associated Press]] poll and the [[Coaches' Poll]]. In 2005, they also received a national ranking and a bid to the NCAA Tournament, but were knocked out in the first round by [[Maryland Terrapins women's basketball|Maryland]]. In 2006, they appeared in the WNIT, where they lost to [[Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball|Iowa State]] in a first-round game. The next season, they were seeded #9 in the NCAA Tournament and defeated [[New Mexico Lobos women's basketball|New Mexico]] in the first round before falling to top-seeded [[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|Connecticut]] in the second round.  That loss ended their school record and nation-leading 26-game winning streak.

The next NCAA Tournament win for the Phoenix women came in 2010, when they entered as a #12 seed and upset 5-seed [[Virginia Cavaliers|Virginia]] in the first round before bowing out to Iowa State on [[Hilton Coliseum|the Cyclones' home court]] just short of the Sweet 16. In the 2011 tournament, they entered as a #5 seed and made their first Sweet Sixteen appearance, defeating [[ArkansasâLittle Rock Trojans|ArkansasâLittle Rock]] and [[Michigan State Spartans women's basketball|Michigan State]] before losing to regional top seed [[2010â11 Baylor Lady Bears basketball team|Baylor]].

The Green Bay softball team claimed its first Horizon League tournament championship in 2005 after being picked to finish last in the conference. They went on to the national tournament, where they defeated #6 seed [[Oregon State Beavers|Oregon State]] in the first round.
