The '''2005 Texas vs. Texas A&amp;M football game''', played November 25, 2005, was the 112th meeting between [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in a [[college football]] game. Texas came into the game ranked number&amp;nbsp;2 in the nation while Texas A&amp;M was unranked.

It was the eleventh&amp;nbsp;game of the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 season]] and the final regular-season game for both teams. Texas had a 10-win, 0-loss record and Texas A&amp;M was 5&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;5. For Texas, a win would make them sole winner of the Big 12 South division and they would go on to play in the [[Big 12 Conference Championship]]. With a loss, they still would play for the conference championship but it would have jeopardized their goal of ultimately playing in the [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|BCS National Championship Game]]. The Aggies needed a win to have a winning record on the season and to be [[bowl eligible]].

The [[2005 Texas Longhorn football team]] (variously &quot;Texas&quot; or &quot;UT&quot; or the &quot;Horns&quot;) was coached by head football coach [[Mack Brown]] and led on the field by [[quarterback]] [[Vince Young]]. The [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M Aggies]] (variously &quot;Texas A&amp;M&quot; or &quot;A&amp;M&quot; or the &quot;Aggies&quot;) were coached by [[Dennis Franchione]].  [[Stephen McGee]] led the Aggies as quarterback due to an injury to starting-quarterback [[Reggie McNeal]].

The game drew a stadium crowd of 86,616 and the game was televised nationally on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The contest was a back-and-forth affair which was ultimately won by Texas, 40â29.   Although Texas won, it turned out to be the poorest performance of the season by the Longhorns, both [[Offense (sports)|offensively]] and [[Offense (sports)|defensively]]; the game also damaged the [[Heisman Trophy]] hopes of Vince Young.  For Texas A&amp;M, the loss capped a 5-6 losing season and made them ineligible for a post-season bowl.

==Lone Star Showdown==
{{main|Lone Star Showdown}}
This game marked the 112th&amp;nbsp;meeting between Texas and the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies]] and the annual football game is part of a multi-sport rivalry called the [[Lone Star Showdown]].

It was the eleventh&amp;nbsp;game of the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 season]] and the final regular-season game for both teams. Texas came into the game with a 10âwin, 0âloss record and Texas A&amp;M was 5&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;5. For Texas, a win would make them sole winner of the Big 12 South division and they would go on to play in the [[Big 12 Conference Championship]].

The game was played at the Texas A&amp;M campus in [[College Station]].

==First quarter==

{{See also|American football rules|American football positions|American football strategy|Glossary of American football}}
UT won the [[coin flipping|coin toss]] and decided to [[kickoff (American football)|kick off]]. The Aggies took a [[touchback]] and started on their own 20&amp;nbsp;[[Glossary of American football#Y|yard line]]. Stephen McGee kept the ball himself for an eight&amp;nbsp;yard gain on [[first down]]; he followed this with a ten&amp;nbsp;yard gain on [[Glossary of American football#S|second down]]. The next two plays were also [[rush (American football)|running plays]]: two&amp;nbsp;yards by [[Jorvorskie Lane]] and ten&amp;nbsp;yards by [[Courtney Lewis]], to bring the ball to mid-field. Lane rushed again for six&amp;nbsp;yards followed by a ten&amp;nbsp;yard run by Lewis. On 2nd&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;four on the UT 44&amp;nbsp;yard line McGee attempted his first [[forward pass|pass]] ([[Glossary of American football#I|intended]] for [[DeQwan Mobley]]) but it was [[incomplete pass|incomplete]]. Both teams were called with [[Glossary of American football#P|personal foul penalties]] on the play. McGee threw another pass and an A&amp;M [[American football rules#Fouls and their penalties|penalty]] was declined by Texas to bring up [[Glossary of American football#F|fourth down]] fourth&amp;nbsp;down.  [[Justin Brantly]]'s [[Punt (football)|punt]] went into the [[end zone]] for a touchback.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

The Longhorns began their drive with a two&amp;nbsp;yard rush by Vince Young. He followed this with a 24&amp;nbsp;yard pass to tight end [[David Thomas (American football)|David Thomas]].  [[Ramonce Taylor]] then lost two yards on a running play and Vince Young made five&amp;nbsp;yards on 2nd&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;twelve. One 3rd&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;seven, Young's pass to [[Billy Pittman]] fell incomplete. This led to [[Richmond McGee]] punting the ball to the Texas A&amp;M 13&amp;nbsp;where [[Todd Pegram]] made a fair catch. On A&amp;M's second&amp;nbsp;possession McGee rushed twice (-4&amp;nbsp;yards, +2&amp;nbsp;yards) then threw an [[interception]] to UT's [[Drew Kelson]]. Young's first&amp;nbsp;down pass to Billy Pittman was incomplete. Ramonce Taylor rushed for five&amp;nbsp;yards to the A&amp;M 12 and a penalty against the Aggies moved the ball to the eight&amp;nbsp;yard line.  [[Henry Melton]] punched in the [[touchdown]] and the [[extra point]] by [[David Pino]] gave Texas a seven&amp;nbsp;point lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

The Aggies were not able to gain a first&amp;nbsp;down and after their punt the Longhorns had the ball around mid-field. They mounted a seven&amp;nbsp;play, 48&amp;nbsp;yard drive culminating in a five&amp;nbsp;yard Ramonce Taylor touchdown run. Texas A&amp;M answered with a scoring drive of their own: 12&amp;nbsp;plays, 67&amp;nbsp;yards, and three&amp;nbsp;points from a Todd Pegram [[field goal (football)|field goal]]. This made the score Texas 14, Texas A&amp;M 3.

Texas got the ball on their own 35 and Vince Young immediately through a pass that was picked off my [[Melvin Bullitt]] near mid-field, with a return to the UT 35. Texas A&amp;M ran a [[trick play]] by having [[running back]] Jorvorsky Lane throw the ball to Jason Carter for a touchdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP recap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;  According to the [[Associated Press]], the touchdown &quot;whipped the crowd of 86,617 into a frenzy as the Aggie fans waved their white [[Traditions of Texas A&amp;M University#12th man towel|12th Man Towels]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP recap&quot;/&gt;  They tried to follow this by a trick [[two-point conversion]] but Todd Pegram's pass was intercepted by UT's [[Brian Robison]] to leave the score at UT 14, TAMU 9. Texas got the ball at their 33 and ran only one play for a slight loss before time expired in the first quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

==Second quarter==
Beginning the second quarter with 2nd&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;13 at his own team's 30&amp;nbsp;yard line, Vince Young threw one incomplete pass to [[Quan Cosby]] and then a 21&amp;nbsp;yard [[Glossary of American football#C|completion]], also to Cosby. Billy Pittman ran for nine&amp;nbsp;yards and this was followed by a six&amp;nbsp;yard loss by Ramonce Taylor. On third&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;seven Vince Young was unable to connect with Limas Sweed and so Richmond McGee came in to punt again. Texas A&amp;M got the ball on their 15&amp;nbsp;yard line and advanced the 85&amp;nbsp;yards in seven&amp;nbsp;plays and just under four&amp;nbsp;minutes of game clock. They scored on a [[Brandon Leone]] touchdown run but the attempt by Jorvorskie Lane at rushing for the two point conversion failed and the resulting score was Texas 14, Texas A&amp;M 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

An [[Unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty against Brandon Leone and a 21&amp;nbsp;yard return by Ramonce Taylor gave the Longhorns good field position at their own 46&amp;nbsp;yard line, but Jamaal Charles immediately gave the ball up to the Aggies on a [[fumble]]. The Texas defense sacked McGee on the next series and the Aggies were unable to gain sufficient yardage for a first&amp;nbsp;down so they punted the ball away. This time, Texas moved the ball quickly; they advanced 77&amp;nbsp;yards in just seven&amp;nbsp;plays and less than three&amp;nbsp;minutes. Their touchdown and extra point made the score UT 21, A&amp;M 15. The Aggies drove back to the UT 34 and attempted a field goal but it fell short of the [[goal posts]]. The Longhorns were able to run two plays (an incomplete pass and a sack of Vince Young) before time expired in the half.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt; The score at half time was Texas 21, Texas A&amp;M 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longhorns stay perfect&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/11/28/TopStories/Longhorns.Stay.Perfect-1113950.shtml | title=Longhorns stay perfect - Texas improves to 11-0 on the season despite an ugly win over Texas A&amp;M Friday | publisher=The Daily Texan | author=Ransom, Eric | date=November 28, 2005 | accessdate=2007-06-19|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928003514/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/11/28/TopStories/Longhorns.Stay.Perfect-1113950.shtml |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

==Third quarter==
UT got the ball to start the second half; according to ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', the quarter started out &quot;like a nightmare&quot; for the Longhorns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longhorns stay perfect&quot;/&gt;  On their third&amp;nbsp;play, Vince Young was [[quarterback sack|sacked]] and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by A&amp;M. Stephen McGee kept the ball himself for two&amp;nbsp;straight rushing plays and a touchdown. The extra point gave the Aggies the lead again: 22â21.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

Young threw two&amp;nbsp;short pass completions to Limas Sweed and Texas was able to reach midfield. Henry Melton was just inches short of converting a third-and-three situation and the team faced fourth&amp;nbsp;down. Brown called a fake punt and the snap went to linebacker [[Rashad Bobino]]. Bobino rushed six yards straight up the middle to keep the drive alive, and a [[Glossary of American football#F|face mask penalty]] against the Aggies tacked on more yardage to put the ball at the A&amp;M 23-yard line. Speaking of the fake punt, Brown said, &quot;We prepared that each week. But we've been running the ball and moving the ball so well that we haven't used it [previously in the season].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Longhorns stay perfect&quot;/&gt;  On first down, Young threw a nine-yard completion to receiver Quan Cosby. This led to a Ramonce Taylor touchdown 10&amp;nbsp;plays, 80&amp;nbsp;yards, 4:21&amp;nbsp;minutes after the drive began.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;  After the extra point the Horns were leading 28-22.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longhorns stay perfect&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

Texas A&amp;M was not able to get a first down so they attempted to punt; but [[Justin Brantley]]'s kick was blocked by [[Cedric Griffin]] and he ran it the eleven&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP recap&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200511250084 | title=(2) Texas 40, Texas A&amp;M 29 | agency=Associated Press | author=Vertuno, Jim | date=November 25, 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;  The extra point was [[Glossary of American football#N|no good]], so the score was Texas 34, Texas A&amp;M 22. A&amp;M came right back with an eight&amp;nbsp;play drive to make it a five&amp;nbsp;point game; the third&amp;nbsp;quarter ended with the Longhorns on offense and the score at 34â29 in favor of the Longhorns.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

==Fourth quarter==
Texas settled for a field goal to start the fourth&amp;nbsp;quarter. This extended their lead to eight&amp;nbsp;points. The Aggies mounted another long drive (9&amp;nbsp;plays, 67&amp;nbsp;yards, 05:13 in time of possession) and advanced to the UT 10 but McGee fumbled the ball over to Texas.    Texas drove the ball to their 45&amp;nbsp;yard line but their drive stalled and they punted the ball. A&amp;M's Carpenter fumbled and UT took over at the A&amp;M 23. They were only able to advance to the 16&amp;nbsp;yard line and then they attempted a field goal; but Pino's kick was [[Glossary of American football#|wide right]] and the Aggies got the ball back on their 20. Their drive resulted in a punt back to Texas. The Horns moved down to the A&amp;M 12&amp;nbsp;before again being stopped by the Aggie defense. Once again they sent in David Pino for a field goal and this time the kick was good, making the score Texas 40, Texas A&amp;M 29 with 2:22 left in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

The Aggies got the ball on their 23 and made it as far as the 30 before being pushed back to their 28. They [[Glossary of American football#T|turned the ball over on downs]]. Texas [[Glossary of American football#T|took a knee]] three times to end the game. The final score was Texas 40, Texas A&amp;M 29.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt;

==Analysis==
The game was the poorest performance of the season by the Longhorns, both offensively and defensively. On offense, Vince Young had only 162&amp;nbsp;yards of offense, his lowest output of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;aTm-box&quot;/&gt; The Associated Press remarked on the poor performance and said that Young, considered one of the nation's best quarterbacks and a [[Heisman trophy]] candidate coming into the game, was not even the best quarterback on the field that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP recap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/games/2005-11-25-texas-am_x.htm | title=Young held in check, but Texas checkmates Aggies | author=Vertuno, Jim | agency=Associated Press | date=November 25, 2005 | accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Daily Texan'' predicted that the game could hurt Young's chances for the Heisman, but they also quoted UT head coach [[Mack Brown]] as saying &quot;Looking at the numbers from what [[Reggie Bush]] did last week and Vince did today, Reggie probably leads, but next week, Vince plays at noon, and Reggie at 3, so I think voters will wait and watch to see what happens.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas eye's openned&quot;/&gt;

UT running backs Henry Melton and Ramonce Taylor also came in for criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas eye's openned&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas focuses&quot;/&gt;  Taylor was criticized for running backwards and sideways in an effort to gain yards, instead of moving ahead and breaking tackles. ''The Daily Texan'' observed &quot;Five of Taylor's 15 carries resulted in a loss or no gain for a total of minus-17&amp;nbsp;yards. However, the other 10 carries totaled 119&amp;nbsp;yards for an average of 11.9&amp;nbsp;yards per positive running play.

The Longhorns' penultimate victory of the season, in the [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]], featured the biggest margin of victory in the history of that contest. Their ultimate victory in the 2006 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] against the [[University of Southern California]] [[2005 USC Trojans football team|Trojans]] for the national championship, as well as their overall season, have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by publications such as ''[[College Football News]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;10 greatest&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cfn.scout.com/2/564658.html | title=Tuesday Question - Ten Greatest Bowl Games | date=September 5, 2006 | publisher=College Football News | author=Cirminiello, Richard and Harris, John | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFB best ever&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiutak, Pete | url=http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2006/TQ/Rose_Best.htm | title=Was the 2006 Rose Bowl the best college football game ever? | publisher=College Football News | date=10 January 2006 | accessdate=2006-10-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060616201851/http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2006/TQ/Rose_Best.htm  |archivedate = 2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CCFN&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiutak, Pete | url=http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Almanac/CFN_Formula/CFN_FormulaAllTime.htm |title=Formula and Calculations for All-Time Greatest Football Teams | publisher=College Football News | accessdate=2006-06-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060614161713/http://www.collegefootballnews.com/Almanac/CFN_Formula/CFN_FormulaAllTime.htm  |archivedate = 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;grand&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/sportscolumns/entries/2006/01/06/rose_bowl_a_gra.html | title=BCS enjoys 'grand cresendo' | publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution | author=Furman Bisher | date=2006-01-06 | accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scout.com'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Scouts best&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://louisianastate.scout.com/2/596414.html | title=Is the bloom off the Rose? |  author=Defresne, Chris | publisher=Scouts.com | date=December 1, 2006 | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;YoungNite&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Murphy, Austin | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/preview/siexclusive/2006/pr/subs/siexclusive/01/05/cf.bcs0109/ | title=The Night is Young's | publisher=Sports Illustrated | date=5 January 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Longhorns and the Trojans were together awarded the 2006&amp;nbsp;[[ESPY Award]] by [[ESPN]] for the &quot;Best Game&quot; in any sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;TexasTrifecta&quot;&gt;Fisher, Gerren LaQuint{{Cite news | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/07/14/Sports/Texas.Snags.Espy.Trifecta-2131713.shtml?norewrite200607252146&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com | title=Texas snags ESPY trifecta - 2006 Rose Bowl voted Best Game of the year, Vince gets Best Championship Performance | publisher=The Daily Texan | date=14 July 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-25 | author=Fisher, Gerren LaQuint|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928003440/http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/07/14/Sports/Texas.Snags.Espy.Trifecta-2131713.shtml?norewrite200607252146&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Longhorns finished the season as the only unbeaten team, with 13 wins and zero losses overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Win/Loss&gt;College football team records are conventionally expressed in number of wins/losses. 13-0&amp;nbsp;means 13&amp;nbsp;wins and zero losses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Big12_standings&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/doc_lib/06_records_3_big12.pdf | format = PDF | title=All Time Big-12 Standings | work = MackBrownTexasFootball.com | accessdate=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UT set numerous school and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] records, including most points scored in a season (652). After the season ended, six&amp;nbsp;Longhorns from this championship team were selected by [[National Football League|professional football teams]] in the [[2006 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NFL-draft&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nfl.com/draft/drafttracker/school/TX | title=Draft Tracker - Texas | work=NFL.com - Official website of the NFL | date=30 April 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060708171702/http://www.nfl.com/draft/drafttracker/school/TX  |archivedate = 2006-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the loss, the Aggies ended up with a losing record for the regular season and consequently they were not [[bowl eligible]]. That meant that this game concluded the season for Texas A&amp;M.
