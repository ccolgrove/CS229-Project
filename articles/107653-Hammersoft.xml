== Landmarks ==
*'''[[Lomita Railroad Museum]]''', Opened in 1966 by Irene Lewis, the Lomita Railroad Museum is a small museum in Lomita devoted to the steam engine period of Railroading. Mrs Lewis, along with her husband Martin, operated &quot;Little Engines of Lomita&quot; which sold kits for live steam engine locomotives. Her engines also appeared in movies, including &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)&quot; and &quot;Von Ryans Express (1965)&quot;. This operation inspired Mrs. Lewis to earn a mechanical engineering degree late in life and to build the museum as a showplace for her products. When built, the museum was the first of its kind  west of Denver. The museum was designed to replicate the Boston &amp; Maine's Greenwood Station in Wakefield, Massachusetts. The Museum was donated by Mrs. Lewis to the City of Lomita in honor of her late husband, Martin Lewis, in 1967. On display are a 1902 Baldwin Locomotive, a Southern Pacific tender, a 1910 Union Pacific caboose, and a Santa Fe caboose. The Museum also houses a full-size replica of a 1920s water tower that was constructed in 2000. The museum also incorporates a small public park, which accommodates a Union Pacific boxcar and a Union Oil tank car. The Museum is open Thursday through Sunday.
