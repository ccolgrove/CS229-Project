'''reddit''' (pronounced {{IPA-en|ËrÉdÉªt|}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatdoesthenameredditmean |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What does the name &quot;reddit&quot; mean? |publisher=reddit |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[social news]] website where the registered users submit content, in the form of either a link or a text &quot;self&quot; post.  Other users then vote the submission &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down,&quot; which is used to rank the post and determine its position on the site's pages and front page.

Reddit was originally founded by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian. It was acquired by [[CondÃ© Nast Publications]] in October 2006. In September 2011, Reddit was split from CondÃ© Nast, and now operates as a subsidiary of CondÃ© Nast's parent company, [[Advance Publications]].

== Overview ==
Registered users (also referred to as ''redditors'') may subscribe to individual reddits (called &quot;subreddits&quot; informally, but &quot;reddits&quot; officially) {{emdash}} communities created around specific areas of interest {{emdash}} to customize the content that appears on their front page, or subscribe to no individual reddits and have a general front page displayed; however as of October 18, 2011, the general front page was archived&lt;ref name=&quot;reddit1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2011/10/saying-goodbye-to-old-friend-and.html |title=Saying Goodbye To An Old Friend}}&lt;/ref&gt; owing to a changing community.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutcomReview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webtrends.about.com/od/reddit/gr/reddit_review.htm |title=A Review of Reddit |last=Nations |first=Daniel |work=About.com: Web Trends |accessdate=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianInnovations&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Richard | title = reddit.com | publisher = The Guardian | date = 2005-12-08 | url = http://technology.guardian.co.uk/innovations/story/0,,1660870,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url = http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Individualreddits |title=Reddit FAQ | accessdate = 2010-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reddit FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatarereddits |title=reddit.com: help |accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Front page rank, for both the general front page and for individual reddits, is determined by the age of the submission, positive (&quot;upvoted&quot;) to negative (&quot;downvoted&quot;) feedback ratio and the total vote count.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEOmoz&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seomoz.org/blog/reddit-stumbleupon-delicious-and-hacker-news-algorithms-exposed|title=reddit algorithm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of submissions cycle through these front pages daily. 

Users submit content via links or with &quot;self&quot; posts that contain user-generated text. Other users may then vote the post &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down,&quot; with the most successful posts gaining prominence by reaching the site's front page or the front page of individual reddits, through the ranking process described above. Users may also comment on the posted links or &quot;self&quot; posts and reply to other commentators, much like an online forum or discussion group. Unlike typical forums, however, comments can also be &quot;upvoted&quot; or &quot;downvoted&quot; by other users. Comment votes do not affect the main article's rank, but when the &quot;comments&quot; link is clicked from a front page, only the most popular comments are shown according to the default comment preference view (which can be changed to list comments in other forms of ascension). The user must click an additional link or change preferences to see all comments.

{{As of|June 2011}}, commentary on the site is particularly active, often running into the hundreds on some submissions. Popular comments have generated many [[memes]] within the reddit community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/reddit |title=Reddit |publisher=Know Your Meme |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== reddits ===
Any registered user may create a subreddit, although a link to do so does not appear on the user's homepage until after thirty days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Re: Can I make my own subreddit? |url=http://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/hmddo/can_i_make_my_own_subreddit/c1wlqgu |date=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 67,000 subreddits to peruse, with the default set being (as of October 18th 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;reddit1&quot;/&gt;):

Users may customize what is shown on their personal front page by subscribing to individual reddits through a page that shows all reddits available {{emdash}} http://www.reddit.com/reddits/ . The site's general front page is also accessible via a link to &quot;all&quot; at the top of the individual user's customised front page.

=== Reddit meet ups ===
The Reddit community has been known to socialise at local parks and bars around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/meetup/ |title=&quot;Reddit Worldwide Meetups&quot; |publisher=Reddit.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many localised reddits for local meetings.

== History ==
&lt;!--&gt;[[Image:Steve Huffman.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Huffman]]&lt;!--&gt;
Reddit was founded in June 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macale|first=Sherilynn &quot;Cheri&quot;|title=A rundown of Redditâs history and community|url=http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/10/14/a-rundown-of-reddits-history-and-community-infographic/|work=The Next Web Social Media|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, both 22-year-old graduates of the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TheGuardianInnovations&quot; /&gt; It received its initial funding from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]]. The team expanded to include Christopher Slowe in 2005. [[Aaron Swartz]] joined in late January 2006 as part of the company's merger with Swartz's Infogami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://infogami.com/blog/introduction|title= Introducing Infogami
| last=Swartz | first=Aaron | authorlink=Aaron Swartz| publisher=Infogami | date=February 27, 2006 | accessdate= 2007-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CondÃ© Nast Publications]], owner of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', acquired Reddit on October 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/10/31/breaking-news-conde-nastwired-acquires-reddit/ | title = Breaking news: CondÃ© Nast/Wired Acquires reddit | publisher = [[TechCrunch]]|date=October 31, 2006|accessdate= 2007-01-06 | last=Arrington | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Arrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Swartz was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-05-07-n78.html |title=A Chat with Aaron Swartz |publisher=Blogoscoped.com |date=May 7, 2007 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open source ===
On June 18, 2008, Reddit became an [[open source]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=steve [spez] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2008/06/reddit-goes-open-source.html |title=reddit goes open source |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the anti-spam/cheating portions, all of the code and libraries written for Reddit became freely available on [[Github]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki |title=Reddit Github |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===
By the end of 2008, the team had grown to include Erik Martin, Jeremy Edberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=alexis [kn0thing] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2007/03/welcome-jedberg.html |title=welcome, jedberg |publisher=blog.reddit |date=March 20, 2007 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; David King,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=alexis [kn0thing] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2008/04/welcome-david.html |title=welcome, david |publisher=blog.reddit |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mike Schiraldi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=alexis [kn0thing] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2008/12/welcome-mike.html |title=Welcome, Mike Schiraldi (a.k.a. raldi) |publisher=blog.reddit |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Huffman and Ohanian moved on to form Hipmunk, recruiting Slowe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kincaid |first=Jason |url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/01/reddit-chief-takes-flight-to-hipmunk-explains-why-hes-leaving-now/ |title=Reddit Chief Takes Flight To Hipmunk, Explains Why Heâs Leaving Now |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=November 1, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and King &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.hipmunk.com/post/6493894847/welcome-ketralnis |title=Welcome, Ketralnis! |publisher=Blog.hipmunk.com |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly thereafter.

=== Reddit Gold ===
In July 2010, facing severe underfunding despite explosive traffic growth, Reddit introduced Reddit Gold, offering new features for a price of [[US$]]3.99/month or US$29.99/year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by mike [raldi] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2010/07/three-new-features-for-reddit-gold.html |title=what's new on reddit: Three new features for reddit gold: Choose-your-own ads, Userpage sorting, and Friends with Benefits |publisher=blog.reddit |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue and attention got them approval to buy more servers and employ more people.

=== Independence ===
On September 6, 2011, Reddit became operationally independent of CondÃ© Nast, now operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, [[Advance Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/independence.html|title=blog.reddit -- what's new online: Independence|accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==

According to Google [[DoubleClick]] Ad Planner's estimate, the median U.S. Reddit user is male, 35-44 years of age, has some college education, and is making a middle-range income of $25,000 - $49,000 USD. The analysis also shows that the top audience interests of the site are development tools, scripting languages, and C and C++, suggesting a computer savvy demographic and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/adplanner/site_profile?#siteDetails?identifier=reddit.com&amp;geo=US&amp;trait_type=1&amp;lp=false|title=DoubleClick Ad Planner by Google|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &quot;Restoring Truthiness&quot; Campaign ==
In September 2010, Reddit users started a movement to persuade [[Stephen Colbert]] to have a rally in Washington DC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colbert Rally&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedman |first=Megan |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/14/reddit-campaign-for-colbert-rally-breaks-charity-records/ |title=Reddit Campaign for Colbert Rally Breaks Donation Record |publisher=Time NewsFeed |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was started by user mrsammercer, in a post where he describes waking up from a dream in which Stephen Colbert holds a satirical rally in D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mrsammercer |url=http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d7ntl/ive_had_a_vision_and_i_cant_shake_it_colbert/ |title=I've had a vision and I can't shake it: Colbert needs to hold a satirical rally in DC |publisher=Reddit.com |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He writes, &quot;This would be the high water mark of American satire. Half a million people pretending to suspend all rational thought in unison. Perfect harmony. It'll feel like San Francisco in the late 60s, only we won't be able to get any acid.&quot;

The idea resonated with the Reddit community, which launched a campaign to bring the event to life. Over $600,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/viewChallenge.html?id=39361 |title=Restoring Truthiness donor page |publisher=Donorschoose.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was raised for charity to gain the attention of Colbert. The campaign was mentioned on-air several times, and when the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]] was held in Washington, D.C. on October 30, 2010, thousands of redditors made the journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiraldi |first=Mike |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2010/11/buy-shirts-remember-rally-question.html |title=Buy Shirts, Remember the Rally, Question Colbert, and Smile |publisher=blog.reddit |date=November 12, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a post-rally press conference, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian asked, &quot;What role did the Internet campaign play in convincing you to hold this rally?&quot; Jon Stewart responded by saying that, though it was a very nice gesture, the two had already thought of the idea prior and the deposit on using the National Mall was already paid during the summer, so it acted mostly as a &quot;validation of what we were thinking about attempting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-and-stephen-colbert-hold-post-rally-to-restore-sanity-press-conference/ Rally to Restore Sanity - Press Conference - Video] [[Mediaite]]. October 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In a message to the reddit community, Colbert later added, &quot;I have no doubt that your efforts to organize and the joy you clearly brought to your part of the story contributed greatly to the turnout and success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ee20j/stephen_colbert_has_answered_your_questions/ |title=Stephen Colbert has answered your questions : IAmA |publisher=Reddit.com |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Reddit was originally written in [[Common Lisp]] but was rewritten in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=steve [spez] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2005/12/on-lisp.html |title=&quot;On lisp&quot; blog post by Reddit founder &quot;spez,&quot; detailing the reasons for switching to python from lisp |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=2005-12-05 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given for the switch were faster performance, wider access to [[Library (computing)|code libraries]], and greater development flexibility. The Python web framework that former Reddit employee [[Aaron Swartz]] developed to run the site, ''web.py'', is now available as an open-source project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpy.org/ |title=Official web.py site |publisher=Webpy.org |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddit currently uses [[Pylons (web framework)|Pylons]] as its web framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.pylonshq.com/display/pylonscommunity/Sites+Using+Pylons Sites Using Pylons] - Pylons Community&amp;nbsp;â PythonWeb&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|November 2009}}, Reddit has decommissioned their physical servers and migrated to [[Amazon Web Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jeremy [jedberg] |url=http://blog.reddit.com/2009/11/moving-to-cloud.html |title=Moving to the cloud |publisher=Blog.reddit.com |date=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reddit uses [[PostgreSQL]] as primary datastore and slowly moving to [[Apache Cassandra]], a column oriented datastore.  It uses [[RabbitMQ]] for offline processing, HAProxy for load balancing and memcached for caching.
In early 2009, Reddit started using [[jQuery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.reddit.com/2009/01/reddit-now-powered-by-jquery.html what's new on reddit: reddit now powered by jQuery] - Posted by Chris Slowe (keysersosa) (Friday, January 30, 2009) - blog.reddit&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile web ===
On June 7, 2010, Reddit staff launched a revamped mobile interface featuring rewritten [[CSS]], a new color scheme, and a multitude of improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2010/06/better-mobile-reddit-for-all.html |title=A better mobile reddit for all |publisher=[[reddit.com]] |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Client interface applications ===
There are several unofficial applications that use the Reddit [[API]], including ''reddit is fun'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.andrewshu.android.reddit |title=reddit is fun - Android Application on the Android market |publisher=Appbrain.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Andreddit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.tomdryer.reddit |title=Download andreddit for your Android phone on AppBrain |publisher=Appbrain.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; F5, BaconReader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baconreader.com/ |title=a tasty new reddit app |publisher=baconreader |date= |accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Android tablet specific application called Reddita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.leyths.reddita.free |title=Reddita- Android Market |publisher=Market.android.com |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search ===
On July 21, 2010, Reddit out-sourced the reddit search engine to Flaptor, who used its search product IndexTank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.reddit.com/2010/07/new-search.html |title=Reddit Blog post announcing the use of IndexTank search engine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
Reddit is known for its various site-wide charity campaigns which have included
* In early December of 2010, the members of the Christianity subreddit and the Atheism subreddit came together to cross-promote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ejnbg/dogs_and_cats_living_together_mass_hysteria/ |title=Dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria! r/Atheism and r/Christianity have a friendly competition up for a holiday charity drive that is spilling over into other subreddi |publisher=Reddit.com |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; fundraising drives for [[World Vision]]'s Clean Water Fund and [[MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res]] (Doctors Without Borders), respectively. Later, the Islam subreddit joined in, raising money for [[Islamic Relief]]. In less than a week, the three communities (as well as the reddit community at-large) raised over $45,000 for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/16/christian-and-atheist-gro_n_797910.html |title=Christians and Atheists Square Off In Online Battle To Raise Money For Charity |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In early October 2010, a story was posted on Reddit about a seven-year-old girl, Kathleen Edward, who was in the advanced stages of [[Huntingtonâs disease]]. The girl's neighbors were taunting her and her family. Redditors banded together and gave the girl a shopping spree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/news/local/toy-store-shopping-spree-for-kathleen-edward |title=Toy Store Shopping Spree for Kathleen Edward |publisher=Myfoxdetroit.com |date=2010-10-12 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stryker, Cole (2010-12-10).

Urlesque. Retrieved April 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; at Tree Town Toys, a toy store local to the story owned by a reddit user.
* Reddit started the largest [[Secret Santa]] program in the world, which is still in operation to date. For the 2010 Holiday season, 92 countries were involved in the Secret Santa program. There were 17,543 participants, and $662,907.60 was collectively spent on gift purchases and shipping costs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://venturebeat.com/2010/12/23/secret-santa-success-caps-banner-year-for-reddit/ |title=Secret Santa success caps banner year for Reddit |last1=Boitnott |first1=John |date=December 23, 2010 |work=VentureBeat Interpreting Innovation |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-12-20/secret-santa-the-creator-of-reddits-gift-exchange-the-worlds-biggest/ | title = The Biggest Secret Santa Gift Exchange in the World | accessdate = 2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redditgifts.com/statistics/ | title = Statistics for Secret Santa 2010 | accessdate = 2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members from reddit donated over $600,000 to [[DonorsChoose]] in support of Stephen Colbert's [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear|March to Keep Fear Alive]].
