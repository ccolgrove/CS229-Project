'''[[Sailing|Sailing/Yachting]]''' is a [[Olympic sport]] starting from the Games of the 1st [[Olympiad]] ([[Sailing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] in Athens {{GRE}}). With the exception of [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and possible [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916]] sailing was always a part of the Olympic program.
The Sailing program of 1908 was open for a total of five sailing classes (disciplines). It turned out that no entries were made in the 15 Metre. The planned venue of all races, named ''matches'' was Ryde, [[Isle of Wight]].

At the 1907 The Hague Conference of the IOC Ryde at the Isle of Wight was appointed to host the sailing regattas, for all classes, of the Games of the IV&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Olympiad. However when there were only British entries for the 12 Metre matches, and both yacht were located at the Firth of Clyde, the decision was made to use Hunterâs Quay as a second venue.

At Ryde the race committee used the available shipping buoys as marks for the courses. 16 [[Nautical miles|nm]] for the 8 Metre and 13 [[Nautical miles|nm]] for the 6 and 7 Metre.

== Competition&lt;ref&gt;The number of entries was not high. This was because the decision of the classes to use was taken less than one year before the games. Building wooden boats, in a class not proven yet, varying in length between 12 and 30 meters, practice with them and ship them to the games in time was for many owners a challenge. Overlooking the circumstances 13 boats from 5 countries was an achievement.&lt;/ref&gt;==

=== Classes (equipment) ===
Although one of the oldest organized sporting activities, '''sailing''' in the early first part of the 20th century was not uniformly organized. This had a lot to do with national traditions as well as with the fact that there were no standardized boat types with uniform building instructions and measurements. Also a lot of development was done in the area of boat design and boat building. The shape of a boat, specifically its length, its weight and its sail area, are major parameters that determine the boat's speed. Several initiatives were started to create a formula that made it possible to have boats race each other without having to calculate the final result. But the different countries initially could not agree on an international system. At the Olympics of 1900 it was clear that sailing was not ready for international competition, and something had to be done.

In 1906 international meetings were organize to solve the problem.  Finally in Paris, October 1907 the first [[International Rule (sailing)|International Rule]] was ratified. Delegates from this meeting went on to form the [[International Yacht Racing Union]] (IYRU), the precursor to the present [[International Sailing Federation]] (ISAF).

The agreed formula gives a result in meters (Metre). During the meeting in 1907 the IOC made the decision to open the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] for the following Metre classes:

== Remarks ==
* This Olympic sailing event was gender independent, but only two woman, ([[Frances Rivett-Carnac]]) in the 7 Metre, and the [[Duke of Westminster|Duchess of Westminster]]  as extra on het 8 Metre, participated. The duchess of Westminster also distributed the diploma's of special merit to the competitors of the other Olympic sports on July, 25 1908.
* The matches at Ryde were held in light air conditions.
* All members of a team had to be a citizen of the country they represent. However the boats used did not have to be build in the same country that the team was representing since the Olympic games are considered a test of skills and handling for the team and no a test of the yacht. This in contrast with the matches for the [[America's cup]] of that time.
* A second 7 Metre yacht was entered under command of Capt. [[Sloan Stanley]] but failed to make it to the starting line.
* At the end of the official report the following suggestion was made: &lt;blockquote&gt;It has been suggested that in the yacht racing of future Olympic Games it might be better to select a fleet of âone-designâ boats in the waters where the Games are held, and let all the crews entered draw lots for them every day, with the proviso that no crew should have the same boat twice.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Sailing had to wait until [[Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] before the first âone-designâ class was selected for the Games.

=== Sailors ===
During the Sailing regattas at the 1908 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:
* {{flagIOCteam|NOR|1908 Summer}}, [[Johan Anker]], Multiple Olympic competitor and designer of many Metre yachts as well as the 1948 Olympic [[Dragon (keelboat)|Dragon]], in the 8 Metre
* {{flagIOCteam|GBR|1908 Summer}}, [[Duke of Westminster|Duchess of Westminster]] as owner and extra crewmember of the 8 Metre ''Sorais''
