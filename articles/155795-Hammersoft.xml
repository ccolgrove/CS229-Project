'''Kings County''' is a [[county]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[province (Canada)|province]] of [[Nova Scotia]].

Kings County is located in central Nova Scotia on the shore of the [[Bay of Fundy]] with its northeastern part also forming the western shore of the [[Minas Basin]].

The part of the county residing in the [[Annapolis Valley]] comprises the agricultural heartland of the province and boasts over 600 [[farm]]s; the area is famous for its [[fruit]] crops, primarily [[apple]]s.  As with most coastal parts of the Maritimes, Kings County's shoreline was home to a productive [[shipbuilding]] industry during the 19th century.

Wolfville houses the highly ranked [[Acadia University]].  Cape Blomidon and the North Mountain preside over the Annapolis Valley, whereas the South [[Mountain]] and interior [[forest]]s to the southern part of the county support a variety of [[lake]]s and recreational cottaging areas.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the coast, valley and interior of Kings County were the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]].  Archaeological evidence from sites in the area indicate [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] habitation dates back thousands of years. The Mi'kmaq were a semi-nomadic people who followed seasonal food sources.  Their lives would be forever changed with the arrival of the Europeans.

The colonization of &quot;Les Mines&quot; and Grand Pre began in the 1680s when a few families relocated from [[France|French]] settlement at [[Port Royal]]. These &quot;[[Acadia]]ns&quot; settlers were named after the French name for the land &quot;Acadie&quot; meaning &quot;land of plenty&quot;. These farmers were accustomed to farming on [[Dyke (construction)|dyked]] lands, and did so here as well. This took place on the normally salty but fertile marshes that were found on the banks of the [[Minas Basin]], through the use of dykes and aboiteaux that allowed the fresh water entry but kept out the salt water tide.  The Acadians farmers prospered in Kings County, and lived harmoniously with the Mi'kmaq. The Acadians and Mi'kmaq fought numerous battles against the British at Grand Pre:[[Raid on Grand Pre]], [[Battle of Grand Pre]], and the [[Siege of Grand Pre]].

After the final defeat of and [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expulsion]] of the [[Acadians]], British control of the land was secured by repopulating the former French lands with settlers from [[New England]]. Between 1760 and 1768 some 8000 [[New England]]ers came to &quot;plant&quot; a new colony. Kings County comprised three [[agricultural]] [[township]]s: [[Horton, Nova Scotia|Horton]], [[Cornwallis, Nova Scotia|Cornwallis]], and [[Aylesford, Nova Scotia|Aylesford]]. The legacy of the [[New England Planters]] is still a tangible part of the life in Kings County, and had an important influence on Nova Scotian ideas on [[democratic government]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[Equal opportunity|equality]] of education.
[[Image:Minas Basin from lookoff.JPG|thumbnail|250px|left|Eastern Kings County from the Lookoff]]
The Planters were followed in the 1780s by further settlers from the [[United Empire Loyalists]] as well as significant numbers of Irish immigrants. The roots of [[Black]] Heritage in Kings County began almost 250 years ago when the [[New England Planters]] were accompanied by slaves and freed Blacks to settle in [[Horton Township, Nova Scotia|Horton]] and [[Cornwallis Township]]s. This initial African population would swell with larger migrations following the [[American Revolution]] and especially the [[War of 1812]]. Further waves of immigration followed in the following two centuries increasing and adding to the population and diversity of Kings County.

The County's agricultural industry blossomed in the 19th century, especially after the arrival of the [[Dominion Atlantic Railway]] which led to a major expansion of exports, especially the [[apple]] industry. After the loss of the British export market for apples in [[World War II]], Kings County farmers diversified into other crops and livestock.  Agriculture remains a major industry as the county has some of the best farmland in Nova Scotia, but farmland now faces pressure from suburban development around valley towns. The county also faces serious pollution problems in its major water artery, the [[Cornwallis River]].

Kings County was a major wooden [[shipbuilding]] area in the 19th Century, including a four-masted [[barque]] built in [[Kingsport, Nova Scotia|Kingsport]] named ''[[Kings County (barque)|Kings County]]'' which was one of the largest ever built in Canada. Today a number of light industrial factories are located in [[Coldbrook, Nova Scotia|Coldbrook]] and [[Waterville, Nova Scotia|Waterville]].

The county's history is preserved and interpreted at the [[Kings County Museum]] in [[Kentville, Nova Scotia|Kentville]] and a number of Kings County towns have museums related to their specific stories such as the [[Wolfville Historical Society]] and the [[Apple Capital Museum]] in Berwick.
