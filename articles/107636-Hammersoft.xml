'''Hermosa Beach''' is a beachfront city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. Its population was 19,506 at the 2010 census, up from 18,566 at the 2000 census.

The city is located in the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] region of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|greater Los Angeles area]] and is one of the three [[Beach Cities]]. Hermosa Beach is bordered by the other two, [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]] to the north and [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] to the south and east.

The city's beach is popular for [[sunbathing]], [[beach volleyball]], [[surfing]] and [[paddleboarding]]. The city itself extends only about 15 blocks from east to west and 40 blocks from north to south, with the [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]] running down the middle. Situated on the [[Pacific Ocean]], Hermosa's average temperature is 70 degrees in the summer and 55 degrees in the winter. Westerly [[sea]] breezes lessen what can be high summertime temperatures in [[Los Angeles]] and elsewhere in the county and help keep the [[smog]] away 360 days of the year.

A paved path, called [[The Strand (bicycle path)|The Strand]], runs along Hermosa's beach from Torrance Beach in the south approximately twenty miles north to [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and the [[Hermosa Beach pier]] is at the end of Pier Avenue, which is one of the beach community's main and shopping, eating and partying areas.

== History ==
Hermosa Beach was originally part of the 1884 [[Rancho San Pedro]] [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant that later became the ten-mile (16&amp;nbsp;km) Ocean frontage of [[Rancho Sausal Redondo]]. In 1900 a tract of {{convert|1,500|acre|km2}} was purchased for $35 per acre from A. E. Pomroy, then owner of the greater part of Rancho Sausal Redondo. Messrs. Burbank and Baker, agents, bought this land for [[Moses Sherman|Sherman]] and Clark who organized and retained the controlling interest in the Hermosa Beach Land and Water Company,

In early days, Hermosa Beach â like so many of its neighboring cities ([[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]], [[Lawndale, California|Lawndale]], [[Torrance, California|Torrance]]) â was one vast sweep of rolling hills covered with [[field (agriculture)|fields]] of [[grain]], mostly [[barley]]. During certain seasons of the year large herds of [[sheep]] were grazed over this land, and corrals and large [[barn]]s for storing the grain, as well as providing shelter for [[horse]]s and farm implements were located on the [[ranch]] between Hermosa and Inglewood. The Spanish words ''Rancho Sausal Redondo'' mean a large circular ranch of [[pasture]] of [[grazing]] land, with a grove of [[willow]] on it.

[[Image:Hermosa beach pier statue.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tim Kelly (surfer)|Tim Kelly]] Lifeguard Memorial Statue at Hermosa Beach Pier &amp; Volleyball courts]]The first official survey was made in the year 1901 for the board walk on the Strand, Hermosa Avenue and Santa Fe Avenue; work on these projects commenced soon after. In 1904 the first pier was built. It was constructed entirely of wood even to the [[piling]]s and it extended five hundred feet out into the ocean. The pier was constructed by the Hermosa Beach Land and Water Company. In 1913 this old pier was partly washed away and later torn down and a new one built to replace it. This pier was built of [[concrete]] {{convert|1000|ft|m|-2}} long, and paved with [[asphalt]] its entire length. Small tiled pavilions were erected at intervals along the sides to afford shade for [[fishermen]] and [[picnic]] parties. A [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] stand was built eventually out on the end. Soon after, about 1914, an [[auditorium]] building was constructed; it has housed various enterprises and at present the public [[rest room]]s, the Los Angeles [[Life Guard]] Service, and the local branch of the [[Los Angeles County Public Library]] occupy rooms in the building. This pier is municipally owned.

The [[Santa Fe Railway]] was the only [[transportation]] system through Hermosa Beach. It was seven blocks from the beach. The street that led to the tracks was called Santa Fe Avenue, but was later renamed Pier Avenue. There was no [[railway station]] for Hermosa, but Burbank and Baker built a [[railway platform]] on the west side of the tracks near Santa Fe Avenue, and later the Railroad Company donated an old [[boxcar]] to be used as a storage place for freight. In 1926, the Santa Fe Company built a modern [[stucco]] depot and installed [[Western Union]] [[telegraph]] service in it.

The first city election for city officers was held December 24, 1906. On January 14, 1907, Hermosa Beach became the nineteenth incorporated city of Los Angeles County.

The name ''Hermosa'' comes from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and means &quot;beautiful.&quot;

== Parks and recreation ==
The wide flat beach makes Hermosa Beach one of the most popular places to play beach volleyball, from professional to amateur.  Hermosa Beach is home to the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]] Hermosa Beach Open tournament, and several amateur CBVA tournaments during the year. [[The Strand (bicycle path)|The Strand]] stretches north into [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]] and south into [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and is a popular place for walkers, joggers and biking. Of the three Beach Cities, only Hermosa Beach owns its own beach. The other two cities' beaches are owned by the county of [[Los Angeles]].

Running parallel to The Strand is a lovely linear trail known today as the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt.  Once part of a railroad easement, this narrow {{convert|24|acre|m2|adj=on}} strip had long been the subject of heated controversy and pressure from various commercial interests.  After years of litigation and wrangling, the city was poised to permit intensive retail and condominium development in the mid-1980s when a grassroots group spearheaded by activist Rosamond Fogg forced the matter to a vote.  The City Council at the time was divided over whether the matter was of much importance but after an energetic and passionate campaign, the citizens found that the greenbelt was a vital recreational resource and mandated its preservation for the use and enjoyment of residents and visitors.  This ballot initiative passed by almost 87%, the highest in California history.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The public also substantiated this effort by taxing themselves millions of dollars in order to purchase the lands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  As a result, the Hermosa Valley Greenbelt has the quality of a rural country lane, home to butterflies and many bird and animal species.  At any time of day or night joggers and walkers enjoy its soft woodchip trails and graceful landscaping.  The Greenbelt is also now part of the Federal [[Rails to Trails]] network.  RUDAT (an urban architectural planning group) found that Hermosa Beach, thanks in large part to the existence of the Greenbelt, was a &quot;world class pedestrian city&quot;.

The city also has eight other parks:
* Cypress Park, also known as Clark Field (9th Street &amp; Ardmore Avenue) - [[Baseball]]/[[Softball]] Diamond, [[Basketball]] and [[Tennis]] Courts
* South Park (Valley Drive &amp; 4th Street) - Children's play area, [[Roller Hockey]] Rink, Large open field for [[Soccer]] and [[American Football|Football]]
* Bi-Centennial Park (4th Street &amp; Ardmore)
* Fort Lots-o-Fun (6th Street  &amp; Prospect)
* Noble Park (The Strand &amp; 14th Street)
* Edith Rodaway Friendship Park (Prospect Avenue between Gentry &amp; Hollowell)
* Valley Park (Valley Drive &amp; Gould Avenue)
* Kay Etow Park (Herondo Street and Monterey Boulevard)

Other facilities:
* Skateboard Park - Pier Avenue and Ardmore Avenue
* [[Roller Hockey]] rink (South Park) - 4th and Valley Drive is frequently used for friendly pick-up games and league matches.
* [[Basketball]] (Cypress Park) - Two outdoor courts on 9th and Valley Drive

* [[Tennis]] - Lighted courts on 10th and Valley / Ardmore
* Skateboarding Park - Lighted park behind the Hermosa Beach Playhouse
* [http://www.hermosabch.org/about/history/lawnhist.html Lawn Bowling Club] is located next to Clark Building at 861 Valley Drive, Hermosa Beach. Open to the public and they furnish equipment and instruction to beginners.  The club was founded in 1936, when Mayor John Clark obtained the approval of the City Council to install a green at his own expense. In 1958, a clubhouse was donated and in 1963 a second green was laid. In the 1960s, over 150 bowlers could be seen all dressed in white. When membership waned, the second green was lost to the basketball court. The club is informal and seeks new members.

Hermosa Beach also has a [[private school]]:
* [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], a [[Catholic school]] with classes up to the eighth grade. Although it is a religious school, there is no convent so most classes are taught by lay persons. Religious studies and services are provided by Franciscan friars and priests.

Average air temperature - (Summer 74 Â°F (23.3 Â°C)/ Winter, 55 Â°F (12.7 Â°C))

Average water temperature - 60 Â°F (15.5 Â°C) (Summer 68 Â°F (20 Â°C)/ Winter 50 Â°F (10 Â°C))

Hermosa Beach has an average of 325 days of sunshine a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=159227&amp;refer=| title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Los Angeles, California, United States of America| publisher=Weatherbase.com| date=| accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its location, nestled on a vast open bay ([[Santa Monica Bay]]), morning fog and haze is a common phenomenon in May, June and early July (caused by ocean temperature variations and currents). Locals have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the &quot;May Gray&quot; and the &quot;[[June Gloom]]&quot;. Overcast skies are common for June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santabarbara.com/community/weather/junegloom.asp| title = Santa Barbara.com: June Gloom| publisher=SantaBarbara.com| date=| accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area will enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures. At times, the sun shines east of PCH, while the beach area is overcast.

As a general rule, the temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) cooler than it is inland. A typical spring day (mid-April) is sunny, pleasant and about 68 Â°F (20 Â°C). In the summer, which stretches basically from May to late October, temperatures can reach to the mid-80's Fahrenheit (about 30 Â°C) at the beach. In early November, it is about 68 Â°F (20 Â°C). In late January, temperatures are around 63 Â°F (17 Â°C). It is winter, however, when the hot, dry [[Santa Ana wind]]s are most common. In mid-December 2004, temperatures soared to 84 Â°F (28 Â°C) in Santa Monica, for a few straight days, with perfectly sunny skies.

The rainy season is from late October through late March. Winter storms usually approach from the northwest and pass quickly through the Southland. There is very little rain during the rest of the year.

Hermosa Beach usually enjoys a cool breeze blowing in from the ocean, keeping the air fresh and clean. Therefore, [[smog]] is less a problem for Hermosa Beach than elsewhere around Los Angeles.

=== Cost of living ===
[[Image:6th street and hermosa beach strand.JPG|thumb|right|6th and The Strand Hermosa Beach|175px]]

The beautiful beach lifestyle comes at a price: according to public data from the ''[[LA Times]]'', real estate prices increased almost 20% per year between 1999 and 2005.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Properties within short walking distance of the ocean routinely sell for well over US$1.5 million. Those with direct, unhindered views routinely ask in excess of $2 million. ''[[Money Magazine]]'' ranks communities in the area as some of the most expensive places to live in America.  Homes located on The Strand frequently sell for $3â10 million.  The home pictured to the right sold in 2003 for $8,100,000.  The average 3-bed 2-bath home costs about $649 per square foot or $1,500,000 as of 2006.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

West of PCH single homes mix with apartments, some have sunset views. East of PCH, the hills rise into upper middle class neighborhoods of tract homes with custom touches. Since the 1980s gentrification has set in, and many single-family dwellings and apartment buildings have been razed for condominiums. Multiple housing units dominate slightly over single family homes.

== Media ==
In addition to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Hermosa Beach is served by local daily the ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' and local weeklies the ''[[Beach Reporter]]'' and the ''[[Easy Reader]]''. One of the main online references for locals and visitors is the online home of the venerable [[Easy Reader]] at [http://www.easyreadernews.com EasyReaderNews.com] and [http://www.SouthBayEvents.com SouthBayEvents.com], which offers a weekly entertainment guide, as well as a full local business listing. The TV show ''[[Summerland (TV series)|Summerland]]'' was partly filmed here.

== Trivia ==

Segments of the [[television show]] ''[[The O.C.]]'' were filmed in Hermosa Beach (and more in neighboring Redondo Beach), not [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]].  This was necessary because of [[trade union|union]] rules that make it expensive to film outside of Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name=&quot;OC&quot;&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/OC/ByLocation.shtml The O.C. Filming Locations]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s the [[hardcore punk]] band [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] emerged from Hermosa Beach, and played their first show at Valley Park. The infamous &quot;church&quot; profiled in ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]'' was on Pier Avenue, though it has since been torn down.

The [[melodic hardcore]] band [[Descendents]] also appered in Hermosa Beach in 1978. It paved the way to two other well known punk bands, the [[Circle Jerks]] in 1979 and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] in 1988.

An episode of [[Gilmore Girls]] (Season 4, Episode 17: Girls in Bikinis, Boys Doin' the Twist) was filmed at the Sea Sprite Inn where Rory went to &quot;Florida&quot; for spring break.

Hermosa Beach has been the sister city of [[Loreto, Baja California Sur]], since 1967.

In the film &quot;[[Jackie Brown]]&quot; by [[Quentin Tarantino]] the arms dealer Ordell Robbie, played by [[Samuel Jackson]], kept his mistress Melanie, played by [[Bridget Fonda]], in a beachfront condo in Hermosa Beach.
