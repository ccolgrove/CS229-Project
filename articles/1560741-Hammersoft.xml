==History==
===MetroVision Channel 8===
8TV was formerly known as '''MetroVision Channel 8''' or '''TV4'''. It was managed by '''City Television Sdn Bhd''' and broadcasts from [[Kuala Lumpur]]. This broadcast area was only limited to [[Klang Valley]] area only.{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/19981206190600/http://www.metrovision.com.my/discover/install.asp| title= MetroVision Tune in guide }}

The channel targets [[Malaysian English]]-speaking viewers; [[American English]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] programmes are also shown in this channel.

Metrovision was launched started television broadcasting first airdate on Saturday, 1 July 1995 at 18:30 [[Time in Malaysia|local time]] tonight officially launched by the then [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] by [[Mahathir bin Mohammad]]. It was originally planned for a nationwide expansion but due to [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|the then-recent Asian Financial Crisis]] the plan was put off. It has faced many challenges to its business foundation, most notably the rise of [[Astro (Malaysian satellite television)|Astro]] on 1 June 1996 and the start of [[ntv7|NTV7]] on Tuesday, 7 April 1998. Metrovision was ceased transmission at Monday, 1 November 1999 at 00:00 [[Time in Malaysia|local time]] midnight.

===8TV===
Prior to closure, the first hour of '''Berita Perdana''' (now known as ''Berita Nasional''), [[RTM TV1]]'s prime time news programme at 20:00 [[Time in Malaysia|local time]] tonight was broadcast for several months before the channel ceased transmission. It was originally planned for relaunch on Tuesday, 1 February 2000 after its digitalisation but it was not until Thursday, 8 January 2004. [[Media Prima|Media Prima Berhad]] bought '''City Television Sdn Bhd''' where they restructured it and relaunched as '''[[8TV (Malaysia)|8TV]]'''.

==Features==
8TV targets the younger block of viewers with a &quot;one station, two channels&quot; concept whereby the first session of the broadcasts are the Chinese channel, while the second session of the broadcasts is mostly English-language programmes. A third part of the broadcast features interactive SMS games, with some music videos in English, Malay and Chinese.

It has a popular slogan, &quot;We're different,&quot; and has partially attempted to show this by offering a large variety of popular series and movies that focuses on youth, urban and Chinese as the targeted audiences.

==Events==
*8TV [[Shopping mall|Mall]] Tour (2006) - in selected major shopping malls in Malaysia.
*8TV Youth Tour (2007) - in selected higher learning institutions in Malaysia.

==Mascot==
In early 2006, 8TV introduced its [[mascot]], a toddler named &quot;[[Pow Pow]]&quot; who graces some of 8TV's [[promo]] ads as well as the main page of its [http://www.8tv.com.my official website]. He was originally called simply the &quot;8TV baby&quot; until a name search contest was held to look for a suitable [[proper name]], and eventually the name &quot;Pow Pow&quot; was selected. Pow Pow is always seen wearing a crimson collared shirt with the 8TV logo on its front, decorated by an orange cape with the 8TV logo again on it, as well as a diaper. Sometimes he is seen sporting an [[electric guitar]]. He bears an uncanny resemblance of the character [[Jack-Jack]] from Disney/Pixar's [[the Incredibles]].

Pow Pow was potentially not the first mascot used by 8TV. During 8TV's early months, it featured a [[nerd]] named &quot;Gary the IT Guy&quot; and his fellow fictional 8TV workforce for its promotional activities, who functioned similarly in the form of a mascot for the then-new station.

* '''''Ho Chak!'' (å¥½å)''' (Hokkien for 'very delicious', a local programme that promotes mostly various local foods that can be found in Malaysia)

== Controversies ==
The station's 2011 [[Ramadan]] public service announcements (PSA) have sparked outrage among the online community for its allegedly racist content. All three ads, which run for 30 seconds each, show the same Chinese girl acting âinappropriatelyâ, with three different scenarios, at a Ramadan bazaar. All of it were widely circulated in social networking sites by users who said the announcements left a bad taste in the mouth which left the station with no choice but to remove it after a few hours.
