'''Netscape Communicator''' was an [[Internet suite]] produced by [[Netscape Communications Corporation]]. Initially released in June 1997, Netscape Communicator 4.0 was the successor to [[Netscape Navigator]] 3.x and included more [[groupware]] features intended to appeal to enterprises.

== Editions ==
Netscape Communicator was available in various editions, such as &quot;Professional&quot; and &quot;Complete&quot;. The following components were included in Netscape Communicator (different editions had different components and some components were dropped in later editions):

'''Features'''
*[[Netscape Navigator]]&amp;nbsp;â [[Web browser]]
*[[Netscape Mail &amp; Newsgroups|Netscape Messenger]]&amp;nbsp;â [[e-mail client]] and (in version 4.5 and above) [[news client]]
*[[Netscape Collabra]]&amp;nbsp;â [[news client]] (merged into Messenger in version 4.5)
*[[Netscape Address Book]]&amp;nbsp;â [[address book]]
*[[Netscape Composer]]&amp;nbsp;â [[HTML editor]]
*[[Netscape Netcaster]]&amp;nbsp;â [[push technology]] client (dropped in version 4.5)
*[[Netscape Conference]]&amp;nbsp;â multi-user communication client (dropped in version 4.5)
*[[Netscape Calendar]]&amp;nbsp;â enterprise calendar client (dropped in version 4.72 because Netscape's license to use the underlying technology expired&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://sillydog.org/netscape/kb/calendar.php What happened to Netscape Calendar?]&quot;. SillyDog701.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1998, a major update to the program was released as Netscape 4.5. This included many improvements, mostly to the Messenger e-mail client, which now also took on the features of Collabra. However, some of the less popular components, such as Netcaster, were dropped. A feature called &quot;Roaming Profiles&quot; was added in version 4.5 that synchronized a user's bookmarks, address book and preferences with a remote server, so that a user's home and work browsers could have the same bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.acns.colostate.edu/aspx/www.acns/bulls/nsroaming_whatsroaming.html Netscape Roaming Profiles - What is it?]&quot;. Colorado State University.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time version 4.5 was released, Netscape had started the [[Mozilla]] [[open source]] project and had ceased charging for Communicator.

The term &quot;Navigator&quot; referred to the browser component alone, while &quot;Communicator&quot; referred to the suite as a whole, as established in version 4.0. However, due to user confusion, the names were often used interchangeably. Also, because none of the applications besides Navigator were popular on their own, and because Netscape never produced any other desktop software that approached the popularity of Navigator, people would often refer to both the Communicator suite and the Navigator browser as simply &quot;[[Netscape]]&quot;. Further complicating the matter was the fact that the command to start Navigator in Unix was &quot;netscape&quot;.

In November 2000, Netscape Communicator was superseded by [[Netscape 6]], an almost completely rewritten program based on Mozilla, or what later came to be known as [[Mozilla Application Suite]]. However, minor updates to Communicator continued to be issued, culminating in the release of Netscape Communicator 4.8 in August 2002.

Mozilla Foundation continued to develop the Netscape code base and had Mozilla Application Suite as the continuation of Netscape Communicator, with [[SeaMonkey]] all-in-one Internet application suite being the direct current and active continuation.
