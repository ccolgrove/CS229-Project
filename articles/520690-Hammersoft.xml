== Unfit to stand trial ==
In 2006, she was released from prison after [[Michael B. Mukasey]] ruled that Lindauer was unfit to stand trial and could not be forced to take [[antipsychotic medication]] to make her competent to stand trial.&lt;ref name=drop/&gt;&lt;ref name=free&gt;{{cite news |first= Anemona|last= Hartocollis|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ex-Congress Aide Accused in Spy Case Is Free on Bail  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/nyregion/09spy.html|work=[[New York Times]] |date=September 9, 2006 |accessdate=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Without external symptoms of mental illness, the maximum allowable period for evaluations of competence to stand trial is four months, according to US Federal Law;&lt;ref name=cfr1&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00004241----000-.html] &quot;Determination of mental competency to stand trial to undergo postrelease proceedings 1&quot; 18 US Code Pts. 313 รยง4241 2010 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindauer's period of evaluation was seven months.--&gt;&lt;!--This is a fringey reference--&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name=cleared&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael|last=Collins|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Feds Drop Case Against Accused Iraqi Agent |url=http://www.opednews.com/articles/1/Feds-Drop-Case-Against-Acc-by-Michael-Collins-090116-583.html|work=[[OpEdNews]] |date=January 16, 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In 2008, [[Loretta A. Preska]] of the Federal District Court in [[New York City]] reaffirmed that Lindauer was mentally unfit to stand trial.&lt;ref name=spi2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Benjamin|last= Weiser|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Woman Accused of Iraq Ties Is Ruled Unfit for Trial Again  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/nyregion/17lindauer.html|work=[[New York Times]] |date=September 16, 2008  |accessdate=2009-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Lindauer's attorney Brian W. Shaughnessy stated that he could not find any other court case in the US in which the prosecution ever argued, much less successfully argued, that the defendant was incompetent to stand trial over the objections of both the defendant and the attorney of the defendant while the defendant was a successful and productive member of society and fully participating in its own defense.{{fact}} 

Lindauer's attorney also states that &quot;Before agreeing to represent her, I took steps to corroborate her story through independent sources that I considered to be extremely high caliber...Ms. Lindauer checked out...Lindauer was always competent to stand trial, only the Justice Department wanted to avoid embarrassing revelations from her case.&quot;&lt;ref name=aff1 /&gt;--&gt;
On January 16, 2009 the government decided to not go ahead with the prosecution saying &quot;prosecuting Lindauer would no longer be in the interests of justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=drop&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Case Dropped Against Md.
