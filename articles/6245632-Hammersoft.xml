'''W23BW''' is a [[broadcast translator|translator station]] on channel 23 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] owned by [[3ABN]] and carrying that network's programming with no programming originating locally. Formerly on channel 54 until 2001, it was moved to channel 23 in 2001 to accommodate the digital signal [[Rockford, Illinois]] of [[WREX]] until it moved to its permanent digital 13 in 2009.

W23BW's signal is nulled to the north, a remnant of the analog age when Rockford's [[WIFR]] broadcast on analog channel 23 (currently WIFR is on digital channel 41, but identifies as channel 23 via [[PSIP]]).
