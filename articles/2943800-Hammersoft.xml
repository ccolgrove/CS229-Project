==History==
[[File:Gtvnetwork.JPG|150px|left|thumb|GTV Network logo in 1978.]]
The country's government television network began operations in 1974 as [[DWGT-TV|Government Television (GTV-4)]]. It was renamed Maharlika Broadcasting System in 1980 followed by switching into color TV and following the People Power Revolution in [[1986]], became People's Television (PTV) noted for its 4 logos from 1986 to 1987 and from 1987 to 1995.

On March 26, 1992, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Cory Aquino]] signed Republic Act 7306 turning PTV Network into a government corporation known formally as People's Television Network, Inc.

Shortly after he took over the mantle of government in June 1992, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] appointed PTV Network's first board of directors. The Network was given a one-time equity funding for capital outlay. Since 1992, PTV has been operating on revenues it generates on its own. [[Republic Act]] 7306 stipulates that the government shall not appropriate funds for the operations of the Network.

PTNI is on full satellite transmission nationwide since 1992 using PALAPA C2. Its flagship station PTV-4, which is based in [[Quezon City]], boasts of a 40-kilowatt brand-new transmitter sitting on a {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower. With its 32 provincial stations across the country, the network has extended its reach and coverage to approximately 85 percent of the television viewing public nationwide.

So far, PTNI has come up with the kind of programs that have earned for itself the Hall of Fame Award for Best Station and for Most Balanced Programming in [[1987]] and two succeeding years thereafter, from the [[Catholic]] [[Mass Media]] Awards (CMMA). It has, to its name, several pioneering and award-winning educational, cultural and public service programs for their relevance and production excellence. In 1996, PTV won the award for Best TV Station ID in the PMPC Star Awards for Television.

PTNI has pioneered educational and cultural programming. Some of its award-winning programs were Tele-aralan ng Kakayahan (which predated ABS-CBN's The [[Knowledge Channel]] by decades), Ating Alamin, [[Kidsongs|Small World (and its successor) Kidsongs]], For Art's Sake, Coast to Coast and Paco Park Presents. Today, at the core of its educational programming is the Continuing Education Via Television or CONSTEL, a program aimed at upgrading teaching skills of elementary and secondary teachers of Science and English. Institutionalized by [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS)]], CONSTEL Science and English are being used in teacher training by the Regional and Divisional Leader Schools of the Department of Education, culture and Sports and in Teacher Education Institutions of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]].

PTNI has also been the official broadcaster of major international sports competitions. It has covered the [[Olympic Games]], starting with the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympic Games]] in Seoul, with the exception of the [[Barcelona Olympics]] in 1992 (covered by [[ABS-CBN]]) and the [[Beijing Olympics]] in 2008(covered by [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]]). PTNI was the carrying station of the [[South East Asian Games]] in [[1991]], [[1995]], [[2005]], and [[2007]], missing in [[2009 SEA Games|2009]], [[Asian Games]] from [[1986]] to [[2006]] and the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics]] in [[2007 IAAF World Championships in Athletics|2007]] and [[2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics|2009]]. During these coverages, PTNI has received commendations from various sports organizations. In [[1996]], it received a presidential citation from then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] for the successful coverage of the [[Atlanta Olympic Games]].

[[File:Nbni.png|200px|left|thumb|NBN logo from 2006-2011]]

On July 16, 2001, under the new management appointed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], PTNI adopted the name National Broadcasting Network (NBN) carrying a new slogan &quot;One People. One Nation. One Vision.&quot; for a new image in line with its new programming thrusts, they continues the new name until the Aquino Administration in 2010.

NBN expanded its broadcast reach with the launching of NBN World on February 19, 2003 in cooperation with the Television and Radio Broadcasting Service (TARBS). This global expansion signals new directions for NBN as it becomes accessible to the rest of the world, particularly the millions of Filipinos overseas. NBN can be seen in [[Australia]], [[North America]] and the [[Asia-Pacific]]. NBN is transmitting via satellite nationwide using [[Agila 2]] but now moved to ABS 1 last September 2011.

Before the year 2010, NBN main studios in Quezon City and its regional stations in Baguio, Cebu and Naga will be equipped with the most modern news gathering equipment for them to compete with the major television networks. Also, a new Harris Transmitter has been installed. NBN's transmitter power shall be increased from 40&amp;nbsp;kW to 60&amp;nbsp;kW. NBN's digital channel is now available on channel 48 using the [[ISDB-T|Japanese digital TV standard]].

In 2011, NBN continued to enhance its digital broadcasting capabilities with equipment donated from the Japanese government.
This equipment will also allow NBN to begin broadcasting emergency alerts when necessary (similar to the [[Emergency Alert System]] in the United States, but it is more likely, due to the usage of the Japanese digital TV standard, that the system would be based on the Japanese [[J-Alert]] system).

Although the branding is officially known as the National Broadcasting Network, in August 2011, the &quot;People's Television&quot; brand which was retired in 2001 was reintroduced as a secondary brand. until a few moths later it PTNI became a Primary Brand
