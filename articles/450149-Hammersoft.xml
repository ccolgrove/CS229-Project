'''Joseph W. Ralston''' (born November 4, 1943) is currently the [[United States]] [[Special Envoy]] for Countering the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) and holds senior positions in various [[Arms industry|defense related corporations]]. He was the former [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].

==Career==
===Military career===
Ralston has served in the military since 1965. He has served in operational command at squadron, wing, numbered air force and major command, as well as various staff and management positions at every level of the [[United States Air Force]].

Ralston became  [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in 1996 . He was favorite to become [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in 1997, however following revelations of a secret affair he remained [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] until May 2000. He then became [[Supreme Allied Commander]] for the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in [[Europe]] until January 2003.

[[Bill Clinton]] writes in his memoirs ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'' that Ralston was used to resolve a potentially sticky situation with [[Pakistan]] in which the US would use Pakistani airspace to strike at the [[Al-Qaeda]] organization meeting in [[Afghanistan]] following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|US Embassy bombings]] in [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]]. There was US concern that Pakistan's intelligence services would tip off the targets or even worse assume the missiles over Pakistan came from [[India]], potentially triggering a nuclear conflict on the Indian sub-continent. As Clinton writes on page 799 of My Life,  &quot;we decided to send the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Ralston, to have dinner with the top Pakistani military commander at the time the attacks were scheduled. Ralston would tell him (the Pakistani general) what was happening a few minutes before our missiles invaded Pakistani airspace, too late to alert the [[Taliban]] or Al-Qaeda, but in time to avoid having them shot down or sparking a counterattack on India.&quot;

In September 2006, he was assigned as [[Special Envoy]] for Countering the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) by the President of the United States [[George W. Bush]].[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/75277.htm]  The PKK is a [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] separatist group designated as a terrorist organization by the [[United States]], [[Turkey]] and the [[European Union]].

Ralston was one of at least three retired four star [[generals]] asked by [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] to oversee both wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|Afghanistan]]. Ralston and the two other generals, however, all declined this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=3 Generals Spurn the Position of War 'Czar' |date= April 11, 2007|publisher= |url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/10/AR2007041001776.html |work =[[Washington Post]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language = | first1=Peter | last1=Baker | first2=Thomas E. | last2=Ricks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate career===
He is currently director of the [[Timken Company]] and the [[URS Corporation]], is on the [[Board of Directors]] of [[Lockheed Martin]] and has been [[Vice Chairman]] of The [[Cohen Group]], since March 2003.&lt;ref name='heed'&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Biography - Joseph W. Ralston |date= |publisher= |url =http://www.lockheedmartin.com/wms/findPage.do?dsp=fec&amp;prfr=false&amp;ci=15607&amp;sc=400&amp;ti=&amp;mm=&amp;dd=&amp;yy=&amp;cpi=&amp;bs=&amp;es=&amp;fti=&amp;rsbci=15607&amp;rsbi= |work =[[Lockheed Martin]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sits on the advisory board of the [[American Turkish Council]], an American-[[Turkey|Turkish]] [[lobby group]].

==Adultery==
In 1997, at the retirement of [[John M. Shalikashvili]], the then [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], Ralston was the top candidate to succeed him to the highest position in the military. A scandal erupted when it became public that he had an adulterous affair with a CIA employee during the 1980s. Ralston claimed this was while he and his wife Linda were separated, however she disputed that assertion, claiming the affair continued and led to their 1988 divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=ADULTERATED STANDARDS |date= June 16, 1997|publisher= |url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986544-1,00.html |work =[[Time magazine]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense Secretary [[William Cohen]] backed Ralston despite the controversy, declaring that Ralston's secret, adulterous relationship 13 years ago wouldn't &quot;automatically disqualify&quot; him from becoming the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Online NewsHour: Ralston Quits as Joint Chiefs Candidate -- June 9, 1997 |date= |publisher= |url =http://www.law.duke.edu/lens/media/ralston.html |work =[[Duke Law]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were allegations of  double standards, as the 1LT [[Kelly Flinn]] was forced out of the Air Force following after being charged  with adultery a month before.

Ralston withdrew his name from consideration and remained Vice Chairman until 2000, when he was appointed [[Supreme Allied Commander]], Europe, in which function he served from 2000 to 2003, taking over from [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] general [[Wesley Clark]]. In this capacity, he was the highest-ranking officer in NATO. He retired on March 1, 2003.

==Conflict of interest==
Ralston holds various senior positions in defense and security-related corporations, simultaneously with his diplomatic role as &quot;anti PKK coordinator&quot;. Critics allege Ralston is using his influence as special envoy to secure large governmental weapons contracts for the corporations he has directorship over. The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' described him as &quot;an arms merchant in diplomat's clothing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Kevin|last= McKiernan|coauthors= |title=An undiplomatic conflict of interest |date= November 1, 2006|publisher= |url =http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/11/01/an_undiplomatic_conflict_of_interest/?p1=MEWell_Pos2 |work =[[Boston Globe]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2006, the Kurdish National Congress of North America issued a press release demanding âthe immediate resignationâ of General Joseph Ralston:&lt;ref name='KNC'&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Demanding the Immediate Resignation of General Ralston as Special |date= |publisher= |url =http://www.kncna.org/docs/pdf_files/KNC_PR_Demanding_Resign_of_JRalston.pdf |work =Kurdish National Congress of North America |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Ralstonâs appointment came at a time when Turkey was finalizing the sale of 30 new [[Lockheed Martin]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] aircraft (approx. $3 billion) and as Turkey was due to make a decision on the $10 billion purchase of the new Lockheed Martin [[F-35 JSF]] aircraft. The sale for the F-16âs was approved by the [[United States Congress]] in mid-October and Turkeyâs decision in favor of the F-35 JSF was announced on October 25, shortly after Ralstonâs recent stay in Ankara, ostensibly to counter the PKK.''

Since the [[History of the Kurdistan Workers Party|PKK insurgency began in 1983]], 30,000 people have died and over 3,000 Kurdish villages have been destroyed, often by U.S. supplied planes.&lt;ref name='gnn'&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Realism Triumphant - Arming the Usual Suspects in Turkey and India |date= |publisher= |url =http://www.gnn.tv/threads/21762/Realism_Triumphant_Arming_the_Usual_Suspects_in_Turkey_and_India |work =[[Guerrilla News Network]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080316140150/http://www.gnn.tv/threads/21762/Realism_Triumphant_Arming_the_Usual_Suspects_in_Turkey_and_India &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics are concerned that hard line anti-PKK policies influenced by conflicting interests would compromise the prospects for longterm solution to the [[Turkish-Kurdish conflict|Kurdish-Turkish issue]].&lt;ref name='Balkan'&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Damage Control Firm Takes Quiet Interest as Former US General Is Charged with Turkish Profiteeringontrol-firm-takes-quiet-interest-as-former-us-general-is-charged-with-turkish-profiteering/ |date= |publisher= |url =http://www.balkanalysis.com/2006/10/31/damage-control-firm-takes-quiet-interest-as-former-us-general-is-charged-with-turkish-profiteering/ |work =balkanalysis |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2006, the PKK announced a unilateral [[cease-fire]] in south-east Turkey, a move that the [[Turkish government]] has  rejected:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=PKK and Iraqi Kurds are 'one and the same,' Turk military believes |date= |publisher= |url =http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=59560 |work =[[Turkish Daily News]] |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:''âThe PKK had to stop fighting anyway because of the winter, but the PKK, backed by [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraqi Kurds]], are acting as if this were a major political decision, not a move dictated by a practical necessity. Of course, we donât take it seriously.â''

Speaking before the Eurasian Strategic Research Center (ASAM) in Istanbul, Ralston mirrored the Turkish government's rhetoric :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=MYTHS ABOUT THE PKK AND THE UNITED STATES |date= |publisher= |url =http://istanbul.usconsulate.gov/ralston_091906.html |work =US Consulate Istanbul |pages = |accessdate = 2007-07-17 |language =}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''âI want to be clear on this point: The US will not negotiate with the PKK. We will not ask Turkey to negotiate with the PKK. And I pledge to you that I will never meet with the PKK.â''
