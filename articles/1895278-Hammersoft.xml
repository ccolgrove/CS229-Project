The '''Gran Sasso raid''' refers to '''Operation ''Eiche''''' ([[German language|German]] for 'Oak'), the rescue of Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[FallschirmjÃ¤ger|paratroopers]] and [[Waffen-SS]] [[commando]]s in September 1943, during [[World War II]]. It was personally ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]], planned by Major [[Harald Mors]] and approved by General [[Kurt Student]].

==Overview==
On 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the [[allied invasion of Sicily]] and [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombing of Rome]], the Italian [[Grand Council of Fascism]] voted to depose Mussolini and replaced him with Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fital&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Whittam| first= John |title =Fascist Italy| publisher= [[Manchester University Press]]| url= http://books.google.com/books?id=hHgMm6APG_0C&amp;dq=%22Vatican+Radio%22+%22Radio+London%22+fascist&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 | isbn= 0719040043 | year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini was subsequently arrested on King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]]'s orders.&lt;ref name=&quot;prisonrescue&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Annussek |first=Greg |title=Hitler's Raid to Save Mussolini |publisher=Da Capo Press |url= http://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Raid-Save-Mussolini-Operation/dp/0306813963|isbn=978-0-306-81396-2 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his arrest, Mussolini was transported around Italy by his captors. [[Otto Skorzeny]], selected personally by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] to carry out the rescue mission, tracked him.

Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used his own reconnaissance{{cn|date=November 2011}} to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned at ''Campo Imperatore'' Hotel, a ski resort at ''[[Campo Imperatore]]'' in Italy's [[Gran Sasso]], high in the [[Apennine Mountains]]. On 12 September 1943, Skorzeny joined the teamâled by Major [[Harald Mors]]âto rescue Mussolini in a high-risk [[Military glider|glider]] mission.

The operation on the ground at Campo Imperatore was led by Lieutenant Count Otto von Berlepsch, planned by Major Harald Mors and under orders from General [[Kurt Student]], all ''[[FallschirmjÃ¤ger]]'' (German Air Force Paratroopers) officers.

The commandos crashed their nine [[DFS 230]] gliders into the nearby mountains, then overwhelmed Mussolini's captors without a single shot being fired. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment, and formally greeted Mussolini with &quot;''Duce'', the ''FÃ¼hrer'' has sent me to set you free!&quot; to which Mussolini replied &quot;I knew that my friend would not forsake me!&quot; Mussolini was first flown from ''Campo Imperatore'' in a ''Luftwaffe'' [[Fieseler Fi 156]]C-3/Trop ''Storch'' [[STOL]] liaison aircraft, ''Werknummer'' (serial number) 1268,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luftwaffe-experten.org/stam-s.html |title=stamm Sx+xx |publisher=Luftwaffe Experten Message Board |accessdate=October 22, 2011 |quote=SJ+LL â Fieseler â Fi156C-3/Trop â W.Nr.1268 â W.Nr.1268 â used on the liberation of Mussolini; source B0001 has this wrong as SU+LL}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially flown in by Captain Walter Gerlach, then taking off with Mussolini and Skorzeny (even though the weight of an extra passenger almost caused the tiny plane to crash) then on to [[Vienna]], where Mussolini stayed overnight at the [[Hotel Imperial]] and was given a hero's welcome. The ''Storch'' involved in rescuing Mussolini bore the radio code letters, or ''Stammkennzeichen'', of '''&quot;SJ + LL&quot;''' in motion picture coverage, for propaganda purposes, of the daring rescue.

==Aftermath==

The operation granted a rare late-war public relations opportunity to [[Hermann GÃ¶ring]]. Mussolini was returned to power again in the German-occupied portion of Italy (the [[Italian Social Republic]]). Otto Skorzeny gained a large amount of success from this mission; he received a promotion to [[SturmbannfÃ¼hrer]], the award of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] and fame that led to his &quot;most dangerous man in Europe&quot; image.

Nazi propaganda hailed the operation for months, the Axis otherwise having little about which to boast in the fall of 1943. As it turned out, it was the last of Hitler's spectacular gambles to bear fruit.
