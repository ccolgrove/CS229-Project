'''Eastern Kentucky University''', commonly referred to as '''Eastern''' or by the acronym '''EKU''' by local residents, is an undergraduate and graduate teaching and research institution located in [[Richmond, Kentucky]], [[United States of America|U.S.A.]]. EKU is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).&lt;ref&gt;SACS http://www.sacscoc.org/searchResults.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains regional campuses in [[Corbin, Kentucky|Corbin]], [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]], and [[Manchester, Kentucky|Manchester]], and centers in [[Fort Knox]], [[Lancaster, Kentucky|Lancaster]], and [[Somerset, Kentucky|Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eku.edu/campuses Continuing Education and Outreach - List of EKU Campuses and Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:EKU UniversityBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|The University Building, EKU's oldest building, was inherited from Central University.]]Before Eastern took over the campus, Central University was founded in Richmond in 1874 as part of Centre College. As Centre got bigger they shut down Central University. In 1906, the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] established the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School as a teacher's college. In 1922 it became a four-year institution and changed its name to the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College, awarding its first degrees under that name in 1925. The school received accreditation from the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1928; then, two years later, in 1930, it changed its name again to the Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College. Eastern added graduate studies in 1935, and thirteen years later, in 1948, the General Assembly removed the word [[Teacher]]s from the school's name, and granted it the right to award nonprofessional degrees. It was not until 1966 that the school was officially renamed Eastern Kentucky University.&lt;ref&gt;

==Athletics==
[[File:EasternKentuckyColonels.png|thumb|right|Eastern Kentucky University&quot;The Colonel&quot;]]
{{main|Eastern Kentucky Colonels}}
Referred to as the &quot;Maroons&quot; until the mid-1960s, Eastern's sports teams are known as the &quot;Colonels.&quot; They compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]].

The school is best known for its [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] football team, who, until this season, was tied with [[Florida State University]] for the most consecutive winning seasons at 32. The Colonels went 5-6 in the 2009-2010 season. They have won 20 OVC conference titles and two [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championships]] in 1979 and 1982. Much of the success came during the long tenure of head coach [[Roy Kidd]] from 1964 to 2002.
[[Image:RoyKiddStadium.jpg|thumb|right|Roy Kidd Stadium - Home of EKU's football team.]]
The EKU men's [[basketball]] team have won the Ohio Valley Conference tournament championship and its automatic bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA basketball tournament]] both in 2005 and 2007, the school had zero tournament appearances in the previous 26 years.

==Student life==
More than 150 Registered Student Organizations are active on campus, including Greek chapters, political organizations, Student Government Association, and dozens of others. Organizations as diverse as the EKU BassMasters and the EKU Anime Club routinely hold events, programs, and fundraisers.

[[Image:EKU KeenJohnson.jpg|thumb|left|Keen Johnson Building.]]Eastern also has many traditions associated with its student life.  Amongst others, &quot;The Corner&quot; is a common area bordered by the Powell Student Center, the Keen Johnson Building and Case Residence Hall where students have gathered in between classes for decades.  Formerly known as &quot;Horny Corner&quot; and still called so by alumni for the flirtatious conversations that often occur there, The Corner has remained a central gathering spot throughout Eastern's history.  Typically, one wishing to get the attention of the student body as a whole will turn towards The Corner to hang a home-made banner from the rails of the Powell Student Center, decorate the area with side walk chalk, or even stand atop one of the many benches or a planter box to exclaim their message.

Mozart's Grave is the tomb of Eastern's unofficial campus mascot from the mid-1960s, and is marked with a gravestone located behind the amphitheater stage in an area of campus known as The Ravine.  A mutt who used to roam campus freely, Mozart was a beloved campus pet and could often be found sleeping under the desk of then-president Robert Martin or lying on the edge of the amphitheater stage during musical performances, a tendency that earned him his name.

==Campus media==
*EKU's campus newspaper is known as the '[http://www.easternprogress.com 'Eastern Progress'']'. The paper was founded in 1922, after two previous campus newspapers had quit publication. The ''Progress'' is published on essentially a weekly schedule during the school year, excluding major holiday breaks, for a total of about thirty issues per academic year.

*EKU's radio station, [http://www.weku.fm/ ''WEKU''] broadcasts classical music and [[NPR]] news to much of central and southeastern Kentucky.

*EKU's yearbook, ''The Milestone'' returned to campus in 2007 after a 10-year absence.  A large, typically high-quality volume chronicaling campus life over the preceding year, ''The Milestone'' is run by students under the auspices of the Department of Communication.
