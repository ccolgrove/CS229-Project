'''Allison Mack''' (born July 29, 1982) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]]. She is best known for her role of [[Chloe Sullivan]] on the [[Superman]]-inspired television series ''[[Smallville]]''.

==Early life==

Mack was born in [[Preetz]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]] to American parents, Mindy and Jonathan Mack. Her father was an [[opera]] singer performing there. The Mack family moved back to the United States when she was two years old. She has an older brother, Shannon, and a younger sister, Robyn.

==Career==
She began her acting career at the age of four in commercials for &quot;German Chocolate&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwtv.com/shows/smallville/cast/allison-mack |title=Smallville Cast Bios Allison Mack |publisher=The CW |accessdate= May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mack then went into modeling for a short period because her mother thought she &quot;looked cute in clothes.&quot; She began studying at The Young Actors Space in [[Los Angeles]] when she was seven.

Her first major TV role came in an episode of the WB series ''[[7th Heaven]]'', in which she gained a lot of attention playing a teenager who [[self-harm|cut herself]]. In 2000, she starred in the short-lived series ''[[Opposite Sex (TV series)|Opposite Sex]]''. She also starred beside her former ''Smallville'' castmate [[Sam Jones III]] in an [[R. L. Stine]] [[miniseries]] ''[[The Nightmare Room]]''. Her filmography includes [[Eric Stoltz]]'s directorial debut ''[[My Horrible Year!]]'', in which she plays a girl having great difficulties in her life as she turns 16, and ''[[Camp Nowhere]]''.

Mack starred as [[Chloe Sullivan]], one of [[Clark Kent]]'s best friends, in the [[The CW Television Network|CW]] hit series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.

In the summer of 2006, Mack's voice was heard as the sister of the main character in the [[Warner Bros.]] [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie ''[[The Ant Bully]]''. That year she also provided the voice of a museum curator named Clea in an episode of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''.

In November 2008, Mack began directing for the first time, taking the reins on the Smallville episode &quot;[[Smallville (season 8)|Power]]&quot;, which aired January 29, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.allisonmack.com/category/directing/ |title = Allison Mack's Personal Blog |accessdate=2009-02-18 |publisher=AllisonMack.com}}{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since May 2009, Mack has been part of a project with the Iris Theatre Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iristheatreco.org/company-members.html |title = Iris Theatre Company |archivedate=2006-06-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qQLIH2GR}}&lt;/ref&gt; which performed a piece of experimental theater at the [[Prague Fringe Festival]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

She voiced [[Power Girl]] in the [[Warner Premiere]] animated feature, ''[[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies]],'' released on September 29, 2009.

In May 2010 it was announced that Mack will not be appearing as a series regular on the final season of ''Smallville'', but will return for several episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Allison-Mack-Smallville-1018783.aspx |title=Allison Mack Leaving Smallville |publisher=TVGuide.com |archivedate=2010-06-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qQLoTukr}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2010 San Diego Comic Con it was mentioned that Allison Mack may still be considered a series regular, as she would appear in several episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/cc10-brianpeterson.htm|title=KryptonSite Smallville Comic-Con Interviews, Part V: Executive Producer Brian Peterson!|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mack returned for five episodes in the tenth season, being billed as a series regular for the episodes she appeared in. She also eventually appeared in the two-part season finale.
