'''Okopipi''' was started in May 2006 to be an [[open source software|open source]] project intending to create a successor to Blue Security's [[Blue Frog]] anti-spam project after Blue Frog was abandoned following attacks by spammers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11392 Blue Security folds under spammer's wrath&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The project has seen no activity since January 2007 and appears to be dead and unlikely to be resuscitated.

Unlike Blue Frog, Okopipi sought to use a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] model in order to avoid any [[single point of failure]]. It was planned to be based on a P2P network nicknamed &quot;the frognet&quot;. On failure to connect it was planned to still opt-out given e-mail addresses. The project was perpetually in the design phase. It was being specifically engineered to prevent the DDoS accusations leveled against its progenitors. Its peer-to-peer nature was unusual amongst anti-spam solutions, with no other peer-to-peer opt-out solutions of note available. The Thunderbird plugin for Okopipi has been renamed Habu and it's main purpose is reporting spam to the SEC, FTC, FDA, SpamCop, and Knujon.
