}}September 5, 2009 was a new start, and proved to be the perfect ending. [[Old Dominion]] played its first football game in 69 years against a [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] school from [[North Carolina]], the Chowan Hawks, in front of a sold-out 19,782 fans. Old Dominion won 36â21.
The defensive line dominated Chowan's offensive line and ODU's defense forced 5 turnovers. ODU quarterback, Thomas DeMarco, hooked up with wide receiver Marquel Thomas for a 50 yard pass play that marked the first touchdown for ODU in 69 years. DeMarco ended the game going 11 for 20 for 123 yards, 6 of those completions were to Reid Evans, who finished the game with 93 yards receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=292480295|title=Chowan 21, Old Dominion 36

Jacksonville was the first opponent that was supposed to be a challenge. Coming off two easy wins against smaller opponents, this was ODU's first test. Trailing 20â7 at halftime, ODU opened the 2nd half with a quick score by Mario Crawford and headed into the 4th quarter trailing 20â14. After trading touchdowns early in the 4th quarter, ODU received the ball with just over 1:30 left in the game. Thomas DeMarco quickly marched his team down the field and found Dorian Jackson for a 32 yard touchdown pass with only 45 seconds remaining in the game.

Thomas DeMarco finished with 175 yards passing and 136 yards rushing. Reid Evans had 7 receptions for 86 yards, and the ODU defense forced 4 turnovers.

ODU did not have an answer for Monmouth's running back David Sinisi who ran the ball 41 times for 216 yards, and also threw a 24 yard touchdown pass on an halfback option play. Sinisi ran for 2 first-downs on Monmouth's final possession of the game when ODU was trying to force a punt, in hopes of possibly winning the game. Because of that Monmouth ended the game with possession. Thomas DeMarco passed for a season high 215 yards while running for 42 more. ODU only forced 2 turnovers while averaging 4.3 takeaways a game coming into this game. Time of possession was very lopsided, with ODU's TOP being 20:49 and Monmouth's being 39:11.
