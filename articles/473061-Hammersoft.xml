The '''Buffalo Bisons''' are a [[minor league baseball]] team based in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]]. They currently  play in the [[International League]] (IL) and are the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] affiliate of the [[New York Mets]]. The Bisons play at [[Coca-Cola Field]] in downtown Buffalo.

The current incarnation of the Bisons was founded in 1979, when Buffalo ownership interests purchased the [[Jersey City A's]] of the Double-A [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] and moved the team to the city.

==Team history==
The history of teams known as the Buffalo Bisons dates to a [[Major League Baseball|major league]] club, the [[Buffalo Bisons (NL)|Buffalo Bisons]] of the [[National League]], who played from 1879 to 1885. In 1886, the Bisons moved into [[minor league baseball]] as members of the original [[International League]]. (An &quot;outlaw&quot; team also known as the [[Buffalo Bisons (PL)|Buffalo Bisons]] also played in the [[Players' League]], an upstart third major league, in 1890, but that team is not currently considered part of the Bisons history.) This team joined the [[Western League (original)|Western League]] in 1899, and was within weeks of becoming a [[Major League Baseball|major league team]] when the Western League announced it was changing its name to the [[American League]] in 1900. However, by the start of the 1901 season, Buffalo had been bumped from the league in favor of the [[Boston Red Sox|Boston Americans]]; the Bisons returned to the minors that year.

This franchise continued in the IL (known as the Eastern League from 1891 to 1911) through June 11, 1970, when it transferred to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]] as the [[Winnipeg/Peninsula Whips|Winnipeg Whips]], due to poor attendance and stadium woes. In 1969, [[HÃ©ctor LÃ³pez]] became the first black [[manager (baseball)|manager]] at the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] level while managing Buffalo Bisonsâsix years before [[Frank Robinson]] became the first black manager in [[Major League Baseball]].&lt;ref name=SOTTAYCBTB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DB1F39F93BA15750C0A966958260|title=  SPORTS OF THE TIMES; A Yankee Comes Back To Baseball|accessdate=February 20, 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[New York Times]]|date=March 28, 1990|author=Vecsey, George}}&lt;/ref&gt; After stops in Winnipeg and [[Hampton, Virginia]], the team was suspended after the 1973 season to make way for the [[Memphis Blues (baseball)|Memphis Blues]].

[[File:bisons coca cola field.jpg|left|thumb|A Bisons game at Coca-Cola Field in July 2010]]
The Bisons name was revived when a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] franchise moved to Buffalo in 1979. That team assumed the previous Bisons team history. After six seasons in the Eastern League, the Bisons rejoined the Triple-A ranks in 1985, joining the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] when the [[Wichita Aeros]]' franchise rights were transferred to Buffalo. When, as part of a reorganization of Triple-A baseball, the American Association folded after the 1997 season, Buffalo joined the International League.

Since their retunr to Triple-A baseball in 1985, the Bisons have made the playoffs 11 times. In 2004, the team came back from being 10 games out of first-place in late June to winning their division by a convincing 9Â½ games. Buffalo won its first-round playoff, against the [[Durham Bulls]], and advanced to the [[Governors' Cup]] Finals, in which they had home field advantage over the [[Richmond Braves]]. The remnants of [[Hurricane Ivan]] caused major flooding problems in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and the entire series was played in Buffalo. The Bisons defeated the Braves in four games and won the Governors' Cup for the second time since 1998. In 2005, Buffalo won the North Division and played the [[Indianapolis Indians]] in the first round, winning the first two games in Indianapolis, but losing all three remaining games. With many of its players shuffled to the [[Cleveland Indians]] throughout the final months of the season, the Bisons failed to qualify for the playoffs in 2006. In 2007, Buffalo failed once again to clinch a playoff spot, marking the first time since Buffalo was parented with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that the Bisons missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons.

===The Mets era===
After the 2008 season, Buffalo parted ways with the Cleveland, as the Indians signed an affiliation agreement with the [[Columbus Clippers]] beginning in 2009. The Bisons then signed a two-year agreement to be the top home for [[New York Mets]] prospects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080922&amp;content_id=3526842&amp;vkey=pr_nym&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nym &quot;Buffalo Bisons and New York Mets sign player development contract&quot;] New York Mets. September 22, 2008. Retrieved on September 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2008, the Mets officially announced that [[Ken Oberkfell]] will be the Bisons new manager for 2009. At the same press conference, the Bisons also unveiled their new logo. The logo pays homage to baseball's 123 year history in the city of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] with the city's skyline in the background. The logo, along with the new colors of blue and orange, closely resemble that of the team's new parent club, the Mets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buffalo.bisons.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081216&amp;content_id=487407&amp;vkey=pr_t422&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t422 &quot;Bisons Unveil New Primary Logo&quot;] Buffalo Bisons. December 16, 2008. Retrieved on December 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009â2010 off-season, the Bisons were chosen to host the 2012 [[Triple-A All-Star Game]] to celebrate 25 years at [[Coca-Cola Field]]. The game will be played on Wednesday, July 11, 2012.

In late July 2010, it was announced that the Bisons and Mets agreed on a two-year extension that will carry their agreement through the 2012 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/other/buffalo-bisons/article79051.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010â2011 off-season saw changes to the Bisons couching staff. Bisons manager [[Ken Oberkfell]] was promoted to the Mets as bench coach returning Oberkfell to the big leagues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/other/buffalo-bisons/article278761.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Oberkfell was replaced by [[Tim Teufel]] who was a member of the 1986 Mets team. Teufel was introduced on Friday January 21, 2011, as the 16th manager in the Bisons' modern era.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/24-sports-news/article319343.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011-2012 off-season once again saw coaching changes. Tim Teufel was promoted to 3rd base coach on the Mets. He was replaced by [[Wally Backman]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northjersey.com/columnists/Klapisch_Backman_shows_loyalty_to_Mets.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was introduced on November 17, 2011.

==Mascots==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
[[Image:Bustertbison.jpg|thumb|Buster on the field energizing the fansâ]]The main mascots of the team have traditionally been Buster T. Bison along with his cousin Chip, but as of 2006, a new mascot named Belle the Ballpark Diva has appeared, along with flamboyant reporter Johnny $tyles. Buster and Belle pursued a love interest, and were married following the August 26, 2007 game against the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees]].
 
Buster and Chip wear Bisons jerseys and caps. Buster's number was the last two numbers of the season up to 2009, however, as of the 2010 season his number is 83, signifying the year Buster first appeared as the team's mascot. Chip's number has always been 1/2. The Bisons have had a number of other mascots in the past. MicroChip, who was smaller and presumably &quot;younger&quot; than Buster and Chip, wore a Bisons jersey as well. His number was 1/4. Loudmouth, a mime played by actress Tracey B. Wilson, was another mascot for the team. The other official mascot of the Bisons was Howie the Ump. He wore a costume much like Buster and Chip, but it was a costume of a human umpire, with an umpire's uniform and mask. He was very short lived, existing only during the 1995â1997 seasons, and was played by local improvisational comedian Randy Reese.

Other unofficial Bisons include Conehead, a beer vendor who wears a rubber conehead hat, and The Earl of Bud, another beer vendor, who during the third inning would climb on the dugout and dance. His last appearance was at the 20th Anniversary game for Dunn Tire Park in August 2007. Also a longtime challenged fan named &quot;Mark&quot; can be seen behind home plate making his opinion known throughout the ballpark.

There is also the Kevin the &quot;K-man.&quot; Kevin is a fan with season tickets, who sits in the upper deck, and hangs a green &quot;K&quot; sign every time a Bisons pitcher records a strikeout. He puts the sign up backwards when the batter is called out looking, just as in baseball scorekeeping.

==Media/game broadcasts==
All Bisons games can be heard on [[WWKB]]-AM in Buffalo and many games are televised on [[Time Warner Cable SportsNet]] throughout Western New York.  Ben Wagner handles play by play while veteran Duke McGuire is color commentator.

In 2010, Justin Sheinis was added to the broadcast team. He will call some play-by-play and color commentary as well as host nearly every pre- and post-game show for the season. He will also put together video package and write feature articles for the Bisons team website, bisons.com.  Beginning in 2009, Friday games aired as a Game of the Week package on [[WGR AM 550]].  These games are a simulcast of those airing on WWKB.

Also, Buffalo Bisons games are sometimes aired on [[SportsNet New York]], which is co-owned by Time Warner Cable and the New York Mets (as well as [[Comcast]]).
