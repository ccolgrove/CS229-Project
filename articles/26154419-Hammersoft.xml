==History==
In the 1978-79 season, the Friars would hold the distinction of being the first team to play the new [[Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey]] team. The result was a 17-0 triumph. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ivy50.com/womens/story.aspx?sid=2/22/2007   |title= Ivy Womenâs Hockey|author=  |date= February 22, 2007  |work= |publisher= Ivy Women in Sports: profiles of women from the Ivy Leagueâs history|accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the Friars won the inaugural Eastern College Athletic Conference Womenâs Championship. 

In Jackie Barto's first season as coach in 1994-95, the Friars were 18-9-4 and won the Eastern College Athletic Conference title. The following season, the Friars reached the ECAC championship game, but they lost to [[University of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] in a game that lasted five overtimes. The 1996-97 season were one of the most successful as Providence went 20-8-2, posting the program's eighth 20-win season. In 1997-98, Barto guided the Friars to the ECAC Tournament for the 15th consecutive season. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17300&amp;ATCLID=1057461&lt;/ref&gt;

Providence College made history on Saturday, December 5, 2009 as the Friars came away with a 4-1 victory over No. 3 New Hampshire in [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]]. Providence became the first Hockey East team to earn a victory at the [[Whittemore Center]] since the league's inception in 2002-03.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friars.com/sports/w-hockey/recaps/120509aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2010, Providence College women's hockey earned their 600th victory by defeating No. 8 [[Cornell University|Cornell]] by a score of 6-3. Junior Jean O'Neill tallied a goal and an assist. Genevieve Lacasse made 22 saves to record the victory. Providence now joins New Hampshire as the only two programs with 600 victories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friars.com/sports/w-hockey/recaps/010910aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt;
