'''Hikarunix''' is a [[Linux distribution]] in [[Live CD]] format for the [[x86]] architecture. It was based on [[Damn Small Linux]]. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of the name of the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series [[Hikaru no Go]] and the [[Linux]] operating system kernel that Hikarunix is based on (which is a [[Unix]] clone).

Hikarunix intended to provide a complete and ultra-portable environment for study and playing the game [[Go (board game)|Go]]; from complete beginner (for whom Mori's &quot;The Interactive Way To Go&quot; [http://playgo.to/interactive/] is included in addition to several books in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] form, as well as a complete offline copy of [[Sensei's Library]]), to intermediate players (who can take advantage of a comprehensive [[Go opening theory|joseki]] library and a collection of about 9500 challenging problems to work through called [[GoGrinder]]) to the expert (who can use the many online Go clients or study annotated games of Go masters, or even have their own games analyzed), all contained within an [[Operating system|OS]] which can fit on a mini- or regular-sized [[Compact disc|CD]] or be installed to a harddrive, or be put onto a USB memory stick, so Go enthusiasts can use Hikarunix everywhere.
