The '''United States U-17 women's national soccer team''' is a youth [[association football|soccer]] team operated under the auspices of [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]].  Its primary role is the development of players in preparation for the full [[United States women's national soccer team|Women's National Team]].  The team's most recent major tournament was the [[2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]], in which the United States team finished runners-up to tournament champions [[Korea DPR women's national football team|North Korea]]. The team competes in a variety of competitions, including the biennial [[FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]], which is the top competition for this age group.  The current head coach is [[Albertin Montoya]].

==History==
===2002 through 2005===
The women's U-17 program was started in 2002 and was initially focused on developing players for the [[United States U-20 women's national soccer team|U-19 national team]]. The U-17s played their first matches in November 2002, including a 3-0 victory over [[Scotland women's national football team|Scotland]]. Through 2003, the U-17s went undefeated in international matches, defeating youth teams from [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] and [[Germany women's national football team|Germany]], and repeated that feat in 2004. In 2005, however, the U-17s suffered defeats in matches against the Canadian and [[Mexico women's national football team|Mexican]] youth teams. 

In 2006, the U-17s competed against various youth teams from [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina]] and Germany, including a loss to the senior [[Argentina women's national football team|Argentina women's national team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/Teams/Youth/US-Under17-Women/About-the-Team.aspx About the Team], US Soccer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007===
In February 2007, [[FIFA]] began organizing for the inaugural [[FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u17womensworldcup/newzealand2008/releases/newsid=636414.html#fifa+looks+forward+competitions+chile+new+zealand FIFA looks forward to the competitions in Chile and New Zealand], FIFA.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the tournament, the U-17s posted a 9-1-0 record, defeating U-17 teams from Germany and [[Uruguay women's national football team|Uruguay]] and U-19 teams from [[Denmark women's national football team|Denmark]], [[England women's national football team|England]], and Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/Teams/Youth/US-Under17-Women/About-the-Team.aspx About the Team], US Soccer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===
The U-17s compiled a record of 19-3-2 and 11-2-1 in international matches, winning the [[CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship]] in [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] on July 26, 2008, defeating [[Costa Rica women's national soccer team|Costa Rica]] 4-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concacaf.com/page/WUnder17s/HistoricalStats/0,,12813,00.html Women's U17 2008 Schedule], CONCACAF official website.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]], the United States lost their opening match to [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]]. They scraped through the opening rounds of play with a draw against [[France women's national football team|France]], and advanced through the tournament to the final, where they lost in overtime to [[Korea DPR women's national football team|North Korea]]. [[Taylor Vancil]] was named the best [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] at the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u17womensworldcup/newzealand2008/news/newsid=948160.html#perfect+tens+strike+gold Perfect tens strike gold], FIFA.com&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 13 goals that the USA had at the tournament, only three players actually scored them: [[Vicki DiMartino]] (5), [[Courtney Verloo]] (4), and [[Kristen Mewis]] (2). The other two goals were [[own goal]]s by [[Paraguay women's national football team|Paraguay]] and [[Korea DPR women's national football team|North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/u17womensworldcup/newzealand2008/teams/team=1916472/statistics.html 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup Statistics: USA], FIFA.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
The U-17s were favored to win the [[2010 CONCACAF Women's U-17 Championship]] held in [[Costa Rica]], winning their group and scoring 32 goals. However, they suffered a stunning loss to [[Canada women's national football team|Canada]] in the semifinals, on a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. This loss prevented the United States from qualifying to the [[2010 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]], the first time in history that a United States women's national soccer team has not advanced out of their region to a Women's World Cup.
