==History==
Colorado State football goes back 115 seasons, and experienced its most successful run in the 15 seasons under head coach [[Sonny Lubick]] (1993â2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/colorado_state/yearly_totals.php CFB Data Warehouse] - Colorado State - yearly results - accessed 2009-10-05&lt;/ref&gt; During their history, the Rams have played in five different conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/colorado_state/index.php CFB Data Warehouse] - Colorado State - accessed 2009-10-05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success under Sonny Lubick==

Since [[Sonny Lubick]] took control over the Rams as head coach in 1993, the Rams have made nine bowl appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3154046 Fairchild, Rams Seek Return to College Football's National Scene]. Associated Press, ESPN.com. Accessed March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; CSU had only two previous bowl appearances. Lubick won nearly 75% of home games in the stadium that would later bear his name, leading the team to six conference titles and an overall record of 108-74.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Colorado State University 2007 Season Review.&quot; McGraw Athletic Center, Fort Collins, CO. Release No. 13, 12/31/07. Pg 14.&lt;/ref&gt; CSU was consistently a top 25 contender from 1994â2002, with a 79-32 record during that period and 3 top 25 finishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Lyell, Kelly. &quot;If He's Done Coaching, Lubick Will Be Missed.&quot; ''Fort Collins Coloradoan'', 12/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Lubick, conference coach of the year four times, coached current [[Denver Broncos]] [[Cecil Sapp]] and [[Erik Pears]], and all-pro NFL linebacker [[Joey Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;Meisler, Natalie. &quot;Lubick Leaving Legacy.&quot; ''The Denver Post''. 11/27/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairchild Era==
{{Main|2008 Colorado State Rams football team}}

On November 27, 2007, following significant drops in attendance and a 17&amp;ndash;30 record over the past 4 seasons, including 3&amp;ndash;9 in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; CSU made the difficult and controversial decision to relieve Lubick of his head coaching duties. The school hired [[Buffalo Bills]] [[offensive coordinator]] [[Steve Fairchild]] to take the helm.  Fairchild was a Rams quarterback from 1978&amp;ndash;80, and served under Lubick as quarterback's coach and later as offensive coordinator from 1993&amp;ndash;2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=ncf&amp;id=3151784 &quot;Bills Offensive Coordinator to Be CSU Head Coach&quot;]. ''Associated Press'', 12/12/07. ESPN.com, accessed March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rams finished the regular season in fourth place in the [[Mountain West Conference]] and accepted a bid to the 2008 [[New Mexico Bowl]] on December 20, where they defeated the [[Fresno State Bulldogs football|Fresno State Bulldogs]]. After the early success, the Rams had three consecutive three win seasons under Fairchild. At the end of his fourth season with Colorado State, Fairchild was fired by Athletic Director Jack Graham.

==Bowl Results==
Under the coaching of [[Earle Bruce]], [[Sonny Lubick]] and [[Steve Fairchild]], the CSU Rams have gone to a total of eleven bowl games since the 1990 football season. 

Under Sonny Lubick, the CSU Rams played in their two of their biggest bowl games to date.  The first was the 1997 Holiday Bowl 35â24 victory over the [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri Tigers]] while the second was the 2000 Liberty Bowl 22â17 victory over the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville Cardinals]].  During both of these winning seasons, the CSU Rams were ranked in the top 25 football teams by both the Coaches Poll and the AP Poll.

In the first season under new head coach Steve Fairchild, the CSU Rams were able to beat the [[Fresno State Bulldogs|Fresno State]] 40â25 in the [[2008 New Mexico Bowl]].  During this game, running back [[Gartrell Johnson]] rushed for over 286 yards and received five passes for 90 yards setting a record for the second most all-purpose yards ever in a single [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] bowl game.

==Rivalries==
===Rocky Mountain Showdown===
Eight times since 1998, Colorado State and in-state rival [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] have faced one another in the [[Rocky Mountain Showdown|annual football battle]] in [[Denver]] at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]]. The rivalry started in 1893 and was played annually until 1958. After being resurrected in 1984, the game moved to Denver in 1998. Since moving to Invesco Field at Mile High, the teams have consistently played before the largest crowds in state history to witness a college sporting event. On August 31, 2009, Colorado State and Colorado signed a 10-year contract extension of the [[Rocky Mountain Showdown]] which will bring the game back to [[Invesco Field at Mile High]] from 2010 to 2019. The game is scheduled to be played at [[Hughes Stadium (Fort Collins)|Hughes Stadium]] in 2020.

===Border War===
The [[Border War (Colorado State vs. Wyoming)|Border War]] featuring CSU and [[University of Wyoming|Wyoming]] - the longest rivalry in each school's history - dates back to 1893. Since 1968, the schools have battled for possession of the [[Bronze Boot]] traveling trophy. The bronzed battle boot was worn in Vietnam by CSU alumnus Dan Romero.

===Ram-Falcon Trophy===
The Ram-Falcon Trophy originated in 1980 to highlight the series between CSU and the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]], located in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. The wood-carved trophy was produced by local artist Bill Wrage. The Air Force ROTC detachment on the CSU campus initiated the creation of the trophy.
