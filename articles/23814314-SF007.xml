'''OpenBitTorrent''' (commonly abbreviated '''OBT''') is an open [[BitTorrent tracker]] project for the [[BitTorrent protocol]].

==Description==
OpenBitTorrent's initiative to provide a free, stable service with no ties to indexing sites or even hosting torrent files has been a huge public success and it has spawned several copies with almost identical services.

OpenBitTorrent has been suspected of being a part of or a side project of [[The Pirate Bay]], because it was observed early on that both sites used the same [[BitTorrent tracker|tracker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/openbittorrent-tracker-muscles-in-on-the-old-pirate-bay-090705/#comment-576934 Comment concerning OBT on torrentfreak.com from 05.07.2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The OpenBitTorrent project has countered by stating that the sites merely shared a tracker cluster operated by DCP Networks and [[Fredrik Neij]] during a startup period (February through August 2009).

On May 22, 2010, the OpenBitTorrent tracker was shut down, although the site remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;down&quot;&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/hollywood-lands-triple-strike-on-pirate-bay-openbittorrent-100522/ Hollywood Lands Triple Strike On Pirate Bay, OpenBitTorrent]&lt;/ref&gt; This was a result of a case against The Pirate Bay by many major Hollywood studios. Later the tracker came back online.
