The '''Principality of Sealand''' is an [[List of unrecognized countries|unrecognized]] entity, located on [[HM Fort Roughs]], a former World War II [[Maunsell Sea Forts|Maunsell Sea Fort]] in the [[North Sea]] 10&amp;nbsp;km (six&amp;nbsp;miles) off the coast of [[Suffolk]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] (51Â°53'40&quot;N, 1Â°28'57&quot;E).&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.sealandgov.org/history.html History Of Sealand] The Principality of Sealand&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1967, the facility has been occupied by the former British [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Paddy Roy Bates]]; his associates and family claim that it is an independent [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.sealandgov.org/history.html History Of Sealand] The Principality of Sealand&lt;/ref&gt; External commentators generally classify Sealand as a [[micronation]] rather than an [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognized state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford &amp; Simon Sellars|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|pages=8â13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it has been described as the world's smallest nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22726244-5002031,00.html|title=JOURNEYS&amp;nbsp;â THE SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY: Simon Sellars braves wind and waves to visit the unlikely North Sea nation of Sealand|accessdate=10 November 2007 |work=The Australian }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand is not currently officially recognised as a sovereign state by [[list of sovereign states|any sovereign state]]. Although Roy Bates claims it is ''[[de facto]]'' recognised by Germany as they have sent a diplomat to the micronation, and by the United Kingdom after an English court ruled it did not have jurisdiction over Sealand, neither action constitutes ''[[de jure]]'' recognition as far as the respective countries are concerned.&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.sealandgov.org/history.html History Of Sealand] The Principality of Sealand&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===History of HM Fort Roughs===
{{Main|HM Fort Roughs}}
In 1943, during World War II, HM Fort Roughs was constructed by the United Kingdom as one of the [[Maunsell Forts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;seaswaterways&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Zumerchik|first=John|title=Seas and Waterways of the World: An Encyclopedia of History, Uses, and Issues|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO Ltd|isbn=978-1-85109-711-1|url=http://books.google.com/?id=IBKoUXrF5p0C&amp;pg=PA563&amp;dq=hm+fort+roughs#v=onepage&amp;q=hm%20fort%20roughs&amp;f=false|page=563}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for defence against German mine-laying aircraft that might be targeting the estuaries that were part of vital shipping lanes; It comprised a floating [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]] base with a superstructure of two hollow towers joined by a deck upon which other structures could be added. The fort was towed to a position above the [[Rough Sands]] sandbar, where its base was deliberately flooded to allow it to sink to its final resting place on the sandbar. The location chosen was approximately six miles from the coast of [[Suffolk]], outside the then [[three-mile limit|three-mile territorial water]] claim of the United Kingdom and therefore in [[international waters]].&lt;ref name=seaswaterways /&gt; The facility (called Roughs Tower or HM Fort Roughs) was occupied by 150â300 [[Royal Navy]] personnel throughout World War II;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project-redsand.com/history.htm |title=Project Redsand information on offshore defences |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=Project Redsand}}{{Verify credibility|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; not until well after the war, in 1956, were the last full-time personnel taken off HM Fort Roughs.&lt;ref name=seaswaterways /&gt;

===Occupation by Roy Bates and the establishment of Sealand===
[[Image:Royal Standard of the Prince of Sealand.svg|left|thumb|Royal Standard of the Prince of Sealand.]]
On 2 September 1967, the fort was occupied by Major [[Paddy Roy Bates]], a British subject and [[pirate radio]] broadcaster, who ejected a competing group of pirate broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford &amp; Simon Sellars|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates intended to broadcast his pirate radio station [[Radio Essex (pirate radio station)|Radio Essex]] from the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, British workmen entered what Bates claimed to be his territorial waters in order to service a navigational buoy near the platform. Michael Bates (son of Paddy Roy Bates) tried to scare the workmen off by firing warning shots from the former fort. As Bates was a [[British subject]] at the time, he was summoned to court in England on firearms charges following the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Welcome to Sealand. Now Bugger Off |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/haven.html|publisher=[[Wired News]] |date=July 2000|accessdate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the court ruled that as the platform (which Bates was now calling &quot;Sealand&quot;) was outside British jurisdiction, being beyond the then three-mile limit of the country's waters,&lt;ref&gt;''Regina v. Paddy Roy Bates and Michael Roy Bates'', The Shire Hall, Chelmsford, 25 October 1968. {{cite web |url=http://www.seanhastings.com/havenco/sealand/judgement.html |title=Regina v. Paddy Roy Bates and Michael Roy Bates|accessdate=11 November 2007|publisher=The Shire Hall, Chelmsford |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the case could not proceed. In 1975, Bates introduced a constitution for Sealand, followed by a flag, a national anthem, a currency and passports.&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealandgov.org/history.html |title=The Principality of Sealand |publisher=Sealandgov.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1978, while Bates and his wife were in England, [[Alexander Achenbach]], who describes himself as the Prime Minister of Sealand, hired several German and Dutch mercenaries to spearhead an attack of Roughs Tower.&lt;ref name=LP11&gt;{{cite book | title = Micronations | author=John Ryan, George Dunford &amp; Simon Sellars | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] | year = 2006 | isbn=1-74104-730-7 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stormed the tower with [[speedboats]] and [[helicopters]], and took Bates' son hostage. Bates was able to retake the tower and capture Achenbach and the mercenaries. Achenbach, a German lawyer who held a Sealand passport, was charged with [[treason]] against Sealand&lt;ref name=&quot;LP11&quot;/&gt; and was held unless he paid [[German mark|DM]]&amp;nbsp;75,000 (more than US$&amp;nbsp;35,000 or Â£23,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attempt to free captive from private 'island' fails|date=5 September 1978|page=3|publisher=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of the Netherlands, Austria and Germany petitioned the British government for his release, but the United Kingdom disavowed his imprisonment, citing the 1968 court decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov.org&quot;/&gt; Germany then sent a diplomat from its London embassy to Roughs Tower to negotiate for Achenbach's release. Roy Bates relented after several weeks of negotiations and subsequently claimed that the diplomat's visit constituted ''[[de facto]]'' recognition of Sealand by Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;LP11&quot;/&gt;

Following his repatriation, Achenbach and Gernot PÃ¼tz established a &quot;[[government in exile]]&quot;, sometimes known as the Sealand Rebel Government, or Sealandic Rebel Government, in Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;LP11&quot;/&gt; Aschenbach's appointed successor, Johannes Seiger, continues to claim via his website that he is Sealand's legitimate ruling authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://principality-of-sealand.eu/welcome_e.html |title=Homepage of Sealandic Government in Exile |accessdate=13 November 2007 |publisher=Sealandic Government in Exile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1990 history===
[[Image:Sealandafterfire2.JPG|thumb|Sealand several months after the fire]]
*1997: Because of the massive number of illegal passports in circulation (estimated at 150,000),&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov.org&quot;/&gt; the Bates family revoked all Sealand passports, including those that they themselves had issued over the previous twenty-two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;LP11&quot;/&gt;
*2006: On the afternoon of 23 June 2006, the top platform of the Roughs Tower caught fire due to an electrical failure. A [[Royal Air Force]] rescue helicopter transferred one person to Ipswich hospital, directly from the tower. The [[Harwich]] [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] stood by the Roughs Tower until a local fire tug extinguished the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobleroi.co.uk/ScrapBook/Sealand_Fire/Sealand_Fire.html |title=Sealand on Fire |accessdate=25 June 2006 |author=Bob Le-Roi}}&lt;/ref&gt; All damage was repaired by November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchandeast.co.uk.nyud.net/Sealand%20update%204.html |title=Church and East renovation completion |accessdate=2006 |publisher=Church and East |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

===Film===
It has been reported that a film about Sealand is in production. It was originally pencilled-in for release in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen |first=Burke |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/09/23/sealand_satellite_movie/ |title=Sealand seeks satellite and movie deals |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=23 September 2007 |accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has yet to be released. Sean Sorensen has been named as the writer, and [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealandnews.com/category/sealand-the-movie/ |title=Sealand News |publisher=Sealand News |date= |accessdate=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Bates has verified this claim in an interview on YouTube.

An [[Cinema of Austria|Austrian]] [[documentary]] film called ''[[Empire Me]]'' focuses on the [[micronation]] movement and covers Sealand.

The film has been pushed back to at least 2012, according to recent interview on [[YouTube]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The film &quot;Hetalia: Paint it White&quot; features Sealand as a minor character with a functioning sea fortress, stating that if it &quot;helps the other countries, maybe they'll accept Sealand as a real country.&quot; Sealand also appears at the end of the movie, no longer a &quot;noppera&quot;.

===In music===
[[The Battle of Sealand]] is the first studio album from the American [[shoegaze]] band [[Airiel]]. It was released in August 2007 on Chicago-based Highwheel Records. The album is named after the Principality of Sealand. According to an article on the ''Sealand News'' website, the members of the band were granted the noble titles of Lord in recognition of naming their CD after the micronation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sealandnews.com/airiel-are-now-lords-of-sealand_157.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 30 September 2007, it was announced that they would be the first rock band to perform at Sealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sealandnews.com/literally-rocking-sealand_162.html ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcewire.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=33961&amp;hilite= |title=First live gig to rock Sealand |publisher=SourceWire |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concert did not take place.

In 2011, English art rock group [[Art Brut]] announced that they had written a song about the Principality of Sealand for their fourth studio album [[Brilliant! Tragic!]], produced by [[Pixies]] frontman [[Frank Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sentimentalistmag.com/2011/03/14/art-brut-release-fourth-album-brilliant-tragic-on-may-24th/ | title=Art Brut Release Fourth Album!

===Comics and animation===
In the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[Hetalia: Axis Powers]]'' by Hidekaz Himaruya, which features [[stereotype]]d [[moe anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] personifications of countries and empires, Sealand is a character. Sealand is described as the smallest character in the series, a reference to the fact it is, &quot;The smallest (unofficial) nation in the world&quot;. He is depicted as having short blond hair and wearing a blue and white sailor suit. His obscurity reaches far beyond the grasp of the real Sealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=Himaruya, Hidekaz|title=[[Hetalia: Axis Powers]]|volume=2|date=10 December 2008|publisher=[[Tokyopop]]|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
===Legal status===
The claim that Sealand is an independent sovereign state is based on the contention that a 1968 decision of an English court, in which it was held that Roughs Tower was in international waters and thus outside the jurisdiction of the domestic courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sealandgov.org/history.html | title=Official History of Sealand | accessdate = 12 January 2007|publisher=Government of Principality of Sealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international law]], the two most common schools of thought for the creation of statehood are the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive]] and [[declarative theory of statehood|declaratory]] theories of state creation. The constitutive theory was the standard nineteenth-century model of statehood, and the declaratory theory was developed in the twentieth century to address shortcomings of the constitutive theory. In the constitutive theory, a state exists exclusively via recognition by other states. The theory splits on whether this recognition requires &quot;diplomatic recognition&quot; or merely &quot;recognition of existence&quot;. No other state grants Sealand official recognition, but it has been argued by Bates that negotiations carried out by Germany constituted &quot;recognition of existence&quot;. In the declaratory theory of statehood, an entity becomes a state as soon as it meets the minimal criteria for statehood.  Therefore recognition by other states is purely &quot;declaratory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===As a statelike entity===
Irrespective of its legal status, Sealand is managed by the Bates family as if it were a recognised sovereign entity, and they are its hereditary [[royal family|royal]] rulers. Roy Bates styles himself &quot;Prince Roy&quot; and his wife &quot;Princess Joan&quot;.

Sealand's constitution was instituted in 1974. It consists of a [[preamble]] and seven articles. The preamble asserts Sealand's independence, while the articles variously deal with Sealand's status as a [[constitutional monarchy]], the empowerment of government bureaus, the role of an appointed, advisory [[senate]], the functions of an appointed, advisory legal [[tribunal]], a proscription against the [[Right to keep and bear arms|bearing of arms]] except by members of a designated &quot;Sealand Guard&quot;, the exclusive right of the sovereign to formulate [[foreign policy]] and alter the constitution, and the hereditary [[patrilinear]] succession of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muu.fi/amorph03/downloads/pdfs/principality_of_sealand.pdf |title=Information on the Principality of Sealand including constitution |accessdate=9 November 2007 |publisher=Amorph Summit of Micronations |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand's [[legal system]] is claimed to follow British [[common law]], and [[statute]]s take the form of [[decree]]s enacted by the sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandgov.com/notices.html |title=The Principality of Sealand statutory notices |accessdate=27 July 2006|publisher=Government of the Principality of Sealand |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand has issued [[passport]]s and has operated as a [[flag of convenience]] state, and it also holds the Guinness World Record for &quot;the smallest area to lay claim to nation status&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The anthem was composed by Londoner Basil Simonenko;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://david.national-anthems.net/sea.htm |title=Sealandic National Anthem |accessdate=15 November 2007 |publisher=Nationalanthems.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not have lyrics.

==Economy==
Sealand has been involved in several commercial operations, including the issuing of coins and postage stamps and the establishment of an offshore Internet hosting facility, or &quot;data haven&quot;. Sealand also has an official website and publishes an online newspaper, ''Sealand News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandnews.com |title=Sealand News |accessdate=11 November 2007 |publisher=Sealand News |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a number of amateur athletes &quot;represent&quot; Sealand in sporting events, including unconventional events like the egg throwing world championship, which the Sealand team won in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sealand News report on Egg Throwing Championship  |url=http://www.sealandnews.com/sealand-wins-sporting-accolade_207.html|publisher=Sealand News |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Sealand News'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sealand News report on Sealand (2008 film) |url=http://www.sealandnews.com/sealand-the-movie_15.html|publisher=Sealand News|date=28 February 2007 |accessdate=28 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a movie called ''Sealand'' is in development for release in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1223973/ |title=Overview on Sealand (2008 film)|accessdate=1 July 2007| publisher=The Internet Movie Database |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 11 February 2007, Sealand is also taking bookings for tourist visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.churchandeast.com/tourism.htm |title= Sealand tourist visits press release |accessdate=23 June 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a period, Sealand [[camouflage passport]]s were mass-manufactured and sold widely by a Spanish-based group believed{{Who|date=January 2009}} to be associated with the &quot;exile government&quot; under Seiger. These passports, which the Bates family say were not authorized by them,&lt;ref name=&quot;LP11&quot;/&gt; were linked to several high-profile crimes. All passports were revoked by Roy Bates in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;LP11&quot;/&gt;

There was a 2007 [[census]], which was published in early 2008 that can be found here [http://www.muu.fi/amorph03/downloads/pdfs/principality_of_sealand.pdf].   

After [[HavenCo]] unexpected collapse, Sealand's government is in the process of building a new online casino. The casino is expected to be opened by the end of 2012, and would employ about 30 employees all of whom would work in Sealand. However Sealand Casino would not potentially be able to expanded due to Sealand's smaller size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sealandcasino.com/ |title=Official home of the online |publisher=Sealand Casino |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
After the 2006 fire, both towers were gutted and still to this day all that is left are a few lights and loose wires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sealandgov.org/Donations.html/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the platform has been completely redone, with railings, floors and underpadding to keep birds from nesting under the platform (finish early 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isle of Craro |url=http://www.privateislandsonline.com/scotland.htm/ |title=land for sale in scotland |publisher=Privateislandsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has been completely remodeled and expanded, this includes a new roof/helicopter pad with new directing lights and a solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isle of Craro |url=http://www.privateislandsonline.com/scotland.htm/ |title=land for sale in scotland |publisher=Privateislandsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building includes a two bedroom one bathroom, kitchen, living room,  Royal ''Palace'' , and a one bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, employees' suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isle of Craro |url=http://www.privateislandsonline.com/scotland.htm/ |title=land for sale in scotland |publisher=Privateislandsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building also has a one room chapel, public bathroom, security office, [[Parliament]] office/rec room, small store, and the office of the Bureau of Domestic and International Affairs (finish late 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isle of Craro |url=http://www.privateislandsonline.com/scotland.htm/ |title=land for sale in scotland |publisher=Privateislandsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in mid 2008 a new generator was replaced with two new life boats, pulley system and a repair job on the artillery gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Isle of Craro |url=http://www.privateislandsonline.com/scotland.htm/ |title=land for sale in scotland |publisher=Privateislandsonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sealand Coins Flag.jpg|250px|thumb|Sealandic coins, from left to right: Half Dollar, Silver One Dollar and Quarter Dollar]]
Several dozen different Sealand coins have been minted since 1972. In the early 1990s, Achenbach's German group also produced a coin, featuring a likeness of &quot;Prime Minister Seiger&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imperial-collection.net/sealand03.html |title=The Imperial Collection&amp;nbsp;â Principality of Sealand|publisher=Empire of Atlantium |accessdate=11 November 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand's coins and postage stamps are denominated in &quot;Sealand dollars&quot;, which it deems to be at [[purchasing power parity|parity]] with the U.S. dollar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandgov.org/About.html |title=Principality of Sealand|publisher=Government of the Principality of Sealand |accessdate=17 July 2008 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sealand first issued [[postage stamp]]s in 1969, and issues through 1977.  No further stamps were produced until 2010.  Sealand is not a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]], therefore its inward address is a [[PO Box]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/addressfinder;jsessionid=I1BCVKJXHDFL0FB2IGEUQEQUHRAYOQ2K?catId=400145&amp;pageId=pcaf_a_one_result_rm&amp;_requestid=116508&amp;gear=postcode |title=Royal Mail address for Sealand|publisher=Royal Mail |accessdate=10 November 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once it is mailed to Sealand's tourist and government office it will then be brought to Sealand, Sealand only has one street address ''The Row''.&lt;ref name=&quot;sealandgov1&quot;&gt;[http://www.sealandgov.org/notices/pn03710.html/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HavenCo===
{{Main|HavenCo}}
In 2000, worldwide publicity was created about Sealand following the establishment of a new entity called [[HavenCo]], a [[data haven]], which effectively took control of Roughs Tower itself; however, [[Ryan Lackey]], HavenCo's founder, later quit and claimed that Bates had lied to him by keeping the 1990â1991 court case{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} from him and that, as a result, he had lost the money he had invested in the venture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In November 2008, operations of HavenCo ceased without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://securityandthe.net/2008/11/18/havenco-data-center-offline/ HavenCo âdata centerâ offline?], Security and the Net, 18 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

These athletes take part in various sports, such as [[Miniature golf|mini-golf]], [[Association football|football]], [[fencing]], and [[Subbuteo|table football]], although Sealand's fencing team competes out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandfootball.dk/index.asp |title=Homepage of the Sealand National Football Team |accessdate=9 November 2007|publisher=Sealand National Football Team |language=Danish |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sealand is a provisional member of the [[Nouvelle FÃ©dÃ©ration-Board]], a football sanctioning body for non-recognised states and states not members of [[FIFA]].

Sealand claims that its first official athlete was Darren Blackburn of [[Oakville, Ontario]], Canada, who was appointed in 2003. Blackburn has represented Sealand at a number of local sporting events, including [[Marathon (sport)|marathons]] and off-trail races.&lt;ref name=&quot;international1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandgov.org/notices/pn02504.html |title=Principality Notice PN 025/04: International Sporting Activities update. |accessdate=15 November 2007 |publisher=Government of the Principality of Sealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sealand's official U-20 National Football team is coached by American high school soccer coach Rory Miller and is mostly composed of players from his current and recent past roster at [[Muhlenberg North High School]] in [[Greenville, Kentucky]].

Sealand is also represented at the [[Destination ImagiNation]] Global Finals by the team from [[Dobbs Ferry High School]] in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York]].
