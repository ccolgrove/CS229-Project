The '''Pandora''' is a [[handheld game console]] designed to take advantage of existing [[open source software]] and to be a target for [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew development]]. It is developed by OpenPandora, which is made up of former distributors and community members of the [[GP32]] and [[GP2X]] handhelds.

When announcing the system, the designers of Pandora stated that it would be more powerful than any [[Mobile device|handheld]] [[video game]] [[video game console|console]] that had yet existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;openpandora_org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openpandora.org |title=Official OpenPandora Site |publisher=OpenPandora |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes several features that no handheld game consoles have previously had, making it a cross between a handheld game console and a [[subnotebook]]. 

== History ==

Development of the Pandora began when Craig Rothwell, Fatih Kilic, Michael Mrozek and (later) Michael Weston teamed up and planned a portable system that would excel in the areas where they thought the [[GP32]] and [[GP2X]] systems (from [[Gamepark]] and [[Gamepark Holdings]] respectively) were flawed.&lt;ref name=Pocketgamer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Various/Pandora/news.asp?c=8667 |title=Why the Pandora came to be |publisher=Pocketgamer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pandora was designed based on ideas and suggestions contributed by GP32X forum members, with the goal of creating the ultimate open source handheld device.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARM Press Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arm.com/iqonline/news/marketnews/20883.html |title=ARM Press Release |publisher=Arm.com |date=2008-05-09 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final case and keymat design was made by DaveC, who was known on the forums for custom hardware modifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openpandora.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113&amp;Itemid=22&amp;lang=en DaveC], Pandora&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the console had been delayed many times. Originally it was estimated by the developers that the console would be released in 2007. OpenPandora began taking pre-orders for one batch of 4000 devices on September 30, 2008&lt;ref&gt;Patel, Nilay.

== Overview ==
[[File:Pandora-latest-080508.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The render of the Pandora, which was computer-created by OpenPandora in late 2008]]
The Pandora is designed to be a handheld game console with high-end [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] capabilities, but may also be run as a low-power full-featured Linux desktop. The system by default comes with a [[Linux]] [[operating system|OS]] based on [[ÃngstrÃ¶m distribution|ÃngstrÃ¶m]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=62&amp;t=44171&amp;hl=&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=648859 |title=Will Pandora Be Able To Run Debian?| work = GP32 GP2X Pandora | publisher = The Wiz |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interface is custom themed to fit the small form factor and touchscreen, analogue joystick, and keyboard-based inputs available. Users can install and run their own desktop environment if they choose. Users may even install other Linux distributions like [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|I47F87FeLV8|Ubuntu on Pandora devboard (2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuvoo.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page|title=Neuvoo accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; themselves.

One of Pandora's major intended uses is for homebrew gaming and for the emulation of older computer systems and video game consoles, which is possible through efficient use of the resources made available by the [[Texas Instruments]] [[Texas_Instruments_OMAP#OMAP3|OMAP 3530]] [[System-on-a-chip|SoC]]. The Pandora developers have already shown working emulators for [[Dreamcast]], [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mupen64 for Pandora&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?/topic/49358-mupen64plus/ |title=Official 'Mupen64Plus |publisher=Gp32x.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Amiga]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Atari Jaguar]] and [[Sega Mega Drive]] software,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pandora developer blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openpandora.org/blog.php |title=Pandora Development Blog |publisher=OpenPandora |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pandora is thought by its developers to have the potential to emulate most if not all machines older than the Dreamcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official 'semi-speculative' emulator list&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?showtopic=41897 |title=Official 'semi-speculative' emulator list |publisher=Gp32x.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device is also intended for use as a portable media playback device with a storage capacity of up to 128 GB of data (64GB SDXC cards) across two SD memory card slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/Craigix/statuses/17513441071 |title=Confirmed: 64GB SD cards work on the Pandora. |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pandora uses standard libraries such as [[OpenGL ES]] and [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] which are freely available, allowing anyone who wishes the ability to develop for the system. Many developers from the GP2x community have publicly stated that they will be developing applications for the new system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The Pandora is compatible with [[Debian]] packages built for the [[ARM architecture]] using [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]. A [[Git (software)|Git]] repository offers the latest kernel source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openpandora.org/blog.php OpenPandora Blog post, &quot;The Good the Bad and the Ugly&quot;] by EvilDragon {{Dead link|date=August 2011}} [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:zvABZhFlFm8J:openpandora.org/index.php%3Fview%3Darticle%26catid%3D2%253Ablog%26id%3D32%26format%3Dpdf%26option%3Dcom_content%26Itemid%3D2%26lang%3Dtr+OpenPandora+Blog+post,+%22The+Good+the+Bad+and+the+Ugly%22+by+EvilDragon&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=au&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiqBiCrlUEYi5lS5ac7Kq-cQhWNmIhk-eXRo-DyV5Ybr4Nw6h-kKiE1WA1VfU_--0eW7LJ222TycN_koVabNBeHxGlEXCwjq_ih0VslDg69tmeQpBokOdjlYWuuKlZZL8U4kFKz&amp;sig=AHIEtbS9WCVr_BTUcABdTeyjd_VqFwSXVg Archived Version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lists on the community-maintained Pandora Wiki keep track of new software releases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandorawiki.org/Emulator_list Pandora Wiki: Emulator list]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandorawiki.org/Games Pandora Wiki: Games]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandorawiki.org/Software_projects Pandora Wiki: Software projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Most, but not all, Pandora software is uploaded to either the [http://apps.open-pandora.org/ Pandora Apps], the [http://dl.openhandhelds.org/cgi-bin/pandora.cgi Pandora File Archive] or [http://repo.openpandora.org Pandora Repo] websites. The Pandora File Archive existed first and is run by Michael Mrozek. Pandora Apps was launched by Craig Rothwell in May 2010, and is designed for viewing on the Pandora's smaller screen resolution.

The Pandora Repo (yet unnamed) was developed by a member the community with help from the community. Its use has been adopted quickly as it tends to have the latest software releases first; The reason being it makes things really easy for the developer as it doesn't require him/her to enter any details about the application, these are automatically acquired from the application itself.

The Pandora Repo is also the first that uses the community created [http://pandorawiki.org/PND_repository_specification REPO specifications]&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandorawiki.org/PND_repository_specification REPO specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; which allows native clients to get applications from the pandora repo without actually visiting the website (much akin to [[Synaptic (software)]] or [[App Store (iOS)]]).
