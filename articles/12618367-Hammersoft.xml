==Travel route==
A number of highways in southern [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]] roughly follow the original route.

In Alberta, the trail follows Highways [[Alberta Highway 3|3]], [[Alberta Highway 4|4]], [[Alberta Highway 61|61]], [[Alberta Highway 889|889]], and [[Alberta Highway 501|501]].

In [[Saskatchewan]], [[Saskatchewan Highway 13|Highway 13]] is designated as Red Coat Trail. The travel corridor from the Manitoba&amp;mdash;Saskatchewan border to [[Winnipeg]] follows [[Manitoba Highway 2|Manitoba PTH 2]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;Winnipeg&quot;&gt;Winnipeg: Established 1738 as [[Fort Rouge (fortification)|Fort Rouge]]; renamed 1822 [[Fort Garry]]; incorporated in 1873 as the City of [[Winnipeg]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Micro&quot;/&gt;

Lethbridge also had other names such as steep banks, the place of black rocks, painted rock, red painted rock, medicine stone, where they slaughtered the Cree, the coal Bank, and Sheran's Ferry crossing amongst others.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nineteenth&quot;/&gt;  Pioneers travelled the pioneer trails across the grasslands during the 19th century created by travellers, first nations and fur traders.  The grasslands area of today was still forested in the 19th century and land would need to be cleared and broken for agricultural homesteads and roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiger Hills&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century southern Saskatchewan was known as an extension of the ''Greater Yellow Grass Marsh''.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada&quot;/&gt;  The Dominion Land surveyors marked the quarter sections of Manitoba in 1874â1875 and of Saskatchewan in 1881 and homesteaders began tilling their homesteads and fencing their quarter-sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiger Hills&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyle&quot;/&gt;  Travel transferred from prairie trail to road allowances set by the surveyors.  Rural municipalities set road bosses and crews to grade the roads and to fill in the low areas. Walking plows would till the soil that was to be moved by the fresnoes, which was a scraper pulled with two horses.  Those who worked on roads would have lowered taxes.  Later crews would work with four-horse scrapers followed by crawler tractors which could pull even larger graders and scrapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  The rural municipality would work out a system of road work for the various ratepayers, and pathmasters or road crew foremen were appointed to oversee the statute labour conducted. Road sections were constructed from one stopping place to the next, where a stopping place was a settler's home who had built additional accommodation for travelers. Ferries were primarily used to cross rivers and creeks, and these often afforded stopping places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiger Hills&quot;/&gt; Approximately 1890 the piers were set for the first highway bridge across the [[Oldman River|Belly River]].&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The current name for the Belly River is the Oldman River&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nineteenth&quot;/&gt;  The first car in Alberta was owned by F.W.

&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1920s most residents had cars for transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyle&quot;/&gt;  In the 1920s roads were gravelled, gravel loaded by shovel, and hauled with horse and wagon, so that automobiles would not become mired down in mud in the low-lying areas.  However, the gravel was too thick, and loose gravel meant horses needed to be shoed and cars would careen wildly over the road, and so therefore the grass trail alongside the road was used instead.  The Department of Public Works fixed this problem by mixing clay with the gravel.  This era was followed by four-horse teams pulling a sulky plow across the roads, eliminating ruts and forming a hard and level surface to drive upon.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bend&quot;/&gt;  The 1920s were indeed years of road work; however in these pioneering days there was little background or guidelines to go by.  Early road work consisted of levelling roads and filling in low spots which would collect water to make travel easier by the first automobiles.  Road ways and road allowances could either be purchased or leased from the homesteader who was proving up that farmland.  A challenge to rural municipality councilors was the removal of rocks from the road allowance.  Government grants were set out for road construction where the ratepayers of the rural municipality came together in road camps for improvements and there were also Road Day Competitions held. The road would divert around sloughs, hills, and other diversions to make the travel easier for horse and cart.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Bend&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921 Highway 13 was graded up through the low areas around the Carlyle area.  A foreman could earn between [[Canada dollar|C$]]6.00 and 7.00 for a day, a graderman could earn between $4.50 and 5.00 per day, labourers in 1921 would earn $4.00 to 450 per day.  A driver of a single team of horses could earn between $7.50 and 88.00 per day, and a driver with a double team of horses could earn up to $10.00 to 10.50 in a day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyle&quot;/&gt;  The Relief Roadwork Program of 1928 which initiated roadwork on Highway 13.  Those local residents with four horses and a grader initially maintained the highway.  During the depression years of the dirty thirties, roadwork continued and the highways were widened, gravelled and paved.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadillac&quot;/&gt;  Gravel was laid on highways in the early 1930s which alleviated being mired in the mud during rainy weather; however during dry weather, gravel roads produced great quantities of dust, reducing visibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiger Hills&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyle&quot;/&gt;  In 1930, the Manitoba provincial government constructed Highway 2 with hard surfacing to follow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tiger Hills&quot;/&gt;  Road crew wages changed to hourly in 1932, where a foreman of a road crew could now earn 35 cents an hour, a man with a two-horse team 45 to 50 cents an hour and a driver with four horses could earn 65 to 70 cents an hour, and labourers could now bring in 25 cents an hour.  In Saskatchewan, [[Carlyle, Sasaktchean|Carlyle]] was established for example as the area headquarters which supervised six Department of Highway road crews along Highway 13.  The crews would remove snow and ice during winter months, and during the summer months conduct road allowance mowing, ensure drainage, attend to sign and guard rail repair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlyle&quot;/&gt;  During the 1940s Pearce, Alberta, was home to a CPR station, village, and  the British Commonseath Air Training Program featuring the No. 36 Elementary Flying School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowsnest&quot;/&gt;  In 1943, tractor operator scrapers termed tumble bugs, were available to rural municipalities.
