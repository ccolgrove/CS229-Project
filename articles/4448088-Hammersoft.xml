&quot;33&quot; follows ''Galactica'' and her civilian fleet as they are forced to contend with constant Cylon pursuit for days without sleep. The episode was lauded by both cast and crew in addition to winning the 2005 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].

==Plot==
Having fled the besieged [[Ragnar Anchorage]] at the end of [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|the miniseries]], the convoy of refugee [[starship|spaceship]]s is relentlessly pursued and attacked by [[Cylon Basestar]]s.  The colonial fleet must execute a [[FTL (Battlestar Galactica)|faster-than-light]] (FTL) jump every 33 minutes to escape the Cylons, who consistently arrive at the new jump coordinates approximately 33 minutes later.  After 130.35 hours and 237 jumps, the fleet's crew and passengers, particularly those aboard [[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|''Galactica'']], have been [[sleep deprivation|operating without sleep]] while facing the strain of nearly constant military action.  Most of the episode focuses on the perils of the constant escape, but the daily business of life is touched upon: citizens trying to re-establish contact with loved ones, the spreading news that [[Cylon (reimagining)#Humanoid Cylons|Cylons now resemble humans]], and the deterioration of crews from stress and fatigue.  President [[Laura Roslin]] has conducted a census of survivors and has the sum of 49,998 souls marked on her [[whiteboard]] aboard ''Colonial One''.

Meanwhile, on [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]], [[Karl Agathon|Lt. Karl Agathon]] ([[aviator call sign|call sign]] &quot;Helo&quot;) fails to elude Cylon patrols and is captured and taken prisoner by a [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]].  Helo is &quot;rescued&quot; from his Cylon captors by a [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Eight]] in the guise of his crewmate [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii|Lt. Sharon &quot;Boomer&quot; Valerii]].

Back at the fleet, the ''Olympic Carrier'', a commercial passenger vessel with 1,345 souls aboard, goes missing during the 238th consecutive jump.  With the ship assumed lost to the Cylons, the attacks unexpectedly cease, allowing the fleet some respite.  Three hours later however, the ''Olympic Carrier'' suddenly rejoins the fleet.  Baltar, pushed by his [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head Six|internal Number Six]], convinces President Roslin that the ship may have been infiltrated with Cylons and now poses a threat to the fleet's safety.  When the Cylon attacks resume 33 minutes after the ''Olympic Carrier''{{'}}s return, ''Galactica'' also detects active [[nuclear weapon]]s aboard the passenger liner, which has begun to disregard orders from [[William Adama|Commander Adama]].  President Roslin and Commander Adama order [[Lee Adama|Capt. Lee &quot;Apollo&quot; Adama]] and [[Kara Thrace|Lt. Kara &quot;Starbuck&quot; Thrace]] to destroy it.  After hesitating to fire on what is ostensibly a civilian ship, the colonial officers destroy the ship while the rest of the colonial fleet jumps away.  Baltar's internal Number Six explains to him that God is looking after his interests, implying that a scientist on the ''Olympic Carrier,'' who had tried to contact Roslin, had knowledge of Baltar's unwitting collusion with the Cylon attack on [[Twelve Colonies|the colonies]].

After the fleet's last jump, the Cylons do not return, and the President's survivor whiteboard aboard ''[[Colonial One]]'' is updated with one additional soul (to 47,973) with the birth of the fleet's first child aboard the ''Rising Star''âa boy.

David Eick found the episode to be a &quot;standalone concept&quot; that did not require having seen the miniseries to understand it.  Because the miniseries ended &quot;at a very happy place&quot;, starting the series in the middle of a crisis without explanation, and showing the audience that &quot;actually, while you&amp;mdash;the audience&amp;mdash;were away, really bad things have been happening&quot; made for a much more intriguing and interesting story.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary0212&quot;&gt;{{cite video

Moore explained on his [[blog]] that the number 33 had no hidden meaning or significance, only that he felt it sufficiently long to allow minor functions like snacking, showering, or [[cat nap]]ping, but was too short to allow anybody to gain any meaningful [[sleep]] and recharge their batteries.  Further, Moore intentionally gave the number no meaning to avoid creating and inserting unnecessary [[technobabble]] into a drama-driven episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDM20050113&quot; /&gt;

[[Executive producer]] [[David Eick]] opined that &quot;33&quot; was the &quot;[[silver bullet]]&quot; that ultimately tipped the scales in their favor and convinced the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] to pick up the series.  The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that ''Battlestar Galactica'' would fall victim to the same trappings of [[space opera]] as other television properties (''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'', ''[[Stargate]]'').  Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's [[audio commentary|DVD commentary]].  First, &quot;33&quot; went into [[Gaius Baltar]]'s ([[James Callis]]) mind and visited his house on [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica|Caprica]] (shot in [[Lions Bay, British Columbia]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary3229&quot;&gt;{{cite video

With [[sleep deprivation]] one of the major plot points of the episode, actor [[Edward James Olmos]] (William Adama) liaised with an expert on the subject and the crew to best depict the actual effects realistically.  Following up, director [[Michael Rymer]] gave each main cast member a specific symptom to play up, so as to avoid repetition on screen.  Olmos and several other cast members took their study a step further, to immerse themselves by restricting their sleep patterns to about three hours a night to emphasize what their expert was imparting.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsgtoc&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bassom | first = David | editor = Adam &quot;Adama&quot; Newell | title = Battlestar Galactica: The Official Companion | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | isbn = 978-1-84576-097-7 | page = 46 | date = 2005-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary1707&quot; /&gt;

In the episode's DVD commentary, Moore and Rymer related how there were endless discussion about the clocks to feature in this episode.  Concerns over [[digital clock|digital]] versus [[analog clock|analog]], size and shape, the ratio of digital to analog clocks, whether they should run forwards or backwards, and whether any labels should be [[stencil]]ed or hand-drawn were all brought up.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a scene cut from &quot;33&quot; where we saw Laura being given her copy of the photo along with a card that said it was taken on the roof of the capitol building on Aerilon during the attack. The photo was inspired by the famous shot of the fire-fighters raising the flag at Ground Zero that became iconic. I thought the Colonies would have their own version of this -- a snapshot taken in the moment that becomes a symbol of the day they can never forget and of all they had lost. The photo itself is of a soldier falling to his knees (possibly shot or simply overcome by emotion) as he stands on the rooftop over looking the devastation of his city, while the Colonial flag waves at the edge of frame. The inscription below the photo on Laura's plaque reads, &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; in itself a reference to the inscription on the watch presented to John Wayne's character in &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  Other cut scenes included one shot in the pilots' [[head (watercraft)|head]], showing the pilots &quot;wrecked and exhausted [...] with an exchange between Starbuck and Apollo&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary1416&quot;&gt;{{cite video

As originally written and shot, when Apollo ([[Jamie Bamber]]) fires on the ''Olympic Carrier'', it was made clear that he sees people inside.  Moore wrote the scene to be strong and clear that the characters were making the decision to fire on the passenger liner in full awareness of the consequences to illustrate and emphasize &quot;the uncompromising nature of the show.&quot;  This was an &quot;enormous fight&quot; between Moore and the network, with the latter feeling this was another scene that was &quot;too dark&quot; and had the potential to turn away audiences; the network further implied that if the scene were left intact, they may have been compelled to air the episodes out of order.  To placate the network, Moore and Eick changed the ending of the episode and &quot;cheated&quot;; instead, when Apollo flies by the ''Olympic Carrier'', it is unclear whether or not there is anybody inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;commentary2838&quot;&gt;{{cite video
