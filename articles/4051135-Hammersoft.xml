'''Frontier Communications Northwest, Inc.''' is a former Verizon operating company owned by [[Frontier Communications]].

==History==
===GTE Ownership===
Verizon Northwest was founded in 1964 as the '''General Telephone Company of the Northwest, Inc.''' and later became '''GTE Northwest, Inc.'''

GTE Northwest originally served [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. GTE, unlike the [[Bell Operating Company|Bell Operating Companies]], transferred states from operating company to operating company. GTE Northwest changes are as follows:
*In 1993, GTE acquired [[Continental Telephone]] (ConTel); as a result, ConTel operations in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho were placed under control of GTE Northwest.
*In 1994, GTE sold ConTel of Idaho to Citizens Communications (which later became [[Frontier Communications]]).
*In 1995, GTE sold operations in [[Montana]] to Citizens Communications, and absorbed ConTel of Oregon into GTE's existing Oregon operations.

===Verizon ownership===
In 2000, [[Bell Atlantic]] acquired GTE, forming [[Verizon]]. As a result, GTE Northwest was renamed &quot;Verizon Northwest, Inc.&quot; It continued to provide local telephone service to former GTE regions and some ConTel regions in [[Idaho]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Oregon]].

===Sale to Frontier===
Verizon Northwest, along with several other Verizon wireline operating companies, were acquired by [[Frontier Communications]] on July 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NDc0NDl8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&amp;t=1 Frontier Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name was changed to '''Frontier Communications Northwest, Inc.''' In a way, this reunites former regions in Idaho &amp; Montana (such as ConTel of Idaho) with its former operating company.
