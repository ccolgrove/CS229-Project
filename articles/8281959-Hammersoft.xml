'''Thornton Township High School''', often simply referred to as '''Thornton''' is a public high school founded in 1899.  The school is located in [[Harvey, Illinois]] one of the [[Chicago Southland|south suburbs]] of the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]].  The school is one of three schools administered by [[Thornton Township High Schools District 205]].  It is occasionally confused with the two other similarly named schools in the district:  [[Thornridge High School]] and [[Thornwood High School]].

A predominantly [[African American]] high school, Thornton is perhaps best known for its many alumni who have been successful in both the performing arts and athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 State Report Card p.1&quot; /&gt;

==History==
The site for Thornton Township High School was decided by a special election on May 28, 1898, where Harvey was selected over Dolton by a 1,504 to 1,123 vote;  with the estimate of the school's cost being $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Harvey Wins School Site'', May 29, 1898, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 3;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Oscar L. Murray was the architect of the building that by October 1898 was now costing $35,000, and had plans that included physical and biological laboratories, a library, gymnasium, a 280 seat assembly room, bicycle, and lunch rooms.&lt;ref&gt;''Trustees Oblige Supt. Andrews'', October 22, 1898, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 5;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

By May, 1899, the plans had firmed up to include a two story structure with basement, with an interior to be finished in [[Quercus rubra|red oak]].  Heat would be provided by [[Steam heating|steam]], with electric fans and an automated clock and signal system.  The main floor assembly room was expanded to seat 700.  Construction was set to begin in June, with completion in October.&lt;ref&gt;''Thornton Township High School, Harvey, Ill.'', May 28, 1899, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 10;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The original building, located at 154th Street and Columbia Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;''Harvey School Bonds Sold'', July 9, 1899, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 8;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, Thornton was one of nine schools (and the only south suburban school) invited to found what would become the Suburban League, which mostly consisted of schools like Thornton which had formerly been members of the Cook County High School League.&lt;ref&gt;''Preps To Form New League'', May 24, 1913, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. 14;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

1928 saw 16 year old [[Betty Robinson]] (between her junior and senior years at the school) not only win the very first Olympic gold medal awarded to a woman in the 100 meters (at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]), but set a world record which would stand for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, William, ''Chicago Girl Breaks World's 100 Meter Record'', August 1, 1928, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'';  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[World War II]], like many high schools, Thornton made changes to accommodate the war effort.  Evening classes for adults started in 1942 to begin training people for necessary war jobs.&lt;ref&gt;''Thornton Night Classes Enroll 452 in War Study'', September 6, 1942, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. SW3;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1943, the school was open 87 hours each week, and had been converted over almost exclusively to wartime training.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton High School Adapts Studies To War'', February 28, 1943, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p. SW2;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Additions were made to the building in 1912 ($140,000), 1927 ($345,000), and 1937 ($300,000).&lt;ref&gt;''Thornton High Asks $300,000 To Build Annex'', September 27, 1936, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p.

SW2;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A third floor was added in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;''Start Building Thornton Twp.

SW7;  accessed ''ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849â1986)'';  November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  1949 saw the addition of a new physical education facility, including a [[natatorium]], wrestling rooms, locker facilities, and class rooms for health classes, in addition to two gyms, one of which could seat 3,500 for basketball games.&lt;ref&gt;''Tell details of Harvey's School Gym'', December 5, 1948, ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', p.

==Athletics==
Thornton's sports teams, which are referred to as the Wildcats, compete in the [[Southwest Suburban Conference]], though for many years competed in the now defunct [[SICA (high school sports)|South Inter-Conference Association (SICA)]].  The teams also compete in state championship series sponsored by the [[Illinois High School Association]] (IHSA).  The school colors are purple and white.
