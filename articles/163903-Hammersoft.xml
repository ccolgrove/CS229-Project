'''Bernard Hill''' (born 17 December 1944) is a British [[actor]] of film, stage and television. In a career spanning thirty years, he is best known for playing Yosser Hughes, the troubled 'hard man' whose life is falling apart in Alan Bleasdale's groundbreaking 1980s TV drama, ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. He is also known for a number of iconic roles in blockbuster films, including Captain [[Edward John Smith]] in ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', [[King ThÃ©oden]] in [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], and as the Warden of [[San Quentin Prison]] in the [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]''. Hill is the only actor to have appeared in more than one of the three films awarded 11 [[Academy Award|Oscars]], and one of only three actors to have starred in more than one film grossing more than [[1000000000 (number)|$1 billion]] [[United States dollar|USD]], namely: ''Titanic'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (the others being [[Orlando Bloom]] who also starred in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', as well as ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and [[Johnny Depp]] who also starred in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'', as well as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''). Hill has appeared in three films which have won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''Titanic'', and ''The Return of the King''.

==Early life==
Hill was born in [[Blackley]], [[Manchester]], [[England]]. He attended [[Xaverian College]] although at the time it was known as &quot;''Xaverian School''&quot;, and then Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama at the same time as [[Richard Griffiths]]. He graduated  with a diploma in theatre in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/going_out/films/2003/03/bernard_hill.shtml |title=Manchester Films - Bernard Hill - a biography |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===''Boys from the Blackstuff''===
Hill first came to prominence in Britain through his [[Yosser Hughes]], a [[Liverpool]] [[working class]] man ultimately driven to the edge by an uncaring system, in [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s [[BBC]] ''[[Play for Today]]'', ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff#The Black Stuff|The Black Stuff]]'' and its more famous series sequel (also by Bleasdale), ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; His character's much-repeated phrase ''Gizza job'' (&quot;''Give us a job''&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; became popular with protesters against [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government, because of the high unemployment of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23603238-details/Out+of+work+-+and+this+time+it+won+t+just+be+Yosser+who+will+feel+the+pain/article.do |title=Out of work - and this time it wonât just be Yosser who will feel the pain &amp;#124; News |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his bemused brood of kids never let out of his sight, Bernard Hill's powerful depiction of a man crumbling before the audience's eyes brought him numerous awards but, as he later revealed, almost &quot;''drove him to the edge of insanity''&quot;.

===Other works ===
Hill then appeared as Sergeant Putnam in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), directed by [[Richard Attenborough]]. Though Hill didnât figure prominently in the cast, he benefited from being part of an Oscar-winning film. Next up for Hill was [[Roger Donaldson]]âs ''[[The Bounty]]'' (1984), a fourth dramatisation of the famed mutiny on [[HMS Bounty]].

He had previously taken smaller parts in a number of British television dramas, appearing as the no-nonsense soldier of [[Caligula]]'s bodyguard, who, after the assassination of that emperor [[Gratus]] in the acclaimed ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', and as [[Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York]] in the BBC's 1982 productions of Shakespeare's ''Henry VI'' plays.

In 1985, he played the lead role in a TV dramatisation of John Lennon's life, ''A Journey in the Life''. In addition to TV roles, Hill appeared on stage in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', and the title roles in ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[A View from the Bridge]]''.

Hill starred alongside acting greats, including [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], as well as [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Liam Neeson]]. Hill then received critical acclaim for his performance as Joe Bradshaw in ''[[Shirley Valentine (film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989), about a [[Liverpool]] housewife ([[Pauline Collins]]) who was a former anti-establishment rebel and engages in an extramarital affair. Hill added more prominent films to his resume, including ''[[Mountains of the Moon (film)|Mountains of the Moon]]'' (1990), ''[[Skallagrigg]]'' (1994) and ''[[Madagascar Skin]]'' (1995).

In the mid-1990s, Hill began appearing in films more regularly. His first major role in ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]'' (1996), starring [[Val Kilmer]] as a bridge-building engineer who must trust a big game hunter ([[Michael Douglas]]) despite their mutual animosity. Hill then went down with the ship when he played [[Edward John Smith|Captain E.J. Smith]] on the ill-fated ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' (1997), by [[James Cameron]], whom Hill got along with quite well - an experience most working on the film did not have. Being in the biggest grossing film of all time attracted attention to his career, as Hill became more sought-after for more prominent parts.

Hill played Philos in ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' (2002), starring [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] and [[Kelly Hu]].

Hill became known to a worldwide audience when he was cast in the role of [[King ThÃ©oden]] of [[Rohan]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] based on [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] novel of the same name. Before casting him as King ThÃ©oden, director Peter Jackson considered Hill for the part of [[Gandalf]]. When he was due to leave the set at the end of production, Jackson gave Hill two gifts, ThÃ©oden's helmet and sword [[Herugrim]].

At the 2006 [[BAFTA TV Awards]] and [[International Emmy Award]], Hill was nominated for his portrayal of [[David Blunkett]] in the one-off satirical drama, ''A Very Social Secretary''.

More recently, he held a minor role in the 2008 film ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'', as the commanding general of the [[Germany|German]] Afrika Korp X Panzer Division, and as a voice actor for Sir Walter Beck in ''[[Fable III]]'' (2010).

Hill has been the narrator in many television documentaries.

Due to his affinity and links to the region, along with his extensive CV in film, Hill was recently announced as a new patron and judge of the [[Norwich Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norwichfilmfestival.co.uk/one-more-judge-announced&lt;/ref&gt;, due to be held in March 2012.

==Personal life==
Hill currently lives in [[Suffolk]]. He is married, and has a son named Gabriel.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;
