The '''2011 Saudi Arabian protests''' have been influenced by the [[Arab Spring]] that started with the 2011 [[Tunisian revolution]]. One of the main online organisers of a planned 11 March &quot;Day of Rage&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;saudirage11March&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;torontostar_rev_longing&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_rage_womensrights&quot; /&gt; Faisal Ahmed Abdul-Ahad&lt;ref name=&quot;handelsblatt_Abdul-Ahad&quot; /&gt; (or Abdul-Ahadwas&lt;ref name=&quot;DPA_Abdul-Ahadwas&quot; /&gt;), was alleged to have been killed by [[Ministry of Interior (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi security forces]] on 2 March,&lt;ref name=&quot;DPA_Abdul-Ahadwas&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSNewscast_Abdul-Ahadwas&quot; /&gt; by which time one of the [[Facebook]] groups discussing the plans had over 26,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;eudigest_26k_FB&quot; /&gt;

Small protests over [[labor rights]] took place in April in front of government ministry buildings in [[Riyadh]], [[Taâif]] and [[Tabuk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;presstv_literacy_5April&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ThReut_10April_univ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArabNews_10April_univ&quot; /&gt; Protests, made up mainly of [[Shia]] protesters,&lt;ref name=&quot;pressTV_17March_4kQatif&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arabtimes_4kQatifetc_18March&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135126/20110416/saudi-arabia-shias-protest-sunni.htm&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in [[Qatif]] and smaller cities in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] such as [[al-Awamiyah]], and [[Hofuf]] in April and May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThReut_demosillegal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PressTV_5May&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;presstv_13May&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PressTV_20May&quot; /&gt; They called for the release of prisoners, for the [[Peninsula Shield Force]] to be withdrawn from Bahrain,&lt;ref name=&quot;KSA_ThReut_16March&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KSA_ThReut_17March&quot; /&gt; for equal representation in key offices and for reforms in political positions, as they feel marginalised.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBT_1415April&quot; /&gt;

Women organised a [[Facebook]] [[women's suffrage]] campaign called &quot;Baladi&quot;, stating that Saudi Arabian law gives women electoral rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;GulfNews_women2325April&quot; /&gt; In April, women in [[Jeddah]], Riyadh and [[Dammam]] tried to register as electors for the [[Saudi Arabian municipal elections, 2011|22 September municipal elections]] despite officials stating that women could not participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GulfNews_women2325April&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJE_women2325April&quot; /&gt; In May and June, [[Manal al-Sharif]] and other women organised a women's right-to-drive campaign, with the main action to take place on 17 June. Al-Sharif drove a car in May and was detained on 22 May and from 23â30 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;France24_huwaiderfilmed&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_detained21May&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indep23May_detained&quot; /&gt; Other women also drove cars, including actress Wajnat Rahbini, who was arrested after driving in Jeddah on 4 June and released a day later.&lt;ref name=&quot;GulfNews_Rahbini&quot; /&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Politics of Saudi Arabia}}
The politics of Saudi Arabia takes place in a framework of a particular form of [[absolute monarchy]] whereby the [[King of Saudi Arabia]] is both [[head of state]] and  the [[head of government]], but where decisions are to a large extent made on the basis of consultation among the senior princes, with the King functioning as ''primus inter pares'' and ultimate arbiter. The Basic Law adopted in 1992 declared that Saudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled by the male descendants of King [[Abd Al Aziz Al Saud]], and that the [[Qur'an]] is the constitution of the country, which is governed on the basis of [[Islam]]ic law ([[Sharia|Shari'a]]).
An unidentified 65-year-old man died on 21 January after setting himself on fire in the town of [[Samtah]], [[Jizan]]. This was apparently the kingdom's first known case of self-immolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;saudi_selfimmo65yr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12260465|title=Man dies after setting himself on fire in Saudi Arabia|date=23 January 2011 |work=|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;saudi2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/world-news/4231-man-dies-in-possible-first-self-immolation-in-saudi|title=Man dies in possible first self-immolation in Saudi |first=Mohideen |last=Mifthah |date=22 January 2011 |work=|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)]]|accessdate=23 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wut1kRgo |archivedate=3 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
===Timeline===
====29 January====
On 29 January, hundreds of protesters gathered in the city of [[Jeddah]] in a rare display of criticism against the city's poor infrastructure after deadly floods swept through the city, killing eleven people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montreal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Flood+sparks+rare+action/4189873/story.html|title=Flood sparks rare action|date=29 January 2011 |work=|publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]] |accessdate=29 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police stopped the demonstration about 15 minutes after it started.

====5 February====
On 5 February, about 40 women wearing black clothes demonstrated in [[Riyadh]], calling for the release of prisoners held without trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;swiss_Saudi_5Feb&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first1=Ulf | last1=Laessing |first2=Asma |last2=Alsharif | pages= | language =| title=Saudi women protest, web activists call for reform | date=5 February 2011 | publisher=[[Swiss Info]]/[[Thomson Reuters]] | url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Saudi_women_protest,_web_activists_call_for_reform.html?cid=29428092 |accessdate=16 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wYAoCCPC |archivedate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[But] after what has happened in the Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_NHariri&quot; /&gt; On 21 May, [[Manal al-Sharif]], a [[women's rights]] [[activist]] who helped start a women's right to drive campaign, was detained for six hours after a video showing her driving in [[Khobar]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], filmed by another women's rights activist, [[Wajeha al-Huwaider]], gained widespread popularity on [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;France24_huwaiderfilmed&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_detained21May&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Indep23May_detained&quot; /&gt; Al-Sharif was detained again from 22 May&lt;ref name=&quot;RTBF_geek&quot; /&gt; to 30 May, when she was released on [[bail]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP_Sharif2BFreed30May&quot; /&gt; on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalAE_SharifFree30May&quot; /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Associated Press]]'' associated the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt_reputation&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_10days_26May&quot; /&gt; On 23 May, another woman was detained for driving a car. She drove with two women passengers in [[Ar Rass]] and was detained by traffic police in the presence of the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police (CPVPV)]]. She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again.&lt;ref name=&quot;arabnews_qassimdriver23May&quot; /&gt; In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_10days_26May&quot; /&gt;

====June====

{{see also|Manal al-Sharif|Wajeha al-Huwaider}}
The women's driving campaign continued in June.

[[Wajnat Rahbini]], a Saudi actress famous in the Arab world for playing in the satirical comedy ''[[Tash ma Tash]]'', broadcast annually during [[Ramadan]], drove her car &quot;in defiance of a long-standing ban on female driving&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;E247_Rahbini&quot; /&gt; on 4 June in Jeddah. She was detained after exiting her car and released the following day without bail.&lt;ref name=&quot;GulfNews_Rahbini&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E247_Rahbini&quot; /&gt;

On 17 June, the main date for the women's driving campaign,&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_detained21May&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RTBF_geek&quot; /&gt; about 30 to 40 women drove cars in towns around Saudi Arabia, including Maha al-Qahtani and [[Eman al-Nafjan]] in Riyadh, and other women in Jeddah and Dammam. When she drove for a second time the same day, al-Qahtani was given a ticket for driving without a Saudi Arabian licence. ''[[The Guardian]]'' interpreted the lack of arrests as a deliberate change in government policy, stating, &quot;police appeared to be under orders not to intervene.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard_17June&quot; /&gt;

====October====
On 4 October, there was a firefight between unidentified gunmen and Saudi security personnel in [[Al Qatif]], injuring between 11 police and at least 3 civilians. The government blamed &quot;a foreign country&quot;, presumably [[Iran]], for the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/04/170200.html|agency=Al Arabiya|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=4 October 2011|title=Saudi Arabia says a âforeign countryâ is fomenting unrest in Eastern Province}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Glen|last=Carey|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-04/saudi-security-forces-wounded-in-attack-in-eastern-province.html|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=4 October 2011|agency=Bloomberg Businessweek|title=Saudi Security Forces Wounded in Attack in Eastern Province}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This confrontation grew out of a conflict in al-Awamiyah, a predominantly Shi'a town in the Sunni kingdom, on Sunday when security forces arrested a 60-year-old man to force his son, who was active in a movement to force Saudi Arabia to withdraw from Bahrain, to give himself up. [[Molotov cocktails]] were thrown at the police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/saudi-police-open-fire-on-civilians-as-protests-gain-momentum-2365614.html|title=Suadi Police open fire on civilians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new|urlhttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203388804576612322988969298.htm|Title=Saudis blame foreigners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November, two people were killed and six others were wounded by police bullets during a protest in [[Qatif]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/2011112465955365750.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February, a [[Thomson Reuters]] report claimed that 10 intellectuals, [[human rights in Saudi Arabia|human rights]] activists and lawyers came together to create the [[Umma Islamic Party]] â considered to be the first political party in Saudi Arabia since the 1990s â to demand the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;threuters_umma_created&quot;/&gt; On February 18 however, all ten members of the party were arrested and ordered to withdraw demands for political reform in exchange for their release.&lt;ref name=&quot;washpo_umma&quot; /&gt;

On 23 February, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, after returning to the country following three months spent abroad for health treatment, announced a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $10.7 billion. These include funding to offset high inflation and to aid young unemployed people and Saudi citizens studying abroad, as well the writing off some loans. As part of the Saudi scheme, state employees will see their incomes increase by 15 per cent, and additional cash has also been made available for housing loans. No political reforms were announced as part of the package, though the 86-year-old monarch did pardon some prisoners indicted in financial crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlJazeeraEnglishBenefits&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi king announces new benefits |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011223105328424268.html |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
