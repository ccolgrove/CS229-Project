The '''[[South Carolina Gamecocks]] men's [[basketball]] team''' represents the [[University of South Carolina]] and competes in the [[Southeastern Conference]].  The program attained national prominence under hall of fame coach [[Frank McGuire]], posting a 205-65 record and three NCAA Sweet 16 appearances from 1967-1976.  The Gamecocks won the 1970 [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] championship, 1971 ACC Tournament, and the 1997 [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship.  South Carolina also won [[Southern Conference]] titles in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945.

Most recently, the Gamecocks won the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] in 2005 and 2006 and claimed a share of the 2009 SEC Eastern division title.  South Carolina is currently coached by [[Darrin Horn]] and plays at the 18,000-seat [[Colonial Life Arena]].

==Program History==
===Southern Conference Years===

South Carolina achieved a measure of regional prominence during its tenure in the [[Southern Conference]], winning regular season championships in 1927, 1933, 1934, and 1945.  The program also won the conference's tournament championship in 1933.  During [[World War II]], the basketball team's success was partially attributed to being assigned outstanding athletes by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] as part of the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Navy leaders kept the teams focus towards the war effort, and USC declined an invitation to the [[Southern Conference]] Tournament in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frank McGuire Era (1965-1980)===

The hiring of [[Frank McGuire]] before the 1964-65 season propelled South Carolina to its most successful period to date.  McGuire's 16-year tenure was highlighted by an undefeated ACC regular season in 1970, an ACC Tournament championship in 1971, and three consecutive Sweet 16 appearances from 1971 to 1973.  USC also posted a 69-16 overall record from 1968 to 1971, and [[John Roche]] won consecutive ACC Player of the Year Awards (1969â1970).  In November 1968, the Gamecocks began playing at the 12,401 seat [[Carolina Coliseum]], which became known as the &quot;House that Frank Built.&quot;  The success South Carolina achieved on the court brought resentment and anger from fellow ACC schools, especially those on &quot;Tobacco Road,&quot; as the conference members of the state of North Carolina were known.  The hostility of the road crowds, the unfriendly behavior of coaches and athletic directors in the conference, and the discrepancies in eligibility standards led McGuire to support South Carolina becoming an [[NCAA Division I independent schools (basketball)|Independent]] before the 1971-72 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an Independent, the program gradually declined, and the University sought entrance into an athletic conference.  This proved problematic because most conferences required schools to have a single athletic director, and South Carolina had multiple directors at the time.  McGuire served as Athletic Director for the basketball program, and he would not relinquish his position.  The University made several attempts to obtain McGuire's resignation, but ultimately honored his contract through 1980.  McGuire finished with a 283-142 overall record at South Carolina and continues to be held in high regard by Gamecock fans.  His six consecutive 20-win seasons from 1969 to 1974, which produced a 137-33 record, remain the benchmark for USC Basketball.

===Metro Conference and SEC===

In 1983, the University became affiliated with the [[Metro Conference]].  The basketball program was placed on probation by the NCAA in the spring of 1987 for two years because of recruiting violations and the sale of complimentary player tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1987 to 1991, George Felton led the Gamecocks to an 87-62 overall record, which included a 1989 NCAA Tournament appearance and a 1991 [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] berth.  For three of Felton's five seasons (1987â1989), [[Tubby Smith]] served as an assistant coach before leaving to join [[Rick Pitino|Rick Pitino's]] staff at [[Kentucky Wildcats basketball|Kentucky]].  South Carolina joined the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] before the 1992 season and initially struggled, posting a combined 20-35 record in 1992 and 1993.

===Eddie Fogler Era (1994-2001)===

[[Eddie Fogler]] was hired away from [[Vanderbilt Commodores Basketball|Vanderbilt]] before the 1994 season and within a few years returned the Gamecocks to respectability.  Under Fogler, South Carolina posted an impressive 66-28 record (34-14 SEC) during the 1996-1998 stretch, which included the school's first SEC championship in 1997.  The 1997 Gamecocks posted a 15-1 record in SEC play and defeated league rival [[Kentucky Wildcats basketball|Kentucky]] twice, but lost in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament.  Fogler stepped down after the 2001 campaign, going 123-117 in eight seasons as the Gamecocks' head coach.  His tenure included two NCAA Tournament appearances (1997, 1998) and two NIT appearances (1996, 2001).  Fogler retired as one of the most successful head coaches in SEC Basketball history, having won regular season conference championships at both Vanderbilt and South Carolina.

===Dave Odom Era (2002-2008)===
Subsequent coach [[Dave Odom]] posted four 20-win seasons during his tenure at South Carolina.  He led the Gamecocks to an appearance in the 2004 NCAA Tournament and consecutive [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] championships in 2005 and 2006. Odom's tenure also saw USC begin play at the 18,000 seat [[Colonial Life Arena]] during the 2003 season.  Following the 2008 campaign, Odom resigned with a 128-104 overall record at USC.

===Darrin Horn Era (2009-Present)===

On April 1, 2008, Darrin Horn was named the new head basketball coach at USC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/040108aag.html Darrin Horn Named Men's Basketball Coach]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first season, Horn led the Gamecocks to a 21-10 record (10-6 SEC), two victories over [[Kentucky Wildcats basketball|Kentucky]], and a share of the 2009 SEC Eastern Division title.  After a 15-16 campaign in 2010, Horn's current USC record stands at 36-26 (16-16 SEC).
