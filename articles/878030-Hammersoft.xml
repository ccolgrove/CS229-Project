October 19, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] categorised ''Hilary Duff'' as &quot;a virtual companion to [[Ashlee Simpson]]'s ''[[Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album)|Autobiography]]'', from its rock/[[dance-pop]] fusion to its earnest demeanor&quot; and &quot;a varied, ambitious album ... it feels like the soundtrack to the life of a smart, ambitious, popular teenager trying to sort things out&quot;.

A review of ''Hilary Duff'' in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' was far less praising; it said &quot;Duff's role in the tween-rock firmament is playing pious [[Lisa Loeb]] opposite Simpson's post-diluvian [[Courtney Love]] ... despite liberal amounts of gold-dust guitar glitter, blow-dried backing vocals, and even the post-crash-[[Lynyrd Skynyrd|Skynyrd]] 'Rock This World', Hilary Duff is too often the vanilla-bean fantasia [[album-oriented rock|AOR]] chauvinists take all girl-pop for.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheVillageVoice-Nov2004&quot;/&gt; ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' magazine wrote that Duff's attempt to follow &quot;the [Avril Lavigne] template that she previously softened&quot; yielded &quot;mixed results ... to a certain extent, [she] is a prisoner of her image and her attempts at [[Chrissie Hynde]]-intensity fall far short of even Ashlee Simpson's gravelly vocal cords.&quot; Its critic described the album's length as its &quot;simple problem&quot;, saying that with &quot;a little quality control ... this could easily be as strong as any other [[teen-pop]] album released this year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylus-Sep2004&quot;/&gt;

In response to Duff's &quot;announcement&quot; that &quot;she's a complicated rock &amp; roll adolescent on the order of Avril and Ashlee&quot;, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote, &quot;Uh-huh. And [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] from the ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]'' comics is [[Patti Smith]]&quot;, noting Duff's &quot;tiny&quot; voice is &quot;buried under layers of generic cheese arrangements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Burr, Ty.

In February 2005, popdirt.com reported that because of the failure of &quot;Fly&quot; in the U.S., Hollywood Records would not be releasing further singles from the album. The website said that &quot;The Getaway&quot; was planned as the follow-up single in January, but its release was cancelled after sales of the album went into a &quot;sudden drop&quot;. Executives at the label decided that money should be invested in a new album&amp;nbsp;â which became ''[[Most Wanted (Hilary Duff album)|Most Wanted]]''&amp;nbsp;â instead of additional promotion for ''Hilary Duff'', according to the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popdirt.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=36752 &quot;Hilary Will Not Release Anymore Singles&quot;]. popdirt.com.

The campaign's online project page said, &quot;The ''Hilary Duff'' album has plenty of great songs that would make great singles ...
