'''Columbus''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Muscogee County, Georgia|Muscogee County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States,{{GR|6}} with which it is [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 189,885&lt;ref&gt;http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/13/1319000.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It is the principal city of the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], which, in 2009, had an estimated population of 292,795. It joins with the [[Auburn, Alabama metropolitan area]] to form the [[Greater Columbus, Georgia|Columbus, Georgia-Auburn, Alabama Combined Statistical Area]], which, in 2009, had an estimated population of 450,467. It is the third largest city and fourth largest metropolitan area in the state, and also the [[List of United States cities by population#Incorporated places over 100.2C000 population|123rd largest city]] in the United States.

Columbus lies 100 miles (160&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Atlanta]].
[[Fort Benning]], a major employer, is located south of the city in [[Chattahoochee County, Georgia|Chattahoochee County]]. The city is home to museums and other tourism sites. The area is served by the [[Columbus Airport (Georgia)|Columbus Airport]]. The current mayor is [[Teresa Tomlinson]], who was elected in November 2010. The city was ranked number 4 on the 100 Best U.S. Cities to live by ''Best Life Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestlifeonline.com/cms/publish/family-fatherhood/The_100_Best_Places_to_Raise_a_Family.shtml 100-Best Places to Live] Retrieved 2009-08-06&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Downtown columbus, georgia 1880.jpg|left|thumb|[[Downtown Columbus, Georgia|Downtown]] in 1880]]
Founded in 1828 by an act of the Georgia Legislature, Columbus was situated at the beginning of the navigable portion of the [[Chattahoochee River]] and on the last stretch of the [[Federal Road (Creek lands)|Federal Road]] before entering [[Alabama]]. The city was named for [[Christopher Columbus]], its founders likely influenced by the writings of [[Washington Irving]]. The plan for the city was drawn up by Dr. Edwin L. DeGraffenried who placed the town on a bluff overlooking the river. Across the river, where  [[Phenix City, Alabama]]  is now located, [[Creek (people)|Creek Indians]] lived until their [[Indian Removal|removal]] in 1836.

The river served as Columbus' connection to the world, particularly connecting the [[plantation]]s in the region with the international cotton market via [[New Orleans]] and ultimately [[Liverpool]], England. The city's [[commerce|commercial]] importance increased in the 1850s with the arrival of the railroad. In addition, [[textile]] mills began springing up along the river, bringing industry to an area reliant upon agriculture. By 1860, the city was one of the more important industrial centers of the South, earning it the nickname &quot;the [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the South,&quot; in deference to the industrial town in Massachusetts.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
{{Main|Battle of Columbus (1865)}}
[[File:Redd House Columbs Georgia.jpg|thumb|Redd House, Columbus, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]]]]
When the outbreak of [[American Civil War|war]] came in 1861, the industries of Columbus expanded their production and Columbus became one of the most important centers of industry in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. During the war, Columbus ranked second to Richmond in the manufacture of supplies for the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=1911|page=746|volume=vol. VI|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to textiles, the city had an ironworks and a sword factory as well as a shipyard for the [[Confederate Navy]].
Unaware of Lee's surrender to Grant and the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], Union and Confederates clashed in the [[Battle of Columbus, Georgia]] on Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865, when a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] detachment under General [[James H. Wilson]] attacked the city and burned many of the industrial buildings.  The inventor of Coca-Cola, Dr. [[John Pemberton|John Stith Pemberton]], was wounded in this battle.  The owner of America's [[The Wanderer (slave ship)|last slave ship]], Col. Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar, was also killed here. A historic marker has been erected in Columbus marking the battle by Wilson's troops as the &quot;Last Land Battle in the War Between the States.&quot;

Reconstruction began almost immediately and prosperity followed. Factories such as the [[Eagle &amp; Phenix Dam|Eagle and Phenix Mills]] were revived and the industrialization of the town led to rapid growth; the city outgrew its original plan. The [[Springer Opera House]] was built on 10th Street attracting such notables as [[Oscar Wilde]]. The [[Springer Opera House|Springer]] is now the official State Theater of Georgia.

By the time of the [[Spanish American War]], the city saw much modernization including the addition of [[tram|trolleys]] extending to outlying neighborhoods such as Rose Hill and Lakebottom and a new water works. Mayor Lucius Chappell also brought a training camp for soldiers to the area. This training camp named Camp Benning would grow into present day [[Fort Benning]], named for General [[Henry L. Benning]], a native of the city.

===20th Century===
With the expansion of the city, the need for a university saw the establishment of Columbus College, a two-year institution which would later grow into [[Columbus State University]], now a comprehensive center of higher learning. The city would consolidate city and county governments in 1971 and become the first of its kind in Georgia (and one of only 16 in the U.S. at the time). As the city has turned from its initial industry of textiles, it has provided a home for other prominent industries including the headquarters for [[Aflac]], [[Synovus]], [[TSYS]] and [[Carmike Cinemas]].
[[Image:Old columbus, georgia.jpg|thumb|left|The Muscogee County Courthouse in 1941, which was destroyed in 1970.]]
During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, urban blight, flight, and prostitution were serious problems in much of downtown Columbus and adjacent neighborhoods. Early efforts to halt the gradual deterioration of downtown began with the saving and restoration of the [[Springer Opera House]] in 1965. With the revitalization of the Springer and its subsequent designation as the State Theatre of Georgia, a historic preservation movement was sparked and various historic districts were established in and around downtown. Large tracts of blighted areas were cleaned up and a modern Columbus Consolidated Government Center was constructed in the city center. A significant period of urban renewal and revitalization followed in the mid to late 1990s. With these improvements, residents and businesses began moving back to these formerly blighted areas. Examples of these municipal projects including the construction of a softball complex which hosted the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] softball competition, construction of the [[Chattahoochee RiverWalk]] along the [[Chattahoochee River]], construction of the [[National Civil War Naval Museum at Port Columbus]], construction of the Coca-Cola Space Science Center, the expansion of the Columbus Museum, and road improvements to include a new downtown bridge crossing the Chattahoochee River to Phenix City.  During the late 1990s, commercial activity expanded north of downtown along the [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|I-185]] corridor.

===21st century===
During the 2000s, expansion and historic preservation was continuing throughout the city. An example of this is the revitalization of South Commons, an area which combines the 1996 Olympic softball competition complex, [[A. J. McClung Memorial Stadium]], [[Golden Park]], the [[Columbus Civic Center]], and the recently added Jonathan Hatcher Skateboard Park into a single complex area. Other additions to the city include the [[National Infantry Museum]] in [[South Columbus, Georgia|South Columbus]], located just outside the [[Fort Benning]] main gate, and the .

Columbus has also established itself as a center for the fine and performing arts. [[RiverCenter for the Performing Arts]], which opened in 2002, houses Columbus State University's music department. In 2002 Columbus State's art and drama departments moved to downtown locations. Such initiatives are provide Columbus with a cultural niche with vibrant and modern architecture mixed with its old brick facades.

The &quot;Ready to Raft 2012&quot; campaign is a project that will create 700 new jobs and is estimated to bring in $42 million annually to the Columbus area. The project will result in the longest urban whitewater rafting venue in the world, scheduled for completion in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtvm.com/global/story.asp?s=12378721]. Retrieved 2011-22-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In upcoming years, it is predicted that there will be an additional 30,000 Soldiers trained at Fort Benning each year due to [[Base Realignment and Closure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbusga.org/planning/Special-Projects/BRAC/ Base Realignment And Closure]. Retrieved 2011-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, Columbus is expected to see a major population increase.

==Geography==
Columbus is one of Georgia's three [[Fall Line Cities]], along with [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]. The Fall Line is where the hilly lands of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] [[plateau]] meet the flat terrain of the [[coastal plain]]. As such, Columbus has a varied landscape of rolling hills on the north side and flat plains on the south. The [[fall line]] causes rivers in the area to decline rapidly towards sea level, making it a good location for [[textile]] mills in the past. The [[Chattahoochee River]] is the major river that runs through Columbus.

The city is located at {{Coord|32.489608|-84.940422|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}} (32.489608, -84.940422).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|221.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|216.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|4.7|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.14%) is water.

===Climate===
Columbus has a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Daytime summer temperatures often reaches a high in the mid 90s, and low temperatures in the winter average in the upper 30s. Columbus is often considered a dividing line or &quot;natural snowline&quot; of the southeastern United States with areas north of the city receiving snowfall annually, with areas to the south typically not receiving snowfall every year or at all.

{{Main|Neighborhoods in Columbus, Georgia}}
Columbus is divided into five [[Area (subnational entity)|geographic area]]s, and they are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;All neighborhood info and names taken from [[Google Maps]].&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Downtown Columbus, Georgia|Downtown]]'''(also called &quot;Uptown&quot;) is the city's [[central business district]], and home to many historic districts, homes, and churches such as the [[Columbus Historic Riverfront Industrial District]], the [[Mott House (Columbus, Georgia)|Mott House]], and the [[Church of the Holy Family (Columbus, Georgia)|Church of the Holy Family]]. It is considered by some to be the area bounded on the north by [[Talbotton, Georgia|Talbotton]] Road; on the South by 30th Avenue; on the West by Front Avenue the [[Chattahoochee River]]; and on the East by Brown Avenue.

*'''[[East Columbus, Georgia|East Columbus]]''' is the largest of the five Columbus areas. It is home to Bull Creek Golf Course, the largest of seven [[golf course]]s in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.com/maps?rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1I7GPEA_en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=columbus+ga+golf+courses&amp;fb=1&amp;split=1&amp;gl=us&amp;view=text&amp;ei=GEysSvv9LKSStge96O2sCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_group&amp;ct=more-results&amp;resnum=1 Columbus golf info], Retrieved September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The area is roughly bounded by [[Georgia State Route 22|Macon Road]] to the North, Buena Vista Road to the South, Schatulga Road and [[Fort Benning]] to the East, and [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|I-185]] to the West.

[[Image:Fireworks in downtown columbus, ga.jpg|thumb|[[Fireworks]] in Downtown on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 2009]]

*'''[[MidTown (Columbus, Georgia)|MidTown]]''' is a residential and commercial area. It is home to two major shopping areas: [[Peachtree Mall]], an indoor [[shopping mall]] opened in 1975; [[The Landings]], an outdoor [[strip mall]] that opened in 2005. MidTown is also home to the majority of bars and nightclubs in the Columbus area. It is bounded roughly by [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|I-185]] to the East, J. R. Allen Parkway to the North, River Road to the West and Wynnton Road to the South.

*'''[[North Columbus, Georgia|North Columbus]]''' is a diverse suburban area of the city that is home to established neighborhoods and newly built [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s. It is home to very upscale areas such as [[Green Island Hills]]. It is also home to [[Columbus Park Crossing]], a major outdoor strip mall. It is bounded roughly by Moore Road to the North, [[Georgia State Route 85|Manchester Expressway]] to the South, Moon Road to the East, and [[J. R. Allen Parkway]] to the West.

*'''[[South Columbus, Georgia|South Columbus]]''' is situated just below MidTown. It is home to the [[National Infantry Museum]], a museum that honors the history of [[infantry]] forces in the U.S. Army. The South Columbus area has a noticeably higher military population than other areas, most likely because it is located just above the [[United States Army]] post [[Fort Benning]].
