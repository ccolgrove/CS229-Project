The '''2010â2011 Greek protests''' are an ongoing series of demonstrations and [[general strikes]] taking place across Greece. The protests, which began on 5 May 2010, were sparked by plans to cut public spending and raise taxes as [[austerity measures]] in exchange for a {{Nowrap|â¬110 billion}} bail-out, aimed at solving the [[Greek financial crisis|2010â2011 Greek debt crisis]]. Three people were killed on the 5 May protests, one of the largest in Greece [[Athens Polytechnic Uprising|since 1973]]. Protest activity has escalated since then, leading to widespread [[social unrest]] and [[anti-government]] sentiment.

On {{Start date|df=yes|25 May 2011}}, anti-austerity protestors organized by the [[Direct Democracy Now!]] movement, known as the '''Indignant Citizens Movement''' ({{lang-el|ÎÎ¯Î½Î·Î¼Î± ÎÎ³Î±Î½Î±ÎºÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½ÏÎ½ Î Î¿Î»Î¹ÏÏÎ½}}, ''KÃ­nima AganaktismÃ©non PolitÃ³n''), started demonstrating in major cities across Greece.

==Background of the 2010 protests==
{{Greek economic crisis}}

{{Further|[[Greek government debt crisis]]|[[Economy of Greece#2010 debt crisis|Economy of Greece &gt; 2010-2011 debt crisis]]}}

In the early-mid 2000s, Greece's economy was strong and the government took advantage by running a large deficit. As the world economy cooled in the late 2000s, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industriesâ[[Greek Merchant Navy|shipping]] and [[tourism in Greece|tourism]]âwere especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. As a result, the country's debt began to pile up rapidly. In early 2010, as concerns about Greece's national debt grew, policy makers{{who|date=November 2011}} suggested that emergency bailouts might be necessary.

On 5 March 2010, the [[Hellenic Parliament]] passed the cost-cutting Economy Protection Bill. On 23 April, the Greek government requested that a bailout package offered by the [[European Union]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] be activated.&lt;ref name=&quot;bailout request&quot;/&gt; The funds were expected to be available quickly, but it was unclear if they would be activated before a crucial 19 May debt rollover. On 27 April, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] cut the country's main debt rating to BB+ (considered &quot;junk&quot; status), increasing concern that a [[Default (finance)|default]] might occur.&lt;ref name=nyt04282010&gt;{{cite news|title= Cuts to Debt Rating Stir Anxiety in Europe |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/global/28drachma.html |work=The New York Times |author=Jack Ewing and Jack Healy |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/sp-downgrades-greek-debt-to-junk/story-e6frg91o-1225859110788 |title= S&amp;P downgrades Greek debt to junk |author=Katie Martin and Terence Roth |publisher=Dow Jones Newswires |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austerity measures===
On 1 May, Prime Minister [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]] announced a fourth round of austerity measures by the Greek government, which have been described as &quot;unprecedented&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/09/greece-debt-crisis-euro-imf |title= The Greek spirit of resistance turns its guns on the IMF |author=Helena Smith |date=9 May 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include more public sector pay cuts, pension reductions, new taxes on company profits, an increase on luxury and [[sin tax]]es, and an increase of the [[value added tax]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8655711.stm|title=Greece police tear gas anti-austerity protesters|date=1 May 2010|publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gr/news/article.asp?lngEntityID=1132263&amp;lngDtrID=251|title=Fourth raft of new measures|language=Greek|publisher=[[In.gr]] |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed changes, which aim to save {{Nowrap|â¬30 billion}} through 2012, represent the biggest government overhaul in a generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt; The cuts are in line with the EU-[[International Monetary Fund]] loan proposals which demand that Greece liberalise its economy and helped Greece reach a loan agreement, announced on 2 May, for an immediate {{Nowrap|â¬45 billion}} in loans (with a 5% interest for the major part, provided by the EU), with additional funds available in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Greece Accepts Terms of EU-Led Bailout, 'Savage' Cuts (Update2)&amp;nbsp;â Bloomberg.com | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a9f8X9yDMcdI&amp;pos=1 | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=3 May 2010|accessdate=7 May 2010|author=Flavia Krause-Jackson and Gabi Thesing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EU puts positive spin on Greek rescue|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html|work=Financial Times|date=2 May 2010|accessdate=2 May 2010|first=Kerin|last=Hope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek20100305&quot;/&gt; The total value of the loans was expected to be in the {{Nowrap|â¬110 billion}} range.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt; Papandreou submitted the bill to Parliament on 4 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC protest&quot; /&gt;

The Hellenic Parliament was expected to vote on the proposed austerity measures on 6 May.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt; [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]], the conservative minority party, vowed to vote against the bill, but the bill was expected to pass due to the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]]'s large 160-seat advantage in Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC protest&quot; /&gt;  The government has pleaded with demoralized staff not to retire, fearing that a surge in benefits requests could further drain the public treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt;

===Relationship to the 2008 Greek riots===

The [[2008 Greek riots]] started on 6 December 2008, when Alexandros Grigoropoulos ({{lang-el|ÎÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Ï ÎÏÎ·Î³Î¿ÏÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ»Î¿Ï}}), a 15-year-old student, was killed by two policemen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100033_13/06/2009_108067|title=POLICE TRIAL Two indicted over teen shooting |publisher=Kathimerini}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Exarcheia]] district of central [[Athens]]. While the unrest was triggered by the shooting incident, commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/12/08/explainer.greece.riots/index.html | title=Explainer: Why is there unrest in Greece? | publisher=CNN | date=10 December 2008 | accessdate=22 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; described the reactions as expressing deeper causes as well, especially a widespread feeling of frustration in the younger generation about specific economic problems of the country (partly as a result of the [[economic crisis of 2008|global economic crisis]]), a rising unemployment rate among the young generation and a perception of general inefficiency and corruption in Greek state institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;displaystory1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12756043&amp;fsrc=rss | title=Behind the protests spreading across Greece | publisher=Economist date=2008-12-09 | accessdate=12 December 2008 | date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;international1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/12/11/europe/greece.php | title=In Greece, a crisis decades in the making |work=International Herald Tribune | date=11 December 2008 | accessdate=12 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Related sporadic protests have continued into 2011.

===Before 5 May 2010===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Greek protests austerity cuts May 2010.jpg|thumb|An arrest being made on May Day 2010.]]
On May Day there were protest marches in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]], by many unions, left-wing, anarchist and communist party supporters. Violent clashes broke out when riot police were sent out to contain the protestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC may day rallies&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- strikes by unions, civil servants, and teachers also took place before 5 May. --&gt;

On 4 May, members of the [[Communist Party of Greece]] broke into the [[Acropolis of Athens]] and hung banners urging the &quot;Peoples of Europe [to] Rise Up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/ynews_wl1925|title=In Photos: Greek protesters storm the Acropolis|publisher=[[Yahoo!

===5 May 2010 strike and demonstrations===

In response to the proposed spending cuts and tax increases, a nation-wide strike was called for 5 May. Starting at midnight, airplane, train, and ferry traffic in and out of the country ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt; Schools, some hospitals, and many private businesses were closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC protest&quot; /&gt; The demonstrations are seen by some as the most widespread since the end of the [[Greek military junta of 1967â1974]].&lt;ref name=burns &gt;{{cite news|title= Greek bailout: Athens burns â and crisis strikes at heart of the EU |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/05/greek-bailout-economic-crisis-deaths |author=Helena Smith |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 100,000 people marched through Athens,&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC protest&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=burns /&gt; with some estimates stretching to 500,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;turnout 5 may rallies&quot;/&gt; As protests gained momentum, a large group tried to storm the parliament building in [[Syntagma Square]] in Athens, where they scuffled with police, causing some of the [[Evzones]] (ceremonial guards) to flee from the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]].&lt;ref name=burns /&gt; The protesters accused members of parliament of being &quot;thieves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt; Riot police were able to push the crowds back with [[tear gas]], [[flash bomb]]s and [[smoke bombs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC protest&quot; /&gt; Nearby buildings, including a finance ministry building, were set on fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt; Prime Minister George Papandreou responded &quot;Nobody has the right to violence and particularly violence that leads to murder.

Protesters set fire to a [[Marfin Investment Group|Marfin Bank]] branch on [[Stadiou Street]] with [[Molotov cocktails]]; witnesses said that protestors marching past the bank ignored the employees' cries for help, while others chanted [[anti-capitalist]] slogans.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC protest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathimerini protest&quot;/&gt; Most of the bank's employees managed to escape the burning building, but two employees who jumped from the second-story balcony were injured and two women and a man were found dead after the fire was extinguished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerdos protest&quot;/&gt; It was reported that fire crews had difficulty reaching the scene because of demonstrations moving through the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathimerini protest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs newshour interview&quot;/&gt; The victims died of [[asphyxiation]] from toxic fumes when they were unable to escape from a roof exit that was blocked.

====Aftermath of the 5 May protest====
On 5 and 6 May 2010, the Hellenic Parliament passed the proposed austerity measures, claiming they show the Greek government's commitment to tackling its [[budget deficit]], amongst continued protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek20100305&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-05/greek-protests-mount-as-parliament-passes-budget-cuts-correct-.html|title=Greek Protests Mount as Parliament Passes Budget Cuts (Update4)|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/world/europe/07greece.html|title=Greek Parliament Passes Austerity Measures|work=New York Times|date=5 May 2010|first=Dan|last=Bilersky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 5 May, the German parliament began debating the bailout package, as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] urged rapid passage.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt;  Merkel remarked that &quot;Quite simply, Europe's future is at stake.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt;  The plan requires Germany to provide the largest share, {{Nowrap|â¬22 billion}}, of the bailout funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt;  The plan must be approved by 15 [[eurozone]] countries in total.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC protest&quot; /&gt;

Analysts said the protests could mark the beginning of protracted [[social unrest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt;  If that occurs, the country could be pushed into deep recession.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt;  Economists have warned that it could be ten years before the Greek economy recovers, even if it does not worsen first.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times protest&quot; /&gt;

There has been advocacy for a [[political coalition]] from within the Greek political elite, and by the Greek journalist [[Alexis Papahelas]] who said that Papandreou should 'get rid of some of the novices he has in his government, make an overture to the opposition and go full-steam ahead.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_100006_06/05/2010_116895|title=Which path will we take?|publisher=[[Kathimerini]]|first=Alexis|last=Papachelas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One columnist at [[The Guardian]] suggests in an editorial that the protests speak of a deeper issue in Greek politics: she asks, 'What the advocates of this scenario [coalition government] do not seem to grasp is that the political class is out of touch with the population,' and 'How can we expect to see solutions and progress by the very same people who are inextricably, causally linked to the problem?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/may/06/national-unity-greece-crisis|title=Greek debt crisis: coalition won't solve anything|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 May 2010|first=Matina|last=Stevis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Any wrong-doing politician should either be sent home or to jail.
*When we, the people, start discussions without fear, fear grasps them, inside the parliament building.
*This is not just the politician's fault. Its all our faults, with our selfish attitudes.
*Demonstrations should take place every evening at 6&amp;nbsp;pm and an [[Popular assembly|assembly]] at 9&amp;nbsp;pm.
*Their democracy guarantees neither Justice nor Equality.
*The taxation system is not the same for the rich and the poor. Equal rights for everyone.

====Political reactions====
In an interview for the Greek newspaper ''Ethnos'' on 29 May 2011, the vice-president of the [[Government of Greece|Greek government]], [[Theodoros Pangalos]], against whom various slogans had been shouted during the demonstrations, adopted an ironic stance towards the movement. He said that &quot;the formation of a political movement, however much the people who follow the technological trends don't want to hear this, does not depend on how many 'likes' or 'dislikes' it gets on Facebook&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnos 29&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=22767&amp;subid=2&amp;pubid=63097052 |title=ÎÏÎ¹ÏÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ® ÏÏÎ· Î´ÏÎ±ÏÎ¼Î® Î¸Î­Î»Î¿ÏÎ½ Î¿Î¹ Î¼Î±ÏÏÎ±Î³Î¿ÏÎ¯ÏÎµÏ |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011 |publisher=www.ethnos.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai 29&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/170747/theodoros-pagalos-kata-aganaktismenon-/ |title=ÎÎµÏÎ´ÏÏÎ¿Ï Î Î¬Î³ÎºÎ±Î»Î¿Ï ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¬ &quot;ÎÎ³Î±Î½Î±ÎºÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½ÏÎ½&quot; |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011 |publisher=www.skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Proto Thema 29&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protothema.gr/greece/article/?aid=124924 |title=ÎÏÎ´Î± ÏÏÎ½  ÏÎµÏÎ½Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¹ÏÎ½ Î¿Î¹ ÎÎ³Î±Î½Î±ÎºÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î¿Î¹... |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011 |publisher=www.protothema.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that &quot;movements without ideology and organization, that is to say movements based on anger, can only lead to either an ineffective release [of tension], which at the end of the day is of no interest to the political world, or pave the way for an undemocratic change of regime by organized minorities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnos 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Proto Thema 29&quot; /&gt; In response, the demonstrations addressed many chants to the vice-president, like &quot;the country is sinking, Theodore, lose some weight!&quot; and other more vulgar ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethnos 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai 29&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Proto Thema 29&quot; /&gt;

On 29 May, the spokesman of the Greek government, [[Giorgos Petalotis]], spoke out against Pangalos, saying that Pangalos should remember that when he took part in demonstrations against the dictatorship as a member of the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] in 1973, &quot;some people considered these demonstrations provocative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ta Nea Petalotis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&amp;ct=1&amp;artId=4633196 |title=Î ÂµÎµÎ³Î¬Î»Î· Î³Î¹Î¿ÏÏÎ® ÏÎ·Ï Î´Î¹Î±ÂµÎ±ÏÏÏÏÎ¯Î±Ï |language=Greek |date=30 May 2011 |publisher=www.tanea.gr |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore added that not only does the Indignant Citizens Movement have a clear ideology (even if it is a &quot;technology trend&quot; as Pangalos described it), but that it also &quot;reflects the real needs of the Greek society&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ta Nea Petalotis&quot; /&gt; He pointed out that &quot;denial [of the system] and no proposals lead nowhere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ta Nea Petalotis&quot; /&gt;

On 1 June, the [[Prime Minister of Greece]], [[George Papandreou]], commented in regards to the Indignant Citizens Movement saying that &quot;today protesters in Greece and the world are demonstrating against matters of national governance which are more weak than they used to be and, despite their inner weaknesses, are trapped by the global powers and the changes of a global system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai Papandreou&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/171063/sholio-papandreou-gia-aganaktismenous-polites/ |title=Î£ÏÏÎ»Î¹Î¿ Î Î±ÏÎ±Î½Î´ÏÎ­Î¿Ï Î³Î¹Î± &quot;ÎÎ³Î±Î½Î±ÎºÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î¿ÏÏ ÏÎ¿Î»Î¯ÏÎµÏ&quot; |language=Greek |date=1 June 2011 |publisher=www.skai.gr |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the blockade of the Parliament by angry citizens on 31 May, which prevented the MPs inside from exiting the building, and also after the angry reactions against the MPs when they were allowed to exit (such as the throwing of empty water bottles, fruit and other objects), the deputy Minister of Education said &quot;I understand that the Indignant Citizens Movement is not a threat to democracy, but violence is, and I condemn it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai Antidraseis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/greece/article/171043/adidraseis-gia-tin-poliorkia-tis-voulis-apo-aganaktismenous-/ |title=ÎÎ½ÏÎ¹Î´ÏÎ¬ÏÎµÎ¹Ï Î³Î¹Î± ÏÎ·Î½ &quot;ÏÎ¿Î»Î¹Î¿ÏÎºÎ¯Î±&quot; ÏÎ·Ï ÎÎ¿ÏÎ»Î®Ï Î±ÏÏ &quot;ÎÎ³Î±Î½Î±ÎºÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼Î­Î½Î¿ÏÏ&quot; |language=Greek |date=1 June 2011 |publisher=www.skai.gr |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that &quot;in a democracy, violence should be prevented and not tolerated&quot; and that &quot;the majority of the MPs in parliament are young; they should receive the same treatment as old MPs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai Antidraseis&quot; /&gt; The deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs commented that &quot;I can accept tougher questioning and criticism, but not the leveling of our political system. Democracy can give [a] solution. The flattening of our democracy can only lead to a slippery road. The majority of the Greek people can be angry, but not under these circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai Antidraseis&quot; /&gt;

[[Member of the European Parliament|European Parliament MP]] Theodoros Skylakakis, who is aligned with the newly-founded [[Democratic Alliance (Greece)|Democratic Alliance]] party, said that &quot;these people need to get a sense of political ideology and move to a deeper revelation: from what they don't like, to what they like&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai 29 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/170750/skulakakis-ginetai-tsakomos-eno-erhetai-to-tsounami/ |title=Î£ÎºÏÎ»Î±ÎºÎ¬ÎºÎ·Ï: ÎÎ¯Î½ÎµÏÎ±Î¹ ÏÏÎ±ÎºÏÎ¼ÏÏ ÎµÎ½Ï Î­ÏÏÎµÏÎ±Î¹ ÏÎ¿ ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ½Î¬Î¼Î¹ |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011 |publisher=www.skai.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that a non-political movement will be ineffective and without results. [[Alexis Tsipras]], leader of the [[Synaspismos]] radical left party and the first party leader to comment on the demonstrations, said that &quot;no one has the right to make the people [silent], or tell them that they have no say in their country's future by means of a referendum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleftherotypia Tsipras&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enet.gr/?i=news.el.politikh&amp;id=279502 |title=Î¤ÏÎ­Î¼Î¿ÏÎ½ ÏÎ·Î½ ÎºÎ¿Î¹Î½ÏÎ½Î¹ÎºÎ® Î±Î½Î±ÏÎ±ÏÎ±ÏÎ® ÏÏÎ·Î½ ÎÏÏÏÏÎ· |language=Greek |date=29 May 2011 |publisher=www.enet.gr |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the [[Left (politics)|Left]] should be supportive of the demonstrations and that &quot;things are turning at a fast pace, and the people are waking up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eleftherotypia Tsipras&quot; /&gt;

The [[Mayor of Athens]] said on 30 May that the protest was a &quot;healthy and sound demonstration&quot;, but when a motion was put forth at the municipal council to declare the municipality's support for the demonstrations, the mayor said that he felt &quot;it is not appropriate to express our sympathy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai 6i&quot; /&gt;

In an interview with a Greek newspaper on 1 June 2011, the Spanish [[Democracia real Ya|Democracia Real YA!]] movement, which organized the [[2011 Spanish Protests]] and sparked the Greek protests, said that its members support the Greek demonstrations and that &quot;this is only the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proto Thema Democracia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protothema.gr/world/article/?aid=125534 |title=H &quot;Î ÏÎ±Î³Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® ÎÎ·Î¼Î¿ÎºÏÎ±ÏÎ¯Î± Î¤ÏÏÎ±&quot; ÎºÎ±Î»ÎµÎ¯ ÏÎ¿ÏÏ ÎÎ»Î»Î·Î½ÎµÏ Î½Î± Î¾ÎµÏÎ·ÎºÏÎ¸Î¿ÏÎ½! |language=Greek |date=1 June 2011 |publisher=www.protothema.gr |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early hours of 22 June 2011, George Papandreou and his government narrowly survived a [[vote of confidence]] in the [[Greek parliament]], with 155 of the 300 seats voting in favor.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC confidence&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek government survives confidence vote |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13869428 |publisher=www.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=21 June 2011 |date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2011, amid violent protests in the square outside parliament, the [[Hellenic Parliament]] voted in favor of passing a new set of [[austerity measures]] with a marginal majority of 155 seats in the 300-seat parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai Mesoprothesmo 30&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/173650/efarmostikos-psifisthike-epi-tis-arhis-apo-155-vouleutes/ |title=ÎÏÎ±ÏÎ¼Î¿ÏÏÎ¹ÎºÏÏ: Î¨Î·ÏÎ¯ÏÎ¸Î·ÎºÎµ ÎµÏÎ¯ ÏÎ·Ï Î±ÏÏÎ®Ï Î±ÏÏ 155 Î²Î¿ÏÎ»ÎµÏÏÎ­Ï |language=Greek |date=30 June 2011 |publisher=www.skai.gr |accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures themselves had attracted much criticism both from the Greek public and within the country's political scene.
