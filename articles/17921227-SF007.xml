'''Windows Automated Installation Kit''' (Windows AIK or WAIK) is a collection of tools and technologies produced by [[Microsoft]] designed to help deploy Microsoft Windows operating system images to target computers or to a [[VHD (file format)|VHD (Virtual Hard Disk)]]. It was first introduced with [[Windows Vista]].

== History ==
Windows AIK Version 1.0 was released with [[Windows Vista]]. New or redesigned tools and technologies included Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM), [[SysPrep]], [[ImageX]], and [[Windows Preinstallation Environment]] (WinPE) v2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=C7D4BC6D-15F3-4284-9123-679830D629F2&amp;displaylang=en |title=Download Details: Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK) |work=Microsoft Download Center |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date={{date|2007-02-13}} |accessdate={{date|2009-11-16}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows AIK Version 1.1 was released with [[Windows Vista SP1]] (and [[Windows Server 2008]]). A number of new tools were introduced, including PostReflect and VSP1Cln. The new WinPE 2.1 could be more customized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=94BB6E34-D890-4932-81A5-5B50C657DE08&amp;displaylang=en |title=Download Details: Automated Installation Kit (AIK) for Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008 |date={{date|2008-04-09}} |accessdate={{date|2009-11-16}} |work=Microsoft Download Center |publisher=Microsoft Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows AIK Version 2.0 was released with [[Windows 7]] beta. Significantly, a single new tool, DISM, replaced several earlier tools including PEImg and IntlCfg, which were deprecated. The new WinPE 3.0 has AeroSnaps&amp;mdash;a Windows 7 feature. The User State Migration Tool (USMT) was added to this WAIK.&lt;ref&gt;{{

== Features ==
=== Preinstallation environment ===

{{main|Windows Preinstallation Environment}}
[[Image:winpe.png|thumb|386px|right|WinPE 3.0 (based on Windows 7) running the shell (command prompt) with several of the built in programs, [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]], [[Windows registry|Registry Editor]], and the [[Task Manager|Windows Task Manager]]. ]]
WAIK includes [[Windows Preinstallation Environment]], a lightweight version of Windows that can be booted via [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]], [[CD-ROM]], [[USB flash drive]] or [[external hard disk drive]] and is used to deploy, troubleshoot or recover Windows environments. It replaces [[MS-DOS]] [[boot disk]]s, [[Emergency Repair Disk]], [[Recovery Console]] and [[Automated System Recovery]] boot disks. Traditionally used by large corporations and OEMs (to preinstall Windows client operating systems to PCs during manufacturing), WinPE is now available free of charge via the Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK).

=== User state migration ===
{{main|User State Migration Tool}}
WAIK for Windows 7 includes [[User State Migration Tool]] v4.0, a [[command-line interface]] tool for transferring Windows user settings from one installation to another as part of an operating system upgrade or wipe-and-reload recovery, for example, to clean out a [[rootkit]]. USMT v4.0 can transfer the settings from Microsoft Windows XP or later to Microsoft Windows Vista and later.&lt;ref&gt;{{
