'''Slovenske Konjice''' is a town and a [[municipality]] in northeastern [[Slovenia]]. The area was part of the traditional region of [[Lower Styria]].

== Slovenske Konjice municipality ==

The municipality is now included in the [[Savinjska statistical region|Savinja statistical region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slovenskekonjice.si/ Slovenske Konjice Municipality site]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the administrative and cultural centre of the [[Dravinja]] Valley.  The municipality borders on the municipalities of [[Å marje pri JelÅ¡ah]] and [[Å entjur pri Celju]] to the south, [[Vojnik, Slovenia|Vojnik]] to the west, [[ZreÄe]] to the northwest, [[Oplotnica]] to the north, [[Slovenska Bistrica]] to the east, and [[RogaÅ¡ka Slatina]] to the southeast. It spreads over 97.8 square kilometers and has a population of 13.600. About hundred kilometers from [[Ljubljana]], [[Graz]] or [[Zagreb]] it is easily reachable by [[A1 motorway (Slovenia)|A1 motorway]] nicknamed Slovenika and via the little [http://www.aeroklub-konjice.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=55 airport] near [[LoÄe, Slovenske Konjice|LoÄe]].

==History &amp; Town sights==
The town of Slovenske Konjice lies under the northern slopes of the ''KonjiÅ¡ka Gora'' mountain and winegrowing hills of Å kalce. On a hill above the town to the southwest are the ruins of [[Konjice Castle]], an extensive 12th century [[castle]] with later additions, that was abandoned in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number eÅ¡d 665&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately above the Old square ({{lang-sl|Stari trg}}) the medieval [[Trebnik Mansion]] stands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number eÅ¡d 7864&lt;/ref&gt; The 850-years old dense town line is a sloping square, from Trebnik manor past the St. George parish church, along small [[stream]] in an open channel, down to the [[Dravinja]] river. The new square (Mestni trg) is situated on the other bank of the river, connected with old square by &quot;horse bridge&quot;. 

The [[parish church]] is dedicated to [[Saint George]] ({{lang-sl|Sveti Jurij}}) and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor]]. It dates to the late 13th century with 18th century additions (side baroque chapel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number eÅ¡d 2927&lt;/ref&gt; Town was mentioned in written sources dating to 1165 as a seminal [[parish]]. The castle is first mentioned in [[1148]] and the [[market town]] in [[1236]]. The town itself was not surrounded by walls. At the times of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman raids]] the church with the [[vicarage]] served as a fortified refuge. A second church in the settlement is dedicated to [[Saint Anne]]. It dates to the mid 16th century with a 17th century [[bell tower|belfry]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] additions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number eÅ¡d 3380&lt;/ref&gt;
{{stack|[[File:SloKonjice1.JPG|thumb|[[Old Square]]]]}}

The main street and the transversal connections above the Dravinja are lined with longitudinal or transversally positioned one-storey secular houses with well preserved Gothic cores and Renaissance additions. The facades were restyled in the 19th century ([[Biedermeier]], [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]]). A rarity is the [[Art Nouveau]] building of the savings bank. A [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian column]] near the church dating to the mid 18th century and a columnar shrine dedicated to [[Saint Florian]] above the stream (the author of both is Franc Zamlik, [[1750]]) dominate the open square. The town core is well preserved, with no aggressive breakthroughs of the roofs and diverse concepts inside the condensed nucleus.

Konjice played its part during the [[Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515]], with rebels here composing a letter with their demands to send to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|the emperor]] in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;Baraga JoÅ¾e, Motaln Valerija, KonjiÅ¡ko 860 let (1146-2006) Zbornik ob 860-letnici Slovenskih Konjic, Kronologija Konjic&lt;/ref&gt; Economic development was boosted after construction of main [[Vienna]] to [[Trieste]] road in the 18th century. During the 19th century the town got a local court. The [[Austrian Southern Railway]] was built in 1846, but it ran 15&amp;nbsp;km east of Konjice. On 20 June 1892 works started on a [[narrow gauge]] (760&amp;nbsp;mm) [[steam railroad]] line called ''KonjiÄanka'' from [[PoljÄane]] to Slovenske Konjice, which was opened on 20 December 1892. On 29 June 1921 it was extended to [[ZreÄe]]. It was closed in 1963, and the tracks were removed in 1970. A Museum locomotive K.3 (Gonobitz), build by Krauss factory at [[Linz]], that was used on this railway is on display at the [[Slovenian Railway Museum]] in [[Ljubljana]].

===Forms of the written name===
Over the centuries the name Konjice appears in written documents in various forms: Gonviz (1251), Gombicz (1370), Gannabitz (1570), Gonaviz (1594), Gonavitz (1630), Gonwitz (1636), Gonowitz (1662), Ganowiz (1680), Gonnawitz (1680) and the {{lang-de|Gonobitz}}.

&quot;Konjice&quot; got the [[adjective]] &quot;Slovenske&quot; in the 1918, during [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], in order not to be confused with the town of [[Konjic]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
