'''Envy''' was an [[open source]] application that was written in [[Python (programming language)|python]] and [[pyGTK]]. It was intended to make the process of installing and uninstalling [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] or [[Nvidia]] proprietary graphics [[Device driver|drivers]] on [[Linux distribution]]s easier. Envy automatically detected the correct graphics card, installed the appropriate driver from online [[Software repository|software repositories]] and configured the [[X Window System|X server]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html&lt;/ref&gt; However development stopped in February 2010, due to lack of time on the developer's part and it no longer works with current Linux versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milone12Feb10&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url =http://albertomilone.com/wordpress/?p=477|title = Quick updates on Lucid|accessdate = 30 April 2011|last =Milone|first = Alberto|authorlink = |year = 2010|month =February}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Development==

The Envy project was started by Alberto Milone, an open source enthusiast. Envy Legacy was developed and maintained by Alberto Milone himself, however, EnvyNG (Envy's Next Generation) is developed and maintained collaboratively by Ubuntu developers and Alberto Milone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albertomilone.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
