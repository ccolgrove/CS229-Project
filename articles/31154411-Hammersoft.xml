'''University College Dublin American Football''' is the [[American football]] club at [[University College Dublin]]. It competes in the South Division of the [[Irish American Football League]] (IAFL).

== History ==
The UCD American Football team was founded in Spring 2007 by three University students. After a period of rapid development UCD Team entered the Irish American Football League. In its first ever season UCD team competed exclusively in the [[flag football|flag]] league of the IAFL. A successful run through the flag league set the club up perfectly for its assault on the kitted development league in the IAFL, the DV8's. Under the rules of the IAFL, UCD were forced to spend a year in a development league which was then called a DV8's league. DV8's followed the rules of [[eight-man football]] which is usually played by small schools in the United States.

== 2009 Season ==
DV8's league comprised [[Dublin Dragons]], [[Dublin University American Football Club|Trinity College]], [[Erris Rams]] and [[Craigavon Cowboys]]. UCD American Football managed a 4-0 start which surprised its opponents and fellow teams in the 11-a-side league. Overall in 2008/09 season UCD managed a 6-2 record with only 2 losses coming from north side rivals Trinity College. Trinity managed to pull off two [[shut-out]] victories by adjusting their gameplan after a blowout opening victory by UCD.

== 2010 Season ==

After a successful developmental league season, the UCD American Football club prepared to embark on its first ever season in the 11-a-side IAFL Senior League. In November of 2009, UCD American Football competed in the [[IAFL College Championship]] which was held in [[Limerick]], [[County Limerick]]. UCD American Football fielded a plucky team with little experience and with few returning players. This resulted in disappointing losses to both the [[DCU]] and [[DUAFC | Trinity College]] teams in two low-scoring contests. Failing to advance to the championship game, UCD would return home to prepare for the 2010 season with lessons learned, but a low level of morale and confidence.

UCDAF, failing to secure a home ground within the Belfield campus, booked the vast majority of their home games in ALSAA, near Dublin Airport. The first of these was a crushing defeat at the hands of the [[UL Vikings]], the end of which saw a 56-0 scoreline. Subsequent blowout losses saw the UCD American Football Team finish the 2010 season with a 2-6 record. Internal turmoil in the UCD camp was illustrated in several forfeited away games due to a lack of numbers. However, a mid-season rallying cry from then Team Captain Patrick Buttner and Head Coach John Collins saw UCD up their game later in the season. A season sweep of in-county and in-Division rivals, the [[Dublin Dragons]] ensued along with a close contest against eventual semi-finalists, the [[Carrickfergus Knights]]. 

The 2010 season, despite disappointment, saw the proliferation of a strong rookie class headed by star Quarter-Back Colin O'Meara and Linebacker Nick Hall, who were awarded Team Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year honours, respectively. The resolve of veteran players was also tested ultimately leading to the success of Cornerback David Murphy, All-rounder Vitaly Levdonski and, Team MVP, Free-Safety Kevin McFadden.

== 2011 Season ==

UCD opened the season with a the very first 11-a-side [[Colours Game]], a close 16-20&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanfootball.ie/trinity-college-dublin-20-16-ucd/ Trinity College Dublin 20-16 UCD] &lt;/ref&gt; loss to their north side rivals [[DUAFC | Trinity College]]. Victory would again become elusive to the young team, with the second game of the season being an away game to Division rivals and former Shamrock Bowl Champions [[University of Limerick Vikings]]. The Vikings dominated in a 6-56 rout of UCD, causing the more experienced players to reminisce over the failure of the prior season's shutout. Further disappointment came in an 0-8 loss to the [[Belfast Trojans]] in the two teams first ever fixture. Despite a rock-solid defense and an ominous opening drive in which QB Colin O'Meara suffered a burst vein in his throwing hand, UCD failed to score and were forced to suffer a third defeat in a row.
Their luck would soon change with a dominant 74-8 win over the [[Dublin Dragons]]. UCD started the game in style with an 80 yard kick return touchdown by rookie WR Conor Redmond. Conor would go on to return another Kickoff, a Punt and add a rushing TD, taking his tally to 30 Points for the season after 4 games. Running Back Dave Murphy had a breakout game with 87 rushing yards and 30 points on the ground. 2nd year Quarterback Colin O'Meara added 3 Touchdowns and 118 yards through the air and showed his talent eluding multiple sack attempts. UCDs Defense continued with their fine form by forcing 5 interceptions and kept the Dragons offence off the field for the majority of the game. The team took their form into their game against [[Cork Admirals]] winning 12-8. The Admirals put up a good fight and went into the half with an 8-0 lead over UCD. In the third quarter UCD began to build momentum as linebacker Dylan Carrig roared down the Cork offence with multiple tackles. The touchdown for UCD came when QB Colin O Meara threw to WR Dave Bennett who tucked the ball in at the end zone. The 2 points were converted by Andrew Kenny and Luca D'Ettore got a safety for UCD with a great sack.
