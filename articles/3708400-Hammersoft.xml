'''TV One''' is the [[flagship (television)|flagship network]] of New Zealand [[state broadcaster]] [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ). It was the first major television network in New Zealand, starting out from 1960 onwards as individual stations in major centres and eventually networking to become NZBC TV in 1969. The network was renamed Television One in 1975 upon the breakup of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, and became a part of TVNZ in 1980 when Television One and [[South Pacific Television]] (now sister network [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]]) merged.

TV One is both a commercial television network and a public broadcaster. Central to TV One is news and current affairs, under the banner ''[[One News (New Zealand)|ONE News]]''. Other programming consists of mainly drama, general entertainment and documentaries, both locally and internationally (especially [[United Kingdom|British]]) produced. The network is broadcast on all digital platforms, and is available via analogue off most terrestrial transmitters.

It is estimated that 98.6% of New Zealand households with a television have access to TV One.

==History==
===1960 - 1975: NZBC TV===
At 7.30pm on 1 June 1960, New Zealand's first television channel, AKTV2, started broadcasting in [[Auckland]] from the NZBC building at 74 Shortland Street, previously used to broadcast public radio station 1YA and now home to [[The University of Auckland]]'s [[Gus Fisher Gallery]]. Owned and operated by the New Zealand Broadcasting Service (NZBS, which became the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1962), it initially broadcast for two hours a day, two days a week. [[Christchurch]]'s CHTV3 followed in June 1961, [[Wellington]]'s WNTV1 a month later, and Dunedin's DNTV2 on 31 July 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyearly&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/826505/823802 |title= The Early Years &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; INSIDE TVNZ &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; tvnz.co.nz |publisher= [[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate= 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Television licence]]s were introduced in August 1960, initially costing [[New Zealand pound|NZÂ£]]4 (equal to [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]154 in December 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;historypdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://images.tvnz.co.nz/tvnz/pdf/tvnz_timeline.pdf |title= Where we've come from |format= PDF |publisher= [[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate= 2008-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/0135595.html |title= New Zealand CPI Inflation Calculator - Reserve Bank of New Zealand |accessdate= 2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1965, 300,000 television licences had been issued, and television was broadcasting seven nights a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyearly&quot; /&gt;

Initially, the four television stations were unlinked, and programming had to be shipped between each station. However, for urgent news video, it was possible to link the two stations in each island using Post Office Telephone Department coax toll lines at the expense of a number of voice channels. This method was too costly for the regular programming.

The most notable example of the unlinked stations was when the inter-island ferry TEV ''[[Wahine disaster|Wahine]]'' sunk in Wellington Harbour on 10 April 1968 - newscasts of the disaster had to be transmitted over Post Office lines by WNTV1 to AKTV2 in Auckland. However, due to the storm disrupting both shipping and flights for a further 24 hours, the first video of the sinking crossed Cook Strait via regular transmissions from WNTV1 and was received on a privately owned television set in [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]], at the top of the South Island some 80&amp;nbsp;km line-of-sight distance from Wellington. A Blenheim based news reporter's film camera was pointed at the television, then the exposed film was rushed by road to Christchurch, developed and transmitted over CHTV3, concurrently sent further south to DNTV2 for transmission there via a coax cable link. Interestingly, this Blenheim film appears to be the only surviving footage of the first day, and it shows part of the television set that the camera was pointed at. &lt;!-- (Its still available for download from TVNZ on-line archives, can somebody maybe add a link here?) --&gt;

By the time of the [[Apollo 11]] mission in July 1969 the two islands were each network-capable via microwave link, but the link over Cook Strait had not been completed, and there was no link between New Zealand and the outside world. Footage on video tape had to be brought over from [[Australia]] by a [[RNZAF]] [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra bomber]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/Apollo_11/New_Zealand_TV.html &quot;Television viewers in New Zealand were unable to see the Apollo 11 Moonwalk live.&quot;] Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station&lt;/ref&gt; into Wellington and WNTV1. To forward this to the South Island the NZBC positioned one of its first [[outside broadcasting]] vans to beam the footage to a receiving dish across Cook Strait, from which is was forwarded through the recently commissioned South Island network. The link was completed later that year, the first [[One News (New Zealand)|NZBC Network News]] transmitted on 3 November, read by Dougal Stevenson.&lt;ref name=&quot;historyearly&quot; /&gt;

With the establishment of the [[Warkworth, New Zealand|Warkworth]] satellite station in 1971, New Zealand could finally communicate with the rest of the world. The first broadcast received by satellite was the 1971 [[Melbourne Cup]] on 2 November,&lt;ref name=&quot;50yearsmag&quot;&gt;50 years of NZTV newspaper insert, Television New Zealand, 31 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but the first live international broadcast received by satellite was [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Anne]]'s marriage to [[Mark Phillips]] on 14 November 1973.&lt;ref name= &quot;historytechnology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/826505/823802 |title= Technology &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; INSIDE TVNZ &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; tvnz.co.nz |publisher= [[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate= 2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colour television|Colour]] came on 31 October 1973&lt;ref name=&quot;50yearsmag&quot; /&gt; in preparation for the [[1974 British Commonwealth Games]], being held in [[Christchurch]] in February. Due to the lack of colour facilities, only [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], and [[boxing]] could be broadcast in colour.&lt;ref name= &quot;historytechnology&quot; /&gt;

===1975 - 1980: TV One===
On 1 April 1975, the NZBC was split into 3 separate state owned corporations: Television One, [[TV 2 (New Zealand)|Television Two]] and [[Radio New Zealand]].

The existing NZBC television service became TV One, and was based in Avalon Television Centre in Wellington which opened that day. TV One used the WNTV1 and DNTV2 studios, while AKTV2's Shortland Street studios and CHTV3 studios were used for the new TV2, which commenced later that year.

===1980 - present: TVNZ===
In 1980 the two television channels merged to form [[Television New Zealand]], with the purpose of finally providing a dividend to the Government. The merger was promised to provide 'complementary programming' for both channels.

In August 2008, TV One, along with TV2, moved to [[720p]] [[high-definition television|high-definition]] for the start of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]]. Both channels were originally only available in high-definition on the Freeview&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;HD platform, before commencing high-definition broadcasts on the Sky platform on 1 June 2009 now moved to 1080i in August 2010.

==Branding==
'''TV One''' has used numerous logos throughout its history. The original logo featured large rounded lettering, sometimes with the top half of the 'o' in the lowercase 'one' divided into rainbow colours. This was replaced after the formation of Television New Zealand in 1980, with uppercase inline lettering.

The [[Friz Quadrata]] typeface and a more classical look debuted in 1987, contrasting Channel 2's more contemporary appearance. The more familiar sans serif italic lettering, with mixed case lettering, was launched during the 1996 Olympics, and evolved into the present style in 2003.

On April 8, 2007 TV One introduced a new on-air graphics package, including new [[Television ident|idents]]. [[Light Surrounding You]] by New Zealand band [[Evermore (band)|Evermore]] was used as the theme music, and the same logo, with a revised colour scheme, was retained. At the start of 2010 TV One released a new graphics package with connected red dots, for use in promos, [[Bumper (broadcasting)|break-bumpers]] etc.
