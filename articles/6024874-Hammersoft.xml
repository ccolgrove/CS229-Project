'''Santa Clarita''' is the fourth largest city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]],  [[United States]] and the [[list of cities in California (by population)|twenty-fourth]] largest city in the state of California. The 2010 US Census reported the city's population grew 16.7% from the year 2000 to 176,320 residents. It is located about {{convert|35|mi|km}} northwest of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and occupies most of the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. It is a notable example of a U.S. [[edge city]] or [[boomburb]]. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] rates it as the sixth safest city in the United States with at least 100,000 inhabitants. Santa Clarita was ranked as number 18 of the top 100 places to live by ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2006/top100/index.html MONEY Magazine: Best places to live 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Clarita was incorporated in 1987 as the union of several previously existing communities, including [[Canyon Country, Santa Clarita, California|Canyon Country]], [[Newhall, Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]], and [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]], all of which are the land of the former [[Rancho San Francisco]]. Its principal boundaries are the [[Golden State Freeway|Golden State]] (I-5) and [[Antelope Valley Freeway|Antelope Valley]] (SR-14) freeways; their merger in [[Newhall Pass]] at the city's southernmost point gives Santa Clarita a triangular appearance on the map.

Santa Clarita is usually associated with the [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] [[amusement park]], though the park is located just outside city limits in unincorporated Los Angeles County, and the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (CalArts), located in Valencia.

==History==
'''Santa Clarita''' was only fairly recently incorporated (1987), but its history runs deep. About AD 450, the [[Tataviam]] people arrived, numbering about 2,000 at their zenith.

In 1842, six years before the better-publicized discovery in the Sacramento area, Francisco Lopez made the first documented discovery of gold in California (the document is a mining claim signed by Gov. Juan B. Alvarado in that year). The discovery was made in [http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/placerita.htm Placerita Canyon], an area later used as Hollywood's original back lot.

The community of Newhall is named after [[Henry Mayo Newhall|Henry Newhall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newhallfoundation.org/aboutHMN.html | title=About Henry Mayo Newhall | publisher=Henry Mayo Newhall Foundation | year=2000 | accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a businessman who made his original fortune during the [[California Gold Rush]] after opening up the H.M. Newhall &amp; Company; an extremely successful auction house in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, CA]]  Newhall's next business interest was railroads. He invested in rail companies that would connect San Francisco to other cities and became president of the [[San Francisco and San Jose Railroad]]. In 1870, he and his partners sold the company to [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], whose board of directors he then sat on.  After railroads, Newhall turned his eye to real estate and ranching. He purchased a number of the old Spanish and Mexican land grants in the state for a total of {{convert|143,000|acre|km2}} between Monterey and Los Angeles counties. The most significant portion was the {{convert|46,460|acre|km2}} [[Rancho San Francisco]] in northern Los Angeles County, which he purchased for $2/acre, and which became known as Newhall Ranch after Newhall's death. Within this territory, he granted a right-of-way to Southern Pacific through what is now Newhall Pass, and he also sold them a portion of the land, upon which the company built a town they named after him: Newhall. The first station built on the line he named for his hometown, [[Saugus, Massachusetts]].  Following his death, Newhall's heirs incorporated the [[Newhall Land and Farming Company]], which oversaw the development of the communities that now make up the city of Santa Clarita.

On September 26, 1876, Charles Alexander Mentry brought in the state's first productive oil well at [[Mentryville]], giving rise to the California oil industry. The oil was brought to a refinery at Newhall; today it is the oldest existing refinery in the world. (It was operational from 1874 to 1888.)

A few days earlier, on September 5, 1876, [[Charles Crocker]] and [[Leland Stanford]] joined their railroads in Canyon Country, linking Los Angeles with the rest of the nation for the first time.

The Saugus Cafe, on Railroad Avenue in [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]], was established in 1887&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sauguscafe.htm &quot;Tales of the Saugus Cafe], at [http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/scvhistory.php ''Santa Clarita Valley History in Pictures''] (retrieved July 22, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to be, by far, the oldest still-operating restaurant in Los Angeles County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chowhound.com/topics/62541 &quot;Centenarian (and older) restaurants?&quot;] [[Chowhound]] (post dated August 26, 2004, retrieved July 22, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming in Santa Clarita began shortly after the turn of the 20th century with a veritable Who's Who of actors including [[William S. Hart]], [[Tom Mix]], [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] and a young [[John Wayne]]. Hart and Carey made their homes in the Santa Clarita Valley; today both are operated as county parks.

The Santa Clarita Valley was the scene of the second worst disaster in California history &amp;mdash; The History Channel called it the &quot;worst civil engineering failure of the 20th century&quot; &amp;mdash; when, on the night of March 12, 1928, [[William Mulholland]]'s [[St. Francis Dam]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;scvhs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/stfrancis.htm  | title= SAN FRANCISQUITO CANYON and the ST. FRANCIS DAM | publisher= [[Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society]] | accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the floodwaters reached the Pacific Ocean near Ventura, an estimated 450 people were dead. Within modern Santa Clarita city limits, the site of the future Westfield Valencia Town Center mall was buried beneath muck and mud. Numerous buildings within Santa Clarita became makeshift morgues.

==Geography==
'''Santa Clarita''' is located at {{Coord|34.416561|-118.506443|region:US_type:city|format=dms|display=inline,title}} (34.416561, -118.506443).{{GR|1}}  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|52.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.065|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.12%) is water.

Santa Clarita is situated near the San Fernando fault zone and was affected by the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], also known as the Sylmar quake.  The city was also affected by the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], and many commercial and residential buildings were devastated by its aftermath, including the nearby Newhall pass, the Valencia Mall, and Six Flags Magic Mountain.  The 38 story tall Sky Tower at Magic Mountain swayed 6 feet in each direction during the Northridge earthquake with only minor damages.

===Wildfires===

Santa Clarita is one of the top areas in the nation for wildfire activity. Recent fires in and around the city of Santa Clarita include the Stables (2001), Copper (2002), Bouquet (2002), Simi (2003), Verdale (2003), Foothill (2004), Buckweed (2007), Ranch (2007), Magic (2007), and Sayre (2008) Fires.

===Climate===
Santa Clarita is warm and dry for most of the year with very little rainfall and hot dry summers, due to its close proximity to the Mojave Desert. Characterized by dry hills covered in brush, the months of late summer and early autumn are often referred to as &quot;fire season.&quot; The warmest months of the year are July through September, although it is not unusual for the temperature to reach 100 degrees in early October. Winters are mild, with temperatures dropping below freezing only occasionally on clear winter nights. Rain falls primarily from December through February. Snow has occurred before and was last seen on April 8, 2011 and February 26, 2011, where some areas received a dusting.The area also received measurable snow on January 2, 2011(1-4&amp;nbsp;inches).

===Enterprise Zone===
On July 1, 2007, to offer new businesses tax incentives to operate inside Santa Clarita, the industrial and commercial areas in northern and western Santa Clarita were zoned as a federally recognized Enterprise Zone. Additional warehousing and office space was also constructed. Presently, the Santa Clarita Enterprise Zone covers 97% of all commercial, business, and industrial zoned land within the city of Santa Clarita. This zoning allows local businesses to claim hiring, sales and use tax credits.

The newly designated Enterprise Zone is now the base of operations for several large companies, including True Position Technologies, Salt Creek Grille, [[Condomman.com]], and Trigg Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santaclaritaenterprisezone.com http://www.santaclaritaenterprisezone.com] ''santaclaritaenterprisezone.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Newhall Ranch in Valencia, California|Newhall Ranch]] is a new community that will break ground in 2012 and bring in 70,000 people to Santa Clarita as well as create 20,000 new jobs{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

==Media==
The City of Santa Clarita and surrounding communities are served by several local media properties.

===Newspapers===
The primary daily newspaper, The [[Santa Clarita Signal]], was founded in 1919 and enjoys a weekday circulation of [http://www.verifiedaudit.com/results.php?publication_name=&amp;type_of_report=circulation&amp;publisher_name=&amp;city=santa+clarita&amp;state=&amp;type=&amp;Circulation+Report2=Search ''10,454''] and a Sunday circulation of [http://www.verifiedaudit.com/results.php?publication_name=&amp;type_of_report=circulation&amp;publisher_name=&amp;city=santa+clarita&amp;state=&amp;type=&amp;Circulation+Report2=Search ''11,598'']. The newspaper, which focuses almost exclusively on local news, sports, entertainment and features, is owned by [[Morris Multimedia]], Inc., of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. The Signal's offices on Creekside Road serve as the newspaper's newsroom, production office, IT and web design facility, and printing facility.

Additionally, Santa Clarita is served by the [[Los Angeles Daily News]], a subsidiary of the [[Los Angeles Newspaper Group]] which itself is owned by [[MediaNews Group]] of [[Denver]]. The ''Daily News'' primarily focuses on news, sports and entertainment stories in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and Los Angeles, but also covers Santa Clarita periodically.  ''Daily News'' circulation numbers within the Santa Clarita Valley are not known, but the paper enjoys a circulation of some 157,000 in the greater Los Angeles region, according to its website.

===Radio===
The Santa Clarita Valley is exclusively served by one radio station: AM-1220 KHTS. The commercial radio station, operated by long time residents and public servants Carl and Jeri-Seratti Goldman, broadcasts from studios located in Canyon Country.  The station carries local news, traffic, weather, sports, music and talk shows.  The station's transmitter and antennas are located on [[Sierra Highway]] between Soledad Canyon Rd. and Sand Canyon Rd.  The station has been on the air since October, 2003.  Prior to [[KHTS (AM)|KHTS]], AM-1220 was known as KBET until 1999 when the Goldmans sold it to now-Clear Channel Communications, only to buy it back in 2003.

In addition to KHTS, the City of Santa Clarita and its surrounding communities are indirectly served by a number of major market Los Angeles FM and AM radio stations, though residents often complain that radio reception in the valley is poor due to the surrounding hillsides.

There are also several other Internet Based Radio Stations that serve the public in the Santa Clarita Valley.

===Television===
All local programming for Santa Clarita is carried on a single [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channel, which is operated by SCVTV, a tax-exempt 501c3 nonprofit corporation. It is available to [[Time Warner Cable]] customers throughout the Santa Clarita Valley on Channel 20 and to AT&amp;T U-verse customers under local programming (Channel 99/Santa Clarita). SCVTV carries public, educational and government programming, including Santa Clarita City Council and Planning Commission meetings, history shows, high school and college news programs, talk shows, football games and other programs of local interest.

There are no commercial over-the-air [[television station]]s in the Santa Clarita Valley. The city is part of the [[Los Angeles]] [[media market]].  [[Digital television|Digital]] signals from the Los Angeles stations are available on local [[Cable television|cable television systems]], [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]].

===Television and movie production===

From the first decade of the 20th century to the present day, the Santa Clarita Valley has been a favorite location for producers of films, television shows, and commercials. Even before the first permanent movie set was erected in 1922, the areas topography was exploited for its versatility as the prototypical Western setting. As the &quot;A&quot; Western of the 1910s, '20s and '30s gave way to the &quot;B&quot; Western of the 1940s and '50s, the Santa Clarita Valley continued to play its role, most notably at Gene Autry's Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio in Placerita Canyon and, later, at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s nearby [[Golden Oak Ranch]]. 

The first motion-picture studio, developed within a high tech Industrial Park across from Magic Mountain, [http://www.valenciastudios.com/ Valencia Studios] was [http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-24/business/fi-521_1_valencia-studios founded in 1986 by Robert Thompson]. Most industry experts were initially skeptical about locating a studio in such a remote location. The first motion picture to be shot on its stages was [http://www.insidehollywood.info/index.php?pg=address-valencia-studios&amp;mn=sl Return of the Living Dead, part 2]. Since its inauspicious beginnings, it has featured many high budget movies and television shows such as [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/ Terminator 2] and [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/ Star Trek 4] in the early 90s to [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/ Twilight] in 2008 and the CBS Paramount television series NCIS in 2011. Over the years, Santa Clarita Valley became the home to many [http://www.sc-studios.com/ other studios] as well as hundreds of entertainment related businesses, sometimes nicknamed, the &quot;New Hallywood&quot;, after one of its communities NewHall. The [http://www.filmsantaclarita.com/ Santa Clarita film commission] maintains a vast location library of potential movie sites. 

While the area has a long history of doubling for other places, on rare occasions the Santa Clarita Valley is credited as &quot;itself;&quot; as in the opening of ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' when Brad Pitt and crew attempt to rob a [[Toys R Us]] in Valencia.
