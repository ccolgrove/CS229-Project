The '''Wenatchee Wild''' is a Tier II [[junior hockey|Junior A]] [[ice hockey]] team in the [[North American Hockey League|North American Hockey League's]] [[West Division (NAHL)|West Division]] based in [[Wenatchee, Washington]].  The team joined the NAHL as an expansion team for the 2008-09 season, the team plays its home games at the 4,300-seat [[Town Toyota Center]]. The Wild are well known for their rivalry with the [[Fairbanks Ice Dogs]].

==History==
On September 12, 2006 ground was broken on a new multipurpose event center that would be home to a new ice hockey team. On February 22, 2008, the [[NAHL]] granted Wenatchee Junior Hockey LLC. with conditional approval for an expansion team. On May 20, 2008, Wenatchee Junior Hockey LLC. announced the franchise would be the &quot;Wild.&quot; The name was chosen by a &quot;name-the-team contest&quot; held at local schools in [[Wenatchee]] and [[East Wenatchee]]. The name beat out other options being the Wranglers, Bombers, Wonders, Hockeyes, Winning Walruses and Ice Busters. The Wild played their first game on September 17, 2008 losing to the [[Motor City Metal Jackets]] 2-1 in overtime. The Wild made a championship run in that first season, winning the division title but losing the championship game 3-2 in overtime. They then came back and won the West Division championship in 2009-10 but was eliminated in the [[Robertson Cup Championship Tournament|round-robin championship tournament]]. On June 18, 2010, the Wild announced a new secondary logo.[[Image:Wild Secondary Logo.jpgâ|right|thumb|The Wild's secondary logo. ]]

==Cowbells==
The team has created an identity for them by using cowbells. Similar to the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] of [[MLB]] and [[Sacramento Kings]] of the [[NBA]], the Wild have fans ring cowbells in support of the team. After a Wenatchee [[goal]], fans will ring their bells in support. Since 2008, the Wild have hosted a cowbell giveaway, where the first 2,000 fans through the door get a free cowbell. Many fans also bring their own bells to games.

The Wenatchee Wild have used a slogan each year following the inaugural season. 

2009-2010: ''Our team, our time, our house!''

2010-2011: ''Unfinished Business''

2011-2012: ''The Wolfpack is Back''
