==Highways==
Florida's [[Interstate highway|interstates]], [[Florida State Roads|state highways]] and [[U.S. Highways]] are maintained by the [[Florida Department of Transportation]], with the exception of a few highways in Miami, which are maintained by the [[Miami-Dade Expressway Authority]] (MDX).

==Intercity rail==
[[Amtrak]] service exists in Florida: Sanford, in [[Orlando-Kissimmee, Florida, Metropolitan Statistical Area|Greater Orlando]], is the southern terminus of the [[Auto Train (Amtrak)|Amtrak Auto Train]], which originates at [[Lorton, Virginia]], south of [[Washington, DC]]. Orlando is also the eastern terminus of the [[Sunset Limited]], which travels across the southern United States via [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] to its western terminus of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Florida is served by two additional Amtrak trains (the [[Silver Star (Amtrak train)|Silver Star]] and the [[Silver Meteor]]), which operate between [[New York, New York|New York City]] and Miami.

===High Speed Intercity Rail===
{{Main|Florida High Speed Rail}}
The [[Florida Department of Transportation]] was preparing to build a [[high speed rail]] between [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].  This is the first phase of the [[Florida High Speed Rail]] system.  Soil work began in July 2010 with the federal government expecting full construction to begin in 2011. However, Governor Rick Scott declined the federal funding.

{{See also|Public transportation in Miami}}
[[File:Miami Metrorail Government Center station.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Miami Metrorail]] train at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] in Downtown Miami.]]
Miami's public transportation is served by [[Miami-Dade Transit]] that runs [[Miami Metrorail|Metrorail]], a [[heavy rail]] [[rapid transit]] system, [[Miami-Dade Metromover|Metromover]], a [[people mover]] train system in [[Downtown Miami]], and [[Miami-Dade Transit#Metrobus|Metrobus]], Miami-Dade's bus system. Metrorail runs throughout Miami-Dade County and has 22 stations on a {{convert|22.4|mi|km|1|sing=on}} track connecting to Downtown Miami's Metromover and [[Tri-Rail]]. Metromover has three lines and 21 stations on a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|sing=on}} track connecting [[Uptown Miami|Uptown]] and the [[Brickell|Brickell Financial District]] inside of [[Downtown Miami]]. Outside of [[Miami-Dade County]], public transit in the [[South Florida metropolitan area]] is served by [[Broward County Transit]] and [[Palm Tran]]; intercounty heavy rail service is provided by [[Tri-Rail]], with 18 stations including the region's three international airports.

Orlando utilizes the [[Lynx (transportation)|LYNX]] bus system as well as a downtown bus service called LYMMO, and has attempted to plan a local [[light rail]] service for years. A [[commuter rail]] service â [[SunRail]] â has been approved by all concerning counties and is in final planning stages.

Tampa and its surrounding area use the [[Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority]] system, called &quot;HARTLINE&quot; or simply &quot;HART&quot; for short. In addition, downtown Tampa has continuous trolley services in the form of a [[heritage trolley]] powered by [[Tampa Electric Company]]. Pinellas County and St. Petersburg provide similar services through the [[Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority]] or &quot;PSTA&quot;. The beaches of [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]] also have a continuous trolley bus. Downtown St. Petersburg also has a trolley system, called the Looper.

In [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]], [[VoTran]] provides bus transportation throughout the entire county. Express service to Orlando is also provided.

In [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]], the [[Citrus Connection]] and [[Winter Haven Area Transit]] (WHAT) provide regional transportation in the cities of Lakeland, Bartow, Winter Haven, Auburndale and smaller surrounding municipalities and unincorporated areas.

Florida voters approved a state constitutional amendment in 2000 for the construction of a [[Florida High Speed Rail|high speed rail]] network. Due to public skepticism about the multi-billion dollar price, voters repealed this amendment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/snapshot/sf041108.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The first segment of this network, projected to have opened in 2009, would have connected Tampa and Orlando, in hopes of alleviating traffic on the busy Interstate 4 corridor. Later segments would have connected Miami, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and Pensacola.
