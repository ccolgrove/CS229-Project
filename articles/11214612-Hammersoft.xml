The album contains the musical tracks from the game, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. It spans 44 tracks and covers a duration of 54:24. It was released on July 15, 1991, by Square and NTT Publishing. ''Final Fantasy III'' has been described as the game in which Uematsu's musical style &quot;began to take a more definite form&quot;. Many of the tracks in the soundtrack use &quot;cascading rhythms&quot; in both the foreground and background sounds, as well as a bass rhythm, pushing the limited sound hardware of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] further than in ''[[Final Fantasy II]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOSV&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick; Schweitzer, Ben | title=Final Fantasy III OSV | url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff3ost/index.html | publisher=RPGFan | date=2006-06-17| accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMOFF3OSV&quot;/&gt; The tunes range in style, including &quot;jazzy&quot; and &quot;new age&quot;, and in tempo from slow, somber pieces to more upbeat rhythms. Including the smaller pieces not included in the original soundtrack, ''Final Fantasy III'' contained twice as many pieces as the soundtrack to ''Final Fantasy II''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMOFF3DS&quot;/&gt; The original release bears the catalog number ''N23D-002''.

''Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version'' was well received by critics. Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan felt that it was &quot;one of the strongest soundtracks&quot; of any [[NES]] game, a sentiment that Patrick Gann of RPGFan agreed with. Gann further declared the main theme &quot;Eternal Wind&quot; to &quot;quite possibly be the best [[Overworld#Music|world map music]]&quot; in a video game.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPGFOSV&quot;/&gt; Jon Turner of Soundtrack Central felt that, although the sound limitations of the album detracted it in the eyes of many listeners, the album was still well worth the purchase.&lt;ref name=&quot;STCFF3review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Turner, Jon | url=http://www.soundtrackcentral.com/cds/finalfantasy3_osv.htm |title=Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version| publisher=Soundtrack Central| accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave of Square Enix Music Online, however, disagreed, feeling that, although it was &quot;charming&quot;, it was &quot;one of the weaker Final Fantasy albums&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMOFF3OSV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/dave/ff3.shtml |title=Final Fantasy III Original Sound Version| publisher=Square Enix Music Online| accessdate=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
