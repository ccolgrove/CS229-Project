{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}


'''Intel Core''' is a brand name used for various mid-range to high-end consumer and business [[microprocessors]] made by [[Intel]].

In general, processors sold as Core are more powerful variants of the same processors marketed as entry-level [[Celeron]] and [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]]. Similarly, identical or more capable versions of Core processors are also sold as [[Xeon]] processors for the server market.

The current lineup of Core processors includes the latest [[Intel Core#Core i7|Intel Core i7]], [[Intel Core#Core i5|Intel Core i5]] and [[Intel Core#Core i3|Intel Core i3]], and the older [[Intel Core#Core 2 Solo|Intel Core 2 Solo]], [[Intel Core#Core 2 Duo|Intel Core 2 Duo]], [[Intel Core#Core 2 Quad|Intel Core 2 Quad]], and [[Intel Core#Core 2 Extreme|Intel Core 2 Extreme]] lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/products/desktop/processors/index.htm?iid=processors_body+dt_core |title=Desktop Processors |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enhanced Pentium M based==
{{Main|Enhanced Pentium M (microarchitecture)}}
{{For|details about the processor core|Yonah (microprocessor)}}
The original '''Core''' brand refers to [[Intel]]'s [[32-bit]] mobile [[dual-core]] [[x86]] [[CPU]]s that derived from the [[Pentium M]] branded processors. The processor family used a more enhanced version of the Intel [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6 microarchitecture]]. It emerged in parallel with the [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst microarchitecture]] (Intel P68) of the [[Pentium 4]] brand, and was a precursor of the [[64-bit]] [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core microarchitecture]] of Core 2 branded CPUs. The Core brand comprised two branches: the '''Duo''' (dual-core) and '''Solo''' (Duo with one disabled core, which replaced the Pentium M brand of single-core mobile processor).

The Core brand was launched on January 6, 2006 by the release of the [[32-bit]] '''[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]''' [[CPU]] â Intel's first [[dual-core]] mobile (low-power) processor.  Its dual-core layout closely resembled two interconnected [[Pentium M]] branded CPUs packaged as a single [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] (piece) silicon chip ([[Integrated circuit|IC]]). Hence, the 32-bit microarchitecture of Core branded CPUs â contrary to its name â had more in common with Pentium M branded CPUs than with the subsequent [[64-bit]] [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core microarchitecture]] of [[Core 2]] branded CPUs. Despite a major [[rebranding]] effort by [[Intel]] starting January 2006, some computers with the Yonah core continued to be marked as Pentium M.

The Core series is also known for being the first Intel processor to be used as the main CPU for an [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computer.  The Core Duo was the CPU for the first generation MacBook Pro while the Core Solo appeared in Apple's [[Mac mini]] line. Core Duo signified the beginning of Apple's shift to Intel processors across their entire line.

In 2007, [[Intel]] began branding the Yonah core [[CPU]]s intended for mainstream '''mobile''' computers as [[Pentium Dual-Core]], not to be confused with the '''desktop''' [[64-bit]] [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core microarchitecture]] CPUs also branded as Pentium Dual-Core.

September 2007 and January 4, 2008 mark the discontinuation of many ''Core'' branded CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intel already phasing out first quad-core CPU |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/33752/135/ |publisher=TG Daily |accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intel to discontinue older Centrino CPUs in Q1 08 |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/34115/122/ |publisher=TG Daily |accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intel used the same strategy previously with the [[Intel 80486|486]] CPU in which early [[486SX]] CPUs were in fact manufactured as [[486DX]] CPUs but with the [[Floating point unit|FPU]] disabled.

==64-bit Core microarchitecture based==
{{Main|Core (microarchitecture)}}
The successor to Core is the mobile version of the [[Intel Core 2]] line of processors using cores based upon the Intel '''[[Core (microarchitecture)|Core microarchitecture]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/architecture-silicon/core/ |title=IntelÂ® Microarchitecture |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; released on July 27, 2006. The release of the mobile version of Intel Core 2 marks the reunification of Intel's desktop and mobile product lines as Core 2 processors were released for desktops and notebooks, unlike the first Intel Core CPUs that were targeted only for notebooks (although some small form factor and all-in-one desktops, like the [[iMac]] and the [[Mac Mini]], also used Core processors).

Unlike the Intel Core, Intel Core 2 is a 64-bit processor, supporting [[Intel 64]]. Another difference between the original Core Duo and the new Core 2 Duo is an increase in the amount of [[CPU_cache#Multi-level_caches|Level 2 cache]]. The new Core 2 Duo has tripled the amount of on-board cache to 6 MB. Core 2 also introduced a quad-core performance variant to the single- and dual-core chips, branded Core 2 Quad, as well as an enthusiast variant, Core 2 Extreme. All three chips are manufactured at a 65&amp;nbsp;nm [[photolithography|lithography]], and in 2008, a 45&amp;nbsp;nm lithography and support Front Side Bus speeds ranging from 533&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz. In addition, the 45&amp;nbsp;nm die shrink of the Core microarchitecture adds [[SSE4.1]] support to all Core 2 microprocessors manufactured at a 45&amp;nbsp;nm lithography, therefore increasing the calculation rate of the processors.

===Core 2 Solo===
The '''Core 2 Solo''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2solo/ |title=IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Solo Mobile Processor - Overview |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in September 2007, is the successor to the Core Solo and is available only as an ultra-low-power mobile processor with 5.5 Watt thermal design power. The original U2xxx series &quot;Merom-L&quot; used a special version of the Merom chip with [[CPUID]] number 10661 (model 22, stepping A1) that only had a single core and was also used in some Celeron processors.
The later SU3xxx are part of Intel's [[CULV]] range of processors in a smaller ÂµFC-BGA 956 package but contain the same Penryn chip as the dual-core variants, with one of the cores disabled during manufacturing.

===Core 2 Duo===
The majority of the desktop and mobile Core 2 processor variants are '''Core 2 Duo'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2duo/ |title=IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo Processor: Upgrade Today |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2duo/mobile/ |title=IntelÂ® Coreâ¢2 Duo Mobile Processor |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two processor cores on a single [[Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]], [[Conroe (microprocessor)|Conroe]], [[Conroe (microprocessor)#Allendale|Allendale]], [[Penryn (microprocessor)|Penryn]] or [[Wolfdale (microprocessor)|Wolfdale]] chip. These come in a wide range of performance and power consumption, starting with the relatively slow ultra-low-power Uxxxx (10 W) and low-power Lxxxx (17 W) versions, to the more performance oriented Pxxxx (25 W) and Txxxx (35 W) mobile versions and the Exxxx (65 W) desktop models. The mobile Core 2 Duo processors with an 'S' prefix in the name are produced in a smaller ÂµFC-BGA 956 package which allows building more compact laptops.

Within each line, a higher number usually refers to a better performance, which depends largely on core and front-side bus clock frequency and amount of second level cache, which are model specific. Core 2 Duo processors typically use the full L2 cache of 2, 3, 4 or 6 MB available in the specific [[Core (microarchitecture)#Steppings|stepping]] of the chip, while versions with the amount of cache reduced during manufacturing are sold for the low-end consumer market as [[Celeron]] or [[Pentium Dual-Core|Pentium]] Dual-Core processors. Like those processors, some low-end Core 2 Duo models disable features such as [[Intel Virtualization Technology]]. Details can be found at the [[list of Intel Core 2 microprocessors]].

This allows twice the performance of a dual-core processors at the same clock frequency in ideal conditions.

Initially, all Core 2 Quad models were versions of Core 2 Duo desktop processors, [[Kentsfield (microprocessor)|Kentsfield]] derived from Conroe and [[Yorkfield (microprocessor)|Yorkfield]] from Wolfdale, but later [[Penryn (microprocessor)#Penryn-QC|Penryn-QC]] was added as a high-end version of the mobile dual-core Penryn.

The Xeon 32xx and 33xx processors are mostly identical versions of the desktop Core 2 Quad processors and can be used interchangeably.

This is similar to earlier [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processors labeled as [[Extreme Edition]]. Core 2 Extreme processors were released at a much higher price than their regular version, often $999 or more.

==Nehalem microarchitecture based==
{{Main|Nehalem (microarchitecture)}}
With the '''[[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem microarchitecture]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/technology/architecture-silicon/next-gen/ |title=IntelÂ® Microarchitecture Codenamed Nehalem |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intel introduced a new naming scheme for its Core processors. There are three variants, Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7, but the names no longer correspond to specific technical features like the number of cores. Instead, the brand is now divided from low-level (i3), through mid-range (i5) to high-end performance (i7),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.intel.com/products/roadmap/roadmap.pdf |title=Public Roadmap Desktop, Mobile &amp; Data Center |format=PDF |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which correspond to three to five stars in Intel's Intel Processor Rating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/consumer/products/processors/ratings.htm | title=Intel Processor Ratings |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the entry-level Celeron (one star) and Pentium (two stars) processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/consumer/products/processors/ratings.htm |title=Processor Ratings |publisher=Intel |date=2010-07-09 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common features of all Nehalem based processors include an integrated DDR3 memory controller as well as [[QuickPath Interconnect]] or [[PCI Express]] and [[Direct Media Interface]] on the processor replacing the aging quad-pumped [[Front Side Bus]] used in all earlier Core processors. Also, all these processors have 256 KB L2 cache per core, plus up to 12 MB shared level 3 cache. Because of the new I/O interconnect, chipsets and mainboards from previous generations can no longer be used with Nehalem based processors.

===Core i3===
The '''Core i3''' was intended to be the new low end of the performance processor line from [[Intel]], following the retirement of the [[Intel Core 2|Core 2]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3585 |title=Intel Quietly Announces Core i5 and Core i3 Branding |publisher=AnandTech |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apcmag.com/intel-confirms-core-i3-as-entry-level-nehalem-chip.htm |title=Intel confirms Core i3 as âentry-levelâ Nehalem chip |publisher=Apcmag.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Core i3 processors were launched on January 7, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/10/01/04/0754250/Core-i5-and-i3-CPUs-With-On-Chip-GPUs-Launched?art_pos=3 |title=Core i5 and i3 CPUs With On-Chip GPUs Launched |publisher=Hardware.slashdot.org |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Nehalem based Core i3 was [[Clarkdale (microprocessor)|Clarkdale]]-based, with an integrated [[GPU]] and two cores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20090813091122_Intel_May_Unveil_Microprocessors_with_Integrated_Graphics_Cores_at_Consumer_Electronics_Show.html |title=Intel May Unveil Microprocessors with Integrated Graphics Cores at Consumer Electronics Show |publisher=Xbitlabs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same processor is also available as Core i5 and Pentium, with slightly different configurations.

The Core i3-3xxM processors are based on [[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]], the mobile version of the Clarkdale desktop processor. They are similar to the Core i5-4xx series but running at lower clock speeds and without [[Turbo Boost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091113PD209.html |title=Intel to launch four Arrandale CPUs for mainstream notebooks in January 2010 |publisher=Digitimes.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Intel [[FAQ]] they do not support [[ECC memory|Error Correction Code (ECC) memory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/support/processors/corei3/sb/CS-031175.htm#?iid=subhdr+dnlds Intel Core i3 desktop processor frequently asked questions]&lt;/ref&gt;. According to motherboard manufacturer Supermicro, if a Core i3 processor is used with a server chipset platform such as Intel 3400/3420/3450, the CPU will support ECC with UDIMM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supermicro.com/support/faqs/faq.cfm?faq=10712 Supermicro FAQ on ECC with Core i3]&lt;/ref&gt;. When asked, Intel confirmed that, although the Intel 5 series chipset supports non-ECC memory only with the Core i5 or i3 processors, using those processors on a motherboard with 3400 series chipsets it will support the ECC function of ECC memory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=60512&amp;start=60 Intel correspondence quoted on silentpcreview forum]&lt;/ref&gt;. A limited number of motherboards by other companies also support ECC with Intel Core iX processors; the Asus P8B WS is an example, but it does not support ECC memory under Windows non-server operating systems&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_1155/P8B_WS/#specifications Asus P8B WS specification]: supports &quot;ECC, Non-ECC, Un-buffered Memory&quot;, but &quot;Non-ECC, Un-buffered memory only support for client OS (Windows7, Vista and XP).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;.

The first '''Core i5'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/support/processors/corei5/ |title=Support for the IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ i5 Processor |publisher=Intel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]] microarchitecture was introduced on September 8, 2009 as a mainstream variant of the earlier Core i7,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |unused_data=Intel's Core i7 870 &amp; i5 750, Lynnfield: Harder, Better, Faster Stronger |url=http://anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=3634 |author=Anand Lal Shimpi |publisher=anandtech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Lynnfield (microprocessor)|Lynnfield]] core. Lynnfield Core i5 processors have an 8 MB [[L3 cache]], a DMI bus running at 2.5 GT/s and support for dual-channel DDR3-800/1066/1333 memory and have [[Hyper-threading]] disabled. The same processors with different sets of features ([[Hyper-Threading]] and other clock frequencies) enabled are sold as [[Intel Core i7|Core i7-8xx]] and [[Xeon#3400-series &quot;Lynnfield&quot;|Xeon 3400-series]] processors, which should not be confused with high-end Core i7-9xx and Xeon 3500-series processors based on [[Bloomfield (microprocessor)|Bloomfield]].

The Core i5-5xx mobile processors are named '''[[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]]''' and based on the [[Westmere (microarchitecture)|32 nm Westmere]] shrink of the [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem microarchitecture]]. Arrandale processors have integrated graphics capability but only two processor cores. They were released in January 2010, together with Core i7-6xx and Core i3-3xx processors based on the same chip. The L3 cache in Core i5-5xx processors is reduced to 3&amp;nbsp;MB, while the Core i5-6xx will use the full cache and the Core i3-3xx will have no support for [[Turbo Boost]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20091113PD209.html&lt;/ref&gt;
'''[[Clarkdale (microprocessor)|Clarkdale]]''', the desktop version of Arrandale, is sold as Core i5-6xx, along with related Core i3 and Pentium brands. It has Hyper-Threading enabled and the full 4&amp;nbsp;MB L3 cache.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publish.it168.com/2009/0810/20090810015301.shtml Intel å¥è¾åæ ¸ E5300(ç) èµè®¯|CPU èµè®¯|æ°å¥è¾åç°èº« å¤æ¬¾Core i5ãi3æ­£å¼ç¡®è®¤|IT168 diyç¡¬ä»¶&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Intel &quot;Core i5 desktop processors and desktop boards typically do not support ECC memory&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/support/processors/corei5/sb/CS-032468.htm?wapkw=%28core+i5+ecc%29#10 IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ i5 desktop processor frequently asked questions]&lt;/ref&gt; but information on limited ECC support in the Core i3 section also applies to Core i5 and i7.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}.

===Core i7===
'''Intel Core i7''' is an [[Intel]] brand name for several families of desktop and laptop [[64-bit]] [[x86-64]] processors using the [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem]], [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)#Westmere|Westmere]], and [[Sandy Bridge]] [[microarchitecture]]s. The Core i7 brand is targeted at the business and high-end consumer markets for both desktop and laptop computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/processors/corei7|title=Support for the IntelÂ® Coreâ¢ i7 Processor|publisher=Intel.com|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is distinguished from the [[Intel Core#Core i3|Core i3]] (entry-level consumer), [[Intel Core#Core i5|Core i5]] (mainstream consumer) and [[Xeon]] (server and workstation) brands.

The Core i7 name was introduced with the [[Bloomfield (microprocessor)|Bloomfield]] Quad-core processor in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and models based on the [[Arrandale (microprocessor)|Arrandale]] dual-core mobile processor were added in January 2010. The first six-core processor in the Core lineup is the [[Gulftown (microprocessor)|Gulftown]], which was launched on March 16, 2010. Both the regular Core i7 and the ''Extreme Edition'' are advertised as five stars in the Intel Processor Rating. In January 2011, Intel released the second generation of Core i7 processors. Both the first and second generation of Intel Core i7 processors are rated as 5 stars in the Intel processor rating. The second generation of Intel core processors are based on the &quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; core and are set to be updated in January 2012 with &quot;Ivy Bridge&quot;.

In each of the first three microarchitecture generations of the brand, Core i7 has family members using two distinct system-level architectures, and therefore two distinct sockets (for example, LGA 1156 and LGA 1366 with Nehalem). In each generation, the highest-performing Core i7 processors use the same socket and [[QPI]]-based architecture as the low-end Xeon processors of that generation, while lower-performing Core i7 processors use the same socket and PCIe/DMI/FDI architecture as the Core i5.

&quot;Core i7&quot; is a successor to the [[Intel Core 2]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;

==Sandy Bridge microarchitecture based==
{{Main|Sandy Bridge}}
In early 2011, a new microarchitecture named '''[[Sandy Bridge|Sandy Bridge microarchitecture]]''' was introduced by Intel, which keeps all the existing brands from Nehalem including Core i3/i5/i7, but introduces new model numbers. The initial set of Sandy Bridge processors includes dual- and quad-core variants, all of which use a single 32&amp;nbsp;nm die for both the CPU and integrated GPU cores, unlike the earlier microarchitectures. All Core i3/i5/i7 processors with the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture have a four-digit model number starting with &quot;2&quot;. With the mobile version, the [[thermal design power]] can no longer be determined from a one- or two-letter suffix but is encoded into the CPU number. Starting with Sandy Bridge, Intel no longer distinguishes the code names of the processor based on number of cores, socket or intended usage; they all use the same code name as the microarchitecture itself.

=== {{anchor|SB Core i3}} Core i3 ===
Released on January 20, 2011, the Core i3-2xxx line of desktop and mobile processors is a direct replacement of the 2010 &quot;Clarkdale&quot; Core i3-5xx and &quot;Arrandale&quot; Core i3-3xxM models, based on the new microarchitecture. While they require new sockets and chipsets, the user-visible features of the Core i3 are largely unchanged, including the lack of support for  [[Intel Turbo Boost|Turbo Boost]] and [[AES-NI]]. Unlike the Sandy Bridge based Celeron and Pentium processors, the Core i3 line does support the new [[Advanced Vector Extensions]].

=== {{anchor|SB Core i5}} Core i5 ===
In January 2011, Intel released new quad-core Core i5 processors based on the &quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; microarchitecture at CES 2011. New dual-core mobile processors and desktop processors arrived in February 2011. 

The Core i5-2xxx line of desktop processors are mostly quad-core chips, with the exception of the dual-core Core i5-2390T, and include integrated graphics, combining the key features of the earlier Core i5-6xx and Core i5-7xx lines. The suffix after the four-digit model number designates unlocked multiplier (K), low-power (S) and ultra-low-power (T).
The desktop CPUs now all have four non-SMT cores (like the i5-750), with the exception of the i5-2390T.  The DMI bus is running at 5 GT/s.

The mobile Core i5-2xxxM processors are all dual-core chips like the previous Core i5-5xxM series and share most the features with that product line.

=== {{anchor|SB Core i7}} Core i7 ===
The Core i7 brand remains the high-end for Intel's desktop and mobile processors, featuring the Sandy Bridge models with the largest amount of L3 cache and the highest clock frequency. Most of these models are very similar to their smaller Core i5 siblings. The quad-core mobile Core i7-2xxxQM/XM processors follow the previous &quot;Clarksfield&quot; Core i7-xxxQM/XM processors, but now also include integrated graphics.
