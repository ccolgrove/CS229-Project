'''Highway 5''' is a north-south route in southern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It connects the southern Trans-Canada route ([[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]]) with the northern Yellowhead route ([[British Columbia Highway 16|Highway 16]]), providing the shortest land connection between [[Vancouver]] and [[Edmonton]]. It is 524&amp;nbsp;km (326&amp;nbsp;mi) in total length. The portion of Highway 5 south of [[Kamloops]] is also known as the '''Coquihalla Highway''', while its northern portion is known as the '''Southern Yellowhead Highway'''. The Coquihalla section was a [[toll road]] until 2008.

The current Highway 5 is not the first highway in B.C. to have this designation. Between 1941 and 1953, the section of present-day [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] and [[British Columbia Highway 97A|Highway 97A]] between [[Kaleden, British Columbia|Kaleden]], just north of [[Osoyoos, British Columbia|Osoyoos]], and [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia|Salmon Arm]] was Highway 5. In 1953, the '5' designation was moved to the route designated today as [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] to the south of Kamloops, and its current route north of Kamloops. In 1986, Highway 5 was re-routed to its present alignment between Hope and [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]]. The direct route between Merritt and Kamloops was completed in 1987. The total cost for the highway between Hope and Merritt was approximately $848 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolls taken off Coquihalla&quot;&gt;[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=3044ae3a-ed05-465b-8305-78290b1b07cb Tolls taken off Coquihalla]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--information on cost overruns and initial budget forecasts should be here, also the known graft spending--&gt;

South of Kamloops, Highway 5 is known as the Coquihalla Highway (colloquially &quot;the Coke&quot;), and is a 186&amp;nbsp;km (116&amp;nbsp;mi)-long freeway, varying between four and six lanes and having a posted speed limit of 110&amp;nbsp;km/h (68&amp;nbsp;mph). The route that the Coquihalla follows through the [[Cascade Mountains]] is approximately the same route traced out by the former [[Kettle Valley Railway]], which existed on this route between 1912 and 1958. It is so-named because it generally follows the [[Coquihalla River]] for about 60&amp;nbsp;km (37&amp;nbsp;mi) near [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] and also uses the [[Coquihalla Pass]]. 

In 2003, Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] announced that his [[British Columbia Liberal Party|Liberal]] government was going to turn over the operation and maintenance of the Coquihalla, as well as the toll revenue, to a private operator. The public and numerous businesses in the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior of British Columbia]] were strongly opposed to this plan, so the provincial government shelved it three months after its announcement.

On September 26, 2008, the provincial government lifted the Coquihalla tolls permanently, effective 1:00 pm that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolls taken off Coquihalla&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2005-2009/2008OTP0240-001470.htm Premier Announces End of Tolls]&lt;/ref&gt; The toll station and signs have since been dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/10/02/bc-081002-coquihalla-tollbooths-demolished.html Coquihalla Tollbooths Demolished]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Yellowhead Highway system is considered part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] network, the Highway 5 segment is not marked as such.

==Route details==

[[Image:BC Highway 5 Coquihalla Snowshed.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Great Bear [[snow shed]], approaching from the North.]][[Image:Roadshield YH5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yellowhead Highway 5, southbound]]
Highway 5 begins in the south at its junction with Highway [[Crowsnest Highway|3]] at an uninhabited location known as &quot;Othello,&quot; 7&amp;nbsp;km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) east of [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] (named after a nearby siding on the Kettle Valley Railway, which used many Shakespearean names). The [[exit number]]s on the Coquihalla are a continuation of those on Highway 1 west of Hope. 35&amp;nbsp;km (22&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Othello, after passing through five interchanges, Highway 5 reaches the Great Bear [[snow shed]], which is a landmark on the route. 13&amp;nbsp;km (8&amp;nbsp;mi) north of the snow shed, after passing through another interchange and the 1244&amp;nbsp;m (4,147 ft) [[Coquihalla Pass]], Highway 5 reaches the former toll booth; it was the only highway in British Columbia to have [[Toll road|toll]]s. The toll for a typical passenger vehicle on the highway was [[Canadian Dollar|C$]]10. 61&amp;nbsp;km (38&amp;nbsp;mi) and five interchanges later, the Coquihalla enters the city of [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]] at its south junction with Highway 5A and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]].

[[Image:Wrongway-multiplex.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the [[wrong-way concurrency]] between Highways 5 and 97 through Kamloops.]]
Highway 5 then goes 4&amp;nbsp;km (2Â½ mi) through the eastern area of Merritt before reaching its northern junction with Highway 5A.  The Coquihalla has three more interchanges and one mountain pass, the [[Clapperton Creek Summit]], in its remaining 72&amp;nbsp;km (45&amp;nbsp;mi) between Merritt and its end at a junction with Highways 1 and 97 within the Afton area of Kamloops. Highway 5 continues east for 7&amp;nbsp;km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) concurrent with Highways 1 and 97 through Kamloops. This stretch of road, which carries 97 ''South'' and 5 ''North'' on the same lanes (and vice versa), is the only [[wrong-way concurrency]] in British Columbia.

After separating from Highways 1 and 97, Highway 5 proceeds north for approximately 19&amp;nbsp;km (12&amp;nbsp;mi), temporarily leaving Kamloops city limits as a four-lane highway, before re-entering the city at the [[Rayleigh, British Columbia|Rayleigh]] community and continuing north. It becomes a two-lane highway at [[Heffley Creek, British Columbia|Heffley Creek]] and the exit to [[Sun Peaks]] resorts, both of which indicate the final northern boundary of Kamloops.

Highway 5 follows the [[North Thompson River]] north from Heffley Creek for approximately 54&amp;nbsp;km (34&amp;nbsp;mi), along a parallel course with a branch of the [[Canadian National Railway]], passing through [[Barriere, British Columbia|Barriere]], to a junction with [[British Columbia Highway 24|Highway 24]] at [[Little Fort, British Columbia|Little Fort]]. 30&amp;nbsp;km (19&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Little Fort, while continuing to follow the North Thompson and the CN Railway, Highway 5 reaches the community of [[Clearwater, British Columbia|Clearwater]]. It proceeds northeast for another 107&amp;nbsp;km (67&amp;nbsp;mi), passing [[Vavenby, British Columbia|Vavenby]] en route, to the community of [[Blue River, British Columbia|Blue River]], and then 109&amp;nbsp;km (68&amp;nbsp;mi) further north through the [[Columbia Mountains]], passing by the community of [[Valemount, British Columbia|Valemount]] to its northern terminus at [[TÃªte Jaune Cache, British Columbia|TÃªte Jaune Cache]], where it meets Highway 16.

==Trivia==

Kw'ikw'iya:la '''(Coquihalla)''' in the Halq'emeylem language of the [[StÃ³:lÅ]], is a place name meaning &quot;stingy container&quot;. It refers specifically to a fishing rock near the mouth of what is now known as the Coquihalla River. This rock is a good platform for spearing salmon.  According to StÃ³:lÅ oral history, the skw'exweq (water babies, underwater people) who inhabit a pool close by the rock, would swim out and pull the salmon off the spears, allowing only certain fisherman to catch the salmon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/coquihalla/index.htm B.C. Ministry of Transportation] - Coquihalla Rates and Information&lt;/ref&gt;

The route is also often referred to simply as &quot;The Coke.&quot; A popular song by country singer [[Corb Lund]], entitled &quot;Hurtin' Albertan&quot;, makes reference to this, with the lyric &quot;...there's good weather up on the Coke.&quot;

Also, the Calgary punk Band Chixdiggit sing about this highway in their song &quot;I Drove the Coquihalla&quot;.
