'''K3b''' (from '''KDE Burn Baby Burn''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dot.kde.org/2006/04/17/k3b-fundraiser-2006-complete-success |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;K[4]B?&lt;/nowiki&gt; |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Compact Disc|CD]] and [[DVD]] [[optical disc authoring|authoring]] application by [[KDE]] for [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s. It provides a [[graphical user interface]] to perform most CD/DVD burning tasks like creating an Audio CD from a set of audio files or copying a CD/DVD, as well as more advanced tasks such as burning eMoviX CD/DVDs. It can also perform direct disc-to-disc copies. The program has many default settings which can be customized by more experienced users. The actual disc [[CD recorder|recording]] in K3b is done by the [[command line interface|command line]] utilities [[cdrecord]] or [[cdrkit]], [[cdrdao]], and [[growisofs]]. As of version 1.0, K3b features a built-in [[Ripping|DVD ripper]].

As is the case with most KDE applications, K3b is written in the [[C++]] [[programming language]] and uses the [[Qt (framework)|Qt GUI toolkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kde.org/whatiskde/devview.php |title=Developer's View |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070202191430/http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/devview.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.kde.org/language-bindings/ |title=Language bindings |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released under the [[GNU General Public License]], K3b is [[free software]].

A first alpha of a [[KDE Platform|KDE Platform 4]] version of K3b was released on 22 April 2009, the second on 27 May 2009 and a third on 14 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://k3b.org/ |title=Project home page announcement |accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mandriva.com/2009/03/19/mandriva-helps-porting-k3b-in-qt4/ |title=Mandriva helps porting K3b in Qt4 |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trueg.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/intermission-why-i-needed-to-fork-qprocess-for-k3b/ |title=Intermission: Why I Needed To Fork QProcess For K3b |accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
