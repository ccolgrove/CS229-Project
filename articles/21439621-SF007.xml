==Development==
After successfully relaunching the franchise with ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' in 2008, there was considerable speculation as to whether The CW planned to create a new version of ''Melrose Place'' in a similar vein. An article in E! Online reported the possibility of a new version of ''Melrose'' in September 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;EO 2008-09-23&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b30508_melrose_place_now_under_renovation.html |title=''Melrose Place'': Now Under Renovation? |first=Marc |last=Malkin |publisher=EOnline.com |date=September 23, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though The CW declined to confirm any such project at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EO 2008-09-23&quot;/&gt; Some weeks later, The CW and [[CBS Paramount Network Television]] (successor-in-interest of [[Spelling Television]] and therefore the legal rights holders to ''Melrose Place'') said they were &quot;exploring the possibility&quot; of creating a new version of the series, to potentially debut in the 2009â2010 TV season and targeting their &quot;prized demographic: young women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/10/studio_cw_in_talks_for_new_mel.php|title=Studio, CW in Talks for New ''Melrose Place''|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=October 2008|publisher=TVWeek.com|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EO 2008-10-28&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b66075_melrose_place_gets_new_lease_on_life.html |title=''Melrose Place'' Gets a New Lease on Life |first=Marc |last=Malkin |publisher=EOnline.com |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,444785,00.html|title=''Melrose Place'' Spinoff In the Works|date=October 29, 2008|publisher=FoxNews.com|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original series creator [[Darren Star]] also confirmed that discussions had taken place, but nothing was official. On October 31, 2008, ''Entertainment Weekly'' writer Michael Ausiello reported that ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' creator [[Mark Schwahn]] had been approached about running what was being called ''&quot;Melrose Place 2.0&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW 2008-10-31&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/10/one-tree-hill-b.html |title=Exclusive ''Melrose 2.0'' Deets: Heather Returning?

In January 2009, The CW's head of entertainment, [[Dawn Ostroff]], discussed the network's plans to develop a ''Melrose Place'' update, stating that she had yet to identify a writer, and that the proposed project would include both returning and new characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;PG 2009-01-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.post-gazette.com/blogs/tunedin/archive/2009/01/12/press-tour-journal-reviving-melrose-place.aspx |title=Press Tour Journal: Reviving ''Melrose Place'' |first=Rob |last=Owen |publisher=Post-Gazette.com |date= January 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that the original ''Melrose Place'' series which began in 1992 started &quot;at a time not unlike what we're going through now ... they talked about the building being foreclosed on, people not having jobs. It took place in a very similar time, a time when the economy was in a downturn.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PG 2009-01-12&quot;/&gt; Ostroff also told reporters that unlike the original series, the new version would try to capture life in the Los Angeles Melrose neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;PG 2009-01-12&quot;/&gt; When asked whether the new series would be the &quot;earnest ''Melrose'' of season one or the nutty Kimberly-blowing-up-the-apartment-complex of later years,&quot; Ostroff explained, &quot;In the beginning you've got to get invested in the characters, but I also think it can't be so dramatic and sleepy that not enough is going on. Our fans really love that heightened drama as you can see when you watch ''One Tree Hill'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]''. So the job is to get them emotionally invested in the people and then do storytelling and have twists and turns and surprises you wouldn't have expected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PG 2009-01-12&quot;/&gt;

On January 19, 2009, with Mark Schwahn now officially off the project, Ausiello reported that The CW were talking with Darren Swimmer and Todd Slavkin (showrunners of The CW's ''[[Smallville]]'') about helming the new ''Melrose Place''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW 2009-01-19&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/01/exclusive-small.html?xid=rss-feed-tvwatch-%27Melrose+Place%27+meets+%27Smallville%27%3F.html |title=Exclusive: ''Smallville'' bosses mull ''Melrose'' remake |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |publisher=EW.com |date=January 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2009 Ausiello confirmed that Swimmer and Slavkin were officially hired as the show runners of the spin-off, and discussed some of the new show's characters that were yet to be cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW 2009-02-06&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/exclusive-look.html |title=Exclusive: Look who's moving into the new ''Melrose Place'' |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |publisher=EW.com |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT 2009-02-06&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/02/melrose-place-r.html |title=''Smallville'' producers set to helm ''Melrose Place'' reboot |first=Denise |last=Martin |publisher=LATimes.com |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported on February 23, 2009 that The CW had officially [[greenlight|greenlit]] a pilot episode for the new ''Melrose Place'' written by Swimmer and Slavkin, which would &quot;follow the original formula and chronicle a new group of twenty-somethings dwelling in Los Angeles' perpetually trendy Melrose neighborhood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HR 2009-02-23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EO 2009-02-24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT 2009-02-24&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/02/melrose-place-1.html |title=''Melrose Place'' remake will be directed by an Oscar winner |last=Fernandez |first=Maria Elena |date=February 24, 2009 |publisher=LATimes.com |accessdate=July 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Academy Award]]-winner [[Davis Guggenheim]] (''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'') was announced as the director and executive producer of the pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR 2009-02-23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EO 2009-02-24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT 2009-02-24&quot;/&gt;

The new series, ultimately just titled ''Melrose Place'' like its 1990s predecessor, premiered on The CW on September 8, 2009.

With the series in production, the ''Los Angeles Times'' noted on August 30, 2009 that the new ''Melrose Place'' intends to reflect life in Los Angeles beyond the way the original did by filming &quot;everywhere from skid row to Sunset Boulevard and using popular venues, such as the Cinerama Dome and Walt Disney Concert Hall, as well as opulent mansions in Malibu and the so-called bird streets of the Hollywood Hills.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-melrose30-2009aug30,0,5602928.story |title= A return to ''Melrose Place'' |last=Fernandez |first=Maria Elena |date=August 30, 2009 |publisher=LATimes.com |accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producers Slavkin and Swimmer both grew up in L.A., and wanted to update the series &quot;in a really cool, relevant way and not just slap the name ''Melrose Place'' on it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;/&gt; Concerned about repeating the same difficulties which occurred when incorporating original series characters in the ''90210'' update, The CW's Ostroff was drawn to Slavkin and Swimmer's intent to &quot;create a new world but also hang on to what was special about ''Melrose'' originally ... I wanted to make sure that we used the old characters in the right way, in a way that made sense to the new characters as well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;/&gt; Swimmer added, &quot;We felt the only way to incorporate the old characters into the new show was for it to feel like it was part of the story and came from the story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;/&gt;

==Cancellation==
Lagging ratings caused frequent speculation that the show would not be brought back for a second season. [http://tvbythenumbers.com/ &quot;TV By The Numbers&quot;], a site that publishes television ratings to the public, repeatedly  stated that the show had not hit its target audience and was likely to be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/06/life-unexpected-going-down-to-the-wire/47472&lt;/ref&gt; After the season finale, series producer [[Darren Swimmer]] left a statement on his Twitter account saying, &quot;Melrose Place: Thnx for the love, fans. Honestly, a season 2 looks like it ain't gonna happen. All signs say no, but no official word yet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/DSwim/status/12207626565&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2010, two days before the new CW line-up was to be released, Swimmer left another message about the fate of the show: &quot;I think it's fair to say we won't be renewed for next season. It was a great run. Mad props to everyone involved with the show &amp; our fans!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/DSwim/status/14209364025&lt;/ref&gt; The CW officially canceled the series on May 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt; [http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/05/19/cws-melrose-place-canceled/51848 CW's Melrose Place Canceled] ''TV By The Numbers'' May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On May 21, 2009, Ausiello reported that Leighton's character Sydney dies in the pilot and sets off a murder mystery, but noted that the actress would continue to appear in multiple episodes of the season through flashbacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW Ausiello 2009-05-21&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ausiello |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ausiello |title=''Melrose'' twist revealed |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/05/major-spoiler-a.html|publisher=EW.com |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' later confirmed that Sydney would be found dead in the first 10 minutes of the premiere episode, a turn of events which means &quot;anything could happen&quot; in the new series, according to executive producer Slavkin.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;/&gt; &quot;It will feel nostalgic, but it's not the old ''Melrose'',&quot; Slavkin said.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;/&gt; The ''Times'' added that initial episodes would revolve around the interrelationships of the apartment complex's seven residents and the theme that &quot;no one is exactly who they seem,&quot; with Sydney's murder solved mid-season.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times 2009-08&quot;/&gt; As the series opens, new Melrose Place resident Violet finds Sydney floating dead in the courtyard pool. Student doctor Lauren reluctantly accepts cash for sex to pay her medical school tuition, as aspiring filmmaker Jonah is offered a directing deal in exchange for his silence about a famous director's indiscretion. David, Sydney's ex-lover and the police's initial suspect in her death, is bailed out of jail by bisexual publicist Ella, who provides a false alibi and has her own reasons for wanting Sydney out of the way. While David steals a valuable painting from his own father Michael Mancini in the dark of night, [[sous chef]] Auggie â seemingly the resident most upset by Sydney's death â burns a bloody chef's uniform.

Holding onto her job puts pressure on Ella, whose efforts to further secret crush Jonah's career do not help his relationship with his new fiancÃ©e Riley. Lauren is compelled to continue prostituting herself, and while Sydney's sister Jane's attempt to blackmail Ella fails, she follows through on her promise to clue in the police on Ella's motives for Sydney's murder. Mousy Violet is revealed to be Sydney's secret daughter, and schemes to both get close to Auggie, and punish Michael for mistreating Sydney.
