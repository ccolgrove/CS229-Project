'''Saint Saviour's''' is the [[Church of England]] parish church for the village of [[Branston, Staffordshire|Branston]], south of [[Burton upon Trent]]. It is part of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]].

The church was built in 1864,&lt;ref name=Raven2004 /&gt; designed by the [[architect]], [[Vincent Cook]].

The church building was originally single-celled, with a [[bell turret]] at its western end. It contains an [[organ chamber]] and [[vestry]], with a stone [[reredos]] installed in memory of the first [[vicar]], [[John Bramell]] (1871 - 1897).

A porch was built in 1981 at the southern end of the church, to replace an early predecessor. At the same time, a meeting room was built on the front of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tringham|2003|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, stained glass from St James's in [[Derby]] was placed in the east window.

The original [[vicarage]], to the northeast of the church, is now a successful restaurant, aptly named The Old Vicarage. A new vicarage was built behind the church in 1985.
