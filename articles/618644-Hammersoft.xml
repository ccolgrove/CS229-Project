The '''Goa'uld''' (pronounced {{IPA-art|É¡oËÉËÊuËld|}} ''go-AH-oold'', commonly shortened to {{IPA-en|É¡oÊËuËld|}} ''go-OOLD'' or {{IPA-en|ËÉ¡uËld|}} ''goold'' in English) are a [[fiction]]al [[symbiotic]] race of [[ancient astronauts]] from the [[United States|American]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] [[military science fiction]] [[television franchise]] ''[[Stargate]]''. The Goa'uld are parasites from the planet P3X-888, integrated within a [[host (biology)|host]], most of the time [[human]]. The resulting creatures are a powerful race bent on galactic conquest and domination, largely without pity, compassion or remorse. They are collectively the greatest extraterrestrial threat to [[Earth]] in the first eight seasons of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' known to the [[Stargate Command]] (SGC). They are pejoratively called &quot;snakes&quot; or &quot;snakeheads&quot; by [[Jack O'Neill]]. The Goa'uld are the main enemies of [[SG-1]] for most of the series, until they are replaced in this capacity by the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] in seasons 9 and 10. They also appear in the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' episode {{sgcite|Critical Mass|Atlantis}}, and in the DVD movie ''[[Stargate: Continuum]].

The Goa'uld were created by writers [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]] for the 1994 movie, ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. Although the alien race in the film was never named, the pilot episode &quot;[[Children of the Gods]]&quot; (1997) established that the [[alien race]] seen in the movie are the Goa'uld. In the series it is confirmed that they are a [[parasite|parasitic race]] which uses hosts to survive. They were the dominant species in our [[galaxy]].

== Development ==
Jeff Kleiser and a special effects team working on ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994) the film, used around 40 people and used self-written image-creation and compositing software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] and the Horus guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;specialeffects&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/wow-how-did-they-do-that-1568272.html |title=Wow, how did they do that? |publisher=''The Independent'' | language=| accessdate=2009-05-14 | location=London | first=Beth | last=Porter | date=1995-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pharaoh mask in the opening credits was made out of fiber glass and was modeled in the workshop. The sequence was filmed with a [[Motion control photography|motion-control camera]] to give a better depth of field.&lt;ref name=&quot;acemmerich&quot;&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Roland Emmerich]] |date=2001 |title=Audio Commentary for Stargate |medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was originally planned to play out in a chronological order, but when [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]] edited the film to tighten the narrative, they decided to change the first scene of the film into a flashback to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdevlin&quot;&gt;[[Dean Devlin]]. (2001). ''Audio Commentary for Stargate'' [DVD]. [[MGM Home Entertainment]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] (from ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'') look in the series was copied from the [[Egypt]]ian look of Ra from the film.&lt;ref name=tvzones58_28&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Steven Eramo | title=Christopher Judge â Judge For Yourself |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 58 |pages=28â32 |month=July |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The look of the Goa'uld such as [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] was initially based on Ra in the feature film.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_62&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Steven Eramo | title=Jan Newman â Born With It â Make-up |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 46 |pages=62â65 |month=July |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the eighth season of ''Stargate SG-1'' was intended to be the last, the producers had finished it with the defeat of the Goa'uld and [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]s. When the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] however renewed the series, the producers had grown creatively tired of writing endings. Having made good experiences with the first season of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', the producers hence decided to revamp the series in more fronts than just adding new characters by introducing new villains and new missions. Thus they considered the beginning of Season 9 as the pilot of a new show and replaced the Goa'uld with the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] as the main villains.&lt;ref name=tvzones64_24&gt;{{Cite news |last=Eramo |first=Steven |author-link= | title=Stargate SG-1 Season 9 preview - Nine Lives |newspaper=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special #64 |pages=24â30; 44â48 56â60 |date=July 2005 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goa'uld still appeared in the show, but in a regular basis under the command of [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]].

The astronomers [[David J. Tholen]] and [[Roy A. Tucker]] enjoyed the ''SG-1'' arch villain [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] so much that they named their discovered [[near-Earth asteroid]] &quot;[[99942 Apophis]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooke |first=Bill |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3434 |title=Asteroid Apophis set for a makeover |publisher=''[[Astronomy Magazine]]'' |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Fiction|section|date=December 2009}}
===Background===
In the Stargate universe, the word &quot;Goa'uld&quot; means &quot;children of the gods&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Children of the Gods&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Children of the Gods |episodelink=Children of the Gods |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Mario Azzopardi]] |writers=[[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=1 |number=1 and 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Goa'uld evolved on the planet P3X-888, where there are still populations of primitive Goa'uld.&lt;ref name=&quot;The First Ones&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=The First Ones |episodelink=The First Ones |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Peter DeLuise]] |writers=Peter DeLuise |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=4|number=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their original hosts were the [[Unas (Stargate)|Unas]], also native to the planet.  The Goa'uld largely abandoned P3X-888 after deciphering the Stargate, spreading throughout the galaxy and conquering other races. Eventually, the Goa'uld began to die out, until in the eighth or ninth millennium BC [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Ra|Ra]] discovered Earth and found ancient humans to be much more suitable hosts, due to the ease by which they can be repaired by Goa'uld technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Stargate |episodelink=Stargate (film) |series=Stargate franchise|serieslink=Stargate |credits=[[Roland Emmerich]] |writers=Roland Emmerich and [[Dean Devlin]] |network= |season=|number=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goa'uld ruled Earth for thousands of years, in the personae of gods from Earth's classical religions. It is never clarified however, whether the Goa'uld impersonate deities that already existed in human mythology or if they themselves were the origin of those deities. From the humans the Goa'uld engineered the [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]], to serve as soldiers and incubators for their young. They also transplanted humans from Earth throughout the galaxy via the Stargate network to serve as slaves and potential hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Children of the Gods&quot; /&gt; Ra's rule over Earth came to an end with a rebellion in the third millennium BC, they had forgotten about Earth until the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot; /&gt;

===On the show===
In the continuity of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the first Goa'uld faced by Earth is [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Ra|Ra]] in the [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'' film]], although the concept of the Goa'uld had not yet been developed when the movie was released. In the early seasons of the show, [[SG-1]] faces and defeats the powerful Goa'uld [[Goa'uld characters in Stargate#Apophis|Apophis]] twice,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Serpent's Lair&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Serpent's Lair |episodelink=The Serpent's Lair (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Jonathan Glassner]] |writers=[[Brad Wright]] |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=2 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Enemies&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Enemies |episodelink=Enemies (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=[[Brad Wright]], [[Robert C.

==Characteristics==
{{In-universe|section|date=December 2009}}
[[Image:SGGoauldHuman.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Kawalsky]] after being taken by a Goa'uld symbiote, showing the characteristic &quot;eye-flash&quot;]]
Goa'uld symbiotes are serpentine lifeforms with four jaws and glowing yellow eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Enemy Within&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Enemy Within |episodelink=The Enemy Within (Stargate SG-1)|series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=Dennis Berry |writers=[[Brad Wright]] |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=1 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally aquatic, mature Goa'uld symbiotes have extensive fins and are powerful swimmers, with the ability to launch themselves from the water towards prospective hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;The First Ones&quot;/&gt; A Goa'uld can burrow into their host through the back of the mouth or the neck, though they prefer the latter because they wish to avoid remembering the look of horror on the host's face.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tok'ra&quot;/&gt; They then enter the brain, take control of the body, and gain total access to the host's memories;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Enemy Within&quot; /&gt; thus, the Goa'uld often use symbiote implantation as a means of interrogation that also provides a useful future spy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Out of Mind&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Out of Mind |episodelink=Out of Mind (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=[[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=2 |number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moebius&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Moebius |episodelink=Moebius (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Peter DeLuise]] |writers=[[Joseph Mallozzi]], [[Paul Mullie]], [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=8 |number=19 and 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A defining characteristic of a Goa'uld host is a brief glowing of the eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot; /&gt; This occurs when the Goa'uld first takes control and upon its death,&lt;ref name=&quot;Moebius&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;In the Line of Duty&quot; /&gt; as well as in moments of extreme emotion or to add emphasis or intimidation. A Goa'uld-occupied host typically speaks in an eerily [[flanging|flanged]], deepened register.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot; /&gt; However, the voice is not necessary, and Goa'uld can speak in a normal tone if they choose, usually when they need to deceive someone. The Goa'uld instill their hosts with superhuman strength, perfect health, and accelerated healing.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Enemy Within&quot; /&gt; The host's life is also lengthened into centuries, which the Goa'uld extend even further using a [[sarcophagus (Stargate)|sarcophagus]]. However, repeated use of the sarcophagus has severe psychological consequences, and is believed to be a main factor in the Goa'uld's evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tok'ra&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Need&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Need |episodelink=Need (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=David Warry-Smith |writers=[[Damian Kindler]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] |network=[[Showtime (United States)|Showtime]] |season=2 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being host to a Goa'uld has been described as a living nightmare, and those humans who have been hosts for thousands of years are widely suspected to have gone insane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summit&quot; /&gt;

Once implanted, the Goa'uld loses its fins and its body atrophies, leaving only a dead husk behind, as seen with [[Charles Kawalsky]]. Modern Goa'uld symbiotes contain the fictional element [[naqahdah]] in their bloodstream, an attribute that is passed on to their host. The naqahdah allows Goa'uld, Jaffa, and former Goa'uld hosts to sense the presence of other symbiotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=In the Line of Duty |episodelink=In the Line of Duty (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=[[Robert C. Cooper]] |network=[[Sky One]] |season=2 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the primordial Goa'uld on P3X-888 do not possess naqahdah.&lt;ref name=&quot;The First Ones&quot; /&gt; Implanted symbiotes cannot be removed from their host via conventional surgery; it can retain control of the host even if the symbiote's original body is cut away.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Enemy Within&quot; /&gt; The symbiote can also release a deadly toxin into the host if it is threatened, and holding the life of the host hostage is a common Goa'uld tactic. The [[Tok'ra]] have developed a means to extract the symbiote while sparing the host by killing the symbiote instantly before it can release the toxin. The [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]] and the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] have also developed their own means of separating a Goa'uld symbiote from its host.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pretense&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pretense |episodelink=Pretense (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=David Warry-Smith |writers=[[Katharyn Powers]] |network=[[Sky One]] |season=2 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Critical Mass&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Critical Mass |episodelink=Critical Mass (Stargate Atlantis) |series=Stargate Atlantis |serieslink=Stargate Atlantis |credits=[[Andy Mikita]] |writers=[[Carl Binder]] |network=[[The Movie Network]] |season=2 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an implanted symbiote dies without releasing the toxin, its body is absorbed into the body of the host.&lt;ref name=&quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;/&gt;

The Goa'uld possess a [[genetic memory in fiction|genetic memory]] passed directly from parent to offspring, which perpetuates the evil of the Goa'uld through generations. Most Goa'uld are asexual, though they usually take on the gender of their preferred host. The exception are the Goa'uld Queens, who over time are able to spawn millions of larvae, once seeded with genetic material from another Goa'uld or even a human.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hathor&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hathor |episodelink=Hathor (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Brad Turner (director)|Brad Turner]] |writers=[[Jonathan Glassner]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |season=1 |number=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queens exercise a great deal of control over the biochemistry of their progeny, and can deny their offspring genetic memory in order to create &quot;blank&quot; symbiotes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cure&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Evolution |episodelink=Evolution (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Peter DeLuise]] |writers=[[Damian Kindler]], [[Michael Shanks]] and Peter DeLuise |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] and [[Sky One]] |season=7 |number=11 and 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa'uld larvae that mature in the wild have only a 50% chance of successfully taking a host; the Goa'uld engineered the Jaffa as incubators to improve these odds. The human offspring of two Goa'uld hosts is known as a Harcesis. The conception of Harcesis children is forbidden, as they would contain the genetic memories of both Goa'uld parents and thus pose a major threat to the established Goa'uld order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secrets&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Secrets |episodelink=Secrets (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=Duane Clark |writers=Terry Curtis Fox |network=[[Sky One]] |season=2 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
[[Image:goa'uld alphabet.GIF|right|150px|thumb|One of the &quot;Goa'uld&quot; alphabets used on ''Stargate SG-1'']]
In the [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'' film]], [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] identifies the language spoken by Ra and the Abydonians as a variant of ancient Egyptian. The [[fictional language]] of the Goa'uld on ''Stargate SG-1'' is also spoken by their human slaves and the Jaffa, often interchanging with English dialogue without explanation. The most commonly used Goa'uld words in the show are &quot;chappa'ai&quot; (&quot;Stargate&quot;), &quot;Tau'ri&quot; (both &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;Earthlings&quot;, can also be translated as &quot;those who came before&quot;, referencing the galaxy's human population's planet of origin), &quot;shol'va&quot; (&quot;traitor&quot;, frequently applied to [[Teal'c]] by various Goa'uld and Jaffa characters), and &quot;kree&quot; (with many possible meanings including &quot;come&quot;, &quot;listen up&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, &quot;attention&quot;, &quot;be prepared&quot; and &quot;take aim&quot;; appearing in many different episodes under different contexts). Most Goa'uld written script used in the show are based on the [[Egyptian hieroglyphic]] script. The alphabet in the series is actually the Nahkt hieroglyphic font, and it was used to write various jokes in different episodes.  Another hieroglyph font used in the series was the [[Meroitic script]] font.&lt;ref name=&quot;Children of the Gods&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Enemy Within&quot;/&gt;

===Technology===

The Goa'uld scavenged or conquered most of their advanced technologies from other races. However, there are innovators amongst the Goa'uld; [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] and [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] in particular have been depicted with a great deal of technological ingenuity.

=== Goa'uld Empire ===
At the time that ''Stargate SG-1'' begins, the Goa'uld are presented as the dominant species of the Milky Way galaxy and have been so for thousands of years. By and large the Goa'uld are shown to be utterly arrogant and obsessed with gaining personal power; to this end they constantly scheme and fight amongst themselves. Arrogance is presented as their greatest weakness; Teal'c once states that he has seen many brilliant battle plans fall apart because a single Goa'uld needed to boast about them.&lt;ref name=&quot;In the Line of Duty&quot; /&gt; The Goa'uld are shown to rule by fear and oppression, regularly employing mass torture and executions, and using their advanced technology to present themselves as omnipotent gods. They are presented as regularly attacking advanced races that they believe may pose a potential threat, such as the Reetou&lt;ref name=&quot;Show and Tell&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Show and Tell |episodelink=Show and Tell (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=Peter DeLuise |writers=[[Jonathan Glassner]] |network=[[Sky One]] |season=2|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Re'ol,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fifth Man&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Fifth Man |episodelink=The Fifth Man (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=Peter DeLuise |writers=[[Joseph Mallozzi]] and [[Paul Mullie]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |season=5|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while suppressing technological progress in their own subject populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot; /&gt;

The more powerful Goa'uld control territories encompassing multiple planets, armies of Jaffa warriors, and fleets of [[Ha'tak|motherships]]. They live in luxury, attended to by scores of loyal slaves. When one Goa'uld defeats another in battle, the vanquished enemy's domain and forces are typically absorbed by the victor. Sometimes Goa'uld will ally with each other to pursue a greater objective; usually these alliances dissolve in treachery as soon as one party senses an advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Serpent's Venom&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Serpent's Venom |episodelink=The Serpent's Venom (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=[[Peter DeLuise]] |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |season=4|number=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System Lords===
The System Lords are the collective of the most powerful Goa'uld in the galaxy. In the episode &quot;[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]&quot;, [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] describes them as &quot;posturing egomaniacs driven by an insatiable lust for power, each one capable of unimaginable evil&quot;. There are around a dozen System Lords at any one time; their ranks change frequently as new ones rise and old ones fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|New Order|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The System Lords control vast territories and armies; in &quot;[[Fair Game (Stargate SG-1)|Fair Game]],&quot; they are stated to be capable of launching an attack against Earth 100 times the strength of that sent by [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] at the end of season 1. For thousands of years until his defeat by [[Jack O'Neill (Stargate)|Jack O'Neill]] and [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]], [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] held the position of Supreme System Lord.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tok'ra&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Tok'ra|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The System Lords are not a unified body and frequently war against each other for dominance, though they will ally in the face of mutual threats. One of the main strategies of both the Tok'ra and the Asgard&lt;ref name=&quot;Fair Game&quot; /&gt; is to play the System Lords against one another, so that no single one of them becomes too powerful to topple.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summit&quot; /&gt; The System Lords employ elite, highly dangerous Goa'uld assassins known as Ash'raks, who have been known to use stealth devices to become invisible, and wield a device called a hara'kesh that serves as a weapon, an interrogation device, and an instrument of torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|In the Line of Duty|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allegiance&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Allegiance |episodelink=Allegiance (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=Tor Alexander Valenza |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=6|number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The System Lords can also turn captured enemies into assassins called za'tarcs, using mind control to implant dormant commands hidden by false memories. Persons who are turned into za'tarcs are not aware of it until their programming activates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Divide and Conquer |episodelink=Divide and Conquer (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=Tor Alexander Valenza |network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |season=4|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A System Lord's most trusted servant and confidant is called a lo'taur, a human slave who can be used as a host in an emergency. Some of these loyal humans serve willingly for the chance of one day experiencing the pleasures of being a Goa'uld host.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summit&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Summit |episodelink=Summit (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Martin Wood]] |writers=[[Joseph Mallozzi]] and [[Paul Mullie]] |network=[[Sky One]] |season=5 |number=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first System Lord seen on ''Stargate SG-1'' is [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]], although the show retroactively established Ra from the [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'' film]] as a System Lord. In {{sgcite|Fair Game}}, the three System Lords that come to Earth are [[Cronus (Stargate)|Cronus]], [[Nirrti (Stargate)|Nirrti]], and [[Yu (Stargate)|Yu]]. In {{sgcite|Summit}} and {{sgcite|Last Stand}}, a meeting of the System Lords is shown, featuring Yu, [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]], Bastet, Kali, Olokun, Morrigan, and Svarog. In those episodes, Anubis is also accepted back into the ranks of the System Lords. The episode {{sgcite|New Order}} introduces two new System Lords, Amaterasu and Camulus. Two unknown System Lords are shown alongside Yu in {{sgcite|Reckoning}}. Other Goa'uld mentioned to be System Lords at one point or another are [[Sokar (Stargate)|Sokar]], Hathor, Heru-ur, Seth, Svarog, and Ares.
The most powerful Goa'uld eventually to come to power is Anubis. The half-ascended being is very powerful but eventually defeated by an ancient weapon system in Antarctica.

=== As false gods and opposition ===
One of the most prominent pieces of Goa'uld [[society]] is their tendency to pose as gods to other, weaker, races, mostly [[Tau'ri|humans]] and [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]]. Goa'uld are shown to do this because of the luxury and power it brings, and to have their followers mine [[naqahdah]]. They fool minor races into believing that they are gods by passing off their technology as magic. Examples of this include opening the Stargate, using hand devices, and their metallic masks, which give them an other-worldly appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;falsgods&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Sumner |first=Darren |title=Producer reveals Atlantis movie title maybe |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2005/11/cooper_ori_take_istargatei_to_a_.shtml |format= |agency= |work= |publisher=''[[GateWorld]]'' |date=November 7, 2005 |accessdate=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masks are first seen in the [[Stargate (film)|original movie]]. They often are covered in decorative frills, and have glowing eye-beads. They are designed for show rather than functionality. Four versions of these have been seen: [[Death Mask|Pharaoh Mask]] (worn by [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]]), Horus Mask (Ra's Horus Jaffa and [[Heru-ur (Stargate)|Heru-ur]]'s Jaffa), Jackal mask (Leader of Ra's Jaffa, originally [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]]), and Serpent Mask ([[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] and his Jaffa). Seth Masks (worn by [[Seth (Stargate)|Seth]] and his Jaffa) have been mentioned, though never shown.

The [[Tok'ra]] (meaning &quot;against Ra&quot;) are a benevolent offshoot of the Goa'uld who oppose them philosophically and militarily. Spawned from the Queen Egeria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cure&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Cure |episodelink=Summit (Stargate SG-1) |series=Stargate SG-1 |serieslink=Stargate SG-1 |credits=[[Andy Mikita]] |writers=[[Damian Kindler]] |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=6 |number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; they only blend or join willing hosts, with whom they share the body equally and enjoy a truly symbiotic relationship. In ''Stargate SG-1'', the Tok'ra become valuable allies of Earth and play a critical role in the eventual defeat of the Goa'uld.
