The '''Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889''' was the first [[land run]] into the [[Unassigned Lands]] and included all or part of the 2005 modern day [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian]], [[Cleveland County, Oklahoma|Cleveland]], [[Kingfisher County, Oklahoma|Kingfisher]], [[Logan County, Oklahoma|Logan]], [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], and [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne]] counties of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oklands&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marti.rootsweb.com/land/oklands.html |title=Oklahoma Land Openings 1889-1907  |accessdate=2007-03-03  |author=Bradford, Susan |date=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The land run started at high noon on April 22, 1889, with an estimated 50,000 people lined up for their piece of the available two million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²).&lt;ref name=&quot;ok history museum 1890 (archive)&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/lib/1890/1890index.htm | title=1890 Oklahoma Territory Census |accessdate=2007-03-03 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060206034927/http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/lib/1890/1890index.htm |archivedate=2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unassigned Lands were considered some of the best unoccupied public land in the [[United States]]. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 was passed and signed into law with an amendment by [[Illinois]] Representative [[William McKendree Springer]], that authorized President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to open the two million acres (8,000&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) for settlement. Due to the [[Homestead Act of 1862]], signed by President [[Abraham Lincoln]], legal settlers could claim lots up to {{convert|160|acre|km2}} in size.  Provided a settler lived on the land and improved it, the settler could then receive the title to the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ok history museum 1890 (archive)&quot;/&gt;

==Boomers and sooners==

A number of the individuals who participated in the run entered early and hid out until the legal time of entry to lay quick claim to some of the most choice homesteads. These people came to be identified as &quot;[[sooners]]&quot;. This led to hundreds of legal contests that arose and were decided first at local land offices and eventually by the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]. Arguments included what constituted the &quot;legal time of entry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ok history museum landrun (archive)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/enc/landrun.htm |title=Land Run of 1889 |accessdate=2007-03-03 |author=Hoig, Stan |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060411041957/http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/enc/landrun.htm |archivedate=2006-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some people think that the settlers who entered the territory at the legally appointed time were known as &quot;boomers&quot;, the term actually refers to those who campaigned for the opening of the lands, led by [[David L. Payne]].

The University of Oklahoma's fight song, &quot;[[Boomer Sooner]]&quot;, derives from these two names.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soonersports.com/trads/what-is-a-sooner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rapid growth==
By the end of the day (April 22, 1889), both [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] and [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]] had established cities of around 10,000 people in literally half a day. As ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' put it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 At twelve o'clock on Monday, April 22d, &lt;!-- &quot;22d&quot; is correctly quoted, please don't change it. --&gt; the resident population of Guthrie was nothing; before sundown it was at least ten thousand. In that time streets had been laid out, town lots staked off, and steps taken toward the formation of a municipal government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/Reps/DOCS/landrush.htm |title=The Rush to Oklahoma |accessdate=2007-03-04  |author=Howard, William Willard  |date=1889-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many settlers immediately started improving their new land or stood in line waiting to file their claim.  Many children sold creek water to [[homesteader]]s waiting in line for five cents a cup, while other children gathered [[buffalo chip]]s to provide fuel for cooking.  By the second week, schools had opened and were being taught by volunteers paid by pupils' parents until regular school districts could be established.  Within one month, Oklahoma City had five banks and six newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eitunassi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/%7Eitunassi/index.html |title=History of the Unassigned Lands |accessdate=2007-03-04 |date=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 1890, the [[Organic Act]] was passed creating the [[Oklahoma Territory]]. This act included the [[Oklahoma Panhandle|Panhandle]] of Oklahoma within the territory. It also allowed for central governments and designated [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]] as the territory's capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;eitunassi&quot;/&gt;
