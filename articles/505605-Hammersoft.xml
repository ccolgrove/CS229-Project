'''John Robert Wooden''' (October 14, 1910&amp;nbsp;â June 4, 2010)&lt;ref name=espndeath/&gt; was an American [[basketball]] player and coach. Nicknamed the &quot;Wizard of [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]]&quot;, he won ten [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] national championships in a 12-year period â seven in a row&lt;ref name=&quot;AP obit&quot;/&gt; â as head coach at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], an unprecedented feat.&lt;ref name =UCLABruins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/ucla-wooden-page.html |title=John Wooden: A Coaching Legend |publisher = UCLABruins.com (official athletic site of the UCLA Bruins)|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Wooden_John.html |title = Sportscentury Biography: Wizard of Westwood |author = Mike Puma |publisher = ESPN |year = 2007 |accessdate = 25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this period, his teams won a record 88 consecutive games.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP obit&quot;/&gt; He was named national coach of the year six times.

As a player, Wooden was the first to be named basketball All-American three times and he won a national championship at Purdue. Wooden was named a member of the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player (inducted in 1961) and as a coach (in 1973), the first person ever enshrined in both categories. Only [[Lenny Wilkens]] and [[Bill Sharman]] have since had the same honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/coachfile/lenny_wilkens/ |title = Lenny Wilkens Coach Bio |publisher = [[NBA]] |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden was renowned for his short, simple inspirational messages to his players, including his &quot;Pyramid of Success.&quot; These often were directed at how to be a success in life as well as in basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP obit&quot;/&gt;

==Early life and playing career==
Born in 1910 in the town of [[Hall, Indiana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1910 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden moved with his family to a small farm in [[Centerton, Indiana|Centerton]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1918 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a boy one of his role models was [[Fuzzy Vandivier]] of the [[Franklin Wonder Five]], a legendary basketball team that dominated Indiana high school basketball from 1919 to 1922.

After graduating in 1928, he attended [[Purdue University]] and was coached by [[Ward Lambert|Ward &quot;Piggy&quot; Lambert]]. He helped lead the [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Boilermakers]] to the 1932 National Championship, as determined by a panel vote rather than the NCAA tournament, which did not begin until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2009/D1.pdf |title = Division&amp;nbsp;I Records |publisher = [[NCAA]] |page = 82 |year = 2009 |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Wooden was named All-Big Ten and All-Midwestern (1930â32) while at Purdue, and he was the first player ever to be named a three-time consensus All-American.&lt;ref name=&quot;CW1930-32&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1930â1932 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also selected for membership in the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.purduebetas.com/history.htm |title = Chapter History |author = Purdue Beta Theta Pi |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden is also an honorary member of the International Co-Ed Fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.apo.org/site/site_files/tnt/1998_fall.pdf |title = President's Message: It's a &quot;New&quot; Fall |author = Wilfred M.

In 1942, during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], he joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]].  He served for nearly three years and left the service as a [[lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;/&gt;

In 1961, he was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame for his achievements as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/john-r-wooden-player |publisher = Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame |title = John R.

==Personal life==
Wooden was the son of Roxie Anna and Joshua Hugh Wooden.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Personal Best&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url = http://search.barnesandnoble.com/My-Personal-Best/John-Wooden/e/9780071437929#EXC |author = John Wooden |coauthor = Steve Jamison  |title = My Personal Best: Life Lessons from an All-American Journey |publisher = McGraw-Hill |isbn= 0071437924 |date = April 2004 |accessdate = 29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three brothers:&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;/&gt; Maurice, Daniel, and William.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Personal Best&quot;/&gt; His two sisters died before reaching the age of three. One was unnamed and died in infancy,&lt;ref name=&quot;My Personal Best&quot;/&gt; while Cordelia died from diphtheria when she was two.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Personal Best&quot;/&gt;

Wooden met his future wife, Nellie (Nell) Riley, at a carnival in July 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â July, 1926 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in a small ceremony in [[Indianapolis]] in August 1932. Afterwards, they attended a [[Mills Brothers]] concert at the Circle Theatre to celebrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â August, 1932 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; John and his wife had a son, James Hugh Wooden, and a daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen.&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt; Nellie died on March 21, 1985&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt; from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_144599.asp |title = The Ultimate Valentine |author = Roy Exum |date = February 12, 2009 |newspaper = The Chattanoogan |accessdate = 25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden remained devoted to Nellie, even decades after her death, until Wooden's own death. Since her death, he kept to a monthly ritual (health permitting)âon the 21st, he visited her grave, and then wrote a love letter to her. After completing the letter, he placed it in an envelope and added it to a stack of similar letters that accumulated over the years on the pillow she slept on during their life together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/magazine/life_of_reilly/news/2000/03/14/life_of_reilly/ |title = A Paragon Rising above the Madness  |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated |date=March 14, 2000 |accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden only stopped writing the letters in the last months of his life due to failing eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=5260677 |title=Wooden set the bar high |first=Rick |last=Reilly |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mourning Nellie's death, Wooden was comforted by his faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://www.mitchhorowitz.com/john-wooden.html |author = [[Mitch Horowitz]] |title = From the Socks Up: The Extraordinary Coaching Life of John Wooden |date = November 2004 |magazine = Science of Mind |accessdate = 7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a devout Christian, considering his beliefs more important to him than basketball: &quot;I have always tried to make it clear that basketball is not the ultimate. It is of small importance in comparison to the total life we live. There is only one kind of life that truly wins, and that is the one that places faith in the hands of the Savior.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= John Wooden |year = 2003 |title = They Call Me Coach |publisher = McGraw-Hill |ISBN = 9780071424912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden's faith strongly influenced his life. He read the Bible daily and attended the First Christian Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;/&gt; He said that he hoped his faith was apparent to others: &quot;If I were ever prosecuted for my religion, I truly hope there would be enough evidence to convict me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Wooden: A Lifetime of Observations and Reflections on and Off the Court |author = John Wooden |coauthor = Steve Jamison |publisher = McGraw-Hill |ISBN = 0809230410 |year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
===High school===
Wooden coached two years at [[Dayton, Kentucky|Dayton]] High School in [[Kentucky]]. His first year at Dayton marked the only time he had a losing record (6â11) as a coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1932 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Dayton, he returned to Indiana, teaching English and coaching basketball at [[South Bend Community School Corporation|South Bend Central High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â August, 1934 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; until entering the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1934 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His high school coaching record over 11 years, two at Dayton and nine at Central, was 218â42.&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt;

===Indiana State University===
After World War II, Wooden coached at Indiana State Teacher's College (now [[Indiana State University]]) in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], from 1946 to 1948,&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;/&gt; succeeding his high school coach, [[Glenn Curtis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=346 |title = March Madness Flashback: John Wooden |author = Paula Meyer |date = March 30, 2006 |accessdate = 29 January 2010 |publisher = Indiana State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his duties as basketball coach, Wooden also coached baseball and served as athletic director,&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;/&gt; all while teaching and completing his master's degree in Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.pantagraph.com/sports/college/article_4870b765-a6d1-56fe-a7c2-d58009b6df78.html |title = Longtime ISU coach Coughlan to join Wooden in Valley Hall of Fame |author = Jim Benson |publisher = Bloomington Pantagraph |date = October 23, 2008 |accessdate = 28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Wooden's [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|basketball team]] won the [[Indiana Intercollegiate Conference]] title and received an invitation to the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball]] (NAIB) National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB's policy banning [[African American]] players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1946 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Wooden's players was Clarence Walker, an African-American from [[East Chicago, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer&quot;/&gt;

That same year, Wooden's alma mater Purdue University wanted him to return to campus and serve as an assistant to then-head coach Mel Taube until Taube's contract expired.  Then, at that time, Wooden would take over the program.  Citing his loyalty to Taube, Wooden declined, as this would have effectively made Taube a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] coach.

In 1948, Wooden again led Indiana State to the conference title. The NAIB had reversed its policy banning African-American players that year,&lt;ref name=&quot;CW1947&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1947 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wooden coached his team to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]]. This was the only championship game a Wooden-coached team ever lost. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;CW1947&quot;/&gt; John Wooden was inducted into the Indiana State University Athletic Hall of Fame on February 3, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gosycamores.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=15200&amp;ATCLID=3714314&amp;SPID=7263&amp;SPSID=65182 |title = Hall of Fame |publisher = GoSycamores.com (official site of Indiana State Athletics) |accessdate = 28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov 8, 2008; Indiana State officially named the floor at Hulman Center The Nellie and John Wooden Court in honor of the legendary coach and his late wife, Nellie.  The ceremony included taped comments from Coach Wooden and the participation of members of his 1946-47 and 1947-48 teams.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gosycamores.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=15200&amp;ATCLID=1617084&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sycamores christened the newly-named floor by defeating the Albion College (MI) Britons in an exhibition game.

===UCLA===
[[File:John Wooden - Southern Campus 1960.jpg|thumb|Wooden at UCLA in 1960]]
After the 1947â48 season, Wooden became the head coach at UCLA, after negotiating for a three-year contract. UCLA had actually been his second choice for a coaching position in 1948. He had also been pursued for the head coaching position at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]], and it was his and his wife's desire to remain in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. But inclement weather in Minnesota prevented Wooden from receiving the scheduled phone offer from the Golden Gophers. Thinking that they had lost interest, Wooden accepted the head coaching job with the Bruins instead. Officials from the University of Minnesota contacted Wooden right after he accepted the position at UCLA, but he declined their offer because he had given his word to the Bruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.coachwooden.com/ |title = The Journey â A Brief Professional and Personal History Timeline â 1948 |publisher = CoachWooden.com â The Official Site of Coach John Wooden |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden had immediate success, fashioning an &quot;instant turnaround&quot; for an undistinguished, faltering program. In 1948, he took a UCLA team that had a 12â13 record the previous year and transformed it into a [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC) Southern Division Champion with a 22â7 record,&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma&quot;/&gt; the most wins in a season for UCLA since it started playing basketball in 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/MBB_History_99-128.pdf |title = UCLA History |publisher = UCLA |pages = 118â126 |year = 2007 |accessdate = 29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He surpassed that number the next season with 24â7 and a second Southern Division Championship and PCC outright, and won a third and fourth straight Southern Division Championship his first four years. Up to that time, UCLA had collected a total of two such championships the previous 30 years.

In spite of these achievements, Wooden reportedly did not initially enjoy his position, and his wife did not favor living in Los Angeles. When Mel Taube left Purdue in 1950, Wooden's inclination was to return and finally accept the head coaching job there.  He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded him that it was he who had insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word.&lt;ref name =&quot;Reilly2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author = [[Rick Reilly]] |date= October 19, 2009 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=4557758 |title = Too Short For A Column |publisher = ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1955-56 season, Wooden had established a sustained success at UCLA. That year, he guided the team to its first undefeated PCC conference title, and a 17-game winning streak that came to an end only at the hands of [[Bill Russell]]'s [[University of San Francisco]] team in the 1956 NCAA Tournament.  However, UCLA was unable to advance from this level over the immediately ensuing seasons, finding itself unable to return to the NCAA Tournament as the [[Pete Newell]]-coached teams at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] took control of the conference at the end of the decade.  Also hampering the fortunes of Wooden's team during that time period was a probation imposed on all UCLA sports in the aftermath of a [[Pacific Coast Conference#The crisis|scandal]] involving illegal payments made to players on the school's football team, along with USC, Cal and Stanford, resulting in the dismantling of the PCC conference.&lt;ref name =&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Alex Wolff | date=June 4, 2010 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/alexander_wolff/06/03/wooden.1964/index.html | title=How '64 Bruins made John Wooden | publisher = ''[[SI.com]]'' |accessdate = 21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, with the probation no longer in place, Wooden had righted the basketball program's ship and returned his team to the top of the conference. This time, however, they would take the next step, and in so doing, unleash a run of dominance unparalleled in the history of college basketball.  A narrow loss, due largely to a controversial foul call, in the semifinal of the 1962 NCAA Tournament convinced Wooden that his Bruins were ready to contend for national championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt;  Two seasons later, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place when assistant coach Jerry Norman persuaded Wooden that the team's small-sized players and fast-paced offense would be complemented by the adoption of a zone press defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt;  The result was a dramatic increase in scoring, giving UCLA a powerhouse team that went undefeated on its way to the school's first basketball national championship.

Wooden's team repeated as national champions the following season before the 1966 squad fell briefly, finishing second in the conference. However, the Bruins' 1967 incarnation returned with a vengeance, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden's retirement in 1975.

Wooden coached what would prove to be his final game in Pauley Pavilion on March 1, 1975, in a 93â59 victory over [[Stanford Cardinal men's basketball|Stanford]]. Four weeks later, following a 75â74 overtime victory over [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] in the 1975 NCAA Tournament semifinal game, Wooden announced that he would retire immediately after the championship game.&lt;ref name&gt;{{cite newspaper | author = [[Associated Press]] | date=March 30, 1975 | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YLITAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mNkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4232,7431027&amp;hl=en | title=Wooden hangs 'em up | publisher = ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'' |accessdate = 23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His legendary coaching career concluded triumphantly, as his team responded with a win over [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] to claim Wooden's first career coaching victory over the Wildcats and his unprecedented 10th national championship.

In 2004, a 93-year old Wooden stated that he wouldn't mind coming back as an assistant who could help players with practices and other light duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1031125/2/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Galleries | date=January 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure with the Bruins, Wooden became known as the &quot;Wizard of [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]]&quot; (although he personally disdained the nickname)&lt;ref name =&quot;Reilly2009&quot;/&gt; and gained lasting fame with UCLA by winning 620 games in 27 seasons and 10 NCAA titles during his last 12 seasons, including seven in a row from 1967 to 1973.&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt; His UCLA teams also had a record winning streak of 88 games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/31/AR2006033101991.html |title = A Tradition Lacking Swagger: Storied UCLA Fails to Worry Frisky LSU |author = Mark Schlabach |newspaper = Washington Post |date = April 1, 2006 |accessdate = 7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2932885&amp;type=story |title = Trinity squash nears decade with nation's longest winning streak |author = Brendan Murphy |publisher = ESPN |date = July 11, 2007 |accessdate = 7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four perfect 30â0 seasons.&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt; They also won 38 straight games in NCAA Tournaments&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt; and 98 straight home game wins at [[Pauley Pavilion]]. Wooden was named NCAA College Basketball's &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; in 1964, 1967, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. In 1967, he was named the [[Henry Iba Award]] USBWA College Basketball Coach of the Year. In 1972, he shared ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's &quot;[[Sportsman of the Year]]&quot; award with [[Billie Jean King]]. He was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoophall.com/hall-of-famers/tag/john-r-wooden-coach |publisher = Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame |title = John R.

&quot;He never made more than $35,000 a year salary (not including camps and speaking engagements), including 1975, the year he won his 10th national championship, and never asked for a raise,&quot; wrote [[Rick Reilly]] of [[ESPN]]. He was given a Bruin powder blue Mercedes that season as a retirement gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?section=magazine&amp;id=3669154 |title = One coach still knows more than all the others combined.

Criticism of Wooden with regard to his stewardship of the UCLA basketball program has most often focused on his failure to investigate or curtail his players' involvement with [[Sam Gilbert (businessman)|Sam Gilbert]], a UCLA booster who was a prominent figure in the players' circle in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | title = The UCLA Dynasty | medium = Cable television documentary| publisher = [[Home Box Office]] | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dufresne&gt;{{cite news |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/08/sports/la-sp-0609-wooden-gilbert-20100609 |title = The dark side of the UCLA basketball dynasty |author = Chris Dufresne |newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date = January 25, 1975 |accessdate = 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carlton&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.lvrj.com/sports/16412456.html |title =  Wooden's greatness impressive, imperfect |author = Ed Graney |newspaper = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date = March 8, 2008 |accessdate = 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/national/tournament/ncaamen/stories/040408dnspofinalfourpage.3964ff4.html |title = The dark side of the UCLA basketball dynasty |author = Chuck Carlton |newspaper = [[The Dallas Morning News]] |date = April 4, 2008 |accessdate = 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1981 investigation by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' found that Gilbert had regularly arranged to procure items such as automobiles, clothing and airline tickets for UCLA players, and in so doing, apparently committed numerous violations of NCAA regulations.&lt;ref name=Dufresne /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/14/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-ghosts-and-goblins-of-westwood.html?pagewanted=1 |title = Sports of The Times; The Ghosts and Goblins of Westwood |author = [[William C.

In 2009, John R. Wooden was named The Sporting News &quot;Greatest Coach of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sporting News honors Wooden|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=4365068|publisher=ESPN. Associated Press|accessdate=7 June 2010|date=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Wooden has been recognized numerous times for his achievements. After his coaching career ended UCLA continued to honor Wooden with the title of Head Men's Basketball Coach [[Emeritus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.directory.ucla.edu/search.php |title =UCLA Directory â Wooden, John R. |publisher = UCLA |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 2006, Wooden was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]]. He was one of five, along with [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Bill Russell]], [[Dean Smith]] and [[Dr. James Naismith]], selected to represent the inaugural class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nabc.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/111806aaa.html |title = Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame to induct founding class |publisher = National Association of Basketball Coaches |date = November 17, 2006 |accessdate = 25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009 in St. Louis. Coach Wooden was the ninth honoree in the Missouri Valley Conference's Lifetime Achievement category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benson&quot;/&gt; Wooden said the honor he was most proud of was &quot;Outstanding Basketball Coach of the U.S.&quot; by his denomination, the Christian Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA Tradition&quot;/&gt;

Since 1977, the most coveted of four college basketball player of the year awards has been named the [[John R. Wooden Award]]. This award has attained the status of being the equivalent of football's Heisman Trophy for college basketball, with the winner announced during a ceremony held at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.woodenaward.com/?page_id=80 |title = John R. Wooden Award |publisher = John R.

Wooden Most Valuable Player Award&quot;. Two annual [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] men's basketball events called the &quot;[[John R. Wooden Classic]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodenclassic.com/ John R. Wooden Classic.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;John R.

Bush]] based on legislation introduced by Congressman [[Brad Sherman]].&lt;ref name =UCLABruins/&gt;

On July 23, 2003, John Wooden received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the nation's highest civilian honor. It was presented by [[George W. Bush]] after a three-year campaign by Andre McCarter, who was on Wooden's 1975 National Championship team. The Ukleja Center for Ethical Leadership at [[California State University, Long Beach]] established the John Wooden Ethics in Leadership Award in 2009, with Wooden being the inaugural recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ukleja Center Presents Award to Legendary Coach John Wooden  | work = Inside CSULB  | publisher = [[California State University, Long Beach]] | date = June 15, 2009 | url = http://csulb.edu/misc/inside/core/?p=5502  | accessdate = June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 John Wooden was honored as an Outstanding Alumnus of the School of Liberal Arts at Purdue University â the first year the award was given.

On October 14, 2010, the Undergraduate Student Association Council of UCLA held a &quot;John Wooden Day Celebration&quot; to honor Wooden's 100th birthday and to commemorate his contributions to the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.uclabruins.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/101210aaa.html |title = UCLA Students to Honor Memory of Late Coach John Wooden on His 100th Birthday on Oct. 14 |publisher = UCLA Athletics |newspaper = Daily Bruin |date = October 12, 2010 |accessdate = October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the Morgan Center was set apart as a recreation of Wooden's office to honor his memory on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dailybruin.com/index.php/article/2010/10/celebration_of_john_woodens_life_and_legacy_in_commemoration_of_his_100th_birthdayl |title = Celebration of John Woodenâs life and legacy in commemoration of his 100th birthday |publisher =ASUCLA Media |newspaper = Daily Bruin |date = October 15, 2010 |accessdate = October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Golf Digest]] lists John Wooden as one of four people to hit both a [[Par_(score)#Albatross|double eagle]] and a [[hole in one]] in the same round of [[golf]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwyre, Bill â [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-dwyre26-2010jan26,0,3945751.column When John Wooden worked magic on a golf course]. Los Angeles Times, January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The feat was accomplished in 1947 at the South Bend Country Club in [[South Bend, Indiana]].

The flagship leadership development program of Woodenâs fraternity, [[Beta Theta Pi]], is named &quot;The John and Nellie Wooden Institute for Men of Principle&quot; after Coach Wooden and his wife, Nellie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Wooden Institute | url = http://www.betathetapi.org/events/wooden-institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coach Woodenâs maxims and Creed are central to the teaching of leadership development at the Institute.

==Following Wooden==
Four coaches left UCLA in the nine years following Wooden. One former UCLA head coach, former [[ESPN]] analyst and current St. John's head coach [[Steve Lavin]] (fired from UCLA in 2003), has said &quot;The mythology and [[pathology]] of UCLA basketball isn't going to change&quot; due to Wooden's legacy and believes that every basketball coach will eventually be fired or forced out from UCLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/01/12/2003-01-12_trouble_bruin_steve_lavin_fe.html |title = Trouble Bruin: Steve Lavin feels the heat again, but this time it may be too much |author = Dick Weiss |newspaper = New York Daily News |date = January 12, 2003 |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden's immediate successor at UCLA, [[Gene Bartow]], went 28â5 in 1976, but was blown out twice that season by the eventual national champions Indiana, the second time in the '76 Final Four, and lost 76â75 in the 1977 West Region semi-finals to [[Idaho State University]].
Bartow won 85.2% of his games (compared to Wooden's 80.8%) in two years, yet supposedly received death threats from unsatisfied UCLA [[Fan (aficionado)|fans]].  Wooden himself has often joked about being a victim of his own success, calling his successors on the phone and playfully identifying himself ominously as &quot;we the [[alumni]]...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3670253 |author = Steve Lavin |coauthor = Chris Snow |title = Coach to Coach: What does John Wooden pass to another coach? |journal = ESPN The Magazine |date = October 5, 2009 |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Wooden recounts walking off the court after his last game coaching in 1975, having just won his tenth title, only to have a UCLA fan walk up and say, &quot;Great win coach, this makes up for letting us down last year&quot; (UCLA had lost in the semi-finals double overtime in 1974)&lt;ref&gt;Wooden, John. ''They Call Me Coach.'' McGraw-Hill, 2004. ISBN 0-07-142491-1&lt;/ref&gt; Bartow's successor, Wooden's protege, Gary Cunningham, posted an even better two year record after Bartow, .862 (50â8) and No. 2 rankings each year, but could not proceed past two wins in the NCAA's, and left. Larry Brown came next, racking up more losses, 17, in two years than UCLA had experienced the previous four, yet with a near magical end season run typical of his career, he managed to coach UCLA into the title game in 1980. He left.
UCLA went 20 years after Wooden's retirement before winning another national basketball championship, finally hanging a [[Pauley Pavilion#UCLA championship banners|banner]] again in 1995 under coach [[Jim Harrick]]. In 2006, [[Ben Howland]] led the team back to the national championship game for the first time since the 1995 title game.&lt;ref name =&quot;UCLA History&quot;/&gt;

==Health and death==
Wooden was in good health until the final years of his life. On April 3, 2006, he spent three days in a Los Angeles hospital receiving treatment for [[diverticulitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/2006-04-06-wooden-released_x.htm |title=John Wooden goes home from hospital |agency = Associated Press |date = April 6, 2006 |accessdate = 31 January 2010 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was hospitalized again in 2007 for bleeding in the colon, with his daughter quoted as saying her father was &quot;doing well&quot; upon his subsequent release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wooden released from hospital |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18026874/ |agency = Associated Press |date=April 16, 2007| accessdate= 7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden was hospitalized on March 1, 2008, after a fall in his home. He broke his left wrist and his collarbone in the fall, but remained in good condition according to his daughter and was given around-the-clock supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3271552 |title = Wooden breaks left wrist, collarbone in fall at home |agency = Associated Press |publisher = ESPN |date = March 1, 2008 |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 2009, he was hospitalized for four weeks with pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dailynews.com/sports/ci_11956069 |title = UCLA's Holiday uses opportunity to run the show |author = Brian Dohn |newspaper = Los Angeles Daily News |date = March 20, 2009 |accessdate = 30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, 2010, Wooden was admitted to the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] after suffering from dehydration and remained hospitalized there until his death the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/06/04/sports-bkc-wooden-hospitalized_7661675.html |title = UCLA: John Wooden suffering from dehydration |author = Beth Harris |newspaper = Forbes.com |date = June 4, 2010 |accessdate = June 4, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of natural causes on June 4, 2010, at the age of 99.&lt;ref name=espndeath&gt;{{cite news |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/news/story?id=5253601 |title = Wooden dies at age 99 |publisher = ESPN Los Angeles |date = June 4, 2010 |accessdate = June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnndeath&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/06/03/basketball.wooden.obit/index.html?hpt=T1 |title = Legendary basketball coach Wooden dies |publisher = the CNN Wire Staff |date = June 4, 2010 |accessdate = June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/2010-06-04-john-wooden-obit_N.htm

==Seven Point Creed==
John Wooden's Seven Point Creed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=wooden |title = Forever Coach |author = Eric Neel |date = October 16, 2005 |accessdate = 24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; given to him by his father Joshua upon his graduation from [[grammar school]]:

*Be true to yourself.
*Make each day your masterpiece.
*Help others.
*Drink deeply from good books, especially the [[Bible]].
*Make friendship a fine art.
*Build a shelter against a rainy day.
*Pray for guidance and give thanks for your blessings every day.

Wooden also authored a lecture and a book about the Pyramid of Success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodencourse.com/woodens_wisdom.html The John R. Wooden Course&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pyramid of Success consists of philosophical building blocks for winning at basketball and at life. In his later years  he was hired by corporations to deliver inspirational lectures and even appeared in commercials for Hartford Insurance and the NCAA. Following his death, all UCLA teams wore either a patch or helmet sticker with the initials &quot;JRW&quot; inside a black pyramid, in honor of his philosophy. It is generally known that he received lecture fees that exceeded the salaries he was paid as a coach. Wooden proudly claimed that these late in life windfalls  allowed him to set up education accounts for all of his grandchildren. In a 2009 interview, John Wooden described himself politically as a &quot;liberal Democrat,&quot; who had voted for some Republican presidential candidates. At the top of the Pyramid of Success was &quot;Competitive Greatness&quot; which Wooden defined as &quot;Perform at your best when your best is required. Your best is required each day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bergin, Mark. &quot;Atop the pryamid&quot;. ''WORLD magazine''. July 3, 2010: 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden was also the author of several other books about basketball and life.

Among Wooden's maxims:
*Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.
*Flexibility is the key to stability.
*Be quick, but don't hurry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/basketball/la-sp-wooden-birthday-pictures,0,5256022.photogallery PHOTOS: John Wooden turns 99], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Penner, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/college/basketball/la-sp-john-wooden14-2009oct14,0,5372928,full.story On his 99th birthday, 99 things about John Wooden], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
