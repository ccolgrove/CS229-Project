'''Robin Mark Ventura''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|v|É|n|Ë|t|Ér|É}} {{respell|ven|TURR|É}}; born July 14, 1967 in [[Santa Maria, California]]) is the current manager of the [[Chicago White Sox]].  He is a former professional [[baseball]] player, a [[third baseman]] who played for four [[Major League Baseball|major league]] teams, most notably for the [[Chicago White Sox]]. On October 6, 2011, Ventura was named manager of the [[Chicago White Sox]].

==Early years==
After attending [[Ernest Righetti High School|Righetti High School]] in [[Orcutt, California]], Ventura was a 3-time All-American at [[Oklahoma State University]]. He led the nation in runs (107), RBI (96) and total bases (204) in 69 games as a freshman in 1986. In 1987, he had a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]-record 58-game hitting streak,&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5175613&lt;/ref&gt; breaking the previous record of 47; he also led [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] in RBIs two years in a row. His hitting streak remains the Division I record, though his mark was surpassed in 2003 by [[Damian Costantino]] of [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] [[Salve Regina University]], who had a 60 game streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/leagues/NCAA/streak031103.html |title=Costantino's hitting streak breaks record |accessdate=2007-06-09 |last=Derewicz |first=Mark |date=2003-03-11 |work=Baseball America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventura helped OSU reach the finals of the [[1987 College World Series]], although they lost the championship game to a [[Stanford University]] team that included future teammate [[Jack McDowell]]. Ventura collected four hits &amp;ndash; including a pair of doubles &amp;ndash; in the final game and batted .364 for the series. In 1988 he earned a spot on the gold medal-winning [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] baseball team, batting .409 during the tournament. He won both the [[Golden Spikes Award]] and the [[Dick Howser Trophy]] for outstanding collegiate play, concluding his 3-year OSU career with a .428 batting average, a .792 [[slugging percentage]], and 302 RBIs. On July 4, 2006, Ventura was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame as a member of its inaugural class.

==Career==
===Chicago White Sox===
After being picked tenth in the [[1988 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the White Sox, Ventura spent much of {{By|1989}} at [[Birmingham Barons|AA Birmingham]] before joining the Sox that September. While in Birmingham, he earned a spot in the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] All-Star Game and was voted the league's top defensive third baseman. He was named to the [[Topps All-Star Rookie Rosters|1990 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster]] and earned the starting third base role with the White Sox the next spring. While his {{By|1990}} rookie year was marred by an 0-for-41 slump and 25 errors, his 123 hits were the most by a White Sox rookie since [[Ozzie GuillÃ©n]] in 1985; he also led AL rookies with 150 games played. The next year he won his first [[Gold Glove Award]] for fielding excellence, set a team record for RBIs at third base, and led the AL in putouts. In {{By|1992}}, Ventura won another Gold Glove and earned a spot on the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team. Following the season, Ventura's half-sister perished in an apartment fire near his home in California; Ventura missed the first three weeks of spring training to be with his family.

{{By|1993}} saw his batting average drop 20 points to .262, though both his slugging and [[on base percentage|on-base percentages]] rose slightly. Ventura also collected his 500th hit that May and won his third straight Gold Glove, while becoming the first AL third baseman with three consecutive 90-RBI campaigns since [[Graig Nettles]] (1975â78). The White Sox appeared in the [[1993 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] that year, Ventura's only playoff trip while in Chicago, losing to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Ventura was on the losing end of his fight with [[Nolan Ryan]], which was voted ESPN's Number One Baseball fight of all time.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

In {{By|1994}}, the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] that year likely prevented him from reaching 90 RBI for the only time between 1991 and 1996. When play resumed in {{By|1995}}, Ventura had ten errors in the first ten games. He spent some time at [[first baseman|first base]] that year amid trade rumors, but ended the year with a career-high .295 average, and on September 4 hit two [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]]s in one game, the eighth player in history to do so and the first since [[Frank Robinson]] in 1970. The next season he won his fourth Gold Glove, reached new highs in [[fielding percentage]], homers and RBIs, and set team records in career homers by a third baseman (142) and grand slams (9).

When spring training began in {{By|1997}} the White Sox were picked by many{{Who|date=June 2010}} to win their division. In a spring training game at [[Ed Smith Stadium]], Ventura slid into home plate and caught his foot in the mud, suffering a broken and dislocated right ankle. The initial prognosis was that he would be lost for the season. However, Ventura returned on July 24, more than a week ahead of the most optimistic predictions. He collected the game-winning hit that night, and homered in his first at-bat the next evening. The White Sox did not make the playoffs, in part due to the â[[White Flag Trade]]â. 

In {{By|1998}}, Ventura's final season with the Sox, he won his fifth Gold Glove, but only hit .263. His homer and RBI totals were close to his career averages, but the Sox attempted repeatedly to trade him and declined to renew his contract, with owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] claiming that he was âdeterioratingâ.

===Move to New York===
====New York Mets====
Ventura departed Chicago in December 1998 when the [[New York Mets]] signed him to a four-year deal.  In his first year in New York, Ventura hit .301 with 32 homers, 120 RBIs and made only nine errors. On May 20 he became the first player ever to hit a grand slam in each game of a doubleheader. He and fellow infielders [[Edgardo Alfonzo]], [[Rey OrdÃ³Ã±ez]], and [[John Olerud]] were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' as the âBest Infield Everâ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/9706/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Most Popular | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he injured his left knee in August; when the problem finally came to light, just before the postseason, it had worsened to torn cartilage. He took the phrase &quot;[[Mojo Risin]]&quot; from [[The Doors]]' &quot;[[L.A. Woman]]&quot; and made it the rally cry for the Mets that year, meeting Doors lead singer [[Jim Morrison]]'s widow [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy Morrison]] when the Mets invited her to a game just before the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mets&quot;&gt;Berardino, Mike. (September 7, 2002) &quot;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8774129_ITM Mets have only themselves to blame after trading Ventura]&quot; in the ''South Florida Sun-Sentinal''. Access date June 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his injury, Ventura provided the game-winning, bases-loaded, two-out single in the eleventh inning against the Pirates on the final weekend of the regular season to propel the Mets back into the wild card chase. In Game 5 of the [[1999 National League Championship Series|1999 NLCS]], with the [[Atlanta Braves]] up 3-2 in the fifteenth inning, a bases-loaded walk to [[Todd Pratt]] forced in the tying run and brought Ventura to the plate. Ventura hit a home run into right-center field. Pratt, however, did not see the ball leave the park and ran back to first base, hoisting Ventura into the air and lugging him off the field before he could round the bases. The hit was officially scored an RBI single, commonly referred to as the &quot;[[Grand Slam Single]]&quot;. The Mets eventually lost the series. He won his first NL Gold Glove that fall, bringing his career total to six.

In {{By|2000}}, still recovering from off-season surgery on both his knee and right shoulder, he only hit .232 with 24 homers and 84 RBIs. He spent part of July on the disabled list with inflammation in his repaired shoulder, and was plagued with errors; but rebounded to hit .320 with three homers and 13 RBIs in the last two weeks of the season. When the Mets reached the [[2000 World Series|World Series]], he hit his only World Series home run against the Yankees' [[Orlando HernÃ¡ndez]]. In {{By|2001}}, he batted .237 with 21 homers and only 61 RBIs.

====New York Yankees====
At the end of the season, the Mets traded him to the Yankees for [[David Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/08/sports/baseball-mets-and-yankees-find-a-common-solution.html?ref=david_justice BASEBALL; Mets and Yankees Find a Common Solution]&lt;/ref&gt; In {{By|2002}}, Ventura batted .247 with 27 homers and 93 RBIs, the eighth time he topped 90 RBI. He was selected to his second and final All-Star team, along with all other members of the Yankees infield. In that year Ventura had the lowest fielding percentage of all third basemen in the major leagues at .941. The Yankees lost the [[American League Division Series|Division Series]] that October, where Ventura hit .286 with four RBIs. In {{By|2003}}, he was platooned at third base with [[Todd Zeile]], another former Met. Ventura struggled through the first few months of the year; by late July he had only nine homers and 42 RBIs. He tied [[Shea Hillenbrand]] for the major league lead in errors by a third baseman, with 23.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlbhist/stats/fielding?groupId=9&amp;sortColumn=errors&amp;sortOrder=true&amp;split=81&amp;qualified=null&amp;season=2002&amp;seasonType=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On July 31, {{By|2003}}, Ventura was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for [[Bubba Crosby]] and [[Scott Proctor]]. On August 3, he hit an [[inside-the-park home run]] in [[Atlanta]] for his first home run as a member of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]]. He spent most of the remainder of the season on the bench.

Re-signed by LA in December, Ventura entered {{By|2004}} with a chance to be the Dodgers' starting first baseman, but that changed during the last week of spring training when new general manager [[Paul DePodesta]] traded for [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] outfielder [[Milton Bradley (baseball player)|Milton Bradley]]. This set off a [[domino effect]] that ended in Ventura being relegated to a bench role as a backup infielder and pinch hitter. He had a game-winning RBI in the second game of the season against the [[San Diego Padres]]. He only hit five home runs in the season. Two of them were pinch-hit game-winning home runs: on July 17, against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and on August 1, against the [[San Diego Padres]]. He also hit his 17th career grand slam on August 29, against the [[New York Mets]] and his 18th career grand slam on September 7, against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Ventura made his pitching debut on June 25 during a blowout loss against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]], allowing a single amid three fly ball outs. The Dodgers made it to the [[National League Division Series|NLDS]] but lost in four games. The Dodgers went a perfect 10-0 in games that he hit a home run. Ventura retired after the season due to [[arthritis]] in his right ankle.

==Post-career rehabilitation==
[[File:Robin Ventura 2008.jpg|thumb|160px|Ventura at the last game at [[Shea Stadium]], 2008.]]
Ventura's 1997 ankle injury - a compound fracture and dislocation - also affected his leg muscles, which began to atrophy following the accident. Full strength in his leg never returned, and the daily pain from his ankle and leg contributed to Ventura's decision to retire from baseball. After retirement, Ventura limped badly and was forced to walk with a cane regularly. On November 18, 2005, Ventura underwent an ankle [[allograft]]. Following the surgery and rehabilitation, he now walks without pain and without a limp. He also sometimes appears on [[ESPNU]] as an anchor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080111&amp;content_id=2343655&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Ventura a marvel of modern medicine |accessdate=2008-01-11 |last=Noble |first=Marty |date=2008-01-11 |publisher=MLB.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ventura returned to [[Shea Stadium]] for the final game on September 28, 2008 for the closing ceremonies, with ex-teammates [[Edgardo Alfonzo]], [[John Franco]], [[Todd Zeile]], and [[Mike Piazza]].

==Managerial Career==
Robin Ventura was named the 39th manager for the [[Chicago White Sox]] on October 6, 2011, succeeding interim manager [[Don Cooper]] (who succeeded [[Ozzie Guillen]] for two games).  Ventura is the 17th former White Sox player to manage the club. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111006&amp;content_id=25528952&amp;vkey=news_cws&amp;c_id=cws |title=White Sox tab Robin Ventura as new skipper |accessdate=2011-10-06 |last=Singer |first=Tom |date=2011-10-06 |publisher=MLB.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting==
Venutra has provided color commentary for the [[College World Series]].  In 2010, he worked as a color commentator for the [[Southwest Region (Little League World Series)|Little League Southwest Region Finals]] on [[ESPN]] along with [[Carter Blackburn]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.espnmediazone3.com/us/2010/08/09/espn-thisweek-august-9-2010/&lt;/ref&gt;
