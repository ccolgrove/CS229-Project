'''ABC Kids''' (or: '''Disney's ABC Kids''') was a children's block of [[animated television series]] and [[live-action]] [[children's television series]]. broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network on SaturdayâSunday mornings in the U.S. and was broadcast on [[Baton Broadcast System|BBS]]/[[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in [[Canada]] until 2002. It was formerly known as '''Disney's One Saturday Morning'''.

==History==
Although ''Disney's One Saturday Morning'' started in 1997, it was formerly ''ABC Saturday Morning'', airing ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'', ''[[The Mighty Ducks (TV series)|The Mighty Ducks]]'', ''[[Disney's Doug]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. Sometime around 1997, Peter Hastings, the creator and excutive producer of &quot;One Saturday Morning&quot;, who wrote for ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' left both shows in order to produce cartoons for Disney and ABC. ABC was told by [[Michael Eisner]] to create a [[Saturday morning]] block that was different from the rest at the time. In February 1997, Peter Hastings pledged the idea that Saturday is different from every other day and to represent weekdays as buildings. He also proposed the use of virtual set technology; Although he knew little about it at the time and the technology used was just starting development. Disney and ABC liked the idea. He hired [[Prudence Fenton]] as Consultant Manger and Co-Executive Producer. Together they sampled virtual set technology at [[NAB Show|NAB]] 1997 and chose technology developed by [[Accom]] and ELSET. Rutherford Bench Productions which had previously worked with Disney hired [[Pacific Ocean Post]], POP Sound today, to produce the virtual set. The building was initially a drawing of [[Grand Central Terminal]] with a roller coaster but evolved into a towering mechanical 1. Even the interior has similarities such as a central high raised room with two wings on left and right sides and another on the south side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677612.html?categoryid=1009&amp;cs=1&amp;query=|title=ABC hopes for virtual success|date=September 15, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-13 | first=Michael | last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Disney's One Saturday Morning''===
On September 13, 1997, ''Disney's One Saturday Morning'' was first broadcast as a two hour block on the ''ABC Saturday Morning'' lineup, and originally featured some of the shows that had aired on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678415.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=|title=Webs roll out season geared to kids|date=August 29, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-13 | first=Christopher | last=Grove}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally scheduled for September 6, 1997, but due to ABC and all the other networks airing [[Princess Diana|Princess Diana's]] funeral instead of children's programming that day, It was pushed back a week later. In 1999, it was extended to 5 hours. On September 6, 1999 a spin-off, ''[[Disney's One Too]]'', aired on [[UPN]] and in [[Television syndication|syndication]] every weekday in the morning or afternoon and Sunday morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117743063.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=|title=Mouse brands UPN kidvid|date=July 19, 1999|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-13 | first=Chris | last=Pursell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''One Saturday Morning''' aired the final time on September 7, 2002 (by this time it had simply become bumpers and promos; the segments and hosting had been dropped in 2000 due to [[audience measurement|low ratings]]). Since [[Fox Kids]] was bought by Disney, [[4Kids Entertainment]] took over the block as &quot;[[4Kids TV|Fox Box]]&quot; and Disney changed the block from '''''Disney's One Saturday Morning''''' to '''''ABC Kids''''' on exactly the same day that Fox Kids was taken over.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC Kids&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117873477.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=|title=Kid skeds tread on joint strategy|date=September 29, 2002|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-13 | first=Paula | last=Bernstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the introduction to ''One Saturday Morning'' as well as other introductions on the block, a tiny [[lightbulb]] icon would appear in a bottom corner of the screen and an announcer would say, &quot;Illuminating Television,&quot; stating the programming block's [[E/I|educational programming]]. The lightbulb's chain would be pulled by a hand, and it would have an animation (turning into a rocket, falling into a garbage can, jumping in a pool, etc.). The icon continued to be used after the switch to ''ABC Kids'' until 2004, when it was replaced by a mortarboard hat that said &quot;e/i&quot; on it and an ABC logo that jumped to the top of the screen to wear the e/i hat. The mortarboard continued to be used until August 27, 2011.

===''ABC Kids''===
On September 14, 2002, Disney's ''One Saturday Morning'' was rebranded as ABC Kids. The block originally contained new programs, but by the end, all of ABC Kids programs became repeats of [[Disney Channel]] originals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC Kids&quot;/&gt;

''[[Power Rangers]]'' was previously aired on [[Fox Kids]] until halfway through the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force|Wild Force]]'' season, when ''Power Rangers'' moved to ABC Kids for the 2002 Fall season due to the [[ABC Family|Fox Family Channel]]/[[Saban Entertainment]] purchase by Disney in 2001. Starting with the episode &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;, the remainder of the ''Wild Force'' season premiered on ABC Kids. During its time on both Fox Kids and ABC Kids the entire ''Wild Force'' season also reran later on [[ABC Family]] (in part both prior to the introduction of and during the [[ABC Family#ABC_Family_Action_Block_.2F_Jetix|ABC Family Action Block]]). The following ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm|Ninja Storm]]'' season also premiered on ABC Kids and then reran later on the ABC Family Action Block. The ''[[Power Rangers Dino Thunder|Dino Thunder]]'', ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.|S.P.D.]]'', ''[[Power Rangers Mystic Force|Mystic Force]]'', ''[[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive|Operation Overdrive]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers Jungle Fury|Jungle Fury]]'' seasons were all premiered on [[Jetix (US)|Jetix]] and then reran on ABC Kids. The ''[[Power Rangers RPM|RPM]]'' season and broadcasts of the first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Mighty Morphin]]'', newly [[re-version]]ed, aired exclusively on ABC Kids.

''Power Rangers'' ended its run on ABC Kids on August 28, 2010 nationwide due to [[Haim Saban]] having bought back the [[intellectual rights]] to the franchise from Disney and giving airing rights to [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] in May 2010. Airings ended slightly earlier on August 14, 2010 on west coast affiliates due to a two-week preemption caused by the [[2010 Little League World Series]] and the [[E/I]] recovery that resulted from it. On September 4, 2010, the hour held by ''Power Rangers'' was returned to the local affiliates. After its completion on ABC Kids, ''Power Rangers'' moved to Nickelodeon. All new seasons (starting with the ''[[Power Rangers Samurai|Samurai]]'' season) began to premiere on the main [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] channel on February 7, 2011. Repeats of new seasons and all previous seasons began airing on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] on February 11, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;buy back&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019212.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=Saban re-acquires rights to 'Rangers' â Entertainment News, TV News, Media â Variety|date=2010-05-12|accessdate=2010-05-12 | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of federally-mandated [[E/I]] programming guidelines, some of the network's affiliate groups, primarily [[Hearst Television]] and [[Allbritton Communications Company|Allbritton Communications]], refused to carry any show that did not fulfill E/I requirements (such as ''Kim Possible'' or the ''Power Rangers'' series during their time on ABC Kids) in order to instead free up time to air locally produced programming. However, some stations time shifted these shows either to very early in the morning Saturday or to Sunday, often before local news, ''[[Good Morning America Weekend Edition|Good Morning America]]'' and/or that week's &quot;live&quot; portion of the ABC Kids block began. 

ABC Kids was aired for the final time on August 27, 2011. After that, ABC discontinued airing animated programming, making it the first not to air animated programs since September 1993, when [[NBC]] stopped airing animated programs to make room for [[TNBC]].

On May 24, 2011, ABC announced that it had reached a deal with broadcast syndication production company [[Litton Entertainment]] to produce original content for the Saturday morning block. The ''[[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]'' block launched on September 3, 2011, replacing ABC Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Orders Saturday Kids Block From Litton|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/05/24/51447/abc-orders-saturday-kids-block-from-litton|accessdate=May 24, 2011|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albiniak|first=Paige|title=ABC to Premiere Litton's Weekend Adventure on Sept. 3|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/468736-ABC_to_Premiere_ABC_Weekend_Adventure_on_Sept_3.php|accessdate=May 24, 2011|newspaper=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Litton Announces &quot;ABC Weekend Adventure&quot;|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110524007282/en/Litton-Announces-ABC-Weekend-Adventure|accessdate=May 24, 2011|newspaper=[[BusinessWire]]|date=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
