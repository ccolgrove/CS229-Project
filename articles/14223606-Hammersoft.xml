'''''MuchDance''''' is a series of pop/dance albums featuring various artists compiled, mixed and released by the [[Canadian]] television station [[MuchMusic]], beginning in 1997. It continues a similar series released in association with [[Quality Records]] from 1990 to 1997 under the name '''''Muchmusic Dance Mix'''''.

In addition to the ordinary albums in the series, MuchMusic also released albums such as ''MuchDance 80's'' (2005) that included classics like Paula Abdul's &quot;Straight Up.&quot; There has also been a volume of ''MuchDance 90s'' released, along with two #1 hits compilations.

In the United States, Quality Records released the set as '''Dance Mix USA''' from 1993 to 1998.

==History==

Quality released the first ''Dance Mix'' album as ''Dance Mix '90.'' Two Years later, ''Muchmusic Dance Mix '92'' was released with the Muchmusic logo on the cover and a series of advertisements on the channel. The final album in this series, ''Dance Mix 1997,'' was released by Quality without Muchmusic branding. In the United States, Quality, through its co-owned US subsididary Critique/Radikal Records, used featured tracks from &quot;Dance Mix '92&quot; to release the first of eight &quot;Dance Mix USA&quot; compilations, which proved to be popular with American fans through endless television and print campaigns. The last &quot;Dance Mix USA&quot; set released in America was in 1998 through Radikal.

The album ''MuchDance 1997'' was released in 1997.  Starting in 1998, a new edition has since been released every year, with the title of the album reflecting the next year (thus why there is no MuchDance 1998, as the album released that year was released under the title of ''MuchDance 1999'').

The latest album in the series, ''MuchDance 2012'', was released on November 8th, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.muchmusic.com/get-ready-for-this-muchdance-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;
