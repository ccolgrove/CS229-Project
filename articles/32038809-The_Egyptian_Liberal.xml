The following is a '''timeline of the [[2011 Bahraini uprising]]''', a campaign of protests, rioting, and civil disobedience in the [[Persian Gulf]] state of [[Bahrain]] that is considered part of the [[revolutionary wave]] of protests dubbed the [[Arab Spring]].

On 14 February, clashes were reported from parts of Bahrain. Helicopters circled over [[Manama]], where protesters were expected to gather in the afternoon; there was also a greater police presence in Shia villages. At least fourteen people were injured in clashes overnight and with police having used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse marchers in the mostly Shia village of [[Nuwaidrat]] in the country's southwest. The marchers were demanding the release of those detained during earlier protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;JazeeraBah14Feb&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | title = Bahrain Activists in 'Day of Rage'&amp;nbsp;â Anti-Government Protests in Shia Villages Around the Capital Leave Several People Injured and One Person Reported Dead | date=14 February 2011 | publisher = [[Al-Jazeera English]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011214925802473.html | accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After clashes that resulted in one death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= [[Ian Black (journalist)|Black, Ian]] |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/14/middle-east-iran-bahrain-yemen |title = Arrests and Deaths as Egypt Protest Spreads Across Middle East&amp;nbsp;â Iranians Defy Government Ban To Join Rally in Tehran, with Demonstrations and Street Clashes in Bahrain and Yemen | work = [[The Guardian]] | date=14 February 2011 | accessdate=14 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a young Bahraini male named [[Death of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima|Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima]] &lt;ref name=&quot;alwatannews1&quot;&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2011|reason=article in arabic.  at minimum, needs english translation of headline appended to &quot;trans_title&quot; field}} {{cite web | author = | url = http://www.alwatannews.net/news.aspx?id=2AG/1OO/7YhbLymnAKamyw== |title =ÙØ²ÙØ± Ø§ÙØ¯Ø§Ø®ÙÙØ© ÙØ¹Ø²Ù Ø£Ø³Ø±Ø© Ø§ÙÙØªÙÙÙ ÙÙ Ø£Ø­Ø¯Ø§Ø«  &quot;Ø§ÙØ¯ÙØ©&quot; ÙÙÙØ¬Ù ÙÙØªØ­ÙÙÙ ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ­Ø§Ø¯Ø« | trans_title = | language = [[Arabic language|Arabic]] | work = [[Al-Watan (Bahrain)|Al-Watan]] |date=14 February 2011 | accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; protesters were said to have moved to another location with between 600 to 700 continuing protests in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{full|date=April 2011}} Headline News.

On 9 March, in a protest that began at the Ras Roman mosque, thousands of Shia Bahrainis marched on the immigration office in the capital, Manama, and voiced their opposition towards the granting of citizenship to Sunnis from other countries serving in the country's military. However, in order to emphasise that the protest was against the government's naturalisation policy, and not against Bahrain's native Sunni population, participants also shouted slogans about Sunni-Shia unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Staff | title = Thousands Stage Rally in Bahrain&amp;nbsp;â Mostly Shia Protesters Demand Changes to Naturalisation Policy, Which They Say Favours Foreigners at Their Expense | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113917595654981.html | publisher = [[Al Jazeera English]] | date=9 March 2011 | accessdate=15 April 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yRqP02L8 |archivedate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, at a school in [[Saar, Bahrain|Saar]], clashes erupted between naturalised Sunni parents&amp;nbsp;â mainly from Syria and Pakistan&amp;nbsp;â and Shia parents, after some Shia pupils launched anti-government protests.

A video that appeared on YouTube showed one protester being shot with a tear-gas canister at close range.

Clashes were reported Friday in Bahrain's capital on the eve of parliamentary elections in the country. Security forces were sent to rallies to deal with what the Interior Ministry called &quot;illegal acts which resulted from demonstrations,&quot; the state news agency reported. An opposition group called The February 14 Coalition said it planned to launch protests on Friday and Saturday in the newly named Martyr's Square, the site formerly known as [[Pearl Roundabout]]. &quot;Just like all other freedom-loving people living in real democracies across the globe, we, the people of Bahrain have the right to choose the way in which we are governed,&quot; the group said. The Youth Coalition of February 14 announced it would be holding a sit-in demonstration at the same location.&lt;ref name =&quot;CNN23.9&quot;/&gt;

Bahrain held [[by-elections]] on 25 September to fill the 18 parliamentary seats left vacant when deputies from the main opposition Al Wefaq party resigned in March 2011.  Four seats were won unopposed before votes were cast, while the elections have been notable for the success of female candidates.  The elections were boycotted by the Al Wefaq party and other opposition groups, a political move that denied them legitimacy. As a result the voter turnout was low, particularly in areas where voters reportedly faced intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (26 September 2011).
