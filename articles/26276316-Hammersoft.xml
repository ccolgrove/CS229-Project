In 1987, Roddenberry selected Berman and [[Maurice Hurley]] to help create ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;tngcompanion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2003|last=Nemeck|first=Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he shared supervising producer duties with [[Robert H. Justman]]; after Justman changed to consulting producer duties, Berman was promoted to co-executive producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;tngcompanion&quot;/&gt; As Roddenberry's health declined, Berman took over more of the show's daily production; he was promoted to executive producer in the show's third season, following Hurley's departure.&lt;ref name=&quot;tngcompanion&quot;/&gt; Berman wrote the ''TNG'' episodes &quot;[[Brothers (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Brothers]]&quot; and &quot;[[A Matter of Time (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|A Matter of Time]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tngcompanion&quot;/&gt; In its final year, ''The Next Generation'' became the first syndicated television show to be nominated for the Best Dramatic Series Emmy.&lt;ref name=&quot;tngcompanion&quot;/&gt;

During ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s penultimate season, Berman co-created ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' with [[Michael Piller]], marking the first time two ''Star Trek'' series ran concurrently.&lt;ref name=&quot;ds9companion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Deep Space Nine Companion|first=Terry J.|last=Erdmann|coauthors=Paula M. Block|date=2000-08-01|isbn=978-0671501068}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''The Next Generation'' completed its run, Berman co-created ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' with Piller and [[Jeri Taylor]]. In 2001, he co-created ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise|Enterprise]]'' (retitled ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' in 2003) with [[Brannon Braga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/111735.html|title=Dispatch: Berman Celebrates Milestone|date=2000-05-22|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period, Berman was also lead producer on the four ''Next Generation'' feature films: ''[[Star Trek Generations|Generations]]'' (1994), ''[[Star Trek: First Contact|First Contact]]'' (1996), ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection|Insurrection]]'' (1998), and ''[[Star Trek Nemesis|Nemesis]]'' (2002). Berman received both producer and story credit on all four films.

In reviewing ''Nemesis'', [[IGN]]'s Oliver Glen argued that Berman and co-producer Braga seemed to be responsible for much of Star Trek no longer being &quot;bold&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/380/380136p1.html|title=Review of Star Trek Nemesis|first=Glen|last=Oliver|date=2002-12-12|accessdate=2009-04-12|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Star Trek writer [[David Weddle]] believed that the &quot;moribund aesthetics of Rick Berman&quot; were the &quot;constrictions that slowly strangled the franchise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/a_season_1_batt.html|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|accessdate=2009-05-03|title=A Season 1 'Battlestar' chat with Weddle and Thompson|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=2005-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berman specifically received criticism for his approach to dramatic musical scoring;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-05-03|url=http://www.soundtrack-express.com/osts/startrektv.htm|title=Next Generarion Music|author=Soundtrack Express|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; composer [[Ron Jones (composer)|Ron Jones]] claimed Berman &quot;always considered music an intrusion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startreksoundtracks.com/interview-ronjones.html|title=Ron Jones Interview|publisher=Star Trek Soundtracks|date=2002-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, former ''Next Generation'' star [[Brent Spiner]] credits Berman with having &quot;protected Gene Roddenberry's vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2008/12/10/spiner-comes-to-the-defense-of-rick-berman-and-jj-abrams/|title=Spiner Comes To The Defense Of Rick Berman (and JJ Abrams)|author=Anthony Pascale|date=December 10, 2008|work=TrekMovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon.com]]'s Robert Wilonsky asserted that Berman deserves credit for producing hundreds of hours of popular programming, and that &quot;without Berman to keep the show alive, there'd be no Berman to blame for the show's death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;salonpg3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/1999/10/29/trek/index2.html|title=The trouble with &quot;Trek&quot;|first=Robert|last=Wilonsky|date=1999-10-29|accessdate=2009-04-12|work=[[Salon.com]]|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Berman was involved in developing an eleventh ''Star Trek'' movie based on a script written by [[Erik Jendresen]]; however, when [[Gail Berman]] (no relation) took over as president of Paramount Pictures, Jendresen's script was shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/news422489.html|title=Star Trek XI Is Down, But It Is Not Out|first=Michael|last=Hinman|date=2006-04-12|accessdate=2009-04-12|publisher=Airlock Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent months, Berman began hinting that his involvement with ''Star Trek'' was drawing to a close, stating in November that &quot;when they re-energise the franchise it's going to be the result of someone fresh, someone who has not been extensively involved with ''Star Trek''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2005/11/19/a-new-team-will-produce-new-trek-tv-show-says-berman/|title=A New Team Will Produce New Trek TV Show Says Berman|first=Sam|last=Sloan|date=2005-11-19|accessdate=2009-04-12|work=Slice of SciFi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-2006, Berman stated he would no longer be involved in producing ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=45301415d7b9d&amp;cid=453133f7254fc&amp;tid=45304fe67fb03&amp;threadView=2&amp;clickReply=1|title=Rick Berman on Leaving the Star Trek Franchise|date=October 13, 2006|work=TrekWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his departure, Berman has indicated he is still involved in television production as well as projects &quot;not connected to the television business&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;trekmovie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://trekmovie.com/2007/04/20/berman-to-write-book-on-trek-experience/|title=Berman To Write Book On Trek Experience|first= Anthony|last=Pascale|date=2007-04-20|accessdate=2009-04-12|publisher=TrekMovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also stated an interest in writing a memoir of his experiences at ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name=&quot;trekmovie&quot;/&gt;
