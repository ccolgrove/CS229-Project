<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="18481342" ns="0" title="Preseed"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Preseeding''' is a method for automating the installation of the [[Debian]] [[GNU/Linux]] [[operating system]] and its derivatives. Answers to installation questions, which would normally be answered interactively by an operator, are predetermined and supplied via a configuration file (and sometimes boot parameters). This is similar to unattended installations of Windows operating systems using an answer file (see [[Installation (computer programs)]]).

Many [[Debian]]-based operating systems support preseed, because it is a feature of the [[Debian-Installer]] (also known as &quot;d-i&quot;).  For instance, although [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] is commonly installed via the user-friendly [[Ubiquity (software)|Ubiquity]] installer, preseeding the d-i is the recommended method for automating Ubuntu installations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/installation-guide/powerpc/appendix-preseed.html|title=Automating the installation using preseeding|publisher=Ubuntu documentation team|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
and for customizing install CDs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization|title=InstallCDCustomization|publisher=Ubuntu documentation team|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Note that preseeding automates the operating system installation, but it does not necessarily continue to detailed configuration or application installation in the same way as [[Fully Automatic Installation]]
