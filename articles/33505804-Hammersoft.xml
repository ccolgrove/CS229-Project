NATO Secretary-General [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] said in a statement that &quot;NATO and our partners have successfully implemented the historic mandate of the United Nations to protect the people of Libya. We will terminate our mission in co-ordination with the United Nations and the National Transitional Council. With the reported fall of Bani Walid and Sirte, that moment has now moved much closer.&quot; The [[North Atlantic Council]], the governing body of NATO, will meet on 21 October to officially terminate the seven-month campaign.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;David S.

NATO defense ministers, meeting in [[Brussels]] earlier in October, decided not to halt air operations. However, following Gaddafi's death and the NTC's taking of Sirt, the last city under Gaddafi's control, NATO is likely to officially end the campaign. And the [[Intergovernmental organization|inter-governmental military alliance]] is now expected to bring the campaign to an end. While only suspending airstrikes and beginning a monitoring period was considered, a NATO officer speaking to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on condition of anonymity stated that the sentiment within NATO is to end the campaign entirely, including the enforcement of the [[no-fly zone]] and the [[arms embargo]] enforced by naval ships.&lt;ref name=Cloud/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stavridis/&gt;

The death of Gaddafi and end of the campaign was viewed as a &quot;rare clear-cut victory&quot; for NATO after long operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Piracy in Somalia|anti-piracy patrols off Somalia]]. According to Michael Clarke, director of the London-based [[Royal United Services Institute]] [[think tank]], &quot;NATO can say unambiguously this was a military and political success.
