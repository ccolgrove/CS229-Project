'''RenÃ© Goscinny''' (14 August 1926 &amp;ndash; 5 November 1977) was a [[French people|French]] comics editor and writer, who is best known for the [[comic book]] ''[[AstÃ©rix]]'', which he created with illustrator [[Albert Uderzo]], and for his work on the comic series ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' with [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] (considered the series' golden age) and ''[[Iznogoud]]'' with [[Jean Tabary]].

==Early life==
Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926, to a family of [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrants from [[Poland]];&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Garcia|first= Laure|work =Le Nouvel Observateur | title = Uderzo, le dernier Gaulois | url = http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p2136/articles/a280131-uderzo__le_dernier_gaulois.html|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;  his parents were StanisÅaw Simkha GoÅcinny (the surname means ''hospitable'' in Polish, Simkha is his Jewish name meaning happiness), a chemical engineer from [[Warsaw]], Poland, and Anna (Hanna) BereÅniak-GoÅcinna from [[khodorkov (Ukraine)|ChodorkÃ³w]], a small village near [[Zhitomir]], in the [[Second Polish Republic]], now [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Yeruham Eniss the village had a soap factory that supplied the large Jewish community of nearby Chortkow with jobs selling and trading in soap. A census made in the late 1930's counted 3670 Jewish families in Khodorkov before WWII ([[ShtetLinks]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; Claude, RenÃ©'s older brother was born 6 years earlier; on 10 December 1920. StanisÅaw and Anna had met in Paris and married in 1919. The GoÅcinnys moved to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], two years after RenÃ©'s birth, because of a chemical engineer post StanisÅaw had obtained there. He spent a happy childhood in Buenos Aires, and studied in the French schools there. He had a habit of being the &quot;Class Clown&quot;, probably to compensate for a natural shyness. He started drawing very early on, inspired by the illustrated stories which he enjoyed reading. 

In December 1943, the year after he graduated from school, 17 year old Goscinny lost his father to a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], forcing him to find a job. The next year, he got his first job, as an assistant accountant in a tire recovery factory, and when he was laid off the following year, he became a junior illustrator in an advertising agency.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Lambiek Comiclopedia | title = RenÃ© Goscinny | url =http://lambiek.net/artists/g/goscinny.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 

Goscinny, along with his mother, left Argentina and went to New York in 1945, to join their uncle Boris. To avoid service in the US military, he travelled to France to join the [[French Army]] in 1946. He served at [[Aubagne]], in the 141st Alpine Infantry Battalion. Promoted to senior [[corporal]], he became the appointed illustrator of the regiment and drew illustrations and posters for the army.

==First works==
The following year, he illustrated the book ''The Girl with The Eyes of Gold'' and returned to New York. On his arrival Goscinny went through the most difficult period of his life. For a while, he was jobless, alone and totally broke. By 1948, though, he recovered and started working in a small studio where he met and became friends with future ''[[MAD Magazine|Mad]]'' alumni [[Will Elder]], [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and [[Harvey Kurtzman]].&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Goscinny then became art director at [[Kunen Publishers]] where he wrote four books for children. Around this time he met Joseph Gillain, better known as [[JijÃ©]], and Maurice de Bevere aka [[Morris (comics)|Morris]], the [[cartoonist]] and author of the series ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' (which Goscinny would write from 1955 to his death in 1977).&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;/&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 

Also, he met [[Georges Troisfontaines]], chief of the [[World Press agency]], who convinced Goscinny to return to Paris and work for his agency as the head of Paris office in 1951. Here, he met Albert Uderzo, with whom he started a longtime cooperation.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lambiek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lagardere&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = LagardÃ¨re | title = Release of the 33rd Asterix volume | url =http://www.lagardere.com/us/actualites/detail_actu.cfm?idt=9&amp;idn=5994&amp;nav=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; They started out with some work for ''[[Bonnes SoirÃ©es]]'', a female magazine for which Goscinny wrote ''Sylvie''. Goscinny and Uderzo also launched the series ''Jehan Pistolet'' and ''Luc Junior'' in ''[[La Libre Junior]]''.

In 1955, Goscinny, accompanied by [[Jean-Michel Charlier]], [[Albert Uderzo]] and [[Jean HÃ©brad]], founded the syndicate Edipress/Edifrance. The syndicate launched publications like ''Clairon'' for the factory union and ''Pistolin'' for a chocolate company. Goscinny and Uderzo cooperated on the series ''Bill Blanchart'' in Jeannot, ''Pistolet'' in Pistolin and ''Benjamin et Benjamine'' in the magazine of the same name. Under the pseudonym Agostini, Goscinny wrote ''[[Le petit Nicolas|Le Petit Nicolas]]'' for [[Jean-Jacques SempÃ©]] in ''[[Le Moustique]]'' and later ''[[Sud-Ouest (magazine)|Sud-Ouest]]'' and ''[[Pilote]]''. 

In 1956, Goscinny began a collaboration with the magazine ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]''. He wrote some short stories for [[Jo Angenot]] and [[Albert Weinberg]], and worked on ''Signor Spaghetti'' with [[Dino Attanasio]], ''Monsieur Tric'' with [[Bob de Moor]], ''Prudence Petitpas'' with [[Maurice MarÃ©chal]], ''Globul le Martien'' and ''Alphonse'' with [[Tibet (comics)|Tibet]], ''Strapontin'' with [[Arthur Berckmans|Berck]] and ''[[Modeste et Pompon]]'' with [[AndrÃ© Franquin]]. An early creation with Uderzo, ''[[Oumpah-pah]]'', was also adapted for serial publication in ''Tintin'' from 1958-1962.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;asterix int&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Asterix International! | title = Albert Uderzo | url =http://www.asterix-international.de/asterix/uderzo.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; In addition, Goscinny appeared in the magazines ''[[Paris-Flirt]]'' (''Lili Manequin'' with [[Will (comics)|Will]]) and ''[[Vaillant (magazine)|Vaillant]]'' (''Boniface et Anatole'' with Jordom, ''Pipsi'' with Godard).

==''Pilote'' and ''AstÃ©rix''==
In 1959, the Ãdifrance/Ãdipresse syndicate started the [[Franco-Belgian comics magazines|comics magazine]] ''[[Pilote]]''.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BDO-1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=BDoubliÃ©es|title=Pilote annÃ©e 1959|url=http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1959.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Goscinny became one of the most productive writers for the magazine. In the magazine's first issue, he launched his most famous creation, ''[[Asterix|AstÃ©rix]]'', with Uderzo. This series was an instant hit and is now known worldwide. Goscinny also restarted the series ''Le Petit Nicolas'' and ''Jehan Pistolet'', now called ''Jehan Soupolet''. Goscinny also began ''Jacquot le Mousse'' and ''Tromblon et Bottaclou'' with Godard. 

The magazine was bought by [[Georges Dargaud]] in 1960, and Goscinny became editor-in-chief. He also began new series like ''Les Divagations de Monsieur Sait-Tout'' (with Martial), ''La Potachologie IllustrÃ©e'' (with [[Cabu]]), ''Les Dingodossiers'' (with [[Marcel Gotlieb|Gotlib]]) and ''La ForÃªt de ChÃªnebeau'' (with [[Mic Delinx]]). With [[Tabary]], he launched ''Calife Haroun El Poussah'' in ''Record'', a series that was later continued in ''Pilote'' as ''[[Iznogoud]]''. With [[Raymond Macherot]] he created ''Pantoufle'' for ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]].

==Family==
Goscinny married Gilberte Pollaro-Millo in 1967. In 1968 their daughter [[Anne Goscinny]] was born, who also became an author.

==Death==
Goscinny died at 51, in Paris of [[cardiac arrest]] on 5 November 1977, during a [[cardiac stress test|stress test]] at his doctor's office. He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery of Nice. In accordance with his will, most of his money was transferred to the chief rabbinate of France. 

Since Goscinny's untimely death, Uderzo has continued to produce the Asterix series, although at the much slower pace of one book every three to five years. The critical reception of the books written without Goscinny has been mixed to poor.

In a tribute to Goscinny, Uderzo gave his likeness to one of the characters in ''L'OdyssÃ©e d'AstÃ©rix'' (&quot;Asterix and the Black Gold&quot;).
