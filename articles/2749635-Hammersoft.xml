'''The King family''' are a [[fictional]] [[family]] appearing on the [[ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Emmerdale]]''.

==About the Kings==
The Kings were one of Emmerdales most popular families and also the most tragic.
Emmerdale bosses had previously tried to introduce two large families - The Calder/Weston clan in 2001 and the Marsdens in 2003 - but they were axed after failing to impress the viewers, leading producers to attempt it for the third time.
The King Family first arrived in [[Emmerdale]] in early 2004 consisting of father Tom, eldest son Jimmy and Jimmy's wife Sadie, and younger sons Matthew and Carl. They were later joined by the youngest King brother, Max. Within months of their arrival, they became viewer favourites and were set to become Emmerdales new version of the Tate clan. Ratings for Emmerdale began to beat Eastenders on frequent occasions from 2004â2007 and the Kings proved to be extremely popular with viewers. However, by the end of 2008, actors Charlie Kemp (Max), Patsy Kensit (Sadie), Ken Farrington (Tom) and Matt Healy (Matthew) had all quit the show, leading to producers writing their characters out in shocking exit plots. The Kings biggest plot was the Who Killed Tom King storyline (2006â2007) in which Tom was murdered on Christmas Day and 10 of the shows characters were all suspects.
They will always be remembered for providing Emmerdale with some of its biggest and most popular storylines but will also be remembered for being the unluckiest family in soap history.

===Hierarchy===
Initially [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] was the [[patriarch]] of his family, making sure everyone knew he was in charge both at home and within the family business, King and Sons. His eldest son [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy]] strived to be his second in command, working for his father since the age of 14, though Tom favoured Jimmy's wife [[Sadie King|Sadie]] and gave her important jobs, rather than giving them to Jimmy. Sadie later betrayed the family, and kidnapped Tom with the help of [[Cain Dingle]], leading to her departure from the village.

Tom's second son, [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew]] also wanted to have power within the business, and regularly came to blows with Jimmy about it. Tom's younger sons [[Carl King (Emmerdale)|Carl]] and [[Max King (Emmerdale)|Max]] were initially low down on the status scale, and Max didn't work for the company, instead working as a vet until his death in October 2006.
