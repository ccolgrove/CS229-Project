'''Chaetognatha''', meaning ''hair-jaws'', and commonly known as '''arrow worms''', are a [[Phylum (biology)|phylum]] of predatory marine worms that are a major component of [[plankton]] worldwide. About 20% of the known species are benthic, that is belonging to the lowest zone of the ocean, or [[benthic zone]], and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from {{convert|2|to|120|mm|in}}. 

There are more than 120 modern species assigned to over 20 genera.  Despite the limited diversity of species, the number of individuals is large.&lt;ref name=Bone&gt;

==Anatomy==

Chaetognaths are transparent or translucent dart-shaped animals covered by a [[cuticle]]. The body is divided into a distinct head, trunk, and tail. There are between four and fourteen hooked, grasping spines on each side of their head, flanking a hollow vestibule containing the mouth. The spines are used in hunting, and covered with a flexible hood arising from the neck region when the animal is swimming. All chaetognaths are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], preying on other planktonic animals.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1046â1050|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trunk bears one or two pairs of lateral fins incorporating structures superficially similar to the [[fin ray]]s of fish. Unlike those of vertebrates, however, these are composed of a thickened [[basement membrane]] extending from the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]], and they are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]]. An additional caudal fin covers the post-anal tail.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Two chaetognath species, ''Caecosagitta macrocephala'' and ''Eukrohnia fowleri'', have [[bioluminescent]] organs in their fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | author = Haddock, S.H.D. &amp; J.F.

Chaetognaths swim in short bursts using a dorso-ventral undulating body motion, where their tail fin assists with propulsion and the body fins for stabilization and steering.&lt;ref&gt;

The body cavity lacks a [[peritoneum]], and therefore resembles the [[pseudocoel]] of animals such as [[nematode]]s, but is divided into one compartment on each side of the trunk, and additional compartments inside the head and tail.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Although they have a mouth with one or two rows of tiny teeth, compound eyes, and a nervous system, they have no respiratory or circulatory systems.  

The mouth opens into a muscular [[pharynx]] which contains glands to lubricate the passage of food. From here, a straight intestine runs the length of the trunk to an [[anus]] just in front of the tail. The intestine is the primary site of digestion and includes a pair of [[diverticulum|diverticula]] near the anterior end.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The nervous system is reasonably simple, consisting of a [[ganglion]]ated nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. The dorsal ganglion is the largest, but nerves extend from all the ganglia along the length of the body. Chaetognaths have two compound eyes, each consisting of a number of pigment-cup [[ocelli]] fused together. In addition, there is a number of sensory bristles arranged in rows along the side of the body, where they probably perform a function similar to that of the [[lateral line]] in fish. An additional, curved, band of sensory bristles lies over the head and neck.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

Materials are moved about the body cavity by [[cilia]].  Waste materials are simply excreted through the skin and anus.

The arrow worm [[rhabdomere]]s are derived from [[microtubule]]s, which in turn form conical bodies, which contain granules and thread structures. The cone body is derived from a cilium, and the microtubules of the rhabdomeres are 20 nm long and 50 nm wide.  &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Photoreception.&quot; EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica from [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] . 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
All species are [[hermaphroditic]], carrying both [[ovum|eggs]] and [[spermatozoon|sperm]].&lt;ref name=Bone/&gt; Each animal possesses a pair of [[testis|testes]] within the tail, and a pair of [[ovary|ovaries]] in the posterior region of the main body cavity. Immature sperm are released from the testes to mature inside the cavity of the tail, and then swim through a short duct to a [[seminal vesicle]] where they are packaged into a [[spermatophore]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

During mating, each individual places a spermatophore onto the neck of its partner after rupture of the seminal vesicle. The sperm rapidly escape from the spermatophore and swim along the midline of the animal until they reach a pair of small pores just in front of the tail. These pores connect to the [[oviduct]]s, into which the developed eggs have already passed from the ovaries, and it is here that fertilisation takes place.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The eggs are planktonic, or attached to nearby [[alga]]e, and hatch into miniature versions of the adult, without a well-defined [[larva]]l stage.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

== Classification ==

Chaetognaths are traditionally classed as [[deuterostomes]] by [[embryologist]]s. [[Lynn Margulis]] and K. V. Schwartz place chaetognaths in the deuterostomes in their ''Five Kingdom'' classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Phylum Chaetognatha per Margulis and Schwartz] (select Margulis &amp; Schwartz in 'Classification by') - last retrieved November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular [[phylogeny|phylogenist]]s, however, consider them to be [[protostomes]]. [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] places them in the protostomes in his ''Six Kingdom'' classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Phylum Chaetognatha per Cavalier-Smith] (select Cavalier-Smith in 'Classification by') - last retrieved November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The similarities between chaetognaths and nematodes mentioned above may support the protostome thesis - in fact, chaetognaths are sometimes regarded as a basal [[ecdysozoa]]n or [[lophotrochozoa]]n.&lt;ref&gt;

Chaetognatha appears close to the base of the protostome tree in most studies of their molecular phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain their deuterostome embryonic characters.  If chaetognaths branched off from the protostomes before they evolved their distinctive protostome embryonic characters, they may have retained deuterostome characters inherited from early [[bilateria]]n ancestors.  Thus chaetognaths may be a useful model for the ancestral bilaterian.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies of arrow worms' nervous systems suggests they should be placed within the protostomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi | 10.1111/j.1744-7410.2010.00189.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi | 10.1186/1742-9994-4-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fossil record ==
Due to their soft bodies, chaetognaths fossilize poorly. Even so, several fossil chaetognath species have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vannier | first1 = J. | last2 = Steiner | first2 = M. | last3 = Renvoise | first3 = E. | last4 = Hu | first4 = S.-X. | last5 = Casanova | first5 = J.-P. | year = 2007 | title = Early Cambrian origin of modern food webs: evidence from predator arrow worms | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B | volume = 274 | issue = 1610| pages = 627â633 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2006.3761 | pmid = 17254986 | pmc = 2197202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the [[Cambrian]] Period. Complete body fossils have been formally described from the Lower [[Cambrian]] [[Maotianshan shales]] of [[Yunnan, China]] (''Eognathacantha ercainella'' Chen &amp; Huang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J.-Y. | last2 = Huang | first2 = D.-Y. | year = 2002 | title = A possible Lower Cambrian chaetognath (arrow worm) | url = | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue =5591 | page = 187|pmid=12364798|doi=10.1126/science.1075059  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Protosagitta spinosa'' Hu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hu | first1 = S.-X. | year = 2005 | title = Taphonomy and palaeoecology of the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Biota from Eastern Yunnan, China | url = | journal = Berliner PalÃ¤obiologische Abhandlungen | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1â197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Middle Cambrian [[Burgess Shale]] of British Columbia (''Oesia disjuncta'' Walcott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Szaniawski | first1 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Cambrian chaetognaths recognized in Burgess Shale fossils | url = | journal = Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume = 50 | issue =1 | pages = 1â8 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-001.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  A more recent chaetognath, ''Paucijaculum samamithion'' Schram, has been described from the Mazon Creek biota from the [[Pennsylvanian]] of Illinois. Chaetognaths were thought possibly to be related to some of the animals grouped with the [[conodont]]s.  The conodonts themselves, however, are thought to be related to the [[vertebrates]].  It is now thought that [[protoconodonta|protoconodont]] elements (e.g., ''Protohertzina anabarica'' Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than teeth of conodonts.  Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements, but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then.
