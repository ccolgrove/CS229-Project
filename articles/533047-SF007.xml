'''FreeSBIE''' is a [[live CD]], an [[operating system]] that is able to load directly from a bootable CD with no installation process or hard disk. It is based on the [[FreeBSD]] operating system. Its name is a [[pun]] on [[frisbee]]. Currently, FreeSBIE uses [[Xfce]] and [[Fluxbox]].

FreeSBIE 1.0 was based on FreeBSD 5.2.1 and released on February 27, 2004. The first version of FreeSBIE 2 was developed during the summer of 2005, thanks to the [[Google Summer of Code]]. FreeSBIE 2.0.1, which is a complete rewrite of the so-called toolkit, is based on FreeBSD 6.2 and was released on February 10, 2007. According to [[DistroWatch]] the FreeSBIE project is discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=freesbie |title=FreeSBIE - FreeBSD Live CD |publisher=DistroWatch.org |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
