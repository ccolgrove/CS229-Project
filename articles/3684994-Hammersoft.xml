'''Nazareth College''' is a [[Catholic]], [[co-educational]], [[Secondary school|secondary]] [[day school]], located in [[Noble Park North, Victoria|Noble Park North]], a south eastern suburb of [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

Established in 1986, the [[college]] currently caters for approximately 1000 students in Years seven through twelve.

== History ==
Nazareth was established in 1986 through the collaboration of four local parish primary-level schools: St Elizabeth's in [[Noble Park North, Victoria|Noble Park North]], St Gerard's in [[Dandenong North, Victoria|Dandenong North]], St Justin's in [[Wheelers Hill, Victoria|Wheelers Hill]] and St Simon's in [[Rowville, Victoria|Rowville]]. At the time, it was seen that there was need for a local regional college following the Catholic tradition and hence, Nazareth College was formed to cater to students from the four parishes. A majority of the students at Nazareth College are graduates of one of the parish schools listed above.

Nazareth College's past principals have been:
*Paul D'Astoli (1986â1996)
*Gregory Clarke (1997â2006)
*Anne McDonald (2007âpresent)

== Nazareth Cluster ==
The Nazareth Cluster is a collaboration of Nazareth College and its four feeder schools: St Elizabeth's, St Gerard's, St Justin's and St Simon's.  The collaboration's purpose is to ease the transition between primary school and secondary school.  It is from this cluster that Nazareth College draws its priests for mass.

== Structure ==
Nazareth College comprises a Middle School and Senior School. Middle School caters for the students in Years 7-9 and the Senior School caters for the students in 10-12.

In the Middle School, students must complete the core subjects (subjects compulsory to all students including English, science, math, art, technology, music and language subjects) such as English, Mathematics, etc. At Year 9, students are given the opportunity to select subjects including a language (either Italian or Japanese) and a variety of other subjects.

In the Senior School, focus is placed upon the completion of the primarily academic [[Victorian Certificate of Education|VCE]], or the more trade orientated VCAL.

==Academics==
Nazareth College senior students study for the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (Nazareth does not offer the [[International Baccalaureate]]), achieved after graduating from Year 12.  While this is usually undertaken over a period of two years the school recently instituted an acceleration program that allows gifted students to do, at most, one Year 11 subject in Year 10.  A Monash University bursary is also awarded to the top student in Year 11 at each campus to help pay for the cost of Year 12 studies.

==International Students==
Nazareth College has fostered a large international student program, with at least twenty international students studying in each of Years 11 &amp; 12, these students come from primarily [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]].  To continue to foster its international links the school regularly hosts students from overseas to study at Nazareth College.

== Student Leadership ==
Students of every age have the opportunity to take up a position of leadership. Students may become a Class Captain or SRC (Years 7 - 11), a House Captain (Years 8, 10 and 12) and Middle School Captain (Year 9).

In Year 12, students have a variety of leadership opportunities:
There are 12 positions on the Student Representative Council (SRC);
4 House Captain positions, 4 Arts Captain positions &amp; 4 College Captain positions.  These captain positions are broken up into:

*College Captain SRC (2 people)
*College Captain Faith and Outreach (2 people)
*Arts Captains (4 people)
*House Captains (4 people, 1 for each house)
