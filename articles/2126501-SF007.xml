'''Google Earth''' is a [[virtual globe]], [[map]] and [[Geography|geographical]] information program that was originally called EarthViewer 3D, and was created by [[Keyhole, Inc]], a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funded company acquired by [[Google]] in 2004 (see [[In-Q-Tel]]). It maps the Earth by the [[superimposition]] of images obtained from [[satellite imagery]], [[aerial photography]] and [[geographic information system|GIS]] [[computer graphics|3D]] globe. It was available under three different licenses, two currently: Google Earth, a free version with limited function; Google Earth Plus (discontinued),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2008/12/google_earth_plus_discontinued.html|title=Google Earth Plus Discontinued}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techpluto.com/google-earth-live/|title=Google Discontinues &quot;Google Earth Plus&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included additional features; and Google Earth Pro ($399 per year), which is intended for commercial use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Earth Product Family&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth.google.com/products.html| title= Google Earth Product Family| accessdate = 2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product, re-released as Google Earth in 2005, is currently available for use on [[personal computer]]s running [[Windows 2000]] and above, [[Mac OS X]] 10.3.9 and above, [[Linux kernel]]: 2.6 or later (released on June 12, 2006), and [[FreeBSD]]. Google Earth is also available as a [[Web browser|browser]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] which was released on May 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2008/05/google-earth-meet-browser.html|title=Google Earth, meet the browser}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also made available for mobile viewers on the [[iOS (Apple)|iPhone OS]] on October 28, 2008, as a free download from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and is available to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] users as a free app on the [[Android Market]]. In addition to releasing an updated Keyhole based client, Google also added the imagery from the Earth database to their web-based mapping software, [[Google Maps]]. The release of Google Earth in June 2005 to the public caused a more than tenfold increase in media coverage on [[virtual globe]]s between 2004 and 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;Media Coverage of Geospatial Platforms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geospatialweb.com/figure-4| title=Media Coverage of Geospatial Platforms| accessdate = 2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; driving public interest in [[geospatial]] technologies and applications.
As of October 2011 Google Earth has been downloaded more than a billion times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-earth-downloaded-more-than-one.html] Official post on Google Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axetue.com/2011/10/12/google-earth-billion-downloads/] Google Earth Gets a Billion Downloads&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==

Google Earth displays satellite images of varying resolution of the Earth's surface, allowing users to see things like cities and houses looking perpendicularly down or at an [[oblique angle]] (see also [[bird's eye view]]). The degree of resolution available is based somewhat on the points of interest and popularity, but most land (except for some islands) is covered in at least 15 meters of resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth.google.com/data.html]{{Dead link|date=September 2011}} Maps showing a visual representation of Google Earth coverage&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]], Australia; [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]; and [[Cambridge|Cambridge, Cambridgeshire]] include examples of the highest resolution, at 15&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;inches). Google Earth allows users to search for addresses for some countries, enter coordinates, or simply use the mouse to browse to a location.
For large parts of the surface of the Earth only 2D images are available, from almost vertical photography. Viewing this from an oblique angle, there is perspective in the sense that objects which are horizontally far away are seen smaller, like viewing a large photograph, not quite like a 3D view.

For other parts of the surface of the Earth 3D images of terrain and buildings are available. Google Earth uses [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) data collected by [[NASA]]'s [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] (SRTM).&lt;ref&gt;Farr et al., 2007, The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, v. 45, Reviews of Geophysics, doi: 1029/2005RG000183. [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/ SRTM web site]&lt;/ref&gt; This means one can view the whole earth in three [[dimension]]s. Since November 2006, the 3D views of many mountains, including Mount Everest, have been improved by the use of supplementary DEM data to fill the gaps in SRTM coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php/Cat/0/Number/695033/an/latest/page/0#695033|title=Google Earth Community: Nov. 23rd&amp;nbsp;â Thanksgiving Day imagery update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people use the applications to add their own data, making them available through various sources, such as the [[Bulletin Board Systems]] (BBS) or [[blogs]] mentioned in the link section below. Google Earth is able to show all kinds of images overlaid on the surface of the earth and is also a [[Web Map Service]] client. Google Earth supports managing three-dimensional [[Geospatial]] data through [[Keyhole Markup Language]] (KML).

Google Earth is simply based on 3D maps, it has the capability to show 3D buildings and structures (such as bridges), which consist of users' submissions using [[SketchUp]], a [[3D modeling]] program software. In prior versions of Google Earth (before Version 4), 3D buildings were limited to a few cities, and had poorer rendering with no textures. Many buildings and structures from around the world now have detailed 3D structures; including (but not limited to) those in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, India, Japan, United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/googleearth.php |title=Skyscraper News Google Earth |publisher=Skyscrapernews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, [[Pakistan]] and the cities, [[Amsterdam]] and [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infopot.tk/ |title=infopot.tk |publisher=infopot.tk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, [[Hamburg]] became the first city entirely shown in 3D, including textures such as faÃ§ades. The 'Westport3D' model was created by 3D imaging firm AM3TD using long-distance laser scanning technology and digital photography and is the first such model of an Irish town to be created. As it was developed initially to aid Local Government in carrying out their [[town planning]] functions it includes the highest resolution photo-realistic textures to be found anywhere in Google Earth. Three-dimensional renderings are available for certain buildings and structures around the world via Google's 3D Warehouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/ |title=3D Warehouse |publisher=Sketchup.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other websites. Although there are many cities on Google Earth that are fully or partially 3D you can get more by going on to the Earth Gallery. The Earth Gallery is a library of modifications of Google Earth people have made. In the library there are more than just modifications for 3D buildings there are models of earth quakes using the Google Earth model, 3D forests, and much more.

Recently{{when|date=June 2011}}, Google added a feature that allows users to monitor traffic speeds at loops located every 200 yards in real-time. In version 4.3 released on April 15, 2008, [[Google Street View]] was fully integrated into the program allowing the program to provide an on the street level view in many locations.

On January 32nd, 2010, the entirety of Google Earth's ocean floor imagery was updated to new images by SIO, NOAA, US Navy, NGA, and GEBCO. The new images have caused smaller islands, such as some atolls in the [[Maldives]], to be rendered invisible despite their shores being completely outlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2009/01/new_view_of_ocean_floor_in_google_e.html |title=New View of Ocean Floor in Google Earth &amp;#124; Google Earth Blog |publisher=Gearthblog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Google Earth is useful for many day-to-day and other purposes.

*Google Earth can be used to view areas subjected to widespread disasters if Google supplies up-to-date images. For example after the January 12, [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] images of Haiti were made available on January 17.

* With Google's push for the inclusion of Google Earth in the Classroom,&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleEnterprise&quot;&gt;

* One can explore and place location bookmarks on the Moon, and Mars.

* One can also get directions using Google Earth, using variables such as street names, cities, and establishments.

* Google Earth can also function as a &quot;hub&quot; of knowledge, pertaining to your location. By enabling certain options, one can see the location of gas stations, restaurants, museums, and other public establishments in their area. Google Earth can also dot the map with links to images, [[YouTube]] videos, and [[Wikipedia]] articles relevant to the area being viewed.

==Features==
===Wikipedia and Panoramio integration===
In December 2006, Google Earth added a new layer called &quot;Geographic Web&quot; that includes integration with [[Wikipedia]] and [[Panoramio]]. In Wikipedia, entries are [[Web scraping|scraped]] for coordinates via the {{srlink|Template:Coord|Coord templates}}. There is also a community-layer from the project [[:de:Wikipedia:WikiProjekt Georeferenzierung/Wikipedia-World/en|Wikipedia-World]]. More coordinates are used, different types are in the display and different languages are supported than the built-in Wikipedia layer.&lt;ref&gt;http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kolossos/world-link.php?lang=en dynamic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webkuehn.de/hobbys/wikipedia/geokoordinaten/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Google announced on May 30, 2007 that it is acquiring [[Panoramio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/annc/annc_panoramio.html|title=Google is planning to acquire Panoramio|publisher=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Google removed the &quot;Geographic Web&quot; layer. The &quot;Panoramio&quot; layer became part of the main layers and the &quot;Wikipedia&quot; layer was placed in the &quot;More&quot; layer.

===Flight simulator===
[[Image:Toronto downtown.png|right|thumb|Downtown [[Toronto]], as seen from a [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F16 Fighting Falcon]] during a simulated flight.]]

In Google Earth v4.2 a flight simulator was included as a [[Easter egg (virtual)#Software-based|hidden feature]]. Starting with v4.3 it is no longer hidden. Initially the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and the [[Cirrus SR-22]] were the only aircraft available, and they could be used with only a few airports. In addition to keyboard control, the simulator can be controlled with a mouse or joystick.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}    Google Earth v5.1 and higher crashes when starting flight simulator with Saitek and other joysticks.
The user can also fly underwater.

====Featured planes====
* [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]&amp;nbsp;â A much higher speed and maximum altitude than the Cirrus SR-22, it has the ability to fly at a maximum speed of [[Mach 2]]. The take-off speed is 225 knots, the landing speed is  200 knots (370&amp;nbsp;km/h).

* [[Cirrus SR-22]]&amp;nbsp;â Although slower and with a lower maximum altitude, the SR-22 is much easier to handle and is preferred for up-close viewing of Google Earth's imagery. The take-off speed is 75 knots (139&amp;nbsp;km/h), the landing speed is 70 knots (130&amp;nbsp;km/h)&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleearthflight.weebly.com/learn-how-to-fly-better.html]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight simulator can be commanded  with the keyboard, mouse or plugged-in joystick. Broadband connection and a high speed computer provides a very realistic experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article3250643.ece Webwise: Google's flight simulator] [[The Sunday Times]], January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The simulator also runs with animation, allowing objects (for example: planes])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2009/08/planes_for_google_earth_flight_simu.html&lt;/ref&gt; to animate while on the simulator. Image overlays&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gearthhacks.com/dlfile31271/Airbus-A400--Flight-Sim-Overlay.htm&lt;/ref&gt; can also be added to make it look like the cockpit of a plane.

===Sky mode===
{{Main|Google Sky}}
[[Image:Google Earth Sky.png|thumb|right|Google Earth in Sky Viewing Mode]]

'''[[Google Sky]]''' is a feature that was introduced in Google Earth 4.2 on August 22, 2007, and allows users to view [[star]]s and other [[celestial bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Explore the sky with Google Earth | publisher =Google | date= 2007-08-22 | url =http://earth.google.com/sky/skyedu.html | accessdate =2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by [[Google]] through a partnership with the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] (STScI) in Baltimore, the science operations center for the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Dr. [[Alberto Conti]] and his co-developer Dr. [[Carol Christian]] of STScI plan to add the public images from 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn12523 |title=Celestial add-on points Google Earth at the stars - tech - August 22, 2007 - New Scientist Tech |publisher=Technology.newscientist.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as color images of all of the archived data from Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys. Newly released [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] pictures will be added to the Google Sky program as soon as they are issued. New features such as multi-wavelength data, positions of major satellites and their orbits as well as educational resources will be provided to the Google Earth community and also through Christian and Conti's website for Sky.&lt;ref&gt;http://hubblesite.org/explore_astronomy/gsky/&lt;/ref&gt; Also visible on Sky mode are constellations, stars, galaxies and animations depicting the planets in their orbits. A real-time Google Sky [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]] of recent astronomical transients, using the [[VOEvent]] protocol, is being provided by the VOEventNet&lt;ref&gt;http://voeventnet.org/&lt;/ref&gt;collaboration. Google's Earth maps are being updated each 5 minutes.

Google Sky faces competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olsen |first=Stefanie |url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9881229-1.html |title=WorldWide Telescope peers into Big Dipper &amp;#124; Crave - CNET |publisher=Crave.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Microsoft WorldWide Telescope]] (which runs only under the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems) and from [[Stellarium (computer program)|Stellarium]], a free open source planetarium that runs under Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]].

On March 13, 2008, Google made a web-based version&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/sky/&lt;/ref&gt; of Google Sky available via the internet.

===Street View===
{{Main|Google Street View}}
On April 15, 2008 with version 4.3, Google fully integrated its [[Google Street View|Street View]] into Google Earth. In version 6.0, the photo zooming function has been removed because it is incompatible with the new 'seamless' navigation.

Google Street View provides 360Â° panoramic street-level views and allows users to view parts of selected cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas at ground level. When it was launched on May 25, 2007 for [[Google Maps]], only five cities were included. It has since expanded to more than 40 U.S. cities, and includes the suburbs of many, and in some cases, other nearby cities. Recent updates have now implemented Street View in most of the major cities of Australia and New Zealand as well as parts of Canada, parts of South Africa, Denmark, Mexico, Japan, Norway, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France, the UK, Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Portugal, Taiwan,  and Singapore.

Google Street View, when operated, displays photos that were previously taken by a camera mounted on an automobile, and can be navigated by using the mouse to click on photograph icons displayed on the screen in the user's direction of travel. Using these devices, the photos can be viewed in different sizes, from any direction, and from a variety of angles.

===Water and ocean===
Introduced in version 5.0 (February 2009), the ''Google Ocean'' feature allows users to zoom below the surface of the ocean and view the 3D [[bathymetry]] beneath the waves. Supporting over 20 content layers, it contains information from leading scientists and [[Oceanography|oceanographers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7865407.stm | work=BBC News | title=Google Earth dives under the sea | date=February 2, 2009 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, 2009, Google added underwater terrain data for the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Earth now includes US &quot;Third Coast&quot;|url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2009/04/google-earth-now-includes-us-third.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Google added underwater terrain data for [[Lake Baikal]]. 

In June 2011, higher resolution of some deep ocean floor areas increased in focus from 1-kilometer grids to 100 meters thanks to a new synthesis of seafloor topography released through Google Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2814&lt;/ref&gt; The high resolution features were developed by oceanographers at Columbia Universityâs [http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/ Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory] from scientific data collected on research cruises. The sharper focus is available for about 5 percent of the oceans (an area larger than North America). Underwater scenery can be seen of the Hudson Canyon off New York City, the Wini Seamount near Hawaii, and the sharp-edged 10,000-foot-high Mendocino Ridge off the U.S Pacific Coast. There is a Google 2011 Seafloor Tour for those interested in viewing ocean deep terrain.

===Historical Imagery===
Introduced in version 5.0, Historical Imagery allows users to traverse back in time and study earlier stages of any place. This feature allows research that require analysis of past records of various places.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dive into New Google Earth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/dive-into-new-google-earth.html | title = Dive into New Google Earth | accessdate = 2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mars===
{{Main|Google Mars}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Google Mars R Osman.jpg|left|thumb|A high resolution view of [[Victoria Crater]] displayed in 3D using the Mars feature on Google Earth 5]] --&gt;
Google Earth 5 includes a separate globe of the planet Mars, that can be viewed and analysed for research purposes. The maps are of a much higher resolution than those on the browser version of [[Google Mars]] and it also includes 3D renderings of the Martian terrain. There are also some extremely high resolution images from the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'s [[HiRISE]] camera that are of a similar resolution to those of the cities on Earth. Finally, there are many high resolution panoramic images from various Mars landers, such as the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], [[Spirit Rover|Spirit]] and [[Opportunity Rover|Opportunity]], that can be viewed in a similar way to [[Google Street View]]. Interestingly enough, layers on Google Earth (such as World Population Density) can also be applied to Mars. Layers of Mars can also be applied onto Earth.  Mars also has a small application found near the face on Mars.  It is called Meliza, and features a chat between you and an automatic robot speaker.  It is useful for research on Mars, but is not recommended for normal conversations.

===Moon===
{{Main|Google Moon}}
[[File:Google moon 1.jpg|thumb|One of the lunar landers viewed in [[Google Moon]]]]
On July 20, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, Google introduced the Google Earth version of [[Google Moon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2009/07/look_at_the_moon_in_google_earth_-.html |title=Look at the Moon in Google Earth - Available Now! &amp;#124; Google Earth Blog |publisher=Gearthblog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows users to view satellite images of the [[Moon]]. It was announced and demonstrated to a group of invited guests by Google along with [[Buzz Aldrin]] at the [[Newseum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2009/07/google_earth_event_on_july_20th_in.html |title=Google Earth Event on July 20th in DC - Expect the Moon &amp;#124; Google Earth Blog |publisher=Gearthblog.com |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by |url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2009/07/fly-yourself-to-moon.html |title=Google LatLong: Fly yourself to the moon |publisher=Google-latlong.blogspot.com |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Earth Engine===
[[Google Earth Engine]] is a separate product, not a part of Google Earth.

==Influences==
Google Earth can be traced directly back to a small company named [[Autometric]], now a part of [[Boeing]]. Autometric created a visualization product named Edge Whole Earth and demonstrated this to Michael T. Jones. Chris Tanner, and others at SGI in 1996. Several other visualization products using imagery existed at the time, including Performer-based ones, but Michael T. Jones stated emphatically that he had &quot;never thought of the complexities of rendering an entire globe...&quot; The catch phrase &quot;from outer space to in your face&quot; was coined by Autometric President Dan Gordon, and used to explain his concept for personal/local/global range.  Edge blazed a trail as well in broadcasting, being used in 1997 on [[CBS News]] with [[Dan Rather]], in print for rendering large images draped over terrain for National Geographic, and used for special effects in the feature film ''[[Shadow Conspiracy]]'' in 1997. In 2000, Edge Viewer was made available through the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] for free.

Gordon was a huge fan of the âEarthâ program described in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s [[sci-fi]] classic ''[[Snow Crash]]''. Indeed, a Google Earth co-founder claimed that Google Earth was modeled after ''Snow Crash'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/227346.html |title=Google Earth interview |publisher=Web User |date=2008-04-11 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another co-founder said it was inspired by the short science education film ''[[Powers of Ten]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;google_earth1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brownianemotion.org/2006/07/24/notes-on-the-origin-of-google-earth/ |title=Avi Bar-Zeâev (from Keyhole, the precursor to Google Earth) on origin of Google Earth |publisher=Brownianemotion.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Google Earth was at least partly inspired by a [[Silicon Graphics]] demo called &quot;From Outer Space to in Your Face&quot; which zoomed from space into the [[Swiss Alps]] then into the [[Matterhorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bnhsu.wordpress.com/2007/04/30/google-earth-from-space-to-your-face%E2%80%A6and-beyond/ |title=Google Earth: From Space to Your Face...and Beyond |publisher=Bnhsu.wordpress.com |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This launch demo was hosted by an [[SGI Origin 3000 and Onyx 3000|Onyx 3000]] with [[InfiniteReality#InfiniteReality4|InfiniteReality4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/ir_techreport.html |title=Infinite Reality Technical Report |publisher=Futuretech.blinkenlights.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; graphics, which supported [[Clip Mapping]] and was inspired by the hardware texture paging capability (although it did not use the Clip Mapping) and &quot;Powers of Ten&quot;. The first Google Earth implementation called Earth Viewer emerged from [[Intrinsic Graphics]] as a demonstration of Chris Tanner's software based implementation of a [[Clip Mapping]] texture paging system and was spun off as Keyhole Inc. Earth Viewer was the inevitable ultimate realization of the capabilities of a seamless texture paging system and many of the individuals working on Earth Viewer were Silicon Graphics alumni.

==Technical specifications==
Detailed release notes/history/changelog are made available by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=40901 |title=Google Earth Release Notes / Changelog History |publisher=Earth.google.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagery and coordination===
* Coordinate System and Projection
** The internal coordinate system of Google Earth is geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) on the [[WGS84|World Geodetic System]] of 1984 (WGS84) datum.
** Google Earth shows the earth as it looks from an elevated platform such as an airplane or orbiting satellite. The projection used to achieve this effect is called the [[General Perspective Projection|General Perspective]]. This is similar to the [[Orthographic projection (cartography)|Orthographic projection]], except that the point of perspective is a finite (near earth) distance rather than an infinite (deep space) distance.
* Baseline resolutions
** Czech Republic: 0.1 - 0.5 m (by Eurosense / Geodis Brno)
** Slovakia: 0.5 m (by Eurosense / Geodis Slovakia)
** Hungary: 2.5 m SPOT Images. Budapest approx. 0,3 m.
** Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, UK, Andorra, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Vatican City: 1 m or better
** Balkans: 2.5 m (medium resolution)
** U.S.: 1 m (excludes Alaska &amp; Hawaii)
** Global: Generally 15 m (some areas, such as [[Antarctica]], are in extremely low resolution), but this depends on the quality of the satellite/aerial photograph uploaded.
* Typical high resolutions
** Europe: 0.3 m, 0.15 m (e.g. Berlin, [[Zurich]], [[Hamburg]]), 0.1 m [[Prague]]
** U.S.: 1 m, 0.6 m, 0.3 m, 0.15 m (extremely rare; e.g. [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and Google Campus, or [[Glendale, California|Glendale]])
* Altitude resolution:
** Surface: varies by country
** Seabed: Not previously applicable, but since the introduction of &quot;Ocean&quot;, elevation data has been introduced (a colorscale approximating sea floor depth is &quot;printed&quot; on the spherical surface at views from high altitudes).
* Age: Images dates vary. The image data can be seen from squares made when DigitalGlobe Coverage is enabled. The date next to the copyright information is not the correct image date. Zooming in or out could change the date of the pictures. Most of the international urban image dates are from 2004 and have not been updated. However, most US images are kept current. Google announces imagery updates on their LatLong Blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.google.com/sky/skyedu.html |title=Google Earth |publisher=Earth.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in form of a quiz, with hints of the updated locations. The answers are posted some days later in the same blog.

===Hardware and software===
Google Earth is unlikely to operate on older hardware configurations. The most recent system requirements update&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=20701 |title=System Requirements for Google Earth : Getting Started - Google Earth Help |publisher=Earth.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; document these minimum configurations:
* [[Pentium 3]], 500[[MHz]]
* 256 [[Megabyte]]s of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]
* 400 MB free [[hard drive|disk]] space
* Network speed: 128 kbit/s
* 64MB DirectX9 and 3D capable [[graphics card]]
* Resolution of 1024x768, 16-bit High Color - DirectX 9 (to run in Direct X mode)
* [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Linux]] or [[Mac OS X]]

The most likely cause of failure is insufficient video RAM: the software is designed to warn the user if their graphics card is not able to support Earth (this often occurs due to insufficient [[Video RAM]] or buggy graphics card drivers). The next most likely mode of failure is Internet access speed. Fast [[broadband Internet]] (Cable, DSL, T1, etc.) is required.

===Mac version===
A version for [[Mac OS X]] was released on January 10, 2006, and is available for download from the Google Earth website. With a few exceptions noted below, the Mac version appears to be stable and complete, with virtually all the same functionality as the original Windows version.

Screenshots and an actual binary of the Mac version had been leaked to the Internet on December 8, 2005. The leaked version was significantly incomplete. Among other things, neither the Help menu nor its &quot;Display License&quot; feature worked, indicating that this version was intended for Google's internal use only. Google released no statement regarding the leak.

The Mac version runs only under Mac OS X version [[Mac OS X v10.4|10.4]] or later. There is no embedded browser, no direct interface to [[Gmail]] and no full screen option. As of January 2009 there are a few bugs concerning the menu bar when switching between applications and a few bugs concerning annotation balloons and printing.

From version 4.1.7076.4558 (released on May 9, 2007) onward Mac OS X users can, among other new features, upgrade to the &quot;Plus&quot; version via an option in the Google Earth menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/20124|title=Google Earth 4.2.180.1134 - MacUpdate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users reported difficulties with Google Earth crashing in the then current version when zooming in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/postlist.php/Cat/0/Board/SupportGEMac|title=Google Earth Community: Viewing forum: Google Earth for Mac OS X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux version===
Starting with the version 4 beta Google Earth functions under [[Linux]], as a native port using the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt-toolkit]]. It is [[proprietary software]] specifically in order to impose [[Digital Rights Management]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}; the [[Free Software Foundation]] consider the development of a free compatible client for Google Earth to be a [[High Priority Free Software Projects|High Priority Free Software Project]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html FSF.org]: High Priority Free Software Projects&lt;/ref&gt;

===Android version===
An Android version was released on Monday, February 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2010/02/google-earth-now-available-for-android.html |title=Google Earth now available for Android |publisher=google-latlong.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iOS version===
[[File:Google Earth iOS logo.png|thumb|150px|Google Earth iOS version icon]]
A version for the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], which runs on the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and the [[iPad]], was released for free on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] on October 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/10/google-earth-co.html| title=Google Earth Comes to the iPhone|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''| date=2008-10-27|last=Sorrel|first=Charlie| accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2008/10/google-earth-now-available-for-iphone.html| title=Google Earth now available for the iPhone|publisher=Google Mobile team| date=2008-10-27| accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes use of the [[multi-touch]] interface to move on the globe, zoom or rotate the view, and allow to select the current location using the iPhone integrated [[Assisted GPS]]. This version, however, does not feature layers like computer versions do. Like Google Maps, it only integrates the Wikipedia and Panoramio layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2008/10/google_earth_for_the_iphone_release.html |title=Google Earth for the iPhone Released! &amp;#124; Google Earth Blog |publisher=Gearthblog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Earth Plus===
Discontinued in December 2008, Google Earth Plus was an individual-oriented paid subscription upgrade to Google Earth that provided customers with the following features, most of which are now available in the free Google Earth:
* [[GPS]] integration: read tracks and waypoints from a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] device. A variety of third party applications have been created which provide this functionality using the basic version of Google Earth by generating KML or KMZ files based on user-specified or user-recorded waypoints. However, Google Earth Plus provides direct support for the [[Thales Navigation|Magellan]] and [[Garmin]] product lines, which together hold a large share of the GPS market.&lt;br&gt; The Linux version of the Google Earth Plus application does not include any GPS functionality.
* Higher resolution printing.
* Customer support via email.
* Data importer: read address points from [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] files; limited to 100 points/addresses. A feature allowing path and polygon annotations, which can be exported to [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], was formerly only available to Plus users, but was made free in version 4.0.2416.
* Higher data download speeds

===Google Earth Pro===
For a $399 annual subscription fee, Google Earth Pro is a business-oriented upgrade to Google Earth that has more features than the Plus version. The Pro version includes add-on software such as:
* Movie making.
* GIS data importer.
* Advanced printing modules.
* Radius and area measurements
Originally, these features cost extra in addition to the $399 fee, but more recently{{when|date=June 2011}} have been included in the package.

Unlike the free version of Google Earth, the professional version does not work on Linux.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Google Earth Enterprise===
Google Earth Enterprise is a version of Google Earth designed for use by organizations whose businesses could take advantage of the program's capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://earth.google.com/enterprise/earth_enterprise.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automotive version===
An automotive version of Google Earth is available in 2010 in the new [[Audi A8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Redmer |first=Jens |url=http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-audi-take-google-services-in-car.html |title=Google LatLong: Google &amp; Audi take Google services in a car to the next level in the new Audi A8 |publisher=Google-latlong.blogspot.com |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Google Earth Plug-in==
The Google Earth API is a free beta service, available for any web site that is free to consumers. The Plug-in and its JavaScript API allows users to place a version of Google Earth into web pages. The API does not have all the features of the full Google Earth Application but enables sophisticated 3D map applications to be built.

The Google Earth Plug-in is currently available for the following web browsers and operating systems:

Microsoft Windows (2000, XP, Vista, and 7)
* Google Chrome 1.0+
* Internet Explorer 6.0+
* Firefox 2.0+
* Flock 1.0+

Apple Mac OS X 10.4 and higher (Intel and PowerPC)
* Safari 3.1+
* Firefox 3.0+

To date the plug-in supports the following layers:
* Terrain
* Roads
* Buildings
* Borders
* 3-D Buildings

It also supports 'Sky Mode', 'Photo Overlays', and provides much of the same controls and information bar as the full application.

==Imagery resolution and accuracy==
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2011}}
[[Image:Google Scilly.jpg|thumb|The [[Isles of Scilly]], showing the very low resolution of some islands. The islands (green area) are about 10 km across. (This is now improved.){{Coord|49|56|10.81|N|6|19|22.88|W|region:GB_type:isle|name=Low resolution Isles of Scilly}}]]
[[Image:GoogleGib.jpg|thumb|The west side of [[Gibraltar]] ([[UK]]), tilted view showing the sea rising up the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] - claimed altitude of the sea just off the beach at Elliots Memorial, 252 m. This is now fixed. {{Coord|36|6|59.6|N|5|21|5.2|W|name=Water altitude problem in Google Earth}}]]
[[Image:Earth 20100324 1728h.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Tamalpais]], detail of parcel-scale 40cm-gridded terrain in good registration with 30cm-pixel aerial photo. {{Coord|37.9561|N|122.5682|W}}]]

Most land areas are covered in satellite imagery with a resolution of about 15 m per pixel. This base imagery is 30m [[multispectral]] [[Landsat]] which is [[Pansharpened image|pansharpened]] with the 15m [panchromatic] [[Landsat]] imagery. However, Google is actively replacing this base imagery with 2.5m [[Spot Image|SPOTImage]] imagery and several higher resolution datasets mentioned below. Some population centers are also covered by aircraft imagery ([[orthophoto]]graphy) with several pixels per meter. Oceans are covered at a much lower resolution, as are a number of islands; notably, the [[Isles of Scilly]] off southwest [[United Kingdom]] were at a resolution of about 500 m or less, although this has since been addressed.

Google has resolved many inaccuracies in the vector mapping since the original public release of the software, without requiring an update to the program itself. An example of this was the absence from Google Earth's map boundaries of the [[Nunavut]] territory in Canada, a territory that had been created on April 1, 1999; this mistake was corrected by one of the data updates in early 2006. Recent updates have also increased the coverage of detailed aerial photography, particularly in certain areas of western and central Europe.

The images are not all taken at the same time, but are generally current to within three years. However, with the release of Google Earth 5.0, it has historical images dating back to the 1940s in some spots. Image sets are sometimes not correctly stitched together. Updates to the photographic database can occasionally be noticed when drastic changes take place in the appearance of the landscape, for example Google Earth's incomplete updates of [[New Orleans]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]], or when placemarks appear to shift unexpectedly across the Earth's surface. Though the placemarks have not in fact moved, the imagery is composed and stitched differently. Such an update to London's photography in early 2006 created shifts of 15â20 metres in many areas, noticeable because the resolution is so high.

Place name and road detail vary greatly from place to place. They are most accurate in North America, Europe and Australia, but regular mapping updates are improving coverage elsewhere.

Errors sometimes occur due to the technology used to measure the height of terrain; for example, tall buildings in [[Adelaide]], Australia cause one part of the city to be rendered as a small mountain, when it is in fact flat. Also, in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], there is a large hill in the approximate location of [[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]], where many of the skyscrapers are located. The height of the [[Eiffel Tower]] creates a similar effect in the rendering of Paris.  Also, prior to the release of version 5.0 in February 2009, elevations below sea level were presented as sea level, for example: [[Salton City, California]]; [[Badwater Basin|Death Valley]]; and the [[Dead Sea]] were all listed as 0&amp;nbsp;m when Salton City is â38&amp;nbsp;m, Death Valley â86&amp;nbsp;m, and the Dead Sea â420&amp;nbsp;m.

Where no 3 [[minute of arc|arc second]] [[digital elevation model|digital elevation data]] was available, the three dimensional images covering some areas of high relief are not at all accurate, but most mountain areas are now well mapped. The underlying digital elevation model has been placed 3 [[minute of arc|arc seconds]] too far north and up to 3 arc seconds too far west. This means that some steep mountain ridges incorrectly appear to have shadows extending over onto their south facing sides. Some high resolution images have also been misplaced:  an example is the image covering [[Annapurna]], which is misplaced by about 12 arc seconds. Elevation data was recently{{when|date=June 2011}} updated to 10-meter (1/3-arc-second) resolution for much of the United States from the previous 30-meter (1-arc-second) resolution.

In some areas, local government jurisdictions have submitted more finely gridded terrain models through the Map Content Partners program.&lt;ref name=&quot;MapContentPartners&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/submityourcontent/public_sector.html| title=Google Map Content Partners, Public Sector/Non-profit | accessdate=2010-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2010, the County of Marin, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge by San Francisco, California, published a 40&amp;nbsp;cm gridded terrain surface of 1425&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; through the program.

The &quot;Measure&quot; function shows that the length of [[equator]] is about 40,030.24&amp;nbsp;km, giving an error of â0.112% compared with the actual value of 40,075.02&amp;nbsp;km Earth; for the [[meridian (geography)|meridional]] circumference, it shows a length of about 39,963.13&amp;nbsp;km, also giving an error of â0.112% compared with the actual value of 40,007.86&amp;nbsp;km.

On December 16, 2007, most of Antarctica was updated to a 15&amp;nbsp;m resolution using imagery from the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (1&amp;nbsp;m resolution images of some parts of Antarctica were added in June 2007); however, the Arctic [[polar ice cap]] is completely absent from the current version of Google Earth, as are waves in the oceans. The geographic [[North Pole]] is found hovering over the Arctic Ocean and the tiling system produces [[visual artifact|artifacts]] near the poles as the tiles become 'infinitely' small and rounding errors accumulate.

Cloud cover and shadows can make it difficult or impossible to see details in some land areas, including the shadow side of mountains.

Some parts of the world have still not been photographed. Very low resolution photos or false color photos indicate that the area has not been photographed. On Google Earth 6.0 it is easy to see areas that are not photographed by simply clicking the Historical imagery option on.

==Controversy and criticism==
The software has been criticized by a number of [[special interest group]]s, including national officials, as being an [[invasion of privacy]] and even posing a threat to [[national security]]. The typical argument is that the software provides information about military or other critical installations that could be used by [[terrorist]]s. 
* Former [[President of India|President]] of [[India]] [[APJ Abdul Kalam]] expressed concern over the availability of high-resolution pictures of sensitive locations in [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IndianPresCrit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techtree.com/techtree/jsp/article.jsp?article_id=68712&amp;cat_id=582| title=Kalam Concerned Over Google Earth | accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google subsequently agreed to censor such sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Google_Earth_agrees_to_blur_pix_of_key_Indian_sites/articleshow/1559236.cms|title=Google Earth agrees to blur pix of key Indian sites | work=The Times Of India | first1=Rajeev|last1=Deshpande|date=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2009, Google superimposed old [[woodblock prints]] of maps from 18th and 19th century [[Japan]] over Japan today.

Descendants of members of the burakumin caste still face discrimination today and many Japanese people feared that some would use these areas, labeled ''[[etamura]]'' (ç©¢å¤æ, ''translation: &quot;village of an abundance of defilement&quot;&quot;''), to target current inhabitants of them. These maps are still visible on Google Earth, but with the label removed where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6337499.ece &quot;Google Earth maps out discrimination against burakumin caste in Japan&quot;], The Times Online, May 2009.

[[Image:Royal Stables.jpg|thumb|right|Blurred out image of the Royal Stables in [[The Hague]], Netherlands. This has since been partially lifted.]]
Some citizens may express concerns over aerial information depicting their properties and residences being disseminated freely. As relatively few jurisdictions actually guarantee the individual's [[right to privacy]], as opposed to the state's right to secrecy, this is an evolving but minor point.
Perhaps aware of these critiques,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spatiallaw.blogspot.com/2008/04/privacy-lawsuit-against-google-earth.html Privacy Lawsuit Against Google Earth], Spatial Law blog, 2008-04-09
&lt;/ref&gt; for a time, Google had [[Area 51]] (which is highly visible and easy to find) in Nevada as a default placemark when Google Earth is first installed.

As a result of pressure from the [[United States government]], the residence of the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] at [[Number One Observatory Circle]] was obscured through [[pixelization]] in Google Earth and [[Google Maps]] in 2006, but has since been lifted. The usefulness of this downgrade is questionable, as high-resolution photos and aerial surveys of the property are readily available on the Internet elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeball-series.org/veep-eyeball.htm|title=Eyeballing the US Vice Presidential Residence}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capitol Hill]] used to also be pixelized in this way, but this was lifted. The Royal Stables in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] used to be pixelized as well, but was partially lifted. If one zooms in too close to the Stables, it is still pixelized.

Critics have expressed concern over the willingness of Google to cripple their dataset to cater to special interests, believing that intentionally obscuring any land goes against its stated goal of letting the user &quot;point and zoom to any place on the planet that you want to explore&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geospace.co.uk/files/Zook_Graham_2007_Geoforum.pdf|title=The Creative Reconstruction of the Internet: Google and the Privatization of Cyberspace and DigiPlace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], critics have also argued that Google Earth has led to the vandalism of private property, highlighting the [[graffiti]] of a [[penis]] being drawn on the roof of a house near [[Hungerford]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2009/mar/24/penis-drawing-roof-google &quot;Teenager's 60ft painting of penis on parents' roof spotted in space&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 29/05/2010&lt;/ref&gt; on the roof of [[Yarm School]] at [[Stockton on Tees]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article75115.ece &quot;The Piddler On The Roof&quot;], ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'', accessed 29/05/2010&lt;/ref&gt; and on the playing fields of a school in [[Southampton]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/jan/31/schools.uk1 &quot;Schoolyard penis seen from space&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 29/05/2010&lt;/ref&gt; as examples of this.

In [[Hazleton, Pennsylvania|Hazleton]], [[Pennsylvania]], media attention and critics focused on Google Earth once more because of the defacing of the Hazleton Area Highschool Football field.  Grass was removed to create the image of a penis approximately 35 yards long and 20 yards wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nepamedia.blogspot.com/2007/12/hazleton-penis-made-famous-by-google.html |title=Hazleton Penis Made Famous by Google Maps |publisher=nepamedia blogspot.com |accessdate= 2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent versions of Google Earth require a software component running in the background that will automatically download and install updates. Several users expressed concerns that there is not an easy way to disable this updater, as it currently runs without the permission of the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/02/why-googles-sof/|title=Why Google's Software Update Tool Is Evil}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2011}}

==Copyright==
Currently, every image created from Google Earth using satellite data provided by Google Earth is a [[copyright]]ed map. Any derivative from Google Earth is made from copyrighted data which, under [[United States Copyright Law]], may not be used except under the licenses Google provides. Google allows [[non-commercial]] personal use of the images (e.g. on a personal website or blog) as long as copyrights and attributions are preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Google Earth Help Center:  |url=http://earth.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=21422 |title=Can I post images to the web?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By contrast, images created with NASA's globe software [[NASA World Wind|World Wind]] use [[The Blue Marble]], [[Landsat]] or USGS layer, each of which is a terrain layer in the [[public domain]]. Works created by an agency of the United States government are public domain at the moment of creation. This means that those images can be freely modified, redistributed and used for [[Commerce|commercial]] purposes.

==Layers==
Google Earth also features many layers as a source for information on businesses and points of interest, as well as showcasing the contents of many communities, such as [[Wikipedia]], [[Panoramio]] and [[YouTube]]. Google updates with new layers often. Many Google Earth layers, such as Panoramio and Google Earth Community layers, are updated daily with entries from the respective websites.

===Borders and labels===
Contains borders for countries/provinces and shows placemarks for cities and towns.
* [[Border]]s: ''Marks international borders with a thick yellow line, 1st level administrative borders (generally [[province]]s and [[State (administrative division)|states]]) with a [[lavender (color)|lavender]] line, and 2nd level administrative borders ([[county|counties]]) with a [[cyan]] line. Coastlines appear as a thin yellow line. Displays names of [[country|countries]], 1st level administrative areas, and islands.''
* Labels: ''Displays labels for large bodies of water, such as oceans, seas, and bays, and populated places.''

===Places of interest===
A collection of business listings provided by many local services.

===Panoramio===
Shows many of the most relevant pictures uploaded onto Panoramio's website

===Roads===
Displays available road networks. The colors and signs displayed vary depending on the type of roadway.
* [[limited-access road|Limited-access]] [[freeway]]s and [[tollway]]s that are part of widespread networks such as the [[International E-road network]], United States [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]] and many other national road networks are represented by orange lines.
* Other freeways are marked with pale orange lines.
* Some roads in Japan are indigo.
* Other important roads, generally those most travelled, highest capacity, or bearing a [[road number]], are labeled with yellow lines.
* All other roads are labeled white.
* Some [[pedestrian]] walkways and [[private road]]s are signified by [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] white lines, especially when greatly resembling a road intended for public automotive traffic.

===Buildings in 3D===
{{See|SketchUp|Google 3D Warehouse}}
Shows many [[3D modeling|3D]] [[3D computer graphics|computer]] [[building model]]s in many cities, in these styles:
* Photorealistic: ''Shows many buildings in a realistic style, with more complex polygons and surface images.''
* Gray: ''Low-detail models of city buildings designed for computers that may not have the capability of showing the photorealistic models.''

Any real world building can be created for Google Earth via a number of avenues:
* Users can create their own 3D buildings with [[Google Building Maker|Building Maker]]. This browser based tool allows users to match 'boxes' to aerial imagery of certain cities. Low learning curve resulting in lower quality 3D buildings.
* Users can download [[SketchUp]] a 3D modeling application that allows users to create detailed digital representations of real world buildings. Provided the models meet Google's criteria, they can then be uploaded to the 3D warehouse and accepted to Google Earth
*There are now several companies, certified by Google,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1G1ACAWCENNZ334&amp;=&amp;q=google+certifie+geo+developers&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1G1ACAWCENNZ334&amp;q=google+certified+geo+developers&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;psj=1&amp;fp=9bef8cda26d1a6ec&lt;/ref&gt; that provide a service creating and maintaining 3D buildings for customers. These companies generally provide high detail models.

In 2009, in a unique collaboration between Google and the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]], the museum selected 14 of its most important paintings to be photographed and displayed at the ultrahigh resolution of 14,000 [[megapixel]]s inside the 3D version of the Prado in Google Earth and [[Google Maps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2009/jan/14/museums-internet-google-earth-prado|title=Online gallery zooms in on Prado's masterpieces (even the smutty bits)|author=[[Giles Tremlett]]|date=14 January 2009|newspaper=The Guardian | location=London|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/prado/|title=The Prado in Google Earth|accessdate=2010-04-03|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Street View===
{{main|Google Street View}}
Shows placemarks with 360 degree [[panoramic]] views of streets of many cities in Australia, France, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the United States, and recently{{when|date=June 2011}} Portugal, [[Brazil]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Taiwan]], Switzerland, Canada, Mexico, Sweden, Norway, South Africa and Finland.
