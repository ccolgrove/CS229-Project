'''Samir Kassir''' (Ø³ÙÙØ± ÙØµÙØ± in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) (May 5, 1960 &amp;ndash; June 2, 2005) was a Lebanese professor of history at [[l'UniversitÃ© Saint-Joseph|Saint-Joseph University]] and [[journalist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/bo1.htm al-Ahram] 19â25 August 2004 Issue No. 704 ''The not so sick man of Europe'' By Rasha Salti&lt;/ref&gt; Born to a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] father and a [[Syrian people|Syrian]] mother, &lt;ref name=&quot;SKnet&quot;&gt;[http://www.samirkassir.net/ Samir Kassir.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Kassir received his degree in philosophy and political philosophy in 1984, in 1990, Kassir earned his PhD in Modern History also from the University of Sorbonne.&lt;ref name=&quot;SKnet&quot;/&gt; He held both Lebanese and French nationality. A prominent left-wing activist, he was a strong advocate of freedom for the Palestinians, democracy in Lebanon and [[Syria]] and a vocal critic of the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syrian presence in Lebanon]]. He was assassinated on 2 June 2005 and his murderers remain unknown. A French investigation is currently underway but its results have yet to be released. Kassir was a keen advocate of secular democracy in the Middle East.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot; ... What [Arab-American] reconciliation needs, if the United States were really willing to reach such reconciliation, is first [America's] revision of its understanding of Arab democracy, which has been restricted until now, to the American convention that mandates Arabs give up their pan-Arab ties... and the issues that steer their feelings most, on top of them the Palestinian issue ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SKnet&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life==
Samir Kassir's journalistic career began when he was a seventeen year old [[secondary school]] student at the ''LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais de Beyrouth'', with unsigned contributions to the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] newspaper ''Al-NidÄ'''. The same year, he began contributing to the French-language daily ''[[L'Orient-Le Jour]]'', one of Lebanon's principal newspapers.

From 1981 to 2000, he contributed to the French international political review ''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]''. In 1982 and 1983 he edited the newsletter ''Le Liban en Lutte'' (Struggling Lebanon), which was dedicated to the Lebanese resistance against the [[Israel]]i occupation. In 1984 he gained a DEA (roughly equivalent to a [[Master's degree]] in the British university system) in philosophy and political philosophy from the UniversitÃ© de Paris I. From 1984 to 1985 he edited the weekly ''Al-Yawm as-SÄbi`'', and from 1986 to 2004 he was a member of the editorial board of the ''Revue des Etudes Palestiniennes'', the French-language journal of the [[Institute for Palestine Studies]]. From 1988 to 1989 he contributed to the London-based pan-Arab daily ''[[Al-Hayat]]''. 

Samir Kassir obtained his PhD in modern and contemporary history from the UniversitÃ© de Paris IV in 1990, with a thesis on the [[Lebanese Civil War]].  His books, in French and Arabic, include a history of Beirut and a study of the Lebanese Civil War. He also co-authored a book about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and Palestinian-French relations. In 1995 he founded a new monthly political and cultural review, ''L'Orient-L'Express'', which he edited until it ceased publication in 1998, from lack of interest and pressure from the advertising industry. From that year on he was a professor at the &quot;Institut des sciences politiques de l'UniversitÃ© Saint-Joseph&quot; in Beirut.

It was also in 1998 that Kassir became an editorial writer for the daily ''[[Al-Nahar]]'' newspaper. He became widely known for his popular weekly column in which he wrote strong articles against the pro-Syrian regime. He also made frequent appearances on several television stations as a political analyst on news programs. 

Known for his unrelenting courage, Kassir was unafraid of expressing trenchant opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/766/cu2.htm al-Ahram] ''A journalist apart'' Kenneth Brown remembers Lebanese writer and journalist Samir Kassir&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated [[democracy]] in both Lebanon and Syria, and continuously spoke for the rights of the Palestinians. He recognised courage and determination in others and took under his wing leading young pro-democracy and human rights activists such as [[Wissam Tarif]], with whom Kassir developed a warm and close friendship. It was his non-compromising views on the [[Ba'ath]] regime that many believe led to his assassination.

He maintained a keen and sympathetic interest in Syria despite his criticism of its involvement in Lebanon, and was on close terms with many Syrian intellectuals, including those involved in the [[Damascus Spring]]. He was a founding member of the [[Democratic Left (Lebanon)|Democratic Left Movement]], which won a seat in the Lebanese parliamentary elections of 2005. Kassir and the [[Democratic Left (Lebanon)|party]] he helped establish were both very influential in triggering the popular upheavals following Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]]'s killing.  

Kassir's last book in Arabic concerned the &quot;Damascus Spring&quot; and the consequences for Lebanon of Syrian political developments; Syrian dissident film-maker [[Omar Amiralay]] penned its introduction. Before his assassination, he was working on another book about the &quot;Beirut Spring&quot; that aimed to discuss the recent momentous developments in Lebanon, that was supposed to be published by Actes Sud. In February 2006 a book was published with the same title, by Actes Sud, but contained translations of Arabic articles written mainly after Hariri's [[assassination]].

Samir Kassir was a [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Orthodox]] married to [[Giselle Khoury]], a talk-show host on [[Al-Arabiya]] television. He is survived by two daughters, Mayssa and Liana, from a previous marriage.

His wife, prominent TV presenter [[Giselle Khoury]], and a group of Kassirâs friends, students and colleagues from l'Orient Express, including writer [[Elias Khoury (writer)|Elias Khoury]], created the [[Samir Kassir Foundation]]. One of the foundationâs objectives would be translating his works into [[English language|English]], Italian, and Norwegian.

A special edition of [[l'Orient Express]] was published in November 2005, to celebrate its tenth anniversary, under the title &quot;The Unfinished Spring&quot; and was dedicated in memory of Kassir. This project was initially Kassir's idea who was working on it before he was assassinated.

A square in downtown [[Beirut]], behind the Annahar building, was named in Kassirâs honor. The [[Samir Kassir Foundation]] erected a bronze statue of the journalist there on June 2, 2006, exactly a year after his assassination.

==Assassination==

Kassir was [[assassination|assassinated]] using a [[car bomb]] in [[Beirut]] on June 2, 2005. The investigation into his assassination is still underway, but no one has been indicted yet. Since Kassir had been constantly receiving threats from Lebanese and Syrian [[Intelligence Officers]], there is widespread speculation in Lebanon that the perpetrators were the Lebanese-Syrian security apparatus or remnants of this force (as Syria has claimed that all its intelligence officers were out of Lebanon; in addition, the head of the Lebanese security forces had resigned). The Syrian government has denied these charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050603/ai_n14652436 Independent] Jun 3, 2005 ''Syria's troops have gone. So who killed Samir, Lebanon's fearless'' by Robert Fisk&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was widespread [[condemnation]] for the killing and many prominent opposition figures blaming the blast on the Lebanese and Syrian regimes. Among them were Hariri's son, [[Saad Hariri|Saad]], who said &quot;the blood-stained hands that assassinated Rafiq Hariri are the same ones that assassinated Samir Kassir.&quot; Moreover, [[Elias Atallah]], Secretary General of the Democratic Left Movement, urged his allies on March 14 to march to the presidential palace and remove president Lahoud.  However, the calls remained unanswered.  Years later, March 14 allies admitted that had Lahoud been removed, Lebanon would have been spared the later political assassinations.

Kassir was among the first victims in the growing list of political assassinations that have occurred in Lebanon in the past few years.  These began with the attempted assassination of [[Marwan Hamadeh]] and followed with the killing of [[RafÄ«q HarÄ«rÄ«|Rafiq al-Hariri]], the former Prime Minister. After Kassir, [[George Hawi]], the former head of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] was targeted by another car-bomb; this was followed by failed assassination attempts at former Interior Minister and former Syrian ally [[Elias Murr]] and popular [[LBCI]] TV anchorwoman and journalist [[May Chidiac]] who survived, but lost an arm and leg. On the 12th of December, Samir Kassir's colleague, [[An-Nahar]] chief editor, and top anti-Syria legislator [[Gebran Tueni]], was killed by a car bomb. [[Pierre Amine Gemayel]], the former Minister of Industry, was another victim in the series of assassinations. Gemayel was travelling in his car when gunmen opened fire in broad daylight. MP   [[Walid Eido]] from the Hariri-led Future movement was killed  near the Military Bath of Beirut on June 13, 2007, when leaving his gym club. Shortly afterwards, MP [[Antoine Ghanem]] of the Lebanese [[Phalanges Party]] (aka [[Kataeb Party]]), was killed in another car bomb on September 19, 2007 in the Sin al-Fil suburb of Beirut. Shortly afterwards, second-in-command of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]], General [[FranÃ§ois al-Hajj]] was killed in the military-secured suburb of Baabda on December 12, 2007. One month  later, security chief and top Lebanese investigator into the International Tribunal for the Hariri assassination was killed in January 2008. Many have blamed [[Syria]] for all the recent assassinations of its opponents.
