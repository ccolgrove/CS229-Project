'''Cornish Australians''' are citizens of Australia whose ancestry originates in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom, one of the six [[Celtic Nations]]. They form part of the worldwide [[Cornish diaspora]] which also includes large numbers of people in the [[Cornish American|US]], Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Mexico and many Latin American countries. Cornish Australians are thought to make up around 4.3 per cent of the Australian population and are thus one of the largest ethnic groups in Australia.

Cornish people first arrived in Australia with [[Captain Cook]], most notably [[Zachary Hickes]], and there were some Cornish convicts on the [[First Fleet]], [[James Ruse]], [[Mary Bryant]], along with several of the early governors. The creation of South Australia, with its emphasis on being free of convicts and religious discrimination, was championed by many Cornish religious dissenting groups and Cornish people comprised a sizeable proportion of settlers to that colony. Large scale Cornish emigration to Australia did not begin until the 1840s, coinciding with the Cornish potato famine and slumps in the Cornish mining industry. The gold rushes and copper booms were major draws on Cornish people, not just from Cornwall itself, but also from other countries where they had previously settled.

In recent years the story of the ''Lost Children of Cornwall'', child migrants sent from Cornwall to Australia up until the early 1970s, has come under intense scrutiny. The practice of sending apparently unwanted or orphaned Cornish children abroad continued long after it had ceased, after being discredited, in other areas. It has been the subject of apologies by both the Australian and British prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/8488113.stm | work=BBC News | title=Boys moved after migration stop | date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number of Cornish Australians==
A 1996 study by Dr. Charles Price gives the total ethnic strength of Cornish Australians as 269,500 with a total population of 768,100. This is made up by 22,600 of un-mixed origin and 745,500 of mixed origin and equates to 4.3 percent of the Australian population.&lt;ref&gt;Jupp, James. The Australian People: An Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and Their Origins, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the Cornish the fourth largest [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] group in Australia after the [[English Australian|English]], [[Irish Australian|Irish]] and [[Scottish Australian|Scottish]], and the fifth largest ethnic group in Australia.

Approximately 10 percent of the population of South Australia, and over 3 percent of Australia as a whole, has significant [[Cornish people|Cornish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busby.net/cawa/culture.html Cornish Association of Western Australia Inc â Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1986 Australian Census 15,000 people reported their ancestry as Cornish,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;/&gt; however, no figure from the 2006 Australian census has been published as to how many reported their ancestry as such in that year.

In 2011 a campaign was launched to increase the number of people writing in their Cornish ancestry on the [[Census in Australia#2011|2011 Austalian Census]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cornwall24.net/economy/australian-census-2011-yes-the-cornish-count/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cornishaustralian.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
===Festivals===
The Cornish who moved to Australia brought with them many festivities and holidays. The most important being at Christmas and Midsummer.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall&lt;/ref&gt;

* Christmas, amongst other things they would bring greenery inside their houses and sing their traditional carols.
* [[Midsummer]], 24 June, was traditionally celebrated with fire. Cornish Australians used large amounts of fireworks, described as ''enough to bombard a town'', as well as numerous bonfires. As it was a observed as a general holiday large numbers of community events also took place, including many sporting events, concerts, parades and tea-treats.
* The [[Duke of Cornwall]]'s birthday was observed as a general holiday.
* [[Whit Monday]] was believed to be a more important celebration than the Queen's birthday.
* [[St Piran]]'s Day was celebrated during the early days in South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Payton, Philip, The Cornish Overseas, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kernewek Lowender]] ([[Cornish language|Cornish]] for &quot;Cornish happiness&quot;), held biennially since 1973 in the South Australian towns of [[Moonta, South Australia|Moonta]], [[Kadina, South Australia|Kadina]] and [[Wallaroo, South Australia|Wallaroo]], is the largest Cornish festival in the world, attracting tens of thousands of visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southaustralia.com/9008021.aspx |title=Kernewek Lowender |work=SouthAustralia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been four Cornish festivals held in the City of [[Bendigo]] since 2002. The most recent was held at [[Eaglehawk, Victoria|Eaglehawk]] in March 2010 and was entitled 'Welcome Back Cousin Jack'(We welcome you 'One and All').&lt;ref name=&quot;londoncornish1&quot;&gt;http://www.londoncornish.co.uk/pdfs/spring10.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and drink===
[[Cornish cuisine|Cornish food]] like the [[Cornish pasty]] is still popular amongst the Cornish Australian communities. Former premier of South Australia, [[Don Dunstan]], once took part in a pasty-making contest. [[Copper Coast Wines|Swanky beer]] and [[saffron cake]] were very popular in the past and have been revitalised by Kernewek Lowender and the Cornish Associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwall24.net/magazine/kernewek-lowender-%E2%80%93-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-cornish-festival/ Kernewek Lowender â the Worldâs Largest Cornish Festival &amp;#124; Cornwall 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s Henry Madren Leggo, whose parents came from St Just, Cornwall, began making vinegar, pickles, sauces, cordials and other grocery goods based on his motherâs traditional recipes. His company, now known as Leggo's, is wrongly believed by many to be Italian.&lt;ref name=&quot;londoncornish1&quot;/&gt;

Angove Family Winemakers, formerly Angove's, was founded by Dr W.T. Angove, a Cornish doctor who migrated to South Australia with his family in 1886. He planted vines in the outer Adelaide suburb of Tea Tree Gully, though 125 years on most of its wines are based on Riverland grapes. They have recently started producing wines from their new vineyard purchased in  2002 in McLaren Vale. The distribution company wholesales not only Angove wines and St Agnes Brandy but also Nicolas Feuillatte Champagne and a dozen other companies' wines and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/top-drop/value-goes-upmarket-20110604-1flq4.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Gorsedh Kernow]] make frequent visits to Australia, and there are a number of Cornish Australian bards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~kevrenor/gorseth.html The Bards Of The Gorsedh Of Cornwall In Australia Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

South Australian [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]], particularly the [[Nunga]], are said to speak English with a Cornish accent due to the fact that they were taught English by Cornish miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=Peter|title=Postvocalic R in an Australian English Dialect.|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics|year=1989|month=june|volume=9|issue=1|pages=161â163|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ470834&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ470834|accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitner|first=Gerhard|title=The habitat of Australia's Aboriginal languages :|year=2007|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110190793|pages=170|url=http://hooke.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/bib_seek.cgi?cat=ul&amp;bib=4358253}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most large towns in South Australia had newspapers at least partially in Cornish dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Adolphe Wurm, Peter MÃ¼hlhÃ¤usler, Darrell T.

===Literature===
Not Only in Stone by Phyllis Somerville is the story of emigrant Cornishwoman, Polly Thomas, who faces many trials and tribulations in the pioneering era of South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wakefieldpress.com.au/product.php?productid=575&amp;cat=15&amp;page=6&lt;/ref&gt; The book won the South Australian Centenary novel award in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/8187681&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Cornish culture|Cornish]] Christmas carols are still traditionally sung in parts of Australia, just like in [[Grass Valley, California]]. Cornish Australians have a place in the transnational Cornish carol writing tradition. ''The Christmas Welcome: A Choice Collection of Cornish Carols,'' published at Moonta in 1893, was one of several such collections published between 1890 and 1925 from [[Polperro]] to [[Johannesburg]].  The Cornish also used to decorate their houses with greenery for Christmas, a tradition that was transported with them to Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Cornish [[male voice choir]]s and [[brass bands]] were once a popular part of Cornish Australian culture, but this has waned somewhat.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; [[File:Gerry and Ashley Cawley.JPG|right|thumb|Two Cornish wrestlers]]

[[File:Moonta2.JPG|Robert Street Methodist Church, Moonta|250px|thumb|left]]

===Religion===
Many Cornish settlers in Australia were [[Methodist]] and many chapels were built in the places that they settled. Others were [[Anglican]], while few were Roman Catholic. Their Methodism was a badge of distinctive Cornishness and also gave them their trade unionist convictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Most of the 22000 Wesleyan Methodists, 6000 Primitive Methodists and more than 6000 Bible Christians in South Australia in 1866 were Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Leitner, Australia's many voices:
Australian Englishâthe national language, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===
There has been much involvement of Cornish Australians in sport over the years. Many playing rugby and cricket at an international level. This has led to the Cornish chant of &quot;Oggie, Oggie, Oggie, Oi, Oi, Oi,&quot; taken on by all Australians as &quot;Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/expats/expats-newsletter/page.cfm?objectid=18098816&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082 Oggy! chant 'came from Cornwall' â Newsletter â Expats â WalesOnline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cornish took some of their own sports with them to Australia. [[Cornish wrestling]] matches were a regular occurrence, held at festivities throughout the year, particularly Midsummer, Easter and Christmas. Thousands attended these contests, which were sometimes spread over several days and with wrestlers representing different mining regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Politics==
The Cornish miners founded the first trade unions, and were instrumental in the formation of the [[Australian Labor Party]].The first  Labor party minority government in Tasmania (1909) was led by premier [[John Earle (Australian politician)|John Earle]]. The first  Labor party majority government in South Australia (1910â12) was led by premier [[John Verran]], a Cornishman from Gwennap. The first Labor party majority government in Western Australia (1911â16) was led by premier [[John Scaddan]], a Cornishman from Moonta. Sir Robert Menzies founded the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1944.

[[File:John Quick.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]], Father of the Australian Federation]]
There have been many other Australian politicians of Cornish birth or descent. Some of these are listed below, starting with perhaps the most important, Sir John Quick, Founding Father of the Australian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop42/stephen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Settlers===

During the 18th Century many Cornishmen were employed by the Royal Navy. People like Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] and [[Edward Pellew]], conscious of their Cornish identity, recruited heavily from their fellow Cornishmen. [[Samuel Wallis]], from Lanteglos-by-Camelford, was one of Boscawen's protÃ©gÃ©s and the first European to discover [[Easter Island]] and [[Tahiti]] in 1767. Cornish naval officers played a major role in the early years of the Australian colony.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Payton, Philip. The Cornish Overseas, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Zachary Hicks]] â When [[Captain Cook]] arrived in Tahiti in June 1769, to observe the transit of Venus, his second-in-command was the Cornishman Lieutenant Zachary Hicks. After six months charting the coast of New Zealand, Cook headed west in search of New Holland as Australia was then known. It was at first light on 19 April 1770 that Hicks spotted land ahead, so it is that the most south-eastern tip of Australia is called [[Point Hicks]]. Cook hugged the coast until they arrived at [[Botany Bay]], where again Hicks came to the forefront. Rowing ashore in two jolly boats, he was the first of the party to set foot on Australian soil.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[File:Gov Davey's proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|Governor Arthurâs proclamation c. 1828â1830, the Arthur family were Cornish&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010034b.htm Arthur, Sir George (1784â1854) Biographical Entry â Australian Dictionary of Biography Online]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Governors====
After its founding in 1788 two of the first Governors of the New South Wales colony were Cornish.

[[Philip Gidley King]] â 3rd Governor, who arrived on the First Fleet as First Lieutenant in Captain Phillips' ship. One of those who went ashore to look for water, he had his first encounter with the [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigines]], offering them beads and mirrors. Botany Bay proving a disappointment, King recommended the location at [[Port Jackson]] as an alternative. Ralph Clark, an officer of Marines, compared the new location with the [[River Tamar]] in Cornwall, 'I cannot compair [sic] any think [sic] to come nearer to it than about 3&amp;nbsp;miles above Saltash on the Wair.' King and 22 others were sent to colonise [[Norfolk Island]]. This eventually came to nothing and the island was abandoned in 1806. After a traumatic time on the island King went back to Britain to recuperate, leaving Nicholas Nepean, from [[Saltash]], in charge. He returned in November 1791 and in 1800 he became governor of New South Wales. In 1803 he ordered the occupation of [[Van Diemen's Land]] as a convict settlement, there he founded [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] named after the town of his birth.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[William Bligh]] â 4th Governor, most famous as the victim of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]], he was also unfortunate enough to be the victim of a ''coup d'etat'' at the hands of the infamous Rum Corps on 26 January 1808. He had tried to reign them in, something King had failed to do, but instead spent the next two years in exile on Van Diemen's Land while the colony was ruled by a military junta. He returned in 1810 when [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was appointed as governor. Shortly afterwards he left Australia for good.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Sir George Arthur]] â Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land, now the State of Tasmania, 1823â1837. At the time Van Diemen's Land was the main British [[penal colony]] and it was separated from New South Wales in 1825. It was during Arthur's time in office that Van Diemen's Land gained much of its notorious reputation as a harsh penal colony. He selected [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] as the ideal location for a prison settlement, on a [[peninsula]] connected by a narrow, easily guarded [[isthmus]], surrounded by shark-infested seas. He failed in his attempts to reform the colony and the system of [[penal transportation]] with Arthur's autocratic and authoritarian rule leading to his recall. By this time he was one of the wealthiest men in the colony. He returned to Britain in 1837.

====Convicts====
[[File:FremantleprisonMoondynescell.JPG|thumb|left|Moondyne Joe's ''&quot;escape-proof&quot;'' cell]]
On the [[First Fleet]] 21 Cornish convicts arrived in Australia aboard the Charlotte and Scarborough in 1788. A further twelve were sent in the Second Fleet of 1790, though six died on the way, and sixteen were carried on the Third Fleet of 1791. Some 600 convicts were transported from Cornwall to Australia between 1787 and 1852, 78 per cent of whom were male. Some of the most famous of these included:&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=australia+first+fleet+cornwall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pQ8ZsDZmGb&amp;sig=TfiFNvZO2PtZBgpAQUgjeTEuoqw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-YAHTYaRHsKYhQfXyLnuBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=australia%20first%20fleet%20cornwall&amp;f=false {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[James Ruse]], known as Australia's first farmer, who had been transported from Cornwall in the [[First fleet]]. [[Ruse, New South Wales]] was named after him. As well as being the first to set foot on the colony, he was also given the first land grant.
* [[Mary Bryant]], the famous female convict and escapee, transported on the First fleet. With her husband and children she became one of the first to successfully escape the colony, though her family all perished along the way.
* [[William Bryant (convict)|William Bryant]], a fisherman, husband of Mary, also transported on the First fleet. As a fisherman he was considered useful, and put in charge of looking after the fishing ships.
* [[William Philp]], from Padstow in Cornwall, was transported on board the Argyle in 1831 with a life sentence. In 1833 he escaped by stealing the government schooner Badger with several other convicts. They sailed to Manila and then made their way to Macao. In Macao they were identified by a Royal Navy officer who requested their arrest. However the Portugese authorities refused to arrest or deport them and they made their escape. They were never recaptured.
* [[Joseph Horrocks]], founder of the mining town of Gwalla, later renamed [[Northampton, Western Australia]]. He took up a land grant of 100&amp;nbsp;acres which happened to be rich in copper. He developed the mine and brought in Cornish miners to work it.
* [[Moondyne Joe]], whose real name was Joseph Bolitho Johns (c. 1826 â 13 August 1900), was Western Australia's best known bushranger. He was convicted of burglary and stealing in 1849 and sentenced to ten years penal servitude. After being moved between several prisons he was transported to Western Australia. Due to his good behaviour he was released on a ticket of leave in 1864. In 1865 he was sentenced to a further ten years for Killing and eating a neighbour's steer, something he denied for the rest of his life. Determined not to serve his sentence he absconded from a work party. He was eventually caught but months later he escaped again. Trying to make his way to South Australia, Johns was again caught. This time he was placed in  a specially built &quot;escape-proof&quot; cell in [[Fremantle Prison]]. Two years later he escaped through a hole he'd made in the prison wall. Keeping quiet and not committing any crimes, Johns managed to evade the law for two more years, but accidentally ran into police while making a robbery in 1869. Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in April 1871.

===Mining===
The greatest waves of Cornish immigrants to Australia came to mine various minerals including copper, silver and gold. Some of the greatest areas of Cornish settlement are listed below. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries over a third of the Cornish workforce was employed in the mining industry. A mixture of famine and collapses in the mining industry in their native Cornwall forced many thousands of Cornish people to leave their homes from the 1840s. However their skills in hard-rock and metalliferous mining were so sought after that tens of thousands more were sent for over the following decades to build the growing Australian mining industry. This was added to during the gold-rushes, when even more Cornish arrived to seek their fortune.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=the+australian+people+an+encyclopedia+of+the+nation+its+people+and+their+origins+Cornish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pQ8ZvHWpKe&amp;sig=QwqYYxU2hVdQyxzv3GhPMdcOUPo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uKYMTfG_LJGYhQeC9_G3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20australian%20people%20an%20encyclopedia%20of%20the%20nation%20its%20people%20and%20their%20origins%20Cornish&amp;f=false {{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Australia====
[[File:Moonta-aerial-view-1223.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of the &quot;Copper Triangle&quot;]]
Samuel Stephens became the first adult colonist to put foot on South Australian soil when he landed at Nepean Bay on 27 July 1836. He was followed by hundreds of other Cornish people over the following five years.&lt;ref&gt;John Blackett, History of South Australia, Adelaide, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, John Stephens, was active in promoting the new colony within Britain, publishing his book, ''The Land of Promise'', in 1839.

Ten percent of the South Australian population has significant Cornish ancestry. Cornish surnames are more heavily concentrated in South Australia where six of the top ten surnames are Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/whats-in-a-name/2006/09/04/1157222045836.html Nguyens keeping up with the Joneses â National â theage.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally renowned Cornish author [[D. M. Thomas]], who spent part of his childhood in Melbourne, visited the town of [[Truro, South Australia]] in the late 20th Century. There, he found that, ''&quot;Cornwall seemed close ... Cornish miners had come in droves in the last century, and played a large part in founding the state. A High School class to which I read and talked had three children with solidly Cornish names, who knew all about their ancestry.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Thomas, Memories and Hallucinations, Macmillan, London, 1988, p19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Copper Triangle=====
In its heyday Moonta was South Australia's second largest town after [[Adelaide]] and was predominately settled by Cornish miners and their families. Today it is known as 'Australia's Little Cornwall'. Along with the other principal towns of [[Kadina]] and [[Wallaroo]] in the northern [[Yorke Peninsula]] this mining area became known as the [[Copper Triangle]] and was a significant source of prosperity for South Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today Moonta is most famous for its traditional Cornish pasties and its Cornish style miner's cottages and mine engine houses such as Richman's and Hughes engines houses built in the 1860s.  Many streets and houses have Cornish names.  Many descendants of these Cornish families bearing their Cornish surnames still live in the Copper Triangle and the area is intensely proud of its Cornish heritage. Many of the original miners cottages made from [[wattle and daub]] still stand and are still lived in by local residents. Many Cornish subsiquently left the area during the Victorian and Western Australian gold-rushes.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Map the Miner at Kapunda South Australia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Map the Miner|Map Kernow]] (&quot;the son of Cornwall&quot;), Kapunda, South Australia]]

=====Kapunda=====
Copper was discovered in [[Kapunda, South Australia|Kapunda]] in the 1840s, coinciding with the Cornish potato famine which led to many Cornish people emigrating to the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

=====Adelaide Hills=====
Copper was discovered at Montacute, in the [[Adelaide Hills]], soon after Kapunda, and Cornish miners were in the forefront of this development.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

=====Burra Burra=====
The [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]] mine, or 'the Monster' as it was colloquially known, acted like a magnet to the Cornish in Australia. Discovered in 1845, it proved to be an incredibly rich mine, sparking a new wave of immigration to South Australia. The main township is called Redruth after [[Redruth]] in Cornwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

====Victoria====
The Cornish played an important role in the development of the Victorian goldfields.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bendigo Miners' statue.jpg|thumb|left|A statue commemorating Cornish miners in [[Bendigo]], Victoria, Australia]]

=====Bendigo=====
In 1881 46.9 percent of fathers and 41.4 percent of mothers in [[Bendigo]] were born in Cornwall. This was in addition to those Cornish who were born in Australia or places as far afield as [[Mexico]] or [[Brazil]]. The Cornish in Bendigo outnumbered the combined strength of their Irish and Scottish counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:City Hall, Geelong-Victoria-Australia, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|The City Hall, Geelong, Victoria, designed by Cornish architect [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]]]]

=====Ballarat=====
Along with Bendigo, [[Ballarat]] was one of the major Cornish mining settlements in Victoria.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

=====Geelong=====
Many Cornish settled in [[Geelong]], especially after the decline of the gold-fields.

====New South Wales====
=====Broken Hill=====
Many Moonta and Bendigo Cornish took up mining in Broken Hill. The Cornish presence in [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] was bolstered by [[Cornish American]] miners from Nevada, who brought with them better technology for working in the silver-lead sulphide deposits.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

====Western Australia====
There were Cornish mining copper in Western Australia from the 1840s, but this was increased with the discovery of gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

=====Coolgardie=====
Once the third largest town in Western Australia, [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]] attracted the Cornish during the 1890s to mine gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

=====Kalgoorlie-Boulder=====
The city of [[Kalgoorlie]] with [[Boulder, Western Australia|Boulder]] attracted great numbers of Cornish both from within and outside Australia, due to their extensive goldfields.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

=====Murchison River=====
Cornish miners worked at the Geraldine mine in Western Australia  and the nearby town of Northampton. Their  produce was shipped out of   [[Port Gregory, Western Australia]]  in small  vessels  like the tramp steamer  [[SS Xantho]] and then  transhipped to the port of Geraldton where it  was loaded onto wool ships bound for England as a form of 'paying ballast'.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, G.K.

==Cornish associations==
There are many Cornish associations in Australia, as there are  around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londoncornish.co.uk/lcalinksww.html LCA: Affiliated Cornish Associations World-Wide]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornish Association of South Australia is the oldest, being run continuously since 1890. Others include The Cornish Association of Bendigo and District, The Cornish Association of New South Wales, Southern Sons of Cornwall inc., The Cornish Association of Queensland, The Cornish Association of North Yorke Peninsula, The Cornish Association of Tasmania, The Cornish Association of Victoria, and The Cornish Association of Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londoncornish.co.uk/australiac.html |work=London Cornish Association website |title=Affiliated Cornish Associations World-wide: Australia |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
