The strike was brought about by the increasingly poor working conditions of railway employees in the context of the worldwide [[Great Depression]], which affected Romania significantly. It quickly turned into a riot, and resulted in clashes between railway workers and the [[Jandarmeria RomÃ¢nÄ|Gendarmerie]], as well as in the death of [[Vasile RoaitÄ]], a worker whose image was used by the early Communist regime.

An important member of the railway employees striking was the [[Romanian Communist Party]] member [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who later became the leader of [[Communist Romania]]. In 1933, Gheorghiu-Dej was sentenced to 12 years' forced labour by the courts of the [[Kingdom of Romania]] for his role in organising the GriviÈa strike. He escaped in 1944, and after the installation of the Communist regime in Romania in 1948, became the country's ''de facto'' ruler as General Secretary of the [[Romanian Communist Party]].
