'''''The Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; fifth season''' originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network between September 30, 1993 and May 19, 1994. The [[Showrunner|show runner]] for the fifth production season was [[David Mirkin]] who executive produced 20 episodes. [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] executive produced the remaining two, which were both hold overs that were produced for the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|previous season]]. The season contains some of the series' most acclaimed episodes, including &quot;[[Cape Feare]]&quot; and &quot;[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748~3~0~25bestand1,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|accessdate=2008-04-06|date=2003-01-29|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes the 100th episode, &quot;[[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]]&quot;. The season was nominated for two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and won an [[Annie Award]] for Best Animated Television Program as well as an [[Environmental Media Award]] and a [[Genesis Award]]. The DVD box set was released in [[Region 1]] on December 21, 2004, Region 2 on March 21, 2005, and Region 4 on March 23, 2005.

==Production==
[[Image:Conan O'Brien - Simpsons (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|[[Conan O'Brien]] left the writing staff halfway through the season.]]
The season was the first to be executive produced by [[David Mirkin]], who would also run [[The Simpsons (season 6)|the following season]]. Several of the show's original writers who had worked on ''The Simpsons'' since the [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] had left following the completion of season four. &quot;[[Cape Feare]]&quot;, which was the final episode to be produced by the &quot;original team&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;vitti&quot;/&gt; aired during this season as a hold over.&lt;ref name=&quot;vitti&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|date=2004|title=Commentary for the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Kogen]], [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], [[Sam Simon]] and [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] wrote their final episodes for the season four production run. Show runners [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] left to produce their own series, ''[[The Critic]]'' but returned in subsequent seasons to produce more ''Simpsons'' episodes, and Jean again became the show runner starting with [[The Simpsons (season 13)|season thirteen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jean&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Meyer]] and [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Frank Mula]] and future show runners [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] all stayed with the show following the previous season. O'Brien would leave the series halfway through the production of the season to host his own show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. He had been working on &quot;[[Homer Goes to College]]&quot; when he found out he was chosen to host ''Late Night'' and was forced to walk out on his contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;jean&quot;/&gt; He later had a cameo appearance in &quot;[[Bart Gets Famous]]&quot;. He recorded his part while ''Late Night'' was on the air, but O'Brien thought that his show might be canceled by the time the episode aired.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGF&quot;/&gt;

A whole new group of writers were brought in for this season. [[Jace Richdale]] was the first to be hired by Mirkin and others to receive their first writing credits were [[Greg Daniels]] and [[Dan McGrath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Burns' Heir&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Scully]] wrote &quot;[[Lisa's Rival]]&quot;, which was produced for this season, but aired the next. Two freelance writers wrote episodes: [[David Richardson (writer)|David Richardson]] wrote &quot;[[Homer Loves Flanders]]&quot; while Bill Canterbury received two writing credits. [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]] and [[Susie Dietter]], who had previously worked on the show as part of the animation staff, would direct their first episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGF&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Brooks, James L.; Mirkin, David; O'Brien, Conan; Dietter, Susie; Silverman, Davis|date=2004|title=Commentary for the episode &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot;.

[[Image:Davidmirkin.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[David Mirkin]] was the show runner for this season.|alt=A seated man wearing a cap smiles as he looks into the distance. His hands are crossed.]]
The season started off with &quot;[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]&quot; which was chosen as the season premiere because it guest starred [[George Harrison]]. The [[Fox Network]] executives had wanted to premiere with &quot;Homer Goes to College&quot; because it was an ''[[Animal House]]'' parody, but the writers felt &quot;Homer's Barbershop Quartet&quot; would be a better episode because of Harrison's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Jean, Al; Martin, Jeff; Azaria, Hank; Lovitz, Jon; Kirkland, Mark |date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Homer's Barbershow Quartet&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the episode aired during the beginning of the fifth season, &quot;[[Cape Feare]]&quot; was the last episode written by the original team of writers and guest starred [[Kelsey Grammer]] as [[Sideshow Bob]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vitti&quot;/&gt; Compared to previously produced episodes, the episode featured several elements that could be described as cartoonish.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;/&gt; This was a result of the staff's careless attitude towards the end of season four as the majority of them were leaving which, combined with the shortness of the episode, led to the creation of the [[rake (tool)|rake]] sequence, became a memorable moment for this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2004|title=Commentary for the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Cape Feare&quot; and &quot;[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]]&quot; were both broadcast early in the season and are amongst the series' most acclaimed episodes, both having placed highly on ''Entertainment Weekly''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s list of the top 25 episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;/&gt; The episode &quot;[[Deep Space Homer]]&quot; was the only episode to be written by David Mirkin and was controversial amongst the show's writing staff when the episode was in production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too &quot;large&quot; of an idea. [[Matt Groening]] felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers &quot;nowhere to go&quot;. As a result, every aspect of the show was worked on to make the concept work. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David; Silverman, David; Kirkland, Mark|date=2004|title=Commentary for the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;. The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]]&quot; was the series' 100th episode. It was chosen because it heavily featured Bart and was promoted as &quot;Bart's biggest prank ever,&quot; even though Bart did not actually pull any pranks in the episode;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David; Silverman, David; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Anderson, Bob|date=2004|title=Commentary for the episode &quot;Cape Feare&quot;.

[[Cletus Spuckler]] and [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Rich Texan|the Rich Texan]] were the only recurring characters to be introduced this season, first appearing in &quot;[[Bart Gets an Elephant]]&quot;, and &quot;[[$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)|$pringfield]]&quot; respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGE&quot;/&gt; Other minor characters who first appeared this season were [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Luigi Risotto|Luigi]] and [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Baby Gerald|Baby Gerald]]. Two more episodes, &quot;[[Bart of Darkness]]&quot; and &quot;[[Lisa's Rival]]&quot; were produced as part of the season five (1F) production run, but both aired [[The Simpsons (season 6)|the following season]].&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, pp. 148â150&lt;/ref&gt;
