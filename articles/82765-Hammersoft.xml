She has won numerous awards for acting, both for the stage and for film, including five [[BAFTA Award]]s (plus the BAFTA Fellowship Award), two [[Academy Awards]], two [[Golden Globe]]s, two [[Emmy Award]]s, a [[Laurence Olivier Award]], two [[SAG Awards]], and a [[Tony Award]].

She currently stars in the critically acclaimed drama, ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' as Violet Crawley, the Dowager-Countess of Grantham, for which she has won an Emmy.
 
==Early life==
'''Margaret Natalie Smith''' was born in [[Ilford]], [[Essex]]. She is the daughter of Margaret Smith (nÃ©e Hutton), a [[Glasgow]]-born secretary, and Nathaniel Smith, a [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]-born public health pathologist who worked at Oxford University.&lt;ref name=&quot;glasgow&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=Suzie|title=You have to laugh|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=20 November 2004|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1354891,00.html?gusrc=rss|accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Maggie-Smith.html |title=Maggie Smith Biography (1934â) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019451/bio ''Maggies Smith at Yahoo Movies''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tiscali&quot;&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/maggie_smith_biog.html ''Maggie Smith biography'']. Tiscali.film &amp; TV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/65/Maggie-Smith.html ''Maggie Smith'']. Film Reference.com.&lt;/ref&gt; She has older twin brothers, Alistair and Ian. Smith studied at [[Oxford High School (Oxford)|Oxford High School]].

==Career==
Smith has had an extensive career both on screen and in live theatre, and is known as one of Britain's pre-eminent actresses. She began her career at the [[Oxford Playhouse]] with Frank Shelley and made her first film in 1956. She became a fixture at the [[Royal National Theatre]] in the 1960s, most notably for playing [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]'' opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] and winning her first [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for her performance in the [[Othello (1965 film)|1965 film version]].

In 1969, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance as an unorthodox Scottish schoolteacher in ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'', a role originally created on stage by [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in 1966 in London. ([[Zoe Caldwell]] won the [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play|Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] when she created the role in New York.) Smith was also awarded the 1978 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as the brittle actress Diana Barry in ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]],'' acting opposite [[Michael Caine]]. Afterwards, on hearing that [[Michael Palin]] was about to embark on a film (''[[The Missionary]]'') with Smith, Caine is supposed to have humorously telephoned Palin, warning him that she would steal the film. She also starred with Palin in the [[black comedy]] ''[[A Private Function]]'' in 1984.

Smith appeared in ''[[Sister Act]]'' in 1992 and had a major role in the 1999 film ''[[Tea with Mussolini]],'' where she appeared as the formidable Lady Hester. Indeed, many of her more mature roles have centred on what Smith refers to as her &quot;gallery of grotesques&quot;, playing waspish, sarcastic or plain rude characters. Recent examples of this would include the judgmental sister in ''[[Ladies in Lavender]]'' and the cantankerous snob Constance, Countess of Trentham in ''[[Gosford Park]],'' for which she received another [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination.

Other notable roles include the querulous Charlotte Bartlett in the [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant-Ivory]] production of ''[[A Room with a View (film)|A Room with a View]]'', a vivid supporting turn as the aged Duchess of York in [[Ian McKellen]]'s film of ''[[Richard III (1995 film)|Richard III]]'', and a little known but powerful performance as Lila Fisher in the 1973 film ''[[Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing]]'' with [[Timothy Bottoms]]. Due to the international success of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' movies, she is now widely known for playing the role of Professor [[Minerva McGonagall]], opposite [[Daniel Radcliffe]], with whom she'd previously worked in the 1999 BBC television adaptation of ''[[David Copperfield (1999 film)|David Copperfield]]'', playing Betsie Trottwood. She also plays an older Wendy in the Peter Pan movie, ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' and Mrs. Medlock in ''[[The Secret Garden (1993 film)|The Secret Garden]]''. In 2010, she appeared as Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, in the British period drama ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', taking part in the second series also which was screened in the Autumn of 2011. A third series is being planned.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

She appeared in numerous productions at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]], Ontario, to acclaim from 1976 through to 1980. These roles included Queen Elizabeth in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', Virginia Woolf in ''Virginia'', and countless lead roles with long-time Stratford icon [[Brian Bedford]] including the [[NoÃ«l Coward]] comedy ''[[Private Lives]]''.

On stage, her many roles have included the title character in the stage production of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''The Lady in the Van'' and starring as Amanda in a revival of ''Private Lives''. She won a Tony Award in 1990 for Best Actress in a Play for [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Lettice and Lovage]]'', in which she starred as an eccentric tour guide in an English stately home.   In 2007, she appeared in [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[The Lady from Dubuque]]'' at [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]].

She was awarded Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1970, and was raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in 1990.

==Personal life==
Smith has been married twice. She married actor [[Robert Stephens]] on 29 June 1967 at Greenwich [[Register Office]]. The couple had two sons: actors [[Chris Larkin]] (born in 1967) and [[Toby Stephens]] (born in 1969),&lt;ref name=&quot;tiscali&quot;/&gt; and divorced on 6 May 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiscali&quot;/&gt; Smith is a grandmother via both her sons.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coveney, &quot;I'm Very Scared of Being Back on Stage&quot;, ''thisislondon.co.uk'', 3 February 2007 [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/theatre/article-23387486-details/I'm%20very%20scared%20of%20being%20back%20on%20stage/article.do]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Lawson |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/story/0,,2091828,00.html |title=Mark Lawson, &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;, '&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, 31 May 2007 |publisher=Arts.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married playwright [[Beverley Cross]] on 23 August 1975 at the [[Guildford]] Register Office; he died on 20 March 1998.

In 2007, the ''Sunday Telegraph'''s Mandrake diary disclosed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was subsequently reported to have made a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ijMyS9F4MJL_ziOQRrBup8yayqKw |title=Actress Maggie Smith recounts cancer battle |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
