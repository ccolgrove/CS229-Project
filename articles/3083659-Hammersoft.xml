The '''Washington D.C. Slayers''' are a [[rugby league football]] team based in [[Washington, D.C.]] They currently play in the [[USA Rugby League]]. They play their home games at Duke Ellington Field near Georgetown Hospital.

The Slayers, along with the [[Connecticut Wildcats]], were established in 2003 as [[expansion team]]s of the [[American National Rugby League]] (AMNRL). They played in the AMNRL for eight seasons, from 2003â2010, making it to the league playoffs six times and advancing to the semi-finals in their inaugural season. In 2011 they became one of seven teams to depart from the AMNRL to form the new USA Rugby League.

==History==
The team was founded in 2003 by Martin O'Donoghue, who had played on the [[United States national rugby league team|United States national team]] and was involved in the early development of the [[American National Rugby League]]. The Slayers, along with the [[Connecticut Wildcats]] of [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], joined the league as [[expansion team]]s for the [[2003 AMNRL season|2003 season]]. At this time most players were recruited from [[rugby union]] clubs from across the greater Washington area, and many of them were personal friends of O'Donoghue, who served as the team's first coach.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dc-slayers.com/History.html|title= History of the Slayers|author= |date= 2010|work= dc-slayers.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Slayers went to the league playoffs in their inaugural year, advancing to the semi-finals before being defeated by the Connecticut Wildcats. They went to the playoffs again in 2004, but in the beginning of a trend that would follow the team through the 2000s, were knocked out in the first round by the team that would go on to win the Grand Final. After the season founder O'Donoghue left the United States. The team nearly collapsed, as only eight players committed to play for 2005, less than the thirteen needed on the field. Nevertheless these eight completed every game of the season. The team was able to rebuild the following year, and advanced to the playoffs in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010, though never making it past the first round.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;
