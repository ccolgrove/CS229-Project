It also appears as a surname.

==Etymology==
[[Rida]] (Reza) is an [[Islam]]ic concept rooted in the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah|practices]] of its founder [[Muhammad]]. This idea of contentment is expressed in two Qur'anic verses which discuss the contentment of [[Allah]] with believers and, conversely, of believers with Allah:

:''Allah was well pleased with the believers...'' ({{Quran-usc|48|18}})

Muslims believe that Allah's pleasure with the servant is expressed through his gifts both material and spiritual and the servant's pleasure with Allah is the name of his obedience to Allah's commands and submission to his will. Rida on the part of the human also includes his determination to accept Allah's decree irrespective of whether it is favourable or unfavourable.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The name is very popular among the [[Shia]] community, especially in [[Iran]], the largest Shia-dominated nation in the world, mainly because the 8th [[Imam]] of Shia Islam, [[Ali al-Rida|Imam 'Ali al-Ridha]], bore this name. 

Because the Arabic ''dh'' sound (comparable to the English ''th'') does not exist in the [[Persian language]], Persian-speakers replace the sound with a ''z''. This pronunciation was also adopted by other languages influenced by Persian, most of all [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]]. In the [[Maghreb]] region, the name is spelled ''Reda'', due to the [[French language|French]] influence during the [[French colonial empire|colonial]] times.
