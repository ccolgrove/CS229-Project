[[Image:GUST LOCK ON RUDDER (1373262822).jpg|thumb|Aircraft rudder]]

A '''rudder''' is a device used to steer a [[ship]], [[boat]], [[submarine]], [[hovercraft]], [[aircraft]] or other conveyance that moves through a medium (generally air or water). On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter [[adverse yaw]] and [[p-factor]] and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or yawing motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with [[hinge]]s to the craft's stern, tail or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a [[tiller]] -- essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever armâmay be attached to the top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a [[helmsman]]. In larger vessels, cables, pushrods, or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.

Generally, a rudder is &quot;part of the steering apparatus of a boat or ship that is fastened outside the hull&quot;, that is denoting all different types of oars, paddles and rudders.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder.EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica&quot;&gt;rudder.EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. Retrieved August 8, 2008, from [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the steering gear of ancient vessels can be classified into side-rudders and stern-mounted rudders, depending on their location on the ship. A third term, [[steering oar]], can denote both types. In a [[Mediterranean]] context, side-rudders are more specifically called quarter-rudders as the later term designates more exactly the place where the rudder was mounted. Stern-mounted rudders are uniformly suspended at the back of the ship in a central position, but the term has historically been found wanting because it does not take into account that the stern rudders were attached to the ship [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] in quite a different way: While the [[Europe]]an pintle-and-gudgeon rudder was attached to the sternpost by pivoting iron fastenings, the [[Arab]]s used instead a system of lashings. [[China|Chinese]] stern rudders also featured [[Block and tackle|tackles]], but, unlike their medieval and Arab counterparts, had no sternpost to which to attach them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence V.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single sail tends to turn a vessel in an upwind or downwind direction, and rudder action is required to steer a straight course. A steering oar was used at this time because the rudder had not yet been invented. With a single sail, a frequent movement of the steering oar was required to steer a straight course; this slowed down the vessel because a steering oar (or rudder) course correction acts like a brake. The second sail, located forward, could be trimmed to offset the turning tendency of the main sail and minimize the need for course corrections by the steering oar, which would have substantially improved sail performance.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Leo.

Rowing oars set aside for steering appeared on large Egyptian vessels long before the time of [[Menes]] (3100 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;William F. Edgerton, 255&quot;&gt;William F.

Chinese rudders were not supported by [[pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] as in the Western tradition; rather, they were attached to the hull by means of wooden jaws or sockets,&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 3 632&quot;/&gt; while typically larger ones were suspended from above by a rope [[block and tackle|tackle]] system so that they could be raised or lowered into the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 3 632&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many junks incorporated &quot;fenestrated rudders&quot; (rudders with holes in them, supposedly allowing for better control). Detailed descriptions of Chinese junks during the [[Middle Ages]] are known from various travellers to [[China]], such as [[Ibn Battuta]] of [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]] and [[Marco Polo]] of [[Venice]], [[Italy]]. The later Chinese encyclopedist [[Song Yingxing]] (1587â1666) and the 17th century European traveler Louis Lecomte would write of the junk design and its use of the rudder with enthusiasm and admiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;needham volume 4 part 3 634&quot;&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Par634.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that the Chinese invented the &quot;median, vertical and axial&quot; stern-mounted rudder, and that such a kind of rudder preceded the pintle-and-gudgeon rudder found in the West by roughly a millennium.&lt;ref name=&quot;johnstone mcgrail 191&quot;/&gt; However, Mott points out that the Chinese rudder worked by a very different suspension system, and that it was not permanently attached to a sternpost, leaving little point in comparing two such different types of rudder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence V. Mott 2f., 92&quot;/&gt; The method of mounting steering gear from the stern was well known in [[Mediterranean]] navigation by the time the practice appeared in Chinese ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;William F.

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[Image:Rudder of a Roman Boat (RG Museum Koeln, Germany).JPG|thumb|Stern-mounted rudder of a Roman boat, 1st century AD (RG-Museum, Cologne).]]

Roman navigation used sexillie quarter rudders which went in the Mediterranean through a long period of constant refinement and improvement, so that by Roman times ancient vessels reached extraordinary sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Mott, p.1&quot;&gt;Lawrence V. Mott, The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1337: A Technological Tale, Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of quarter rudder lay in its combination of effectiveness, adaptability and simpleness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Mott, p.1&quot;/&gt; Roman quarter rudder mounting systems survived mostly intact through the medieval period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Mott, p.1&quot;/&gt;

By the first half of the 1st century AD, rudders mounted on the stern were also quite common in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] river and harbour craft as proved from [[relief]]s and archaeological finds (Zwammderdam, Woerden 7). A tomb plaque of [[Hadrian]]ic age shows a harbour tug boat in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] with a long stern-mounted oar for better leverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lionel Casson (1965) plate 1&quot;&gt;Lionel Casson: ''Harbour and River Boats of Ancient Rome'', ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 55, No. 1/2, Parts 1 and 2 (1965), pp. 31-39 (plate 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, the boat already featured a [[spritsail]], adding to the mobility of the harbour vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Casson, Harbour and River Boats of Ancient Rome, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Vol. 55, No. Â½, Parts 1 and 2.

===Medieval Near East===
[[Arab]] ships also used a sternpost-mounted rudder, but which differed technically from both its European and Chinese counterparts, indicating an independent invention.&lt;ref name=Mott-93/&gt; On their ships &quot;the rudder is controlled by two lines, each attached to a crosspiece mounted on the rudder head perpendicular to the plane of the rudder blade.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mott-93&gt;Lawrence V. Mott, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest evidence comes from the ''Ahsan al-Taqasim fi Marifat al-Aqalim'' ('The Best Divisions for the Classification of Regions') written by [[al-Muqaddasi]] in 985:

: ''The captain from the crow's nest carefully observes the sea. When a rock is espied, he shouts: &quot;Starboard!&quot; or 'Port!&quot; Two youths, posted there, repeat the cry. The helmsman, with two ropes in his hand, when he hears the calls tugs one or the other to the right or left. If great care is not taken, the ship strikes the rocks and is wrecked.''&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Mott, p.92f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab]]s used instead a system of lashings. [[China|Chinese]] stern rudders also featured [[Block and tackle|tackles]], but, unlike their medieval and Arab counterparts, had no sternpost to which to attach them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence V. Mott 2f., 92&quot;/&gt; According to Lawrence V. Mott, the &quot;idea of attaching the rudder to the sternpost in a relatively permanent fashion, therefore, must have been an Arab invention independent of the Chinese.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mott-93/&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===

Oars mounted on the side of ships evolved into quarter rudders, which were used from [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] until the end of the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]]. As the size of ships and the height of the freeboards increased, quarter-rudders became unwieldy and were replaced by the more sturdy stern-mounted rudders with [[pintle]] and [[gudgeon]] attachment. While stern-mounted rudders were found in Europe on a wide range of vessels since Roman times, including light war galleys in Mediterranean,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V.

Historically, the radical concept of the medieval pintle-and-gudgeon rudder did not come as a single invention into being. It presented rather a combination of ideas which each had been long around before: rudders mounted on the stern, iron hinges and the straight sternpost of [[Cog (ship)|northern European ships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Mott, 118f.&quot;&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1337: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University, S.118f.]&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier rudders were mounted on the stern by the way of rudderposts or tackles, the iron hinges allowed for the first time to attach the rudder to the entire length of the sternpost in a really permanent fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1337: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University, S.2, 92f.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, its full potential could only to be realized after the introduction of the vertical sternpost and the full-rigged ship in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawrence Mott, 118f.&quot;/&gt; From the [[age of discovery]] onwards, European ships with pintle-and-gudgeon rudders sailed successfully on all seven seas.

Contrary to an older hypothesis, all evidence indicates that the European hinged stern-mounted rudder, whose technical specifications considerably differ from the Chinese one, was invented independently:

: ''The only actual concept which can be claimed to have been transmitted from the Chinese is the idea of a stern-mounted rudder, and not its method of attachment nor the manner in which it was controlled. Since that idea of putting a rudder on the stern can be traced back to the models found in Egyptian tombs, the need to have the concept brought into the Middle East is questionable at best. There is no evidence to support the contention that the sternpost-mounted rudder came from China, and no need to call on exterior sources for its introduction into the Mediterranean.''&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Mott, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boat rudders details==
Boat rudders may be either outboard or inboard. Outboard rudders are hung on the stern or transom. Inboard rudders are hung from a keel or skeg and are thus fully submerged beneath the hull, connected to the steering mechanism by a rudder post which comes up through the hull to deck level, often into a cockpit.  Inboard keel hung rudders (which are a continuation of the aft trailing edge of the full keel) are traditionally deemed the most damage resistant rudders for off shore sailing.  Better performance with faster handleing characteristics can be provided by skeg hung rudders on boats with smaller fin keels.

Rudder post and mast placement defines the difference between a ketch and a yawl, as these two-masted vessels are similar. Yawls are defined as having the mizzen mast abaft (i.e. &quot;aft of&quot;) the rudder post; ketches are defined as having the mizzen mast forward of the rudder post.

Small boat rudders that can be steered more or less perpendicular to the hull's longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed &quot;hard over.&quot; However, terms such as &quot;hard over,&quot; &quot;hard to starboard,&quot; etc. signify a maximum-rate turn for larger vessels.  Transom hung rudders or far aft mounted fin rudders generate greater moment and faster turning than more forward mounted keel hung rudders.

There is also the '''barrel type rudder''' where the ships screw is enclosed and can swiveled to steer the vessel.  Designers claim that this type of rudder on a smaller vessel will answer the helm faster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=xd8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA495&amp;dq=%22Popular+Mechanics%22+Jan+1935+floating&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wtc4TsGsDeSusAKXtpka&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Barrel Type Rudder Makes Quicker Turns&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1934, bottom-right pg.495&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ayaw.gif|thumb|Movement caused by the use of rudder.]]

On an aircraft, the '''rudder''' is a directional [[control surface]] along with the rudder-like [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] (usually attached to horizontal tail structure, if not a [[slab elevator]] ) and [[ailerons]] (attached to the wings) that control pitch and roll.  The rudder is usually attached to the [[fin]] (or [[vertical stabilizer]]) which allows the pilot to control [[Flight dynamics|yaw]] in the vertical axis, i.e. change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing.  The rudder's direction in aircraft since the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of flight between the two World Wars into the 21st century has been manipulated with the movement of a pair of foot pedals by the pilot, while during the pre-1919 era rudder control was most often operated with by a center-pivoted, solid &quot;rudder bar&quot; which usually had pedal and/or stirrup-like hardware on its ends to allow the pilot's feet to stay close to the ends of the bar's rear surface.

In practice, both aileron and rudder control input are used together to turn an aircraft, the ailerons imparting roll, the rudder imparting yaw, and also compensating for a phenomenon called [[adverse yaw]]. Adverse yaw is readily seen if the most simple type of ailerons alone are used for a turn. The downward moving aileron acts like a flap, generating more lift for one wing, and therefore more drag (though since the 1930s, many aircraft have used [[Frise aileron]]s or differential ailerons, which compensate for the adverse yaw and require little or no rudder input in regular turns). Initially, this drag yaws the aircraft in the direction opposite to the desired course. A rudder alone will turn a conventional fixed wing aircraft, but much more slowly than if ailerons are also used in conjunction.  Use of rudder and ailerons together produces co-ordinated turns, in which the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is in line with the arc of the turn, neither [[slip (aerodynamic)|slip]]ping (under-ruddered), nor skidding (over-ruddered). Improperly ruddered turns at low speed can precipitate a [[spin (flight)|spin]] which can be dangerous at low altitudes.

Sometimes pilots may intentionally operate the rudder and ailerons in opposite directions in a maneuver called a [[forward slip]]. This may be done to overcome crosswinds and keep the fuselage in line with the runway, or to more rapidly lose altitude by increasing drag, or both. The pilots of [[Air Canada Flight 143]] used a similar technique to land the plane as it was too high above the glideslope.

Any aircraft rudder is subject to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation.  In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder.  (The same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, but it is more important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins.)  The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its '''blowdown limit'''; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.

==Trim tab==
{{main|Trim tab}}
'''Trim tabs''' are small surfaces connected to the trailing edge of a larger [[control surface]], such as a rudder, on a [[boat]] or [[aircraft]], used to control the [[trim (aircraft)|trim]] of the controls, i.e. to counteract hydro- or aero-dynamic forces and stabilise the boat or aircraft in a particular desired attitude without the need for the operator to constantly apply a control force. This is done by adjusting the angle of the tab relative to the larger surface.

Changing the setting of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting position of a control surface (such as an [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] or rudder). As the desired position of a control surface changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that positionâto zero, if used correctly.  Thus the trim tab acts as a [[servo tab]].  Because the [[center of pressure]] of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the control surface than the center of pressure of the control surface, the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the control surface.  The position of the control surface on its axis will change until the movements from the control surface and the trim surface balance each other.
