The Lady Blunt is one of the two best-preserved Stradivarius violins in existence.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news | title =Rare Stradivarius Violin to be Sold| work =Sophie Hull | publisher =artsandcollections.com| date =2011-05-03  | url = http://www.artsandcollections.com/index.php?/article/rare_stradivarius_violin_to_be_sold_317/| accessdate = 2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has survived, like the [[Messiah Stradivarius]] of 1716, in near-original condition since it has resided mostly in the hands of collectors and seen little use.
