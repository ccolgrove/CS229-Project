The '''OpenDisc''' project offers a selection of high quality [[open source software]] on a disc for [[Microsoft Windows]] users. The aims of the project are &quot;to provide a free alternative to costly software, with equal or often better quality equivalents to [[proprietary software|proprietary]], [[shareware]] or [[freeware]] software for Microsoft Windows&quot;, and &quot;to educate users of [[Linux]] as an [[operating system]] for home, business and educational use&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theopendisc.com/about/ About the OpenDisc project], 25th September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was created in September 2007 by former [[OpenCD]] project lead Chris Gray, who cited numerous difficulties&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrisgray.me/2007/09/mutiny-aboard-the-good-ship-theopencd Mutiny aboard the good ship OpenCD], 27th September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which he believed were negatively affecting the progress of the [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] sponsored project. As of the 27th September 2007, the OpenCD project is no longer under active development (the former OpenCD project was replaced by OpenDisc).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theopencd.org OpenCD homepage], 27th September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
