The '''1979 ICC Trophy''' was a [[one-day cricket|limited-overs]] [[cricket]] tournament held in [[England]] between 22 May and 21 June 1979. It was the first [[ICC Trophy]] tournament to be staged, with matches between the 15 participating teams played over 60 overs a side and with white clothing and red balls. All matches were played in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], with the final being played on [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]]'s ground at [[New Road, Worcester|New Road]]. The two finalists, [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]], qualified to take part in the [[1979 Cricket World Cup]].

==Competition format==

The 15 teams were divided into three groups of five. Each team played each other team in its group once in matches played between 22 May and 4 June, scoring four points for a win and two for a no-result (match started but not finished) or abandoned entirely without a ball being bowled. The three group winners and the team with the fourth-highest points total after the group stage went forward to the semi-finals, the top team playing the fourth-ranked side and the team with the second-highest number of points playing the third. Where teams finished with equal points totals, [[run rate]] was used to separate them.

A close opening-day match saw [[Singapore cricket team|Singapore]] manage a nail-biting one-wicket victory over [[Argentina cricket team|Argentina]]. The Argentines had made a respectable 154/9 from their 60 overs, their total restricted by a fine 5-44 from Young Ken Sen. In reply, [[Singapore cricket team|Singapore]] slumped to 43/4 before the middle order steadied the ship, Goh Swee Heng proving the key man with 40 not out as they overhauled their opponents' total with four balls to spare. In the other Group A game, there was no result between [[East African cricket team|East Africa]] and [[Papua New Guinea cricekt team|Papua New Guinea]], though the Papuans had struggled to 101/8 from 40.2 overs by the time the match was called off, with only Api Leka's 51 not out staving off complete collapse.

Argentina's 147 proved to be inadequate, Ferguson top scoring with 44, as [[East Africa cricket team|East Africa]] won by five wickets with more than six overs in hand, [[Narendra Thakker]] making 44 not out. [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]]'s win over [[Papua New Guinea cricket team|PNG]] was a one-sided affair, PNG losing their last four wickets for five runs to collapse to 90 all out and the Bermudians reaching 92/3 from a mere 23.2 overs.

Both matches were ruined by the weather: the game between Argentina and Papua New Guinea was curtailed by rain, the [[South American]]s having reached an unconvincing 86/4 after 33 overs when play was called off. Meanwhile, there was no play at all between Bermuda and Singapore.

Argentina lost wickets at regular intervals against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] to make an inadequate 81 in their innings, future [[Scottish cricket team|Scotland]] [[List A cricket|List A]] bowler [[Clarence Parfitt]] taking 3-16; their opponents raced to their target, for the loss of just one wicket, inside 16 overs. In the other game, [[Singapore cricket team|Singapore]] crawled to 131/5 from their full 60 overs, although [[East Africa cricket team|East Africa]]  took more than 52 overs to record a five-wicket win.

Both matches were one-sided: in the first, East Africa's 94 all out ([[Winston Trott]] 3-8) fell well short of a competitive total and [[Winston Reid (cricketer)|Winston Reid]]'s undefeated 59 ensured a simple nine-wicket triumph for [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]]. Papua New Guinea put up a good performance in the other match, making 174 despite 4-30 for Young Ken Sen and then reducing Singaporeans to 15/5, a position from which they never recovered; [[Singapore cricket team|Singapore]] were eventually bowled out for a mere 87 to lose by 87 runs.

[[Canada cricket team|Canada]] proved too strong for [[Malaysian cricket team|Malaysia]], Rasiah Ratnalingham's excellent [[bowling analysis|analysis]] of 12-5-18-3 not enough to stop the Canadians winning by 44 runs thanks to 77 from [[Cecil Marshall]] and 4-33 from [[John Vaughan (cricketer)|John Vaughan]]. Elsewhere, a strong Denmark side overpowered Fiji, [[Ole Mortensen]] taking 4-15 from 12 overs in a Fijian total of just 89 which the Danes cruised past with almost 25 overs to spare; Henrik Mortensen made 52 not out.

Bangladesh were in desperate trouble against [[Fiji cricket team|Fiji]] after good bowling (Konrote 3-14 from nine overs) reduced them to 54/8, but their last two wickets added 49 and their final total of 103 proved to be enough as they won by 22 runs thanks to [[Ashraful Haque]], who destroyed the Fijian line-up with a superb haul of 7-23, figures which would stand as the best return in the ICC Trophy until 1994. Malaysia made 150 from their 60 overs, helped by no less than 27 extras (including 14 wides), but Denmark's batting was too strong, Henrik Mortensen and Carsten Morild adding an unbroken partnership of 119 to guide the [[Scandinavia]]ns to a straightforward seven-wicket win.

Canada (190/9) recorded a solid 49-run win over Bangladesh (141), [[Franklyn Dennis]] top-scoring with 61 and captain [[Garnet Brisbane]] making 34. For the Bangladeshis, [[Jahangir Shah]] took 4-17, but it was not enough to affect the outcome of the match as only two players passed 20.

Malaysia started reasonably to reach 60/2 against Bangladesh, but wickets tumbled regularly thereafter and in the end they could manage only 114 ([[Daulat Zaman]] 4-23) and Jahangir Shah's unbeaten 39 saw the Bangladeshis home by seven wickets. Elsewhere, 4-16 from Canada's [[Martin Stead]] helped reduce [[Denmark cricket team|Denamrk]] from 74/2 to 118 all out, but they collapsed themselves in reply, reaching just 72 (Carsten Morild 4-12) to lose by 46 runs.

A close match saw [[Denmark cricket team|Denmark]] (165/8) beat Bangladesh (155) by 10 runs to record a perfect record of four wins from four games, thanks largely to 74 from Keld Kristensen and some economical bowling (12-5-16-3) by Torben Neilsen. The other match was a somewhat less gripping affair, with Canada winning by 56 runs, their 209/6 (Vaughan 68) being more than enough for Fiji, for whom no batsman passed Browne's 34 as they were bowled out for 153.

The USA's total of 126 all out seemed vulnerable, with only three batsmen reaching 20 and R Reuben claiming 4-37, but once Israel had slumped to 47/7 in reply there was no way back, despite a defiant 24 not out from number nine Kanpol, and they lost by 41 runs.

The [[Netherlands cricket team|Netherlands]](107/2) cruised to an untroubled eight-wicket victory over Israel (105), thanks largely to five dismissals (3ct, 2st) by [[Rene Schoonheim]] and to Bakker's 60 not out. In the other game, a reasonable American total of 168 was boosted by a fifth-wicket stand of 90 between Stuger (48) and former [[first-class cricket|first-class]] cricketer [[Kamran Rasheed]], who hit 44. Despite the loss of two early wickets, a fine 76 not out from future [[Test cricket|Test]] batsman [[Roy Dias]] ensured that there were no real alarms for the Sri Lankans as they won by six wickets with 20 overs to go.

Wales piled up a daunting 234/5 against Israel, Jeffris Hopkins hitting 92 and Geoffrey Williams 67. Israel were never in the game after they slipped to 59/5, before restoring some respectability with a sixth-wicket stand of 61 thanks to Kessel (32) and Solomon (28); they eventually made 143/9 to lose by 91 runs. In the other match, 51 from [[Duleep Mendis]] and five other scores between 21 and 28 saw Sri Lanka to 212/8; Bakker made 74 in the Dutch reply but received little support and Sri Lanka won by 45 runs.

However, an excellent spell of bowling from Kamran Rasheed, more usually a [[wicket-keeper]], turned the game; he took 5-17 from eight overs and Wales were dismissed for 182 with seven balls to go to lose by just eight runs.

==Semi-finals - 6 June==
===Bermuda v Canada===
Batting first, Bermuda were bowled out for 181 off 58.1 overs with no player making a big impression, but solid contributions from John Tucker (who made his team's top score of 49) and Gladstone Browne (34). In reply, Canada's innings began disastrously as they were reduced to 36/4, but once [[Bryan Mauricette]] (72 not out) and [[Tariq Javed]] (47) had added 111 for the sixth wicket the result was no longer in doubt and the Canadians recorded a four-wicket win with 13 balls to spare.

===Denmark v Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka's powerful batting line-up saw their team through to a huge total of 318/7, including 88 from Dias, 68 from Mendis and 45 from captain [[Anura Tennekoon]]. The Danes began reasonably well in pursuit of such a daunting target, reaching 96/3 at one stage before wickets began to tumble and [[Denmark cricket team|Denmark]] declined to 110 all out, a crushing 208-run loss. [[Bandula Warnapura]] (3-22), [[Somachandra de Silva]] (3-20) and [[Sudath Pasqual]] (3-7) were the pick of Sri Lanka's bowlers.

==Final - 21 June==
A high-scoring match saw 588 runs scored for the loss of 13 wickets, with [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] emerging victorious by the comfortable margin of 60 runs. Mendis hit 66 and [[Sunil Jayasinghe]] 64, with four other players passing 30, as the Sri Lankans made 324/8, the highest total of the entire tournament. [[Canada cricket team|Canada]] recovered from 34/2 to reach 182/3 at one stage with Vaughan making 80 and Marshall 55. Despite having wickets in hand, however, they could not keep up with the required run rate, ending up well short of their target on 264/5.
