'''R''' is a [[programming language]] and software environment for [[statistics|statistical]] computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians for developing statistical software,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Fox, John and Andersen, Robert | title = Using the R Statistical Computing Environment to Teach Social Statistics Courses | publisher = Department of Sociology, McMaster University | date = January 2005 | url = http://www.unt.edu/rss/Teaching-with-R.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2006-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes09&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html |title=Data Analysts Captivated by R's Power | date=2009-01-06 | accessdate=2009-04-28|last=Vance| first=Ashlee |work=[[New York Times]]| quote=R is also the name of a popular programming language used by a growing number of data analysts inside corporations and academia. It is becoming their lingua franca...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and R is widely used for statistical software development and data analysis.&lt;ref name=nytimes09/&gt;

R is an implementation of the [[S (programming language)|S programming language]] combined with [[lexical scoping]] semantics inspired by [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]. S was created by [[John Chambers (programmer)|John Chambers]] while at [[Bell Laboratories|Bell Labs]]. R was created by [[Ross Ihaka]] and [[Robert Gentleman (statistician)|Robert Gentleman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://myprofile.cos.com/rgentleman | title=Robert Gentleman's home page | accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], and now, R is developed by the ''R Development Core Team'', of which Chambers is a member. R is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly as a play on the name of [[S (programming language)|S]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The R FAQ: Why is R named R? |author=Kurt Hornik |isbn=3-900051-08-9 |url=http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-is-R-named-R_003f |accessdate=2008-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

R is part of the [[GNU project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://directory.fsf.org/project/gnur/ | title=Free Software Foundation (FSF) Free Software Directory: GNU R | accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.r-project.org/about.html | title=What is R? | accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[source code]] is freely available under the [[GNU General Public License]], and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various [[operating system]]s. R uses a [[command line interface]]; however, several [[graphical user interface]]s are available for use with R.

== Statistical features ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:R gui on os x.png|thumb|right|The R [[gui]] running the general linear model demo on Mac OS X.]] --&gt;
R provides a wide variety of [[statistical]] and [[graphical]] techniques, including [[linear]] and [[nonlinear]] modeling, classical statistical tests, [[time-series analysis]], classification, clustering, and others. R is easily extensible through functions and extensions, and the R community is noted for its active contributions in terms of packages. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered. Many of R's standard functions are written in R itself, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally intensive tasks, [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], and [[Fortran]] code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  |title=Calling R from Java |author=Duncan Temple Lang |url=http://www.omegahat.org/RSJava/RFromJava.pdf |accessdate=2010-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; code to manipulate R objects directly.

R is highly extensible through the use of user-submitted packages for specific functions or specific areas of study. Due to its S heritage, R has stronger [[object-oriented programming]] facilities than most statistical computing languages. Extending R is also eased by its permissive [[lexical scoping]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Jackman | first = Simon | title = R For the Political Methodologist | journal = The Political Methodologist | volume = 11  | issue = 1 | pages = 20â22 | date = Spring 2003 | publisher = Political Methodology Section, [[American Political Science Association]] | url = http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2006-08-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060721143309/http://polmeth.wustl.edu/tpm/tpm_v11_n2.pdf |archivedate = 2006-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rexer's Annual Data Miner Survey]] in 2010, R has become the [[data mining]] tool used by more data miners (43%) than any other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rexeranalytics.com/Data-Miner-Survey-Results-2010.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strength of R is static graphics, which can produce publication-quality graphs, including mathematical symbols.  Dynamic and interactive graphics are available through additional packages such as [[RGL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| url=http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html 
| title=CRAN Task View: Graphic Displays &amp; Dynamic Graphics &amp; Graphic Devices &amp; Visualization 
| publisher=The Comprehensive R Archive Network  
| accessdate=2011-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

R has its own [[LaTeX]]-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hard copy.

== Programming features ==
R is an interpreted language typically used through a [[command line interpreter]]. If one types &quot;2+2&quot; at the command prompt and presses enter, the computer replies with &quot;4&quot;.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; 2+2
[1] 4
&lt;/source&gt;

Like many other languages, R supports [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix arithmetic]]. R's [[data structure]]s include [[Scalar (computing)|scalars]], [[Column vector|vectors]], [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], data frames (similar to [[Table (database)|tables]] in a [[relational database]]) and [[List (computing)|lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalgaard |first=Peter |authorlink= |coauthors=  |title=Introductory Statistics with R |year=2002 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York, Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn=0387954759X pages=10â18, 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The R object system has been extended by package authors to define objects for [[Regression analysis|regression models]], [[time-series]] and [[Spatial analysis|geo-spatial coordinates]].

R supports [[procedural programming]] with [[Function (computer science)|functions]] and, for some functions, [[object-oriented programming]] with [[generic function]]s. A generic function acts differently depending on the type of arguments it is passed. In other words the generic function [[Dynamic dispatch|dispatches]] the function ([[Method (computer science)|method]]) specific to that type of [[Object (computer science)|object]]. For example, R has a [[Generic function|generic]] print() function that can print almost every type of [[Object (computer science)|object]] in R with a simple &quot;print(objectname)&quot; syntax.

Although R is mostly used by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, it can also be used as a [[numerical linear algebra|general matrix calculation]] toolbox with performance benchmarks comparable to [[GNU Octave]] or [[MATLAB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Example 1 ===
The following examples illustrate the basic syntax of the language and use of the command-line interface.

In R and S, the [[Assignment (computer science)|assignment operator]] is an arrow made from two characters &quot;&lt;-&quot;.

Short R code calculating [[w:Mandelbrot set|Mandelbrot set]] through the first 20 iterations of equation z = zÂ² + c plotted for different complex constants ''c''.  This example demonstrates:
* use of community developed external libraries (called packages), in this case caTools package
* handling of [[complex numbers]] 
* multidimensional arrays of numbers used as basic data type, see variables C, Z and X

== Packages ==
The capabilities of R are extended through user-created ''packages'', which allow specialized statistical techniques, graphical devices, import/export capabilities, reporting tools, etc. These packages are developed primarily in R, and sometimes in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Fortran]]. A core set of packages are included with the installation of R, with more than 4300 ({{as of|2011|3|lc=on}}) available at the [http://cran.r-project.org/ Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)], [[Bioconductor]], and other repositories.  
&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;{{cite web 
| url = http://sites.google.com/site/r4statistics/popularity
| author= Robert A. Muenchen
| title = The Popularity of Data Analysis Software
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The  [http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/  &quot;Task Views&quot;] page (subject list) on the CRAN website lists the wide range of applications (Finance, Genetics, Machine Learning, Medical Imaging, Social Sciences and Spatial statistics) to which R has been applied and for which packages are available.

Other R package resources include Crantastic, a community site for rating and reviewing all CRAN packages, and also R-Forge, a central platform for the collaborative development of R packages, R-related software, and projects. It hosts many unpublished, beta packages, and development versions of CRAN packages.

The [[Bioconductor]] project provides R packages for the analysis of genomic data, such as [[Affymetrix]] and [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] [[microarray]] object-oriented data handling and analysis tools, and has started to provide tools for analysis of data from next-generation [[high-throughput sequencing]] methods.

Reproducible research and automated report generation can be accomplished with packages such as Sweave and odfWeave that support 
execution of R code embedded within [[LaTeX]], [[OpenDocument|OpenDocument format]] and other markups&lt;ref&gt;http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Scripting languages ===
R functionality has been made accessible from several scripting languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (by the RPy&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpy.sourceforge.net RPy home page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; interface package), [[Perl]] (by the Statistics::R&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.cpan.org/~gmpassos/Statistics-R-0.02/lib/Statistics/R.pm Statistics::R page on [[CPAN]]]&lt;/ref&gt; module) and [[Ruby_(programming_language)|Ruby]] (with the rsruby&lt;ref&gt;[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rsruby/ RSRuby rubyforge project]&lt;/ref&gt; [[rubygem]]).
Scripting in R itself is possible via littler&lt;ref&gt;[http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/littler.html littler web site]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as via Rscript.

== Comparison with SAS, SPSS and Stata ==

The general consensus is that R compares well with other popular statistical packages, such as [[SAS_(software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]] and [[Stata]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/technicalreports/Number1/R_relative_statpack.pdf Comparison of R to SAS, Stata and SPSS]&lt;/ref&gt;. In January 2009, the ''[[New York Times]]'' ran an article about R gaining acceptance among data analysts and presenting a potential threat for the market share occupied by commercial statistical packages, such as SAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | title=Data Analysts Captivated by R's Power | date=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial support for R ==
In 2007, [[Revolution Analytics]] was founded to provide commercial support for Revolution R, its distribution of R which also includes components developed by the company.
