==Premise==
{{expand section|date=February 2011}}
The show revolves around a group of three children (two boys and a girl) who are pirates in Never Land (vs. Peter Pan's Neverland), looking for treasure. Their main obstacle is [[Captain Hook#Disney|Captain Hook]], [[Smee]], and Captain Hook's feared nemesis, Tick-Tock the Crocodile from Disney's [[Peter Pan]] franchise. Captain Hook usually sees Jake and his crew doing something fun and steals it from them, and Jake and his crew have to get it back. After they succeed, Jake and his crew count their [[Doubloon|gold doubloons]] (which they receive after solving each &quot;pirate problem&quot;).    

Each program contains two eleven minute animated episodes, followed by a live-action song by the [[Captain Bogg and Salty|Never Land Pirate Band]]. The singing characters &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;Sharky&quot; appear in both animated and live action forms.

==Reception==
The series received generally positive but lukewarm reviews.  A review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it &quot;[p]art video game, part interactive cartoon, part advertisement for 'Peter Pan' merchandise&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944630|title=Jake and the Never Land Pirates|author=Brian Lowry|publisher=''Variety''|published=02-15-2011|accessdate=2011-04-24|date=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that Captain Hook &quot;has been laundered â reasonably enough, yet sadly as well â into a shell of his former self, too silly to be frightening, not even a decent bully, just a kind of (much) older boy who wants to steal your toys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/15/entertainment/la-et-jake-and-pirates-20110215|publisher=''The Los Angeles Times''|title=Television review: 'Jake and the Never Land Pirates'|author=Robert Lloyd|published=02-15-2011|accessdate=2011-04-24|date=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Common Sense Media]] rated it &quot;on&quot; for ages 3 and older, praising the educational content, role models, and especially the messages of the show, and expressing only mild concern about the moderate violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/jake-and-never-land-pirates|title=Jake and the Never Land Pirates|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the flagship of the newly-launched Disney Junior channel, the series was rated the most-watched program among boys ages 2â5 during its first few weeks on the air, with 2.9 million viewers, including 1.1 million ages 2â5, and over 600,000 women ages 18â49 (presumed to be mothers and other caregivers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/04/12/disney-junior%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cjake-and-the-never-land-pirates%E2%80%9D-sails-to-series-highs-on-saturday/89175|author=Disney press release|title=&quot;Jake and the Never Land Pirates&quot; Hit Series Highs on April 9|published=04-13-2011|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, the series was awarded #2 of the Best TV Shows 2011 list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenjunkies.com/tv/tv-lists/best-tv-shows-2011/]&lt;/ref&gt;
