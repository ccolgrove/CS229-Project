'''Gardena''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 58,829 at the 2010 census, up from 57,746 at the 2000 census.

==Geography==
Gardena is located at {{Coord|33|53|37|N|118|18|28|W|type:city}} (33.893615, -118.307841).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.9|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of which is land.

Gardena is bordered by [[Athens, California|Athens]] on the north, the [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, California|Harbor Gateway]] on the east and south, [[Torrance, California|Torrance]] on the southwest, [[Alondra Park, California|Alondra Park]] on the west, and [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]] on the northwest.

==History==
Based on archaeological findings, [[Tongva people|Tongva Indians]] hunted and fished in the area of today's Gardena.&lt;ref name=Gardena&gt;{{cite book|last=Gardena Heritage Committee|title=Gardena|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|page=7|year=2006|isbn=9780738546766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tongva Indians â also known as Gabrielino Indians â are probably descendants of those who crossed from Asia to North America around 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt;

In 1784, three years after the foundation of [[Los Angeles]], [[Manuel Dominguez#Juan Jose Dominguez|Juan Jose Dominguez]] (1736â1809), a [[Spain|Spanish]] soldier who arrived in [[San Diego]], [[California]] in 1769 with [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]], in recognition of his military service, received the roughly {{convert|43000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Spanish land grant, the [[Rancho San Pedro]].  Part of this land contained what became known as Gardena Valley.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt; After the [[American Civil War]] veterans bought parts of the land, soon ranchers and farmers followed suit.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt; Union Army Major General [[William Rosecrans|William Starke Rosecrans]] in 1869 bought {{convert|16000|acre|km2}}. The &quot;Rosecrans Rancho,&quot; was bordered by what later was Florence Avenue on the north, Redondo Beach Boulevard on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and Arlington Avenue on the west. The Rosecrans property was sub divided and sold in the early 1870s. One of those became the {{convert|650|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Dominique Amestoy|Amestoy Ranch]]. Gardena proper began in 1887 when the Pomeroy &amp; Harrison real estate developers subdivided the ranch, and-anticipating that the coming of the Los Angeles and Redondo Railway. Civil War veteran Spencer Roane Thorpe is credited with starting the first settlement in Gardena in 1887.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt;  Railroads put Gardena on the map following a real estate boom in the Los Angeles area in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt; Some believe the city was named for its reputation for being the only &quot;green spot&quot; in the dry season between Los Angeles and the sea.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt;  Because of its acres of berries, the city was dubbed &quot;Berryland&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt; The Strawberry Day Festival and Parade was held each May annually.&lt;ref name=Gardena/&gt; The berry industry suffered at the time of [[World War I]] as other crops were supported by the [[war economy]].&lt;ref name=Eight&gt;Gardena, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Japanese American]]s settled in Gardena throughout its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/gardena/faq.html#q5 Frequently Asked Questions: Gardena] [[County of Los Angeles Public Library]]. Retrieved on March 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only way Gardena could protect itself from a heavy county tax imposed on a planned project at a park site was to incorporate.&lt;ref name=Eight/&gt; The City of Gardena became incorporated on September 11, 1930.&lt;ref name=Eight/&gt;
