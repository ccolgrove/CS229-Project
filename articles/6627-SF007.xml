The '''Common Desktop Environment''' ('''CDE''') is a [[desktop environment]] for [[Unix]] and [[OpenVMS]], based on the [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif widget toolkit]].

== History ==
=== Corporate history ===

[[SunSoft, Inc.|SunSoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]] and [[Unix System Laboratories|USL]] announced CDE in June 1993 as a joint development within the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) initiative.  The primary environment was based on HP's [[VUE]] (Visual User Environment), itself derived from the [[Motif Window Manager]] (mwm).  IBM contributed its [[Common User Access]] model and [[Workplace Shell]].  [[Novell]] provided desktop manager components and scalable systems technologies from [[UNIX System V]].  Sun contributed its [[ToolTalk]] application interaction framework and a port of its [[DeskSet]] productivity tools, including mail and  calendar clients, from its [[OpenWindows]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1994 CDE became the responsibility of the &quot;new OSF&quot;, a merger of the [[Open Software Foundation]] and [[Unix International]];&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
in September 1995, the merger of Motif and CDE into a single project, CDE/Motif, was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Until about 2000, users of Unix desktops regarded CDE as the ''[[de facto]]'' standard, but at that time, other desktop environments such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] were quickly becoming mature, and became almost universal on the [[Linux]] platform, which already had a larger user base than most commercial Unixes in total.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  [[Red Hat]] is the only Linux distribution to which CDE has been ported, although it has since been phased out in favour of GNOME. However CDE code can still be bought and compiled on any UNIX or UNIX-like OS.

In 2001, Sun Microsystems announced that they would phase out CDE as the standard [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] desktop environment in favor of GNOME. Solaris 10, released in early 2005, includes both CDE and the GNOME-based [[Java Desktop System]].  Future releases of Solaris will be based on the [[OpenSolaris]] open source project, which states that there is no plan to make the Solaris CDE &quot;consolidation&quot; (OS component) available as open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hewlett-Packard|HP's]] [[OpenVMS]] uses CDE as its standard desktop environment.

The Open Group released Motif in 2000 as [[OpenMotif]] under a &quot;revenue sharing&quot; license that does not fully meet either the [[Open Source Definition|open source]] or [[Free software licence|free software]] definitions. (The Open Group had wished to make it open source, but did not quite succeed in achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Xfce]] desktop at one time took part of its [[look and feel]] from the CDE environment, but no longer does.

OpenCDE, an open source project to replicate CDE, was started in early 2010.  The project intends to reproduce the [[look and feel]], organization, and feature set of CDE without using any CDE-derived code.&lt;ref&gt;
