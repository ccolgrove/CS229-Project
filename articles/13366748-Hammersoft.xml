Texas A&amp;M University's unique [[History of Texas A&amp;M University|history]] as an all male military institution has led to a unique [[traditions of Texas A&amp;M University|traditions]] and terminology. Some phrases come from traditions that include [[Aggie Bonfire]] and the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies|athletics]] program.  Others phrases are locations and landmarks around the [[Campus of Texas A&amp;M University|campus]]. While most of these terms are used exclusively by Aggies, some are used by the university's rivals. Terms exclusively used by the Corps of Cadets are not included to narrow the list size.
