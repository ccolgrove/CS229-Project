'''Humanity First''' is an international [[charitable trust]] established to promote and safeguard the preservation of human life and dignity. The organisation works with vulnerable communities in over 40 countries spanning 6 continents, and is now registered in 33 countries. The organisation is run by volunteers around the world, and even in operations, expert medical, engineering, educational and technical staff often pay their own way to support international projects. The organisation cites efficiencies through the extensive use of volunteers, partnerships and global sourcing resulting in over 90% of funds going straight to projects, and the actual aid value (including free man-hours of doctors, engineers etc) delivered is significantly (often 50 times) greater than the value of donations received.

==Objectives==
* Relieve suffering caused by natural disasters or man-made conflicts
* Promote peace and understanding based upon mutual tolerance and respect
* Strengthen people's capacity to help themselves

== Origins ==
The concept of Humanity First originates from a desire to provide aid on the basis of need alone, irrespective of race, religion, colour or political allegiance. The organisation was established in the UK and formally registered in 1994.

In two decades, Humanity First has grown into a multi-national aid agency and non-profit charitable organisation, regularly working alongside many other agencies such as the [[Red Cross]], [[Oxfam]], [[Save the Children]] and others. The organisation has access to thousands of volunteers across the globe. Humanity First also now has Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the [[United Nations]].

The organization splits its work into two areas; disaster relief and long-term sustainable projects.

== Human Development ==

''Restoring Communities, Building a Future'' are the guiding principles for Humanity First USA. Humanity First works to assist people afflicted by natural disasters, war, and poverty by first providing the needed disaster relief services and then by building capacity of these communities. Our aim is to restore dignity by providing the resources to help people get back on their feet quickly.

Approach: Humanity First approaches its human development projects with sustainability as the overarching goal. The projects are rooted in a community deeply affected by a natural disaster, war, or poverty. After the relief phase of the project has subsided, Humanity First works with the community to identify viable opportunities for growth and recovery.

Programs: Human development programs can be categorized under the categories of: 1) Health &amp; Medical Programs, or 2) Educational &amp; Vocational Programs
Health &amp; Medical: Designed to provide much needed health and medical services and supplies to some of the world's most vulnerable populations.

Educational &amp; Vocational Programs: Designed to help create capacity and self sufficiency through providing support for primary education for children and vocational training for adults in various under-privileged communities in the US and around the world

== Disaster relief ==
Disaster relief covers the provision of humanitarian aid, medical relief, shelter, food and safe water in response to both man-made and natural disasters. Examples in the last 10 years include responses to the following: [[Kobe earthquake]] in Japan, [[Kosovo War]], [[1999 Ä°zmit earthquake]] in Turkey, [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]] in [[Indonesia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indonesia-relief.org/mod.php?mod=bank&amp;op=infobank&amp;bankid=355 Tsunami Relief Database - Humanity First International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentsector.org/relief/main.html Independent Sector | Charitable Organizations Respond to Tsunami Crisis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sri Lanka, [[Hurricane Katrina]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/07/america/NA-GEN-US-Katrina-Qatar.php ''International Herald Tribune'' news report on Katrina]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/campaigns/2005/11nov/051102aid.shtml Journalism jobs and news from Holdthefrontpage.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/shape/graphics/2006/01/23/060123a.htm SHAPE Media Library: Sweets and X-rays - 23 January 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in Pakistan.

== Long-term projects ==

Humanity First runs a number of long-term projects largely in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]:

*Feed a Family - provision of basic necessities to deserving and vulnerable families, normally for a fixed period of 6 months. Over 700 Tonnes of food and aid has been shipped to Africa for poor families. HF is now establishing a Feed a Village program; it has also established a Feed the Homeless program in the heart of Montreal.

*Water for Life - set up or repair of water pumps to provide clean and safe drinking water to remote villages in the 3rd world. Humanity First are working on these projects with [[Water Aid]] and IAAAE and have built or refurbished over 420 pumps and filter units in [[West Africa]], Latin America and Asia.
*Learn a Skill - training in IT or tailoring. IT training results in certification, and tailoring leads to the provision of a sewing machine and assistance in setting up a tailoring business. In both cases, the aim is to leave students self-sufficient. So far, over 20,000 students have graduated from the 23 vocational training centres across 12 countries.
*Orphan Care - running and support of orphanages covering the needs of orphans including accommodation, education, food, clothing and health. Orphan programmes are currently running in the [[Gambia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Indonesia]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Benin]].
*Gift of Sight - work with a network of hospitals to provide sight treatment ranging from glasses, treatment of infections and in extreme cases, operations to rectify cataracts.
