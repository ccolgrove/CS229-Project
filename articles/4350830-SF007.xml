'''Kororaa''' is a remix of the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] [[GNU/Linux]] distribution. Originally Kororaa was a binary installation method for [[Gentoo Linux]] which aimed for easy installation of a Gentoo system by using install scripts instead of manual configuration. The name is an alternate spelling for the [[MÄori language|MÄori]] word,  &quot;kororÄ&quot; - the [[Little Penguin]].  Kororaa was pre-configured for [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] capable processors.

==History==
Kororaa was started by [[Chris Smart|Christopher Smart]] as a method to quickly reproduce a [[Gentoo Linux]] installation on multiple desktop machines.  Chris also intended that Kororaa be used to quickly demonstrate the power of [[Gentoo Linux]] to users critical of 'compile times.'  On November 7, 2007, Chris announced that he was discontinuing his work on the project, and that there would be no new versions of Kororaa.

The introduction of the Kororaa XGL Live CD was intended to demonstrate the capabilities of [[Novell]]'s  [[Xgl]] and [[Compiz]].

On December 23, 2010, Chris Smart has announced rebirth of Kororaa as Fedora Remix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kororaa.org/2010/12/kororaa-is-back/|title=Kororaa is back}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kororaa XGL Live CD==
[[Image:Xgl cube.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Xgl abilities of the Kororaa Live CD]]
In March 2006, a Kororaa based [[Live CD]] was released, preconfigured with [[Xgl]] capabilities. The live CD supports NVIDIA, ATI and Intel graphics cards, and the latest version (0.3) comes with both [[KDE]] and [[GNOME]].

== Kororaa XGL Live CD and the GPL ==
In May 2006 an unnamed kernel developer sent an email to Christopher Smart, Kororaa's leader, suggesting that packaging the proprietary [[NVIDIA]] and [[ATI Technologies|fglrx]] drivers was a violation of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] as they take GPL code from the kernel and build it into a non-GPL kernel module, qualifying as a derived work. This caused Smart to temporarily remove the CD image from his website in August 2006 [http://kororaa.org/static.php?page=gpl].

Two months later, version (0.3) was released, and all proprietary drivers were removed by request. Because of this, only limited ATI and NVIDIA graphics card support was included.

== Development hiatus and restart ==
On November 7, 2007, Smart announced that development on Kororaa would be ended, and no further versions would be released;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kororaa.org/comments.php?y=07&amp;m=11&amp;entry=entry071107-225645|title=Kororaa Project - No more Kororaa|accessdate=9 November 2007|archivedate=9 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071109171217/http://kororaa.org/comments.php?y=07&amp;m=11&amp;entry=entry071107-225645}}&lt;/ref&gt; reasons given were that
* [[Sabayon Linux]] already serves a purpose as a binary Gentoo distribution
* Gentoo already comes with a GUI installer
* Compiz is already installed on most desktop distributions by default
* Kororaa couldn't compete with other distributions which include non-free drivers by default.
* the weight of the project was too much for a single developer.

On December 23, 2010, Smart announced the restart of Kororaa with a release of the Fedora-based version of the distro: &quot;&quot;I know that you'll be looking for something Linux related to do over your Christmas holidays and New Year, so I've just released the first installable live DVD beta for testing. The final release will be Kororaa 14 (derived from Fedora 14), code-named 'Nemo'. As with the original Kororaa, it's based on KDE. Essentially, Kororaa has been reborn as a Fedora remix, inspired by Rahul Sundaram's Omega GNOME remix. It aims to provide all general computing uses out of the box and it aims to include software packages that most users will want.&quot;
