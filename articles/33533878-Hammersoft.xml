The '''2012 [[NAB Cup]]''' will be an [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) pre-season competition that is played before the [[2012 AFL season#Premiership season|2012 home and away season]]. The games will be played between 18 February and 18 March. The first group of matches will be between {{AFL Haw}}, {{AFL Ric}} and {{AFL Nor}} in Melbourne at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]].  

This year's competition format will be similar to the format used in the previous year and once again will feature eighteen teams. As part of this year's competition, the NAB Regional Challenge will dissolve, with matches to be staged at both regular AFL venues and select regional centres. All matches will count equally with four points for a win and percentage also being taken into account. The two best-performed teams over the three rounds (two shortened and two full games) will play off in the NAB Cup Grand Final on 17 March. The sixteen clubs who don't make the Grand Final will play one last NAB Cup match at various metropolitan locations across Australia in week 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/125474/default.aspx|title=Giant NAB Cup test for GWS|date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Australian Football League|AFL]].com.au|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format for the 2012 NAB Cup will be as follows:
*'''Weeks 1 and 2:''' ''The eighteen teams are split into six pools of three teams each. The three teams in each pool play each other in games of two 20 minute halves, with all three games being played over a three hour period at the one venue.''
*'''Weeks 3 and 4''': ''The eighteen teams will play a full length match each week in either metropolitan or regional areas.''
*'''Week 5:''' ''The two best ranked teams will play in the NAB Cup [[Grand Final]]. The other sixteen teams will play a full length match in either metropolitan or regional areas.''
