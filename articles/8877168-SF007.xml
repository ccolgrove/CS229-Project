In November 2010, WikiLeaks collaborated with major global media organisations to release [[United States diplomatic cables leak|U.S. State department diplomatic cables]] in redacted format. The release was nicknamed CableGate. On 1 September 2011, it became public that an encrypted version of WikiLeaks' huge archive of unredacted U.S. State Department cables had been available via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bittorrent]] for months, and that the decryption key (similar to a password) was available to those who knew where to look. WikiLeaks blamed the breach on its former partner, ''[[The Guardian]]'', and that newspaper's journalist [[David Leigh]], who revealed the key in a book published in February 2011;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikileaks.org/Guardian-journalist-negligently.html Guardian journalist negligently disclosed Cablegate passwords].

==History==
===Founding===
The wikileaks.org domain name was registered on 4 October 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;whois&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Whois Search Results: wikileaks.org|url=http://who.godaddy.com/WhoIs.aspx?domain=wikileaks.org&amp;isc=ALEXADOM|work=GoDaddy.com|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was unveiled, and published its first document, in December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=WikiLeaks' War on Secrecy: Truth's Consequences |date=2 December 2010 |author=Calabresi, Massimo |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2034276-3,00.html |work=Time |location =New York |accessdate=19 December 2010 |quote=Reportedly spurred by the leak of the Pentagon papers, Assange unveiled WikiLeaks in December 2006.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khatchdourian&quot;/&gt; WikiLeaks has been predominantly represented in public since January 2007 by [[Julian Assange]], who is now generally recognised as the &quot;founder of WikiLeaks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/rudd-government-blacklist-hacker-monitors-police/story-e6frg8yx-1225718288350 |title=Rudd Government blacklist hacker monitors police |work=The Australian |location =Sydney |author=Guilliatt, Richard |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] magazine, a volunteer said that Assange described himself in a private conversation as &quot;the heart and soul of this organisation, its founder, philosopher, [[spokesperson]], original coder, organizer, financier, and all the rest&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html |work=The New York Times |title=WikiLeaks Founder on the Run, Trailed by Notoriety |date=23 October 2010 |last1=Burns |first1=John F. |last2=Somaiya |first2=Ravi |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks relies heavily on volunteers and previously described its founders as a mix of Chinese dissidents, journalists, mathematicians, and start-up company technologists from the United States, [[Taiwan]], Europe, [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutwikileaks&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:About |title=Wikileaks:About |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=3 June 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080314204422/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About |archivedate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was originally launched as a user-editable [[wiki]] (hence its name), but has progressively moved towards a more traditional publication model and no longer accepts either user comments or edits. {{As of|2009|6}}, the site had over 1,200 registered volunteers&lt;ref name=aboutwikileaks/&gt; and listed an advisory board comprising Assange and eight other people, some of which denied any association with the organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ab&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rintoul |first=Stuart |title=WikiLeaks advisory board 'pretty clearly window-dressing' |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/wikileaks-advisory-board-pretty-clearly-window-dressing/story-e6frg6nf-1225967895242 |accessdate=18 December 2010 |newspaper=The Australian |location=Sydney |date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/04/wikileaks-julian-assange-iraq-video?page=2 Inside WikiLeaksâ Leak Factory].

===Purpose===
The WikiLeaks website says their goal is &quot;to bring important news and information to the public... One of our most important activities is to publish original source material alongside our news stories so readers and historians alike can see evidence of the truth.&quot;

Another of the organisation's goals is to ensure that [[whistleblower]]s and journalists are not jailed for emailing sensitive or classified documents. The online &quot;drop box&quot; (currently not functioning) was designed to &quot;provide an innovative, secure and anonymous way for sources to leak information to our journalists.&quot;

In an interview on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', Assange discussed the limit to the freedom of speech, saying, &quot;[it is] not an ultimate freedom, however free speech is what regulates government and regulates law. That is why in the [[US Constitution]] the Bill of Rights says that Congress is to make no such law abridging the freedom of the press. It is to take the rights of the press outside the rights of the law because those rights are superior to the law because in fact they create the law. Every constitution, every bit of legislation is derived from the flow of information. Similarly every government is elected as a result of people understanding things&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/260785/april-12-2010/exclusive---julian-assange-extended-interview |publisher= Colbert Nation |date= 12 April 2010 |title =Exclusive&amp;nbsp;â Julian Assange Extended Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has drawn comparisons to [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s leaking of the [[Pentagon Papers]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxworldWikileaks1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bradner |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Bradner |title=Wikileaks: a site for exposure |url=http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2007/011706bradner.html?page=1 |accessdate=19 December 2010 |newspaper=[[Network World]] |location =Framingham, MA |date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the leaking of some documents may be legally protected. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has ruled that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees anonymity, at least in the area of [[political discourse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxworldWikileaks1&quot;/&gt; Author and journalist [[Whitley Strieber]] has spoken about the benefits of the WikiLeaks project, noting that &quot;Leaking a government document can mean jail, but jail sentences for this can be fairly short. However, there are many places where it means long incarceration or even death, such as China and parts of Africa and the Middle East.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=How to be a Whistle Blower |url=http://www.unknowncountry.com/news/how-be-whistle-blower |work=Unknowncountry.com |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
According to a January 2010 interview, the WikiLeaks team then consisted of five people working full-time and about 800 people who worked occasionally, none of whom were compensated.&lt;ref name=&quot;leakonomy&quot;/&gt; WikiLeaks has no official headquarters.

WikiLeaks describes itself as &quot;an uncensorable system for untraceable mass document leaking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jul/14/julian-assange-whistleblower-wikileaks |title=Julian Assange: the whistleblower |work=The Guardian |location=London |author=Moss, Stephen |date=14 July 2010|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is available on multiple servers and different [[domain name]]s following a number of [[denial-of-service attack]]s and its severance from different [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) providers.&lt;ref name=&quot;satter&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Satter |first=Raphael G. |title=WikiLeaks fights to stay online amid attacks |url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/12/03/technology-wikileaks_8180890.html?boxes=Homepagebusinessnews |accessdate=11 December 2010 |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |location =New York |date=3 December 2010 |author2=Svensson, Peter|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/wikileaks-hit-by-new-online-onslaught-2151570.html |title=WikiLeaks hit by new online onslaught |last1=Randall |first1=David|last2=Cooper|first2=Charlie |date=5 December 2010 |work=The Independent |accessdate=4 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was hosted by [[PRQ]], a Sweden-based company providing &quot;highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services&quot;.

He talks about the [[Constitution of Sweden|Swedish constitution]], which gives the information providers total legal protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN1&quot; /&gt; It is forbidden according to Swedish law for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=DÃ¤rfÃ¶r blir Julian Assange kolumnist i Aftonbladet |language=Swedish |author=Helin, Jan |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] (blog) |location =Stockholm |date=14 August 2010 |url=http://blogg.aftonbladet.se/janhelin/2010/08/darfor-blir-julian-assange-kolumnist-i-aftonbladet |accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authorities to take WikiLeaks offline; they place an onus of proof upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, &quot;WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade [[encryption]] to protect sources and other confidential information.&quot; Such arrangements have been called &quot;[[bulletproof hosting]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;goodwin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/25/what-is-wikileaks/?iref=storysearch |title=What is WikiLeaks? |work =This Just In (CNN blog) |date=25 July 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2010, it was announced that the Swedish [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] would be hosting and managing many of WikiLeaks' new servers. The party donates servers and bandwidth to WikiLeaks without charge. Technicians of the party would make sure that the servers are maintained and working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=TT |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/piratpartiet-skoter-wikileak-servrar-1.1155285 |title=Piratpartiet skÃ¶ter Wikileak-servrar |language=Swedish |trans_title=Pirate Party manages Wikileaks&lt;!-- sic! --&gt; Servers |work= Dagens Nyheter |location =Stockholm |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Swedish Pirate Party to host WikiLeaks servers |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/08/18/sweden.wikileaks/#fbid=zfd5Igi2Lea&amp;wom=false |accessdate=21 August 2010 |work =CNN |date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the site became the target of a [[denial-of-service attack]] from a hacker on its old servers, WikiLeaks moved its site to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s servers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last= Gross |first=Doug |title=WikiLeaks cut off from Amazon servers |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/12/01/wikileaks.amazon/index.html?eref=edition |work=CNN |accessdate=2 December 2010 |date=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, the website was &quot;ousted&quot; from the Amazon servers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon&quot; /&gt; In a public statement, Amazon said that WikiLeaks was not following its terms of service. The company further explained, &quot;There were several parts they were violating. For example, our terms of service state that 'you represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content... that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity.'

On 4 November 2010, Julian Assange told Swiss public television [[TÃ©lÃ©vision Suisse Romande|TSR]] that he is seriously considering seeking [[Right of asylum|political asylum]] in neutral [[Switzerland]] and setting up a WikiLeaks foundation to move the operation there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tsr.ch/info/suisse/2657308-julian-assange-compte-demander-l-asile-en-suisse.html |title=Julian Assange compte demander l'asile en Suisse |work=TSR |location =Geneva |date=4 November 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A369920101104 |title=WikiLeaks founder says may seek Swiss asylum |work=Reuters |author =Nebehay, Stephanie |date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Assange, Switzerland and [[Iceland]] are the only countries where WikiLeaks would feel safe to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.orf.at/stories/2023751/ |title=WikiLeaks-GrÃ¼nder erwÃ¤gt Umzug in die Schweiz |work=ORF |location =Vienna |date=5 November 2010 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=WikiLeaks Founder to Release Thousands of Documents on Lebanon  |newspaper=[[Al-Manar]] |location =Beirut |date=5 November 2010 |url=http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=161016&amp;language=en |accessdate=28 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Name servers===
WikiLeaks had been using EveryDNS's services, which led to [[DDoS]] attacks on the host.{{clarify|date=December 2010|reason=reword to make clear what host is meant and why using EveryDNS led to DDoS}} The attacks affected the quality of service at EveryDNS, so the company withdrew its service from WikiLeaks. Pro-WikiLeaks supporters retaliated by launching a DDoS attack against EveryDNS. Because of mistakes in the blogosphere, some supporters accidentally mistook EasyDNS for EveryDNS and a sizable internet backlash against EasyDNS ensued. Afterwards EasyDNS decided to provide WikiLeaks its name server service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Canadian firm caught up in Wiki wars |first=Steve |last=Ladurantaye |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/canadian-firm-caught-up-in-wiki-wars/article1830732/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location =Toronto |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verification of submissions===
WikiLeaks states that it has never released a misattributed document. Documents are assessed before release. In response to concerns about the possibility of misleading or fraudulent leaks, WikiLeaks has stated that misleading leaks &quot;are already well-placed in the mainstream media. WikiLeaks is of no additional assistance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Trapido |first=Michael |title=Wikileaks: Is Julian Assange a hero, villain or simply dangerously naÃ¯ve? |url=http://www.newstime.co.za/WorldNews/Wikileaks_:_Is_Julian_Assange_a_hero_villain_or_simply_dangerously_na%C3%AFve/16065/ |accessdate=18 December 2010 |newspaper=NewsTime |location =Johannesburg |date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAQ states that: &quot;The simplest and most effective countermeasure is a worldwide community of informed users and editors who can scrutinise and discuss leaked documents.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.org/faq-en |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070701115958/http://wikileaks.org/faq-en |archivedate=1 July 2007 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to statements by Assange in 2010, submitted documents are vetted by a group of five reviewers, with expertise in different fields such as language or programming, who also investigate the background of the leaker if his or her identity is known.&lt;ref name=&quot;motherjones3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/04/wikileaks-julian-assange-iraq-video?page=3 |title=Inside WikiLeaks' Leak Factory |work= Mother Jones |location =San Francisco |date= 6 April 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2010 |author= Kushner, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that group, Assange has the final decision about the assessment of a document.&lt;ref name=motherjones3/&gt;

===Legal status===
====Legal background====
The legal status of WikiLeaks is complex. Assange considers WikiLeaks a whistleblower protection intermediary. Rather than leaking directly to the press, and fearing exposure and retribution, whistleblowers can leak to WikiLeaks, which then leaks to the press for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Light |first=Gilead |work=The Great Debate (blog) |publisher=Reuters |title=The WikiLeaks story and criminal liability under the espionage laws |date=26 August 2010 |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2010/08/26/the-wikileaks-story-and-criminal-liability-under-the-espionage-laws/ |accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its servers are located throughout Europe and are accessible from any uncensored web connection.

====Potential criminal prosecution====
The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] opened a criminal probe of WikiLeaks and founder Julian Assange shortly after the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leak of diplomatic cables]] began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage20101201&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Savage |first=Charlie |title=U.S. Weighs Prosecution of WikiLeaks Founder, but Legal Scholars Warn of Steep Hurdles |date=1 December 2010 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/world/02legal.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WPost&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Yost |first=Pete |title=Holder says WikiLeaks under criminal investigation |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/29/holder-says-wikileaks-criminal-investigation/ |accessdate=5 December 2010 |work =Fox News |date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] affirmed the probe was &quot;not sabre-rattling&quot;, but was &quot;an active, ongoing criminal investigation.&quot;&lt;ref name=WPost /&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reported that the department was considering charges under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]], a move which former prosecutors characterised as &quot;difficult&quot; because of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections for the press.&lt;ref name=Savage20101201 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nakashima&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |coauthor=Markon, Jerry |title=WikiLeaks founder could be charged under Espionage Act |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112905973.html |accessdate=5 December 2010 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Supreme Court cases have previously established that the American constitution protects the re-publication of illegally gained information provided the publishers did not themselves break any laws in acquiring it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/07/26/pentagon-papers-ii-on-wikileaks-and-the-first-amendment/ |accessdate =6 December 2010 |date=26 July 2010| title= Pentagon Papers II?

In Australia, the government and the [[Australian Federal Police]] have not stated what Australian laws may have been broken by WikiLeaks, but Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] has stated that the foundation of WikiLeaks and the stealing of classified documents from the US administration is illegal in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |title=Gillard refines verdict on Assange |first=Julia |last=Gillard |date=7 December 2010 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2010/s3086783.htm |interviewer=Lyndal Curtis |program=[[The World Today]] |callsign=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Radio]] (Australia) |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillard later clarified her statement as referring to &quot;the original theft of the material by a junior US serviceman rather than any action by Mr Assange.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Patricia |last=Karvelas |title=Party revolt growing over Prime Minister Julia Gillard's WikiLeaks stance |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location =Sydney |date=14 December 2010 |url= http://www.news.com.au/features/wikileaks/party-revolt-at-pms-wiki-stance/story-fn79cf6x-1225970594165 |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer Zifcak, President of Liberty Victoria, an Australian civil liberties group, notes that with no charge, and no trial completed, it is inappropriate to state that WikiLeaks is guilty of illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |subject=Robinson, Jennifer |subject2=Zifcak, Spencer |subject3= Saul, Ben |title=Law experts say WikiLeaks in the clear |quote=&quot;There is no charge and there has been no trial and even given all of those things the Prime Minister had the confidence to say that Mr Assange was guilty of illegality.

On threats by various governments toward Assange, legal expert [[Ben Saul]] argues that founder Julian Assange is the target of a global smear campaign to demonise him as a criminal or as a terrorist, without any legal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lauder|2010}}: statement by Dr [[Ben Saul]], director of the Centre for International Law at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] has issued a statement highlighting its alarm at the &quot;multiple examples of legal overreach and irregularities&quot; in his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-statement-arrest-of-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange |title=Statement on Arrest of WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange |publisher=[[Center for Constitutional Rights]] |location =New York |date =7 December 2010 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance file===
On 29 July 2010, WikiLeaks added a 1.4 GB &quot;Insurance File&quot; to the Afghan War Diary page. The file is [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] encrypted and there has been speculation that it was intended to serve as insurance in case the WikiLeaks website or its spokesman Julian Assange are incapacitated, upon which the [[passphrase]] could be published, similar to the concept of a [[dead man's switch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_insurance&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Zetter |first=Kim |title=WikiLeaks Posts Mysterious 'Insurance' File |date =30 July 2010 |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/wikileaks-insurance-file/ |work=Wired |location =New York |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_dns_insuranceaes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Victoria |last=Ward |title=WikiLeaks website disconnected as US company withdraws support|date=3 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8178457/WikiLeaks-website-disconnected-as-US-company-withdraws-support.html |accessdate=3 December 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uhylLWl9 |archivedate=3 December 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first few days' release of the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US diplomatic cables]] starting 28 November 2010, the US television broadcaster [[CBS]] predicted that &quot;If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files.

===Financing===
WikiLeaks is a non-profit organisation, largely supported by volunteers, and it is dependent on public donations. Its main financing methods include conventional [[Wire transfer|bank transfers]] and [[E-commerce payment system|online payment systems]]. Annual expenses have been estimated at about â¬200,000, mainly for servers and bureaucracy, but might reportedly reach â¬600,000 if work currently done by volunteers were paid for.&lt;ref name=&quot;leakonomy&quot;/&gt; 

WikiLeaks lawyers often work pro bono, and in some cases legal support has been donated by media organisations such as the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leakonomy&quot;/&gt; WikiLeaks only revenue stream is donations, but it has considered other options including an auction model to sell early access to documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;leakonomy&quot;/&gt; In September 2011, Wikileaks began auctioning items on Ebay to raise funds, and Assange told an audience at Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas that the organisation might not be able to survive.
====Funding model====
The [[Wau Holland Foundation]] helps to process donations to WikiLeaks. In July 2010, the Foundation  stated that WikiLeaks was receiving no money for personnel costs, only for hardware, travelling and bandwidth.&lt;ref name=&quot;techeye&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.techeye.net/internet/wau-holland-foundation-sheds-light-on-wikileaks-donations#ixzz0td0dXhBx |title=Wau Holland Foundation sheds light on WikiLeaks donations&amp;nbsp;â Hardware, ISP, travelling costs |work= TechEye.net |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010 |author= Daly, John W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in [[TechEye]] stated: {{quote|As a charity accountable under German law, donations for WikiLeaks can be made to the foundation. Funds are held in escrow and are given to WikiLeaks after the whistleblower website files an application containing a statement with proof of payment.

However, in December 2010 the [[Wau Holland Foundation]] stated that 4 permanent employees, including Julian Assange, had begun to receive salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://m.thelocal.de/sci-tech/20101223-31975.html |work =The Local |location =Berlin |title=Wikileaks donations still flowing, but not to Assange legal fund |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 2009, WikiLeaks announced that it was experiencing a shortage of funds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/6995068005 |title=Twitter / WikiLeaks: To deal with a shortage of... |publisher=Twitter |date=24 December 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suspended all access to its website except for a form to submit new material.&lt;ref name=&quot;digdeep&quot;/&gt; Material that was previously published was no longer available, although some could still be accessed on unofficial [[Mirror (computing)|mirrors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WikiLeaks&amp;nbsp;â Mirrors |url=http://wikileaks.ch/Mirrors.html |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks stated on its website that it would resume full operation once the operational costs were covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;digdeep&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last= Butselaar |first=Emily |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jan/29/wikileaks-shut-down |title=Dig deep for WikiLeaks |work=The Guardian |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate =30 January 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks saw this as a kind of strike &quot;to ensure that everyone who is involved stops normal work and actually spends time raising revenue&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;leakonomy&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Leak-o-nomy: The Economy of Wikileaks (Interview with Julian Assange) |author=Mey, Stefan |url=http://stefanmey.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/leak-o-nomy-the-economy-of-wikileaks/|accessdate=19 December 2010 |work=Medien-Ãkonomie-Blog |date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the organisation initially planned for funds to be secured by 6 January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WikiLeaks |url=http://twitter.com/wikiLeaks |title=at 7:42&amp;nbsp;am 5&amp;nbsp;Jan 2010 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until 3 February 2010 that WikiLeaks announced that its minimum fundraising goal had been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/8613426708 |title=Twitter / Wikileaks: Achieved min. funraising g... |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2010, [[PayPal]] suspended WikiLeaks' donation account and froze its assets. WikiLeaks said that this had happened before, and was done for &quot;no obvious reason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/8101847372 |title=WikiLeaks: Paypal has again locked our... |publisher=Twitter|accessdate = 26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account was restored on 25 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/8192453527 |title=WikiLeaks: Paypal has freed up our... |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2010, WikiLeaks announced that its website and archive were back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/14270362566 |title=Wikileaks: Next milestone completed:... |publisher=Twitter|date=18 May 2010|accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, WikiLeaks was a finalist for a grant of more than half a million dollars from the [[John S. and James L.

In 2010, WikiLeaks received â¬635,772.73 in PayPal donations, less â¬30,000 in PayPal fees, and â¬695,925.46 in bank transfers.  â¬500,988.89 of the sum was received in the month of December, primarily as bank transfers as PayPal suspended payments December 4.  â¬298,057.38 of the remainder was received in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/0003/wl-finance-en.pdf|title=&quot;Project 04: Enduring freedom of information&quot; Preliminary transparency report 2010|publisher=Wau-Holland-Stiftung (WHS) ''via'' [[Cryptome]] |date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wau Holland Foundation]], one of the WikiLeaks' main funding channels, stated that they received more than â¬900,000  in public donations between October 2009 and December 2010, out of which â¬370,000 has been passed on to WikiLeaks. Hendrik Fulda, vice president of the Wau Holland Foundation, mentioned that the Foundation had been receiving twice as many donations through [[PayPal]] as through normal banks, before PayPal's decision to suspend WikiLeaks' account.

In a 2009 ''[[Computerworld]]'' interview, Assange claimed to be in possession of &quot;5GB from [[Bank of America]]&quot;. In 2010 he told ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine that WikiLeaks was planning another &quot;megaleak&quot; early in 2011, from inside the private sector, involving &quot;a big U.S. bank&quot; and revealing an &quot;ecosystem of corruption&quot;.

In December 2010, Assange's lawyer, [[Mark Stephens (solicitor)|Mark Stephens]], told ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'' on BBC Television that WikiLeaks had information it considered to be a &quot;thermo-nuclear device&quot; which it would release if the organisation needs to defend itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11921080 |title=Wikileaks' Julian Assange to fight Swedish allegations |work=BBC News |date=5 December 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, [[Rudolf Elmer]], a former Swiss banker, passed on data containing account details of 2,000 prominent people to Assange, who stated that the information will be vetted before being made publicly available at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wikileaks given data on Swiss bank accounts |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12205690 |work=BBC News |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the WikiLeaks activists owned a server that was being used as a node for the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor network]]. Millions of secret transmissions passed through it. The activist noticed that hackers from China were using the network to gather foreign governmentsâ information, and began to record this traffic. Only a small fraction has ever been posted on WikiLeaks, but the initial tranche served as the site's foundation, and Assange was able to say, &quot;[w]e have received over one million documents from thirteen countries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Khatchdourian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Raffi |last=Khatchadourian |date=7 June 2010  |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?printable=true |title=No Secrets: Julian Assange's Mission for total transparency |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tranche#Noun |title=Wiktionary definition of tranche |publisher=En.wiktionary.org |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Assange responded to the suggestion that eavesdropping on Chinese hackers played a crucial part in the early days of WikiLeaks by saying &quot;the imputation is incorrect. The facts concern a 2006 investigation into Chinese espionage one of our contacts was involved in. Somewhere between none and handful of those documents were ever released on WikiLeaks. Non-government targets of the Chinese espionage, such as Tibetan associations were informed (by us)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/02/wikileaks_tor_snooping_denial/ |title=Wikileaks denies Tor hacker eavesdropping gave site its start |author=Leyden, John |work=[[The Register]] |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WikiLeaks website claims that the government of the People's Republic of China has attempted to block all traffic to web sites with &quot;wikileaks&quot; in the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] since 2007, but that this can be bypassed through encrypted connections or by using one of WikiLeaks' many covert URLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Is Wikileaks blocked by the Chinese government?|url=http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#Is_Wikileaks_blocked_by_the_Chinese_government.3F|publisher=WikiLeaks|year=2008|accessdate=28 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216000537/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#Is_Wikileaks_blocked_by_the_Chinese_government.3F &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the [[12 July 2007 Baghdad airstrike|2007 airstrikes video]] and as they prepared to release film of the [[Granai airstrike]], Julian Assange has said that his group of volunteers came under intense surveillance. In an interview and Twitter posts he said that a restaurant in [[ReykjavÃ­k]] where his group of volunteers met came under surveillance in March; that there was &quot;covert following and hidden photography&quot; by police and foreign [[intelligence agency|intelligence services]]; that an apparent British intelligence agent made thinly veiled threats in a Luxembourg car park; and that one of the volunteers was detained by police for 21 hours.

In August 2009, [[Kaupthing Bank]] secured a court order preventing Iceland's national broadcaster, [[RÃV]], from broadcasting a risk analysis report showing the bank's substantial exposure to debt default risk. This information had been leaked by a whistleblower to WikiLeaks and remained available on the WikiLeaks site; faced with an injunction minutes before broadcast, the channel ran with a screen grab of the WikiLeaks site instead of the scheduled piece on the bank. Citizens of Iceland were reported to be outraged that RÃV was prevented from broadcasting news of relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work =The San Diego Union-Tribune |author =Sigurgrimsdottir, Herdis |title=Iceland court lifts gag order after public outrage |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2009/aug/04/eu-iceland-bank-outrage-080409/ |agency=Associated Press |date=4 August 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, WikiLeaks has been credited with inspiring the [[Icelandic Modern Media Initiative]], a bill meant to reclaim Iceland's 2007 ''[[Reporters Without Borders]] (Reporters sans frontiÃ¨res)'' ranking as first in the world for free speech.

As in individual responses, government officials had mixed feelings.

===U.S. diplomatic cables leak responses===
According to ''[[The Times]]'' (London), WikiLeaks and its members have complained about continuing harassment and surveillance by law enforcement and intelligence organisations, including extended detention, seizure of computers, veiled threats, &quot;covert following and hidden photography.&quot;&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Two lawyers for Julian Assange in the United Kingdom told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that they believed they were being watched by the security services after the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|U.S. cables leak]], which started on 28 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/05/julian-assange-lawyers-being-watched |title=Julian Assange's lawyers say they are being watched |author=Jones, Sam |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=5 December 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, several companies severed ties with WikiLeaks.

On 3 December, [[PayPal]], the payment processor owned by [[eBay]], permanently cut off the account of the [[Wau Holland Foundation]] that had been redirecting donations to WikiLeaks.

On 6 December, the Swiss bank [[PostFinance]] announced that it had frozen the assets of Assange that it holds, totalling â¬31,000.

On 14 July 2011 WikiLeaks and DataCell Ltd. of Iceland filed a complaint against the international card companies, VISA Europe and MasterCard Europe, for infringement of the antitrust rules of the EU, in response to their withdrawal of financial services to the organisation.

===Response from financial industry===

Since the publications of CableGate, WikiLeaks has faced an unprecedented global financial blockade by  major finance companies including Mastercard, Visa and PayPal.

In October 2010, it was reported that [[Moneybookers]], which collected donations for WikiLeaks, had ended its relationship with the site. Moneybookers stated that its decision had been made &quot;to comply with money laundering or other investigations conducted by government authorities, agencies or commissions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;moneybookers&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

On 18 December 2010, [[Bank of America]] announced it would &quot;not process transactions of any type that we have reason to believe are intended for Wikileaks,&quot; citing &quot;Wikileaks might be engaged in activities ... inconsistent with our internal policies for processing payments&quot;. WikiLeaks responded in a tweet by encouraging their supporters who were BoA customers to close their accounts. Bank of America has long been believed to be the target of [[#Announcements on upcoming leaks|WikiLeaks' next major release]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Bank of America stops handling Wikileaks payments |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12028084 |work=BBC News |date=18 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 2010, Bank of America approached the law firm of [[Hunton &amp; Williams]] to put a stop to WikiLeaks. Hunton &amp; Williams assembled a group of security specialists, [[HBGary Federal]], [[Palantir Technologies]], and [[Berico Technologies]]. They decided upon a campaign that included the use of  &quot;false documents, disinformation, and sabotage.&quot;

During 5 and 6 February 2011, [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] hacked HBGary's web site, copied tens of thousands of documents from HBGary, posted tens of thousands of company emails online, and usurped Barr's Twitter account in [[revenge]]. Some of the documents taken by Anonymous show HBGary Federal was working on behalf of [[Bank of America]] to respond to WikiLeaks' planned release of the bank's internal documents.  Emails detailed a supposed business proposal by HBGary to assist Bank of America's law firm, [[Hunton &amp; Williams]], and revealed that the companies were willing to break the law to bring down WikiLeaks and Anonymous.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;CEO Aaron Barr thought he'd uncovered the hackers' identities and like rats, they'd scurry for cover. If he could nail them, he could cover up the crimes H&amp;W, HBGary, and BoA planned, bring down WikiLeaks, [[Decapitation#metaphoric|decapitate]] Anonymous, and place his opponents in prison while collecting a cool fee. He thought he was 88% right; he was 88% wrong.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CB1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin |first=Leigh |title=WikiLicks |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=15747 |work=Crime |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=Orlando |date=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2011 Julian Assange said the financial blockade had destroyed 95% of WikiLeaks' revenues and announced that it was suspending publishing operations in order to focus on fighting the blockade and raising new funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/24/wikileaks-suspends-publishing &quot;WikiLeaks suspends publishing to fight financial blockade&quot;], Esther Addley and Jason Deans, ''The Guardian'', 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal conflicts==
===Restructuring===
Some supporters were unhappy{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} when WikiLeaks moved from a community-based Wiki model to a more centralised organisational structure. The &quot;about&quot; page originally read:&lt;ref name=&quot;whatis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What is WikiLeaks? How does WikiLeaks operate? |url=http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#What_is_WikiLeaks.3F_How_does_WikiLeaks_operate.3F |work=WikiLeaks |year=2008 |accessdate=28 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216000537/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About#What_is_WikiLeaks.3F_How_does_WikiLeaks_operate.3F |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the user, WikiLeaks will look very much like Wikipedia. Anybody can post to it, anybody can edit it. No technical knowledge is required. Leakers can post documents anonymously and untraceably. Users can publicly discuss documents and analyze their credibility and veracity. Users can discuss interpretations and context and collaboratively formulate collective publications. Users can read and write explanatory articles on leaks along with background material and context. The political relevance of documents and their verisimilitude will be revealed by a cast of thousands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, WikiLeaks established an editorial policy that accepted only documents that were &quot;of political, diplomatic, historical or ethical interest&quot; (and excluded &quot;material that is already publicly available&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:Submissions |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080419013425/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:Submissions |archivedate=19 April 2008 |title=WikiLeaks' submissions page |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with early criticism that having no editorial policy would drive out good material with spam and promote &quot;automated or indiscriminate publication of confidential records.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Wikileaks and untracable document disclosure |url=http://www.fas.org/blog/secrecy/2007/01/wikileaks_and_untraceable_docu.html |work=Secrecy News |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=3 January 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2008 |author=Aftergood, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer possible for anybody to post to it or edit it, as the original FAQ promised. Instead, submissions are regulated by an internal review process and some are published, while documents not fitting the editorial criteria are rejected by anonymous WikiLeaks reviewers.

===Defections===
Within WikiLeaks, there has been public disagreement between founder and spokesperson [[Julian Assange]] and [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]], the site's former German representative who was suspended by Assange.

==Spin-offs==
Releases of US diplomatic cables inspired the creation of a number of other organisations based on the WikiLeaks model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Piven, Ben |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/12/20101216194828514847.html |title=Copycat WikiLeaks sites make waves&amp;nbsp;â Features |work=Al Jazeera English |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[OpenLeaks]] was created by a former WikiLeaks spokesperson. [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] said the intention was to be more transparent than WikiLeaks. OpenLeaks was supposed to start public operations in early 2011 but despite much media coverage it is still not functioning.
*Brussels Leaks was focused on the European Union as a collaborative effort of media professionals and activists that sought to &quot;pull the shady inner workings of the EU system out into the public domain. This is about getting important information out there, not about Brusselsleaks [or any other 'leaks' for that matter].&quot;
*TradeLeaks was created to &quot;do to trade and commerce what WikiLeaks has done to politics.&quot; It was founded by Australian Ruslan Kogan. Its goal is to ensure &quot;individuals and businesses should attain values from others through mutually beneficial and fully consensual trade, rather than force, fraud or deception.&quot; Unfortunately the site itself appears to have become discounted by its users, as evidenced by the highest rated article being &quot;Tradeleaks tampering with leak vote count mechanism&quot;.
*Balkan Leaks was founded by Bulgarian Atanas Chobanov in order to make the [[Balkans]] more transparent and to fight corruption as &quot;There are plenty of people out there that want to change the Balkans for good and are ready to take on the challenge. We're offering them a hand.&quot;
*Indoleaks is an [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]] site that seeks to publish classified documents primarily from the Indonesian government.
*RuLeaks is aimed at being a Russian equivalent to WikiLeaks. It was originally launched to provide translated versions of the WikiLeaks cables but the ''[[Moscow Times]]'' reports it has started to publish its own content as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russias-own-wikileaks-takes-off/429370.html |title=Russia's Own WikiLeaks Takes Off |author=Razumovskaya, Olga |work=The Moscow Times |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*PPLeaks and PSOELeaks are related to the Spanish [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leaks and scandals.
*Leakymails is a project designed to obtain and publish relevant documents exposing corruption of the political class and the powerful in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2011/08/argentina-judge-orders-all-isps-to-block-corruption-reporting-website/ |title=Argentina: Judge orders all ISPs to block corruption reporting website  |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://opennet.net/blog/2011/08/argentina-judge-orders-all-isps-block-sites-leakymailscom-and-leakymailsblogspotcom/ |title=Argentina: Judge orders all ISPs to block the sites LeakyMails.com and Leakymails.blogspot.com|date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/argentina-isps-ip-overblocking|title=Argentine ISPs Use Bazooka to Kill Fly|date 19 August 2011 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
