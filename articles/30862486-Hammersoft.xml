'''Illy Illibuck''' is a carved wooden [[turtle]] that serves as the [[trophy]] awarded to the winner of the American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played annually by the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football]] team of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] team of [[Ohio State University]].  Two junior honorary societies, Bucket and Dipper of Ohio State and Atius-Sachem of Illinois, are responsible for the care of the Illibuck.  Originally the &quot;trophy&quot; was a live turtle when the tradition began in 1925, picked for its expected long life as a symbol of the anticipated long life of the rivalry.  From 1919 until 1933 the Ohio State-Illinois game was the regular-season finale for both teams.  Since the death of the original turtle in 1927, ten wooden replica Illibucks have been carved, each with the scores from games on its back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bucketanddipper.org.ohio-state.edu/illibuck.html Bucket &amp; Dipper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Illibuck is the second oldest trophy passed between [[Big Ten Conference]] football programs (the [[Little Brown Jug (football)|Little Brown Jug]] was created in 1903).  

The rivalry once included the smoking of a [[peace pipe]] between members of the two junior honorary societies, which occurred at [[halftime]] of the game.  This practice has not been done for many years.  However, the trophy is still presented to the winning school of the previous year's contest between quarters.  

The rivalry was temporarily interrupted during the 2003 and 2004 seasons when Ohio State and Illinois did not play each other. When the teams met in 2005, Illinois presented the trophy to Ohio State for winning the BCS National Championship in 2002. Ohio State leads the Illibuck rivalry, 59-23-2 and all time 63-30-4.

In 2011, the Big Ten expanded to twelve teams and split into two divisions.  Both Ohio State and Illinois were both placed in the Leaders Division, so the Buckeyes and Illini will continue to play each other annually.
