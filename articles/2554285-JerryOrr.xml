'''Kopalnia Wujek''' (English: &quot;Uncle&quot; Mine) is a [[coal mine]] in [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]. It is widely known in Poland as the place of the [[Pacification of Wujek|massacre of striking miners]] in 1981 (most often referred-to by the euphemism 'Pacification').

Mining operations began in the vicinity as early as the 16th century. The &quot;Oheim mine&quot; (now called Wujek) was established in 1899 by a merger of six mining operations existing  in [[Silesia]] (then a part of [[Germany]]). The German's called the mine ''Oheim''. The peak Polish production was in 1979 (3.88 million tons that year).

Currently, the Wujek mine produces [[sub-bituminous coal]] with a typical energy content of 30000-31000 kJ/kg, volatile content of 30-31%, ash content of less than 5%, and sulfur content of less than 0.6%.
