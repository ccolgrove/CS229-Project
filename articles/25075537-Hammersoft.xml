In 1978, he was granted a scholarship to come to the United States in order to continue his higher education. He received his Masters of Comparative Jurisprudence (MCJ) from [[Howard University]] in 1980, his LLM from the National Law Center at [[George Washington University]] in 1981, and his Ph.D. in Comparative Jurisprudence from [[Temple University]] in 1986.  His 1986 Ph.D. dissertation at Temple University was on &quot;The applicability of Islamic [[penal law]] ([[qisas]] and [[diyah]]) in the Sudan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascleiden.nl/GetPage.aspx?datastore=4&amp;url=/publications/bibliographies/islaminafrica/ref8216 Mohamad, A. El-Sheikh, &quot;The applicability of Islamic penal law (qisas and diyah) in the Sudan,&quot; 1986, Ph.D. dissertation, [[Temple University]], 332 p., accessed November 7, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
For over 18 years, El-Sheikh was the Imam at Masjid Al-Rahmah of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Maryland.  

El-Sheikh was instrumental in founding the [[Muslim American Society]] in the US, in 1992, along with some other former members of the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;  He said that when they founded the society the founders' goals had changed, in that they no longer needed to operate secretly as they had in other countries when they were members of the Muslim Brotherhood.  He said the founders felt &quot;we should cut relations with the [Brotherhood] abroad and regard ourselves as Americans. . . . We don't receive an order from any organization abroad, and [they] have no authority to tell us what to do&quot;.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;

He also helped launch the [[Dar Al-Hijrah]] [[mosque]] in [[Falls Church, Virginia]], and later was the [[Imam]] of the mosque between August 2003 and May 2005.&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt;  Commenting in 2004 on the [[beheading]]s of American hostages [[Nick Berg]] and [[Daniel Pearl]], he said: &lt;blockquote&gt;beheadings are not mentioned in the [[Koran]] at all. According to Islamic penal law, killers will be sentenced to death, but the means of execution are not mentioned.  ...we don't condone this. They are not following Islam. They are following their own whims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

And in 2004, speaking of Palestinian [[suicide bomber]]s, he said &quot;if certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued [[fatwa]]s to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;murphy&quot;/&gt;

He left Dar Al-Hijrah in 2005 to become the executive director of the [[Fiqh Council of North America]], an association of [[Sharia|Islamic legal]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/10/AR2005061001869.html Sheridan, Mary Beth, &quot;Leader Named at Mosque; Falls Church Site Selects Activist,&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'', June 11, 2005, accessed November 7, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the head of the Islamic Judiciary Council of the Shariâah Scholarsâ Association of North America (SSANA).
