[[File:B-29s dropping bombs.jpg|right|thumb|250px|LeMay became known for his massive incendiary attacks against Japanese cities during the war using hundreds of planes flying at low altitudes.]]

'''Curtis Emerson LeMay''' (November 15, 1906 â October 1, 1990) was a [[general officer|general]] in the [[United States Air Force]] and the vice presidential running mate of [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1968.

He is credited with designing and implementing an effective, but also controversial, systematic [[strategic bombing]] campaign in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific theater]] of [[World War II]]. During the war, he was known for planning and executing a massive bombing campaign against cities in [[Japan]]. After the war, he headed the [[Berlin airlift]], then reorganized the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) into an effective instrument of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].

==Early life and career==
Curtis Emerson LeMay was born in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], on November 15, 1906. His father, Erving LeMay was at times an ironworker and general handyman, but he never held a job longer than a few months. His mother, Arizona Carpenter LeMay, did her best to hold her family together. With very limited income, his family moved around the country as his father looked for work, going as far as Montana and California.  Eventually they returned to his native city of Columbus. LeMay attended Columbus public schools and studied civil engineering at [[Ohio State University]]. Working his way through college, he graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[civil engineering]]. While at Ohio State he was a member of the [[Pershing Rifles| National Society of Pershing Rifles]] and the Professional Engineering Fraternity [[Theta Tau]]. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Corps Reserve in October 1929. He received a regular commission in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in January 1930. While finishing at Ohio State, he took flight training at [[Norton Field]] in Columbus, in 1931â32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Ohio History Central | url = http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=773}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 9, 1934, he married Helen E. Maitland (died 1992), with whom he had one child, Patricia Jane LeMay Lodge, known as Janie.

LeMay became a [[fighter aircraft|pursuit]] pilot and, while stationed in Hawaii, became one of the first members of the Air Corps to receive specialized training in aerial navigation. In August 1937, as navigator under pilot and commander [[Caleb V. Haynes]] on a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], he helped locate the battleship ''[[USS Utah (BB-31)|Utah]]'' despite being given the wrong coordinates by Navy personnel, in exercises held in misty conditions off California, after which the group of B-17s bombed it with water bombs. For Haynes again, in May 1938 he navigated three B-17s over {{convert|610|mi|km}} of the Atlantic Ocean to [[Interception of the Rex|intercept the Italian liner ''Rex'']] to illustrate the ability of land-based airpower to defend the American coasts. In 1940 he was navigator for Haynes on the prototype [[Boeing XB-15]] heavy bomber, flying a survey from Panama over the Galapagos islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Boniface | first = Patrick | contribution = Boeing's Forgotten Monster: XB-15, a Giant in Search of a Cause | title = [[Air Enthusiast]] | number = 79 | date = JanâFeb. 1999 | pages = 64â7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; War brought rapid promotion and increased responsibility.

When his crews were not flying missions they were being subjected to his relentless training, as he believed that training was the key to saving their lives. LeMay was widely and fondly known among his troops as &quot;Old Iron Pants&quot; throughout his career.&lt;ref name=Harper&gt;{{Cite book

==World War II==
When the U.S. entered [[World War II]] in December 1941, LeMay was a major in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (he had been a 1st lieutenant as recently as 1940), and the commander of a newly created B-17 Flying Fortress unit, the 305th Bomb Group. He took this unit to [[England]] in October 1942 as part of the [[Eighth Air Force]], and led it in combat until May 1943, notably helping to develop the [[combat box]] formation.&lt;ref name=coffey&gt;Coffey, ''Iron Eagle''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman&gt;Tillman, ''LeMay''&lt;/ref&gt; He led the 4th Bombardment Wing and was its first commander when it was reorganized into the [[3rd Air Division]] in September 1943. He personally led several dangerous missions, including the Regensburg section of the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]] of August 17, 1943. In that mission he led 146 B-17s to [[Regensburg]], [[Germany]], beyond the range of escorting fighters, and, after bombing, continued on to bases in [[North Africa]], losing 24 bombers in the process.&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;
The heavy losses in veteran crews on this and subsequent deep penetration missions in the autumn of 1943 led the Eighth Air Force to limit missions to targets within escort range. Finally, with the deployment in the European theater of the [[P-51 Mustang]] in January 1944, the 8th Air Force gained an escort fighter with range to match the bombers.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

[[Robert McNamara]] described LeMay's character, in a discussion of a report into high abort rates in bomber missions during [[World War II]]:

{{blockquote|One of the commanders was Curtis LeMayâColonel in command of a B-24 group. He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war. But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal. He got the report. He issued an order. He said, 'I will be in the lead plane on every mission. Any plane that takes off will go over the target, or the crew will be court-martialed.' The abort rate dropped overnight. Now that's the kind of commander he was.&lt;ref&gt;Errol Morris, ''The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara,'' Documentary Film, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 1944, LeMay transferred to the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India theater]] and directed first the [[XX Bomber Command]] in China and then the [[XXI Bomber Command]] in the Pacific. LeMay was later placed in charge of all strategic air operations against the Japanese home islands.&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;

LeMay soon concluded that the techniques and tactics developed for use in Europe against the Luftwaffe were unsuitable against Japan. His bombers flying from China were dropping their bombs near their targets only 5% of the time. Operational losses of aircraft and crews were unacceptably high owing to Japanese daylight air defenses and continuing mechanical problems with the B-29. In January 1945 LeMay was transferred from China to relieve Brig. Gen. [[Haywood S. Hansell]] as commander of the XXI Bomber Command in the [[Marianas]].&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;

He became convinced that high-altitude precision bombing would be ineffective, given the usually cloudy weather over Japan. Furthermore, bombs dropped from the B-29s at high altitude (20,000+ feet) were often blown off of their trajectories by a consistently powerful jet stream over the Japanese home islands, which dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the high-altitude raids. Because Japanese air defenses made daytime bombing below jet stream-affected altitudes too perilous, LeMay finally switched to low-altitude nighttime incendiary attacks on Japanese targets, a tactic senior commanders had been advocating for some time.&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt; Japanese cities were largely constructed of combustible materials such as wood and paper. Precision high-altitude daylight bombing was ordered to proceed only when weather permitted or when specific critical targets were not vulnerable to area bombing. General Lemay was informed by a senior staff member, Colonel William P. Fisher, that bomber pilots were turning back from these low altitude bombing runs due to heavy anti-air craft fire from Japanese defense forces.  Col. Fisher suggested to Lemay that crews who achieved successful strike rates should be rewarded by being released from their deployment. Lemay implemented this unorthodox plan and the strike rate went up to eighty percent.&lt;ref&gt;December 24, 1985 recorded interview with Major General William P. Fisher, USAF, Retired. Conducted by granddaughter Dorothy Danaher White&lt;/ref&gt;

LeMay commanded subsequent [[B-29 Superfortress]] combat operations against Japan, including massive incendiary attacks on 64 [[Japan]]ese cities. This included the [[Bombing of Tokyo in World War II|fire-bombing of Tokyo]] on March 9â10, 1945, the most destructive bombing raid of the war.&lt;ref name=USSBS&gt;United States Strategic Bombing Survey. Summary Report (Pacific War). Washington DC, July 1, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; For this first attack, LeMay ordered the defensive guns removed from 325 B-29s, loaded each plane with Model E-46 incendiary clusters, magnesium bombs, white phosphorus bombs, and [[napalm]], and ordered the bombers to fly in streams at 5,000 to 9,000 feet over Tokyo.&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;

The first pathfinder planes arrived over Tokyo just after midnight on March 10. Following British bombing practice, they marked the target area with a flaming &quot;X.&quot; In a three-hour period, the main bombing force dropped 1,665 tons of incendiary bombs, killing some 100,000 civilians, destroying 250,000 buildings and incinerating {{convert|16|sqmi|km2}} of the city. Aircrews at the tail end of the bomber stream reported that the stench of burned human flesh permeated the aircraft over the target.&lt;ref name=&quot;buckley2001_193&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=John |year=2001 |origyear=1998 |title=Air Power in the Age of Total War |location=London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-203-00722-0 |page=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0_-DJcwmQ20C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22many+wore+their+oxygen+masks+to+escape+the+sickening+stench+of+burning+flesh%22 193]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firebombing leaflet.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A &quot;LeMay Bombing Leaflet&quot; from the war, which warned Japanese civilians that &quot;Unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives.&quot;]]
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported at the time, &quot;Maj. Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, commander of the B-29s of the entire Marianas area, declared that if the war is shortened by a single day, the attack will have served its purpose.&quot;&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;
Precise figures are not available, but the fire-bombing campaign against Japan, directed by LeMay between March 1945 and the Japanese surrender in August 1945, may have killed more than 500,000 Japanese civilians and left 5 million homeless.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, F. J. ''No Strategic Targets Left''. &quot;Contribution of Major Fire Raids Toward Ending WWII&quot;, Turner Publishing Company, limited edition. ISBN 1-56311-483-6. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Official estimates from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey put the figures at 220,000 people killed.&lt;ref name=USSBS/&gt; Some 40% of the built-up areas of 66 cities were destroyed, including much of Japan's war industry.&lt;ref name=USSBS/&gt;

The remaining Allied prisoners of war in Japan who had survived imprisonment to that time were frequently subjected to additional reprisals and torture after an air raid.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} The massive bombing also hit a number of prisons and directly killed a number of allied war prisoners. LeMay was quite aware of the Japanese opinion of him: he once remarked that had the U.S. lost the war, he fully expected to be tried for [[war crimes]], especially in view of Japanese executions of uniformed American flight crews during the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]]. He argued that it was his duty to carry out the attacks in order to end the war as quickly as possible, sparing further loss of life.

Presidents [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] justified these tactics by referring to an estimate of one million Allied casualties if Japan had to be invaded. The Japanese had intentionally decentralized 90 percent of their war-related production into small subcontractor workshops in civilian districts, making remaining Japanese war industry largely immune to conventional precision bombing with high explosives.&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936â1945,'' Random House, 1970, p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the fire-bombing campaign took effect, Japanese war planners were forced to expend significant resources to relocate vital war industries to remote caves and mountain bunkers, reducing production of war material. As an officer who served under LeMay, Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert McNamara]] was in charge of evaluating the effectiveness of American bombing missions. Later McNamara, as secretary of defense under Kennedy and Johnson, would often clash with LeMay.

LeMay also oversaw [[Operation Starvation]], an aerial [[naval mine|mining]] operation against Japanese waterways and ports that disrupted Japanese shipping and food distribution. Although his superiors were unsupportive of this naval objective, LeMay gave it a high priority by assigning the entire 313th Bombardment Wing (four groups, about 160 planes) to the task. Aerial mining supplemented a tight Allied submarine blockade of the home islands, drastically reducing Japan's ability to supply its overseas forces to the point that postwar analysis concluded that it could have defeated Japan on its own had it begun earlier.&lt;ref name=coffey /&gt;&lt;ref name=tillman /&gt;

===JapanâWashington flight===
LeMay piloted one of three specially modified B-29s [[1945 JapanâWashington flight|flying from Japan to the U.S. in September 1945]], in the process breaking several aviation records at that date, including the greatest USAAF takeoff weight, the longest USAAF non-stop flight, and the first ever non-stop JapanâChicago flight. One of the pilots was of higher rank: Lieutenant General [[Barney Giles]]. The other two aircraft used up more fuel than LeMay's in fighting headwinds, and they could not fly to Washington, DC, the original goal.&lt;ref name=40th&gt;{{cite book |title=40th Bombardment Group (VH) history |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EB-0VUI11NsC&amp;pg=PA46 |year=1989 |publisher= Turner Publishing |isbn= 0â938021â28â1 |pages= 45â47}}&lt;/ref&gt; They decided to land in Chicago to refuel. LeMay's aircraft had sufficient fuel to reach Washington, but he was directed by the War Department to join the others by refueling at Chicago. The order was ostensibly given because of borderline weather conditions in Washington, but according to First Lieutenant Ivan J. Potts who was aboard, the order came because LeMay had one fewer [[General (United States)|general's stars]] and should not be seen to outperform his superior.&lt;ref name= &quot;Potts PDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | format = [[PDF]] | url= http://www.40thbombgroup.org/DCFlight.pdf |title=The Japan to Washington Flight: September 18â19, 1945 |last=Potts |first=J.

==Cold War==
===Berlin Airlift===
[[File:lemay4.jpg|right|thumb|General Curtis E. LeMay]]
After World War II, LeMay was briefly transferred to [[The Pentagon]] as deputy chief of Air Staff for Research &amp; Development. In 1947, he returned to Europe as commander of USAF Europe, heading operations for the [[Berlin Airlift]] in 1948 in the face of a blockade by the Soviet Union and its satellite states that threatened to starve the civilian population of the Western occupation zones of Berlin.  Under LeMay's direction, [[C-54]] cargo planes that could each carry 10 tons of cargo began supplying the city on July 1.  By the fall, the airlift was bringing in an average of 5,000 tons of supplies a day.  The airlift continued for 11 monthsâ213,000 flights that brought in 1.7 million tons of food and fuel to Berlin. Faced with the failure of their blockade, the Soviet Union relented and reopened land corridors to the West. Though LeMay is sometimes publicly credited with the success of the Berlin Airlift, it was, in fact, instigated by General [[Lucius D. Clay]] when General Clay called LeMay about the problem. LeMay initially started flying supplies into Berlin, but then decided that it was a job for a logistics expert and he found that person in Lt. General [[William H. Tunner]],&lt;ref&gt;Cherny, Andrei, ''The Candy Bombers: The Untold Story of the Berlin Airlift and America's Finest Hour'', Putnam Press, ISBN 978â0â399â15496â6 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; who took over the operational end of the [[Berlin Airlift]].

===Strategic Air Command===
In 1948, he returned to the U.S. to head the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) at [[Offutt Air Force Base]], replacing Gen [[George Kenney]]. When LeMay took over command of SAC, it consisted of little more than a few understaffed [[B-29]] bombardment groups left over from World War II. Less than half of the available aircraft were operational, and the crews were undertrained. Base and aircraft security standards were minimal. Upon inspecting a SAC hangar full of U.S. nuclear strategic bombers, LeMay found a single Air Force sentry on duty, armed only with a ham sandwich.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, George M., ''Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the United States Air Force'', Washington, D.C.: Air Force History and Museums Program, USAF (2001) p. 132: LeMay recorded the incident in a memo to staff the same day, stating &quot;this afternoon I found a man guarding a hangar with a ham sandwich. There will be no more of that.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  After ordering a mock bombing exercise on [[Dayton, Ohio]], LeMay was shocked to learn that most of the strategic bombers assigned to the mission missed their targets by one mile or more. &quot;We didn't have one crew, not one crew, in the entire command who could do a professional job&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1949, LeMay was first to propose that a nuclear war be conducted by delivering the nuclear arsenal in a single overwhelming blow, going as far as &quot;killing a nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGroot|first=Gerard J.|title=The bomb: a life|year=2004|publisher=Harvard|location=Cambridge, MA |isbn= 0â674â01724â2|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=6VQCsAZpPrgC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=the%20entire%20stockpile%20of%20atomic%20bombs%20in%20a%20single%20massive%20attack&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=1st, pbk. | publisher = Harvard University Press |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 the 1st Missile Division was activated, having operational control over strategic missiles.

Upon receiving his fourth star in 1951 at age 44, LeMay became the youngest four-star general in American history since [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and was the youngest four-star general in modern history as well as the longest serving in that rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrenKozak.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warrenkozak.com/basics.html |title= LeMay: The Life And Wars Of General Curtis LeMay |accessdate=2009-05-08| first =Warren | last = Kozak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 and 1957 LeMay implemented tests of 24-hour bomber and tanker alerts, keeping some bomber forces ready at all times. LeMay headed SAC until 1957, overseeing its transformation into a modern, efficient, all-jet force. LeMay's tenure was the longest over an American military command in close to 100 years.&lt;ref name=AFMagazine_200810&gt;
{{Cite journal
|journal=AIR FORCE Magazine |date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite popular claims that LeMay advanced the notion of [[preventive war|preventive]] nuclear war, the historical record indicates LeMay actually advocated justified [[preemptive war|preemptive]] nuclear war. Several documents show LeMay advocating preemptive attack of the Soviet Union, had it become clear the Soviets were preparing to attack SAC or the United States. In these documents, which were often the transcripts of speeches before groups such as the National War College or events such as the 1955 Joint Secretaries Conference at the Quantico Marine Corps Base, LeMay clearly advocated using SAC as a preemptive weapon if and when such was necessary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Little evidence suggests LeMay ever advocated unauthorized or unjustified nuclear attack of the Soviet Union. To the contrary, a December 1949 letter from LeMay to the Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg indicates LeMay was concerned with having explicit authority from the nation's political leadership to launch a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union. This letter, in LeMay's files at the Library of Congress, indicates LeMay was not willing to operate outside the authority afforded him as a military officer and that LeMay also recognized the constitutional role political leadership played in the decision to initiate war.

===The âAirpower Battleâ===
General LeMay was instrumental in SAC's acquisition of a large fleet of new [[strategic bombers]], establishment of a vast [[aerial refueling]] system, the formation of many new units and bases, development of a strategic [[ballistic missile]] force, and establishment of a strict [[command and control]] system with an unprecedented readiness capability. All of this was protected by a greatly enhanced and modernized security force, the [[Strategic Air Command Elite Guard]]. LeMay insisted on rigorous training and very high standards of performance for all SAC personnel, be they officers, enlisted men, aircrews, mechanics, or administrative staff, and reportedly commented, &quot;I have neither the time nor the inclination to differentiate between the incompetent and the merely unfortunate.&quot;

A famous [[Urban legend|legend]] often used by SAC flight crews to illustrate LeMay's command style concerned his famous ever-present cigar.&lt;ref&gt;Havemann, Ernest, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HFMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=LeMay+Toughest+Cop+of+the+Western+World&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XiRLy7LlDr&amp;sig=pQNJpzP0Gcjgk7gchsjwcTz6azU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zDyfTcyNBOrjiAKUnLHzAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA  Toughest Cop of The Western World]'', Life Magazine, 14 June 1954, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In the first known published account of the story, [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] reporter Ernest Havemann related that LeMay once took the co-pilot's seat of a SAC bomber to observe the mission, complete with lit cigar.&lt;ref name= &quot;Havemann, p. 136&quot;&gt;Havemann, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by the pilot to put the cigar out, LeMay demanded to know why. When the pilot explained that fumes inside the fuselage could ignite the plane, LeMay reportedly growled, &quot;It wouldn't dare.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Havemann, p. 136&quot;/&gt; The incident in the article was later used as the basis for a fictional scene in the 1955 film ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]].''  In his highly controversial and factually disputed&lt;ref&gt;PuttrÃ©, Michael, ''[http://www.mputtre.com/id45.html Nagasaki Revisited]'', retrieved 8 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coster-Mullen, John, ''Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man,'' publ. J. Coster-Mullen, End Notes (2004): Gen. [[Paul Tibbets]], Major [[Dutch Van Kirk]] (Enola Gay's navigator), and other surviving members of the 509th Composite Group were reportedly outraged at many of the factual assertions by Sweeney in ''War's End''.&lt;/ref&gt; memoir ''War's End'', Major General [[Charles Sweeney]] related an alleged 1944 incident that may have been the basis for the &quot;It wouldn't dare&quot; comment.&lt;ref&gt;Sweeney, Charles (Maj. Gen., ret.), Antonucci, James A., and Antonucci, Marion K., ''War's End: an Eyewitness Account of America's Last Atomic Mission'', New York: Avon Books, ISBN 0-38097-349-9 (1997), p. 75: Sweeney stated that a similar incident occurred in 1944 when a B-29 crew chief reminded General LeMay of his lit cigar while LeMay was undergoing B-29 familiarization with (then-Colonel) [[Paul Tibbets]]' [[509th Composite Group]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his uncompromising attitude regarding performance of duty, LeMay was also known for his concern for the physical well-being and comfort of his men.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, George M., ''Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the United States Air Force'', Washington, DC: Air Force History and Museums Program, USAF (2001) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; LeMay found ways to encourage morale, individual performance, and the reenlistment rate through a number of means: encouraging off-duty group recreational activities,&lt;ref&gt;''Sport: Red for Ferrari'', Time Magazine, 20 April 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Judo In SAC Air Force'', Black Belt Magazine, April 1962, pp. 37â38: These ranged from basketball courts and pool tables to judo tournaments and even assembling and tuning engines in SAC workshops for sports car races on SAC air bases.&lt;/ref&gt; instituting spot promotions based on performance, and authorizing special uniforms, training, equipment, and allowances for ground personnel&lt;ref&gt;''Armed Forces: The Finish Flag'', Time Magazine, 2 August 1954: This included new innerspring mattresses, fans, pool tables, and TV sets for enlisted mens quarters.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as flight crews.

On LeMay's departure, SAC was composed of 224,000 airmen, close to 2,000 heavy bombers, and nearly 800 tanker aircraft.&lt;ref name=AFMagazine_200810/&gt;

LeMay was an active [[amateur radio]] operator and held a succession of call signs; K0GRL, K4FRA, and W6EZV. He held these calls respectively while stationed at [[Offut AFB|Offutt AFB]], [[Washington, D.C.]] and when he retired in [[California]]. K0GRL is still the call sign of the Strategic Air Command Memorial Amateur Radio Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

LeMay became aware that the new single sideband [[single-sideband modulation|(SSB)]] technology offered a big advantage over Amplitude Modulation [[Amplitude Modulation|(AM)]] for SAC aircraft operating long distances from their bases. In conjunction with [[Arthur A. Collins|Art Collins]] (W0CXX) of [[Collins Radio]], he established SSB as the radio standard for SAC bombers in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

LeMay was appointed Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force in July 1957, serving until 1961, when he was made the fifth [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]] on the retirement of Gen [[Thomas D. White|Thomas White]]. His belief in the efficacy of strategic air campaigns over tactical strikes and ground support operations became Air Force policy during his tenure as chief of staff.

As chief of staff, LeMay clashed repeatedly with [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]], [[Secretary of the Air Force|Air Force Secretary]] [[Eugene Zuckert]], and the chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], Army [[General (United States)|General]] [[Maxwell Taylor]]. At the time, budget constraints and successive [[nuclear war]] fighting strategies had left the armed forces in a state of flux. Each of the [[armed forces]] had gradually jettisoned realistic appraisals of future conflicts in favor of developing its own separate nuclear and nonnuclear capabilities. At the height of this struggle, the U.S. Army had even reorganized its combat divisions to fight land wars on irradiated nuclear battlefields, developing short-range [[atomic cannon]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] in order to win [[Appropriation (law)|appropriations]]. The [[United States Navy]] in turn proposed delivering strategic [[nuclear weapons]] from [[supercarriers]] intended to sail into range of the [[Soviet]] air defense forces. Of all these various schemes, only LeMay's command structure of SAC survived complete reorganization in the changing reality of [[postwar]] conflicts.

Though LeMay lost significant appropriation battles for the [[Skybolt ALBM]] and the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] replacement, the [[XB-70 Valkyrie]], he was largely successful at expanding Air Force budgets. He advocated the introduction of [[satellite]] technology and pushed for the development of the latest [[electronic warfare]] techniques. By contrast, the U.S. Army and Navy frequently suffered budgetary cutbacks and program cancellations by Congress and Secretary [[McNamara]].

During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962, LeMay clashed again with U.S. [[President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and Defense Secretary McNamara, arguing that he should be allowed to bomb nuclear missile sites in [[Cuba]]. He opposed the naval [[blockade]] and, after the end of the crisis, suggested that Cuba be invaded anyway, even after the Russians agreed to withdraw. LeMay called the peaceful resolution of the crisis &quot;the greatest defeat in our history&quot;.&lt;ref name=Feltus&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Air_Power/LeMay/AP36.htm |title= Curtis E. LeMay |last= Feltus |first= Pamela |work= Centennial of Flight | publisher = US Centennial of Flight Commission | accessdate = 10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unknown to the US, the Soviet field commanders in Cuba had been given authority to launchâthe only time such authority was delegated by higher command.&lt;ref name=Rhodes575/&gt; They had twenty nuclear warheads for medium-range R-12 ballistic missiles capable of reaching US cities (including Washington) and nine tactical nuclear missiles. If Soviet officers had launched them, many millions of US citizens would have been killed. The ensuing SAC retaliatory thermonuclear strike would have killed roughly one hundred million Soviet citizens, and brought [[nuclear winter]] to much of the Northern Hemisphere. Kennedy refused LeMay's requests, however, and the naval blockade was successful.&lt;ref name= Rhodes575&gt;Rhodes, 1995, pp. 574â76&lt;/ref&gt;

The memorandum from LeMay, Chief of Staff, USAF, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, January 4, 1964, illustrates LeMay's reasons for keeping bomber force along ballistic missiles: &quot;It is important to recognize, however, that ballistic missile forces represent both the U.S. and Soviet potential for strategic nuclear warfare at the highest, most indiscriminate level, and at a level least susceptible to control. The employment of these weapons in lower level conflict would be likely to escalate the situation, uncontrollably, to an intensity which could be vastly disproportionate to the original aggravation. The use of [[ICBM]]s and [[SLBM]]s is not, therefore, a rational or credible response to provocations which, although serious, are still less than an immediate threat to national survival. For this reason, among others, I consider that the national security will continue to require the flexibility, responsiveness, and discrimination of manned strategic weapon systems throughout the range of cold, limited, and general war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration, RG 200, Defense Programs and Operations, LeMay's Memo to President and JCS Views, Box 83. Secret.&lt;/ref&gt;

LeMay's dislike for tactical aircraft and training backfired in the low-intensity conflict of Vietnam, where existing Air Force fighter aircraft and standard attack profiles proved incapable of carrying out sustained [[tactical bombing]] campaigns in the face of hostile North Vietnamese antiaircraft defenses. LeMay said, &quot;Flying fighters is fun. Flying bombers is important.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Coram, âBoyd.'' Back Bay Books/Little, Brown, and Company, 2002, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft losses on tactical attack missions soared, and Air Force commanders soon realized that their large, missile-armed jet fighters were exceedingly vulnerable not only to antiaircraft shells and missiles but also to cannon-armed, maneuverable Soviet fighters.

LeMay advocated a sustained strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnamese cities, harbors, ports, shipping, and other strategic targets. His advice was ignored. Instead, an incremental policy was implemented that focused on limited interdiction bombing of fluid enemy supply corridors in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This limited campaign failed to destroy significant quantities of enemy war supplies or diminish enemy ambitions. Bombing limitations were imposed by President [[Lyndon Johnson]] for geopolitical reasons, as he surmised that bombing Soviet and Chinese ships in port and killing Soviet advisers would bring the Soviets more directly into the war and destabilize the European Cold War.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Evidence of LeMay's thinking is that in his 1965 autobiography, co-written with [[MacKinlay Kantor]], LeMay is quoted as saying his response to North Vietnam would be to demand that &quot;theyâve got to draw in their horns and stop their aggression, or weâre going to bomb them back into the [[Stone Age]]. And we would shove them back into the Stone Age with Air power or Naval powerânot with ground forces.&quot;

Some military historians have argued that LeMay's theories were eventually proven correct. Near the war's end in December 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] ordered [[Operation Linebacker II]], a high-intensity Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps aerial bombing campaign, which included hundreds of [[B-52]] bombers that succeeded in widespread destruction of previously untouched North Vietnamese strategic targets. The intense bombing compelled the communist government to quickly conclude negotiations that finally ended America's war.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Others believe the impact was smaller, as the peace negotiations were only temporarily stalled and the North Vietnamese were trying to get better terms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Post-military career==
Owing to his unrelenting opposition to the Johnson administration's Vietnam policy and what was widely perceived as his hostility to Secretary McNamara, LeMay was essentially forced into retirement in February 1965 and seemed headed for a political career.{{Citation needed|date= April 2011}} Moving to [[California]], he was approached by conservatives to challenge moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Thomas Kuchel]] for his seat in the [[United States Senate]] in 1968, but he declined. For [[United States presidential election, 1968|the presidential race that year]], LeMay originally supported [[Richard Nixon]]; he turned down two requests by [[George Wallace]] to join his [[American Independent Party]] that year on the grounds that a third-party candidacy might hurt Nixon's chances at the polls (by coincidence, Wallace had served as a [[Sergeant#United States| sergeant]] in a unit commanded by LeMay during World War II.) However, LeMay gradually became convinced that Nixon planned to pursue a conciliatory policy with the Soviets and accept nuclear parity rather than retain America's first-strike supremacy.{{Citation needed|date= April 2011}} Consequently LeMay, while being fully aware of Wallace's segregationist platform, decided to throw his support to Wallace and eventually became Wallace's running mate. The general was dismayed, however, to find himself attacked in the press as a racial [[segregationist]] because he was running with Wallace; he had never considered himself a [[bigot]].  When Wallace announced his selection in October 1968, LeMay opined that he, unlike many Americans, clearly did not fear using nuclear weapons. His [[saber rattling]] did not help the Wallace campaign.

During the 1968 campaign, LeMay became widely associated with the &quot;Stone Age&quot; comment, especially because he had suggested use of [[nuclear weapons]] as a strategy to quickly resolve a deeply protracted [[conventional war]] which eventually claimed over 50,000 American plus millions of Vietnamese lives. This reputation did nothing to diminish perceptions of extremism in the Wallace-LeMay ticket. General LeMay disclaimed the comment, saying in a later interview: âI never said we should bomb them back to the Stone Age. I said we had the capability to do it.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The Wallace-LeMay AIP ticket received 13.5 percent of the popular vote, higher than most third-party candidacies in the United States, and carried 5 states for a total of 46 electoral votes, but this was not enough to deny Nixon his election as 37th President of the United States. Following the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 election]], LeMay returned to private life, including pursuing several charitable projects. He declined further suggestions to run for political office.

He was honored by several countries, receiving the [[Air Medal]] with three oak leaf clusters, the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] with two oak leaf clusters, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal |Distinguished Service Medal]] with two oak leaf clusters, the French [[LÃ©gion d'honneur| Legion of Honor]] and the [[Silver Star]]. On December 7, 1964 the Japanese government conferred on him the First Order of Merit with the [[Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun]]. He was elected to the [[Alfalfa Club]] in 1957 and served as a general officer for twenty-one years.

According to historian Warren Kozak, Wallace's defeat left LeMay's reputation among the general public in tatters. LeMay was commonly assumed to share Wallace's widely unpopular racist views, even though LeMay had enthusiastically supported racial integration in the U.S. military publicly and privately. He fought segregation in the Air Force before [[Executive Order 9981]] systemically banned the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Glazov | first = James âJamieâ | url = http://frontpagemag.com/2009/10/06/lemay-the-life-and-wars-of-general-curtis-lemay-by-jamie-glazov/ | title = Front Page Magazine | date = 2009â10â6 | contribution = LeMay: the life and wars of General Curtis LeMay}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellany==
===LeMay and UFOs===
The April 25, 1988 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' carried an interview with retired [[Air Force Reserve]] Major General and former U.S. Senator from Arizona, [[Barry Goldwater]], who said he repeatedly asked his friend General LeMay if he (Goldwater) might have access to the secret &quot;[[Project Blue Book|Blue Room]]&quot; at [[Wright Patterson Air Force Base]], alleged by numerous Goldwater constituents to contain [[UFO]] evidence. According to Goldwater, an angry LeMay gave him &quot;holy hell&quot; and said, &quot;Not only can't you get into it but don't you ever mention it to me again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'' (April 25, 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

===LeMay and sports car racing===

He was awarded the [[Woolf Barnato]] Award, SCCA's highest award for contributions to the Club, in 1954.&lt;ref name=SCCA2006/&gt; In November 2006, it was announced that General LeMay would be one of the inductees into the SCCA Hall of Fame in 2007.&lt;ref name=SCCA2006&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

==Rank history==
Curtis LeMayâs first contact with military service occurred in September 1924 when he enrolled as a student in the ROTC program at Ohio State University.  By his senior year, LeMay was listed on the ROTC rolls as a &quot;cadet lieutenant colonel&quot; but had not actually received an appointment in the regular United States military.

On June 14, 1928, the summer before the start of his senior year, LeMay accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery Reserve of the United States Army. In September 1928, LeMay was approached by the [[Ohio National Guard]] and asked to accept a state commission, also as a second lieutenant, which LeMay accepted. This created a unique situation in LeMay's [[service record]] since in 1928 it was unusual for a person to hold a commission both in the National Guard and the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]].

On September 29, 1928, LeMay enlisted in the Army Air Corps as an aviation cadet under the service number 6650359. For the next 13 months, LeMay was not only on the enlisted rolls of the [[Regular Army]] but also still held a commission in the National Guard and Army Reserve. Thus, for this short period in LeMayâs career, he was technically an officer and enlisted soldier at the same time, a practice no longer permitted in the U.S. military. The matter was resolved on October 2, 1929, when LeMayâs Guard and Reserve commission were terminated. According to his service record, these commissions were revoked &quot;by telephone&quot; after an Army personnel officer, realizing that LeMay was holding officer and enlisted status simultaneously, called him to discuss the matter.

On October 12, 1929, LeMay finished his flight training and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Corps Reserve.  This was the third time he had been appointed a second lieutenant in just under two years.  He held this reserve commission until June 1930, when he was appointed as a Regular Army officer in the Air Corps.

LeMay experienced slow advancement throughout the 1930s, as did most officers of the seniority-driven regular army.  At the start of 1940 he was still a first lieutenant but, beginning in 1941, began to receive temporary advancement in grade in the expanding Army Air Forces. LeMay advanced from first lieutenant to brigadier general in less than four years and by 1944 was a major general. When World War II ended, he was appointed to the permanent rank of brigadier general in the Regular Army but held his temporary rank of major general in the Army until promotion to lieutenant general in the now separate United States Air Force in 1948. He then was promoted to full general in 1951 and held this rank until his retirement in 1965.

===Further promotion===
According to letters in Curtis LeMay's service record, while he was in command of SAC during the 1950s several petitions were made by Air Force service members to have LeMay promoted to the rank of [[General of the Air Force (United States)|General of the Air Force]] (five stars). The Air Force leadership, however, felt that such a promotion would lessen the prestige of this rank, which was seen as a wartime rank to be held only in times of extreme national emergency.

Per the Chief of the Air Force General Officers Branch, in a letter dated February 28, 1962:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that a grateful nation, recognizing the tremendous contributions of the key military and naval leaders in World War II, created these supreme grades as an attempt to accord to these leaders the prestige, the clear-cut leadership, and the emolument of office befitting their service to their country in war.  It is the conviction of the Department of the Air Force that this recognition was and is appropriate.  Moreover, appointments to this grade during periods other than war would carry the unavoidable connotation of downgrading of those officers so honored in World War II.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, no serious effort was ever made to promote LeMay to the rank of General of the Air Force, and the matter was eventually dropped after his retirement from active service in 1965.

==Awards and decorations==
LeMay received recognition for his work from thirteen countries, receiving twenty-two [[medal]]s and [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|decorations]].
