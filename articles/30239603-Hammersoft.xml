The '''Italian regional elections of 1970''' were held on [[June 7]]. Even if the regional system was conceived by the [[Italian Constitution]] in [[1948]], the five [[autonomy|autonomous]] regions were the sole to be immediately established. The fifteen ordinary regions were indeed created in 1970 with the '''first''' elections.

==Electoral system==
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system of [[Italy]], and it was adopted for the regional vote too. Each [[Italian province]] corresponded to a constituency electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Droop quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at regional level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

==Results==
Summary of the results of all the lists reaching at least a tenth of the suffrages.
