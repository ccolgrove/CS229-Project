A '''Landolt C''', also known as a Japanese Vision Test, '''Landolt ring''' or '''Landolt broken ring''', is an [[optotype]], i.e. a standardized symbol used for testing vision.  It was developed by the Swiss-born [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] [[Edmund Landolt]].

The Landolt C consists of a ring that has a gap, thus looking similar to the letter C. The gap can be at various positions (usually left, right, bottom, top and the 45Â° positions in between) and the task of the tested person is to decide on which side the gap is. The size of the C and its gap are reduced until the subject makes a specified rate of errors. The minimum perceivable angle of the gap is taken as measure of the visual acuity. It is generally practiced in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2008. [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] &lt;/ref&gt;

The stroke width is 1/5 of the diameter, and the gap width is the same&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journalofvision.org/7/2/25/article.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. This is identical to the letter C from a [[Snellen chart]]. The Landolt C is the standard optotype for acuity measurement in most European countries. It was standardized, together with measurement procedures, by the German DIN [http://www.din.de], as DIN 58220 (now EN ISO 8596).
