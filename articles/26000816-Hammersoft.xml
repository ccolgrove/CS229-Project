'''Amrullah Saleh''' (or Amarullah Saleh, [[Persian language|Persian]]: Ø§ÙØ±Ø§ÙÙÙ ØµØ§ÙØ­; born 1972) is an [[politics of Afghanistan|Afghan politician]] who last served as the head of the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] [[National Directorate of Security]]. In 1997, at the age of 24, he was appointed by anti-[[Taliban]] leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] to lead the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]]'s (Northern Alliance) liaison office inside the Afghan Embassy in [[Dushanbe]] handling contacts to international non-governmental (humanitarian) organizations and intelligence agencies. After the fall of the Taliban regime, Saleh was appointed by President [[Hamid Karzai]] in early 2004 to lead the [[National Directorate of Security]].

==Biography==
Amrullah Saleh was born in the [[Panjshir Province]] of Afghanistan in 1972. 

In the late 1990s, in his early 20s, Saleh worked for the anti-[[Taliban]] resistance, the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] (Northern Alliance), under [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/924_interview_archiv/page2.shtml BBC (2008): Amrullah Saleh Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/2011/01/video-amrullah-saleh-spy-who-quit.html?utm_campaign=Feed%3A+FrontlineEditorsNotes+%28FRONTLINE+Editors%27+Notes%29&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedburner PBS (Frontline, January 2011): The Spy Who Quit]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Saleh was appointed to lead Massoud's international liaison office in [[Dushanbe]], [[Tajikistan]], where he served as a coordinator for non-governmental (humanitarian) organizations and as a liaision partner for foreign intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; 

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] against the [[United States]] Amrullah Saleh helped lead United Front intelligence on the ground in Afghanistan during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|US-led war in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/23/60minutes/main6014887_page2.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody CBS (60 Minutes, 2009) Shadow Warrior]&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the creation of the [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] Saleh was appointed to head Department One of Afghanistan's main intelligence agency, the [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS). The duties of Department One included liaison with foreign military, diplomatic, and intelligence organizations. Saleh reportedly had a falling out with the NDS's director Muhammad Arif Sarwari over his (Saleh's) enthusiasm for greater reform. This led to Saleh's assignment to a lesser post in late 2003. Sarwari was eventually removed from his post as leader of the NDS in early 2004 amidst various criticism that he had, amongst other things, abused his powers, worked against the government, and that the NDS had committed human rights violations. Amrullah Saleh was appointed as Sarwari's successor by [[President of Afghanistan|President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;/&gt; In June 2010 Saleh resigned from his position.

==National Directorate of Security==
Saleh helped rebuild the Afghan intelligence service and was considered as someone in the Afghan government with a clear understanding of the security challenges facing the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/07/world/la-fg-afghan-ousters-20100607|title =Afghan interior minister, top security official resign | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | first1=Alex | last1=Rodriguez | first2=David S. | last2=Cloud | date=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States considered Saleh and former interior minister [[Hanif Atmar]] two of the most effective ministers in Karzai's Cabinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;/&gt; 

On June 6, 2010, Amrullah Saleh resigned from the NDS after a militant attack against the [[Afghan Peace Jirga 2010|national peace jirga]], although the attack was thwarted and none of the assembly participants was hurt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;/&gt; Interior minister [[Hanif Atmar]] resigned the same day as Saleh. A few days after the jirga, Karzai had summoned Hanif Atmar and Amrullah Saleh to discuss the attack against the Jirga. After the meeting both men officially resigned because of the failure to stop the attack on the jirga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Officials Resign in Afghanistan Over Attack by Militants |url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/06/06/world/AP-AS-Afghanistan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2010-06-06}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-ousters-20100607,0,365761.story &quot;Afghan interior minister, top security official resign - They take the blame for the Taliban's attack on a peace assembly organized last week by President Hamid Karzai&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfexaminer.com/world/police-officer-2-civilians-killed-in-roadside-bomb-attack-in-southern-afghanistan-95714194.html &quot;Afghan interior, intel chiefs replaced over attack&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; CNSNews writes: &quot;Saleh told reporters he had submitted his resignation as general director of National Security because he had lost Karzaiâs trust as a result of the attack. He said he and Atmar had briefed the president on the security preparations for the jirga, and the subsequent &quot;success in ... capturing the facilitators,&quot; but Karzai had not been satisfied. He had therefore felt unable to continue in his post. He also said there were âtensâ of reasons for leaving his position, but would not elaborate on others.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNSNews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2010|url =http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/67187|title =Removal of Two Key Afghan Officials Seen As A Blow to the West| publisher = CNSNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two men's resignation/removal led to widespread concerns among Afghanistan experts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;/&gt; Concerns where voiced over the direction the country was moving.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNSNews&quot;/&gt; President Karzaiâs national security adviser, Rangin Dadfar Spanta, was quoted as saying: 
{{quote|&quot;With Amrullah Saleh, the Afghan people have lost a huge treasure of commitment, awareness and experience in this struggle against terrorism, Al Qaeda and the ISI. I canât think of anyone who will be able to even slightly fill the vacuum that he leaves behind. Besides being a highly efficient chief at the N.D.S., he is a man of knowledge and research with an incredible memory and intellect. When he analyzed issues at international meetings, he exhibited tremendous ability at logical reasoning. He was head and shoulder above others. ... I had many differences in arguments with him, but I always saw his presence at the N.D.S. as a huge advantage to this country and this government. Despite my high respects for the presidentâs decisions, I am extremely mournful about Salehâs departure. Extremely mournful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/afghan-media-criticize-security-officials-resignations Afghan Media Criticize Security Officialsâ Resignations]&lt;/ref&gt;|Rangin Dadfar Spanta|June 2010}}

The Afghan media also extensively covered the resignations with the daily newspaper Hasht e Subh headlining an article: ''&quot;Resignation of Atmar and Saleh: Accountability to the People or Tribute to Pakistan?&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times Blog&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/afghan-media-criticize-security-officials-resignations/|title =Afghan Media Criticize Security Officialsâ Resignations| publisher = [[New York Times]] | first=Mujib | last=Mashal | date=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The resignation of Saleh and Atmar came amidst heavy disagreement between Hamid Karzai and Amrullah Saleh on how to proceed against the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/4379.htm &quot;Former Afghanistan Intelligence Chief Says He Quit Because of President Karzai's 'Soft' Policy on Taliban, Says: 'This Soft Behavior Makes the Enemy's Intention Even Stronger and Makes the Confidence of Friends Shaky'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Iâm sure the disagreement between the two men and the president have been going on for awhile,&quot; said Daoud Sultanzoi, a member of Parliament from Ghazni who is a businessman and is viewed as independent.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/world/asia/07afghan.html|title =Afghan Leader Forces Out Top 2 Security Officials | publisher = [[New York Times]] | first=Alissa J. | last=Rubin |authorlink= Alissa J. Rubin | date=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleh publicly blamed the Pakistani government and army for its support of the Taliban and other extremist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile Karzai had increasingly been placing his hopes on his attempts to reach a deal with the Taliban and Pakistan. Pakistan had repeatedly urged Karzai to oust Saleh from his position.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/world/asia/12karzai.html?pagewanted=all|title =Karzai Is Said to Doubt West Can Defeat Taliban | publisher = [[New York Times]] | first=Dexter | last=Filkins | date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amrullah Saleh said he considered Hamid Karzai a patriot. But he said the president was making a mistake if he planned to rely on Pakistani support.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;/&gt;

In 2010 Saleh launched a peaceful campaign to warn that Hamid Karzai had lost conviction in the fight against the Taliban and was pursuing a compromise that could come at the cost of democracy, stability and human rights especially women's rights. He criticized Karzai's policy, which he called a &quot;fatal mistake and a recipe for civil war&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/22/AR2010072206155.html &quot;Minority leaders leaving Karzai's side over leader's overtures to insurgents&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&quot;My view is there must not be a deal with the Taliban. Ever. There must be a process. And according to that process, based on that process, the Taliban should become part of the society and play according to the script of democracy. They should be demobilized, disarmed, reintegrated the way the Northern Alliance was. ... And also they should denounce violence. And that process will bring a lasting stability. Minus that, if there is a deal, deals never bring stability. They create fragile peace. ... if there is a deal, we will resist against the deal, &quot;we&quot; meaning all the forces who fought the Taliban. ...&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;/&gt;|Amrullah Saleh|November 2010}}
