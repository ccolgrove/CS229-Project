New Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo continued as a part of Mexico. During Mexican rule, Governor [[PÃ­o Pico]], made Los Angeles [[Alta California]]'s regional capital.

===Topography===
[[File:Los Angeles Basin JPLLandsat.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Los Angeles Basin]]]]
Los Angeles is irregularly shaped and covers a total area of {{convert|502.7|sqmi|km2|0|sp=us}}, comprising {{convert|468.7|sqmi|km2}} of land and {{convert|34.0|sqmi|km2}} of water.&lt;ref name=gazetteer /&gt; The city extends for {{convert|44|mi|km}} longitudinally and for {{convert|29|mi|km}} latitudinally. The perimeter of the city is {{convert|342|mi|km}}. 

Los Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city is {{convert|5074|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Mount Lukens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#50| title=Elevations of the 50 Largest Cities (by population, 1980 Census) â USGS| publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]| accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angeles.sierraclub.org/hps/guides/09e.htm| title=Mount Lukens - Sierra Club - Hundred Peak Section | publisher=[[Sierra Club]] Angeles Chapter| accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the [[Mt. Washington, Los Angeles|Mt. Washington]] area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as [[Boyle Heights]], the [[Crenshaw, Los Angeles|Crenshaw district]] around the [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles|Baldwin Hills]], and the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] district.

The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, [[wetland]]s, and mountains. The most prevalent botanical environment is [[coastal sage scrub]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=George Oxford|title=Landscaping with Native Plants of Southern California|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RjbPQ6ZOgzMC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=6 October 2011|date=15 January 2008|publisher=Voyageur Press|isbn=978-0-7603-2967-2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which covers the hillsides in combustible [[California chaparral and woodlands|chaparral]]. Native plants include: [[California poppy]], [[matilija poppy]], [[Heteromeles|toyon]], [[Coast Live Oak]], and [[Leymus condensatus|Giant Wildrye]]. Many of these native species, such as the [[Helianthus nuttallii|Los Angeles sunflower]], have become so rare as to be considered endangered.

[[Washingtonia robusta|Mexican Fan Palm]]s, [[Washingtonia filifera|California Fan Palm]]s, and [[Phoenix canariensis|Canary Island Palm]]s can be seen throughout the Los Angeles area, despite the latter being non-indigenous to Southern California.

===Geology===
Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. The geologic instability has produced numerous [[fault (geology)|faults]], which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually.&lt;ref name=quakes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/facts.php |title=Earthquake Facts |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major faults is the [[San Andreas Fault]]. Located at the boundary between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]], it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news70114196.html |title=San Andreas Fault Set for the Big One |publisher=Physorg.com |date=21 June 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]], the 1987 [[Whittier Narrows earthquake]], the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]] near [[Sylmar, Los Angeles|Sylmar]], and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of the Los Angeles Basin}}

[[Image:LA Echo.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] as seen with [[Arecaceae|palm trees]]]]

Los Angeles has a [[Subtropical]]-[[Mediterranean climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Csb'' on the coast, ''Csa'' inland), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid KÃ¶ppen's ''BSh'' ([[semi-arid climate]]) classification. Los Angeles enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.&lt;ref name=weatherbase&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=159227&amp;refer=| title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Los Angeles, California, United States of America| publisher=Weatherbase.com| accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average annual temperature in downtown is {{convert|66|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}: {{convert|75|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|57|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} at night. In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from {{convert|59|to|73|F|C}} during the day and {{convert|45|to|55|F|C}} at night. In the warmest month â August â the temperature typically ranges from {{convert|79|to|90|F|C}} during the day and around {{convert|64|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} at night. Temperatures exceed {{convert|90|F|C|abbr=on}} on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September.&lt;ref name=weatherbase/&gt; Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30 Â°F (17 Â°C).&lt;ref name=NCDC-CANOGA&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/ca/041484.pdf  | title = Climatography of the United States No. 20 (1971â2000) â Canoga Park Pierce Collg, CA  | format=PDF  | year=2004  | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]  | accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature of the sea is {{convert|63|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}, from {{convert|58|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} in January to {{convert|68|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beachcalifornia.com/beach/california-ocean-temperature.html|title=Pacific Ocean Temperatures on California Coast|publisher=beachcalifornia.com|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/united-states/california/los-angeles-ca.php|title=Los Angeles Climate Guide|publisher=weather2travel.com|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a [[microclimate]], causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other.  For instance, the average July maximum temperature at the [[Santa Monica Pier]] is {{convert|75|F|C}} whereas it is {{convert|95|F|C}} in Canoga Park.&lt;ref name=climateofCA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/CALIFORNIA.htm | title = Climate of California | publisher = Western Regional Climate Center|accessdate = 6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city, like much of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called &quot;[[June Gloom]].&quot;  This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning which yield to sun by early afternoon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=Matthew R.|title=Frommer's Los Angeles 2011|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HAPWv2OkeXUC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=5 October 2011|date=22 September 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-62619-1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Los Angeles averages {{convert|15.14|in|mm|1}} of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November through April) with generally moderate rain showers, but often as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms during winter storms. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the mountains get slightly more. However the San Fernando Valley Region of Los Angeles can get between {{convert|16|and|20|in|mm}} of rain per year. Years of average rainfall are rare; the usual pattern is [[bimodal]], with a short string of dry years (perhaps {{convert|7|â|8|in|mm|disp=s}}) followed by one or two wet years that make up the average. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin, but the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was {{convert|2|in|cm|0}} in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;BurtStroud2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burt|first1=Christopher C.|last2=Stroud|first2=Mark|title=Extreme weather: a guide &amp; record book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SV229set7RIC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=5 October 2011|date=26 June 2007|publisher=W.

The [[Texas Transportation Institute]], which publishes an annual Urban Mobility Report, ranked Los Angeles road traffic as the most congested in the United States in 2005 as measured by annual delay per traveler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forbes.com/2008/04/24/cities-commute-fuel-forbeslife-cx_mw_0424realestate.html | title = Best And Worst Cities For Commuters | last = Woolsey | first = Matt | date = 25 April 2008 | accessdate = 24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average traveler in Los Angeles experienced 72 hours of traffic delay per year according to the study. Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco/[[Oakland]], Washington, D.C. and [[Atlanta]], (each with 60 hours of delay).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/04/24/cities-commute-fuel-forbeslife-cx_mw_0424realestate3_slide_3.html?thisSpeed=undefined | title = In Depth: 10 Worst Cities For Commuters | publisher = Forbes Magazine | last = Woolsey | first = Matt | accessdate = 24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the congestion in the city, the mean travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, [[Philadelphia]] and Chicago. Los Angeles' mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACS2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American Community Survey 2006, Table S0802|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DCGeoSelectServlet?ds_name=ACS_2006_EST_G00_}}{{dead link | date = October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include [[Interstate 5]], which runs south through San Diego to [[Tijuana]] in Mexico and then north to the [[Canada â United States border|Canadian border]] through [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], and [[Seattle]]; [[Interstate 10]], the southernmost eastâwest, coast-to-coast [[Interstate Highway]] in the United States, going to [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; and [[U.S. Route 101]], which heads to the [[California Central Coast]], San Francisco, the [[Redwood Empire]], and the [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. State)|Washington]] coasts.

===Transit systems===
[[File:Los angeles metro existing and under construction 2009.png|thumb|Current [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|Los Angeles Metro Rail]] map showing existing and under-construction lines.]]

The [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] and other agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines, as well as [[Rapid transit|subway]] and light rail lines across Los Angeles County, with a combined monthly ridership (measured in individual boardings) of 38.8&amp;nbsp;million as of September, 2011. The majority of this (30.5&amp;nbsp;million) is taken up by the city's bus system,&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/news/pages/ridership-statistics/ | publisher = Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority | title = Ridership Statistics | accessdate = 24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second busiest in the country. The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 8.2&amp;nbsp;million boardings per month.&lt;ref name=metro /&gt; In 2005, 10.2% of Los Angeles commuters rode some form of public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/13/real_estate/public_transit_commutes/index.htm| title = New Yorkers are Top Transit Users| accessdate =24 October 2011| first=Les|last= Christie| date = 29 June 2007| publisher=Cable News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phase of the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Expo Line]] is scheduled to open in November 2011. The [[Metro Orange Line]] is a [[bus rapid transit]] line with stops and frequency similar to those of a light rail. The city is also central to the [[commuter rail]] system [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]], which links Los Angeles to all neighboring counties as well as many suburbs.

Besides the rail service provided by Metrolink and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Los Angeles is served by inter-city passenger trains from [[Amtrak]]. The main rail station in the city is [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] just north of Downtown.

==Law and government==
{{See also|List of elected officials in Los Angeles}}
The city is governed by a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council]] system. The current [[Mayor of Los Angeles|mayor]] is [[Antonio Villaraigosa]]. There are 15 [[Los Angeles City Council|city council]] districts. Other elected city officials include the City Attorney [[Carmen Trutanich]] and the City Controller [[Wendy Greuel]]. The city attorney prosecutes misdemeanors within the city limits. The district attorney, elected by county voters, prosecutes misdemeanors in unincorporated areas and in 78 of the 88 cities in the county, as well as felonies throughout the county.

The [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) polices the city of Los Angeles, but the city also maintains four specialized police agencies; The Office of Public Safety, within the General Services Department (which is responsible for security and law enforcement services at city facilities, including City Hall, city parks and libraries, [[Los Angeles Zoo|the Los Angeles Zoo]], and the Convention Center), the Port Police, within the Harbor Department (which is responsible for land, air and sea law enforcement services at the Port of Los Angeles), the Los Angeles City Schools Police department which handles law enforcement for all city schools, and the Airport Police, within the [[Los Angeles World Airports]] Department (which is responsible for law enforcement services at all four city-owned airports, including [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX), [[LA/Ontario International Airport]] (ONT), [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]] (PMD), and [[Van Nuys Airport]] (VNY).

===Environmental issues===
[[Image:Los Angeles Pollution.jpg|thumb|center|500px|A view of Los Angeles covered in smog]]
The name given by the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] tribe of Native Americans for the area now known as Los Angeles translates to &quot;the valley of smoke.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;According to Gordon J. MacDonald, geophysicist and professor formerly with the [[University of California, San Diego]], quoted in {{cite news|first=Chris |last=Bowman |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080709015204/http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/1066675.html|url=http://www.sacbee.com/101/story/1066675.html|title=Smoke is Normal â for 1800|work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]|date=8 July 2008|archivedate=9 July 2008|accessdate = 6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The [[Los Angeles Basin]] and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to [[inversion (meteorology)|atmospheric inversion]], which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stimson|first=Thomas E.|title=What can we do about smog?|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=6 October 2011|date=July 1955|publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|page=65|issn=00324558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smog season lasts from May to October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Information1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Smog Hangs Over Olympic Athletes|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CJNJjq8h2zwC&amp;pg=PA393|accessdate=6 October 2011|date=11 August 1983|publisher=New Scientist|page=393|issn=02624079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only {{convert|15|in|mm|-1}} of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the [[United States Clean Air Act|Clean Air Act]]. More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating [[low-emission vehicle]]s. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years due to aggressive steps to reduce it, [[Electric car|electric]] and [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] cars, improvements in mass transit, and other pollution reducing measures.

The number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium. Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the [[American Lung Association]] ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;shortTermPollutedCities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2.html |title=People at Risk In 25 U.S. Cities Most Polluted by Short-Term Particle Pollution|publisher=[[American Lung Association]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070325171724/http://lungaction.org/reports/sota06_table2a.html|archivedate=25 March 2007|accessdate = 7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pittsburgh and Los Angeles the most polluted US cities|url=http://www.citymayors.com/environment/polluted_uscities.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080912203013/http://citymayors.com/environment/polluted_uscities.html|archivedate=12 September 2008|date= 4 May 2008|publisher=citymayors.com | accessdate = 7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[groundwater]] is increasingly threatened by [[Methyl tert-butyl ether|MTBE]] from [[filling station|gas stations]] and [[perchlorate]] from [[rocket propellant|rocket fuel]].

===Neighborhood councils===
[[Image:Bunker Hill Downtown Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|[[Bunker Hill, Los Angeles|Bunker Hill]] in L.A.]]
Voters created [[Neighborhood Councils]] in the Charter Reform of 1999. First proposed by City Council member [[Joel Wachs]] in 1996, they were designed to promote public participation in government and make it more responsive to local needs.

The councils cover districts that are not necessarily identical to the traditional neighborhoods of Los Angeles.

Almost ninety neighborhood councils (NCs) are certified and all &quot;[[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]&quot;âmeaning anyone who lives, works or owns property in a neighborhoodâmay vote for members of the councils' governing bodies. Some council bylaws allow other people with a stake in the community to cast ballots as well.

The councils are official government bodies and so their governing bodies and committees must abide by California's [[Brown Act]], which governs the meetings of deliberative assemblies.

The first notable concern of the neighborhood councils collectively was the opposition by some of them in March 2004 to an 18% increase in water rates by the city's [[Los Angeles Department of Water and Power|Department of Water and Power]]. This led the City Council to approve only a limited increase pending independent review. More recently, some of the councils petitioned the City Council in summer 2006 to allow them to introduce ideas for legislative action, but the City Council put off a decision.

The neighborhood councils have been allocated $45,000 each per year for administration, outreach and approved neighborhood projects.

In 2009, Los Angeles reported 314 homicides, which corresponds to a rate of 7.85 (per 100,000 population)âa major decrease from 1993, when the all time homicide rate of over 21.1 (per 100,000 population) was reported for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/assets/pdf/cityprof.pdf |title=LAPD Online Crime Rates |format=PDF |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the death of a [[LAPD Metropolitan Division#S.W.A.T. (âDâ Platoon)|SWAT]] team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's history.&lt;ref name=swat_killed&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lapdonline.org/officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty/content_basic_view/37466| title = Simmons, Randal| accessdate =July 9, 2008| work=[[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles crime family]] dominated organized crime in the city during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mafia.z04.org.ua/zPage_48.html |title=The Mafia Encyclopedia. mafia Ð¼Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð½Ñ. three 6 mafia.

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the city is home to 26,000 gang members, organized into 250 gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/1396 |title=Los Angeles Police Department Gang subsite |publisher=Lapdonline.org |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are the [[Crips]], [[Bloods]], [[SureÃ±os]], [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and [[18th Street gang|18th Street]]. This has led to the city being referred to as the &quot;Gang Capital of America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N08492271.htm|title=Police target 11 worst Los Angeles street gangs|publisher=Reuters AlertNet|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080218003406/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N08492271.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
