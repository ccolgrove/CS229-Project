The '''Trinity Centre''' (known as &quot;The Mall Aberdeen&quot; from 2006 to Dec 2009, and before that as Trinity Shopping Centre) is a one floor shopping centre in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]]. It has a two level Gold Award Car Park. There are 408 spaces and the main entrance is on Wapping Street. Wider spaces are available for parents and children and the disabled. Car Valeting services are now also provided.

The centre is located in the middle of the city with entrances on Union Street (the city's main shopping area), Bridge Street and Guild Street. There is also an underground link walkway to the rail and bus stations, and the new multi-million pound [[Union Square Aberdeen|Union Square]] development which opened in October 2009.

The centre was previously owned and operated by [[The Mall Fund|The Mall Company]]. They sold it to an asset management company in December 2009.
