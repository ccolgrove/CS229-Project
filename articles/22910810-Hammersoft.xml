==Religion==
In similarity to [[Pakistan]]is living other parts of the UK, 92% of Pakistanis in [[London]] are [[Muslim]]s. The other 6% are made up of people who did not declare their religion, [[Christian]]s make up 2% and those with no religion made up 1%.&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy.london.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; Pakistanis make up only 22% of [[London]]'s Muslim population, in contrast to 43% for British Pakistanis living throughout the UK.&lt;ref name=Communities/&gt;

==Economics==
The main industries which the Pakistani community of London are employed in include [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] (including self-owned grocery stores or newsagents).&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; In 2001, 0.6% of businesses in London were owned by British Pakistanis.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/Onlineresources/RWWC/themes/1084/1193 | title= Pakistani London | publisher = [[Museum of London]] | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20% of London's Pakistani population are self-employed.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

The percentage of London Pakistanis employed in managerial, senior official or professional occupations is 33%, which is slightly higher than the London average of 32%. It is also higher than the percentage of London Bangladeshis (22%) and similar to the percentage of Indians (34%) and Other Asians (31%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/publications/factsandfigures/DMAG_briefing2005-4.pdf |title=Pakistani community of London |author= |date= |work= |publisher=London Assembly |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate for Pakistani males and females in London is lower than the national average British Pakistanis living in other regions of Britain. Pakistanis are the only ethnic group (along with White Britions) who have a lower worklessness rate in London than in other areas of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/economic_unit/worklessness/Pam_Meadows.pdf | last =Meadows | first = Pam | title = Worklessness in London: why is it higher than in the rest of the country? | publisher = http://www.london.gov.uk | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social class==

As of 2001, almost equal amounts of Pakistanis in Inner (45%) and Outer London (46%) were [[middle class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

There are stark social differences in Pakistanis living in different boroughs of London. Whilst in [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] and [[Harrow (London Borough)|Harrow]] London Pakistanis are fairly prosperous and mostly Middle Class. The opposite is true in [[Newham]], where they are mostly working class and more likely to suffer from deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iomlondon.org/doc/mapping/Pakistan%20Mapping%20Exercise%20Final%20Report.pdf Pakistani mapping exercise |title=Pakistan Mapping Exercise  |author= |date= |page=11 |publisher=IOM London |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, 63.3% of Pakistani girls in London reached that threshold compared to the national average of 57%.&lt;ref name=Insted&gt;{{cite book | last = Richardson | first = Robin | coauthors = Angela Wood | url = http://www.insted.co.uk/raising2005.pdf | title = The Achievement of British Pakistani Learners | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2009-05-30 | publisher = Trentham Books, in association with the Uniting Britain Trust, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani applicants to universities are over-represented by 7.5% from Greater London.&lt;ref name=Insted/&gt; In education, Pakistanis in London performed the highest out of all [[British Pakistanis]] in the 2001 census.

This is marginally higher than the London average of 31% and is more than twice as high as the figure for London Bangladeshis (15%), equal to the figure for &quot;Other Asians&quot; and comparable to the figure of 34% for London Indians.
