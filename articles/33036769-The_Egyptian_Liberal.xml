On 9 September 2011, several thousand protesters forcibly entered the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]], [[Greater Cairo]], after breaking down a recently constructed wall built to protect the compound.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-671532 The return of calm in front of the embassy of Israel in Giza - CNN iReport]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/21049/Business/Economy/Israeli-workers-in-Egypt-fly-home-in-fear-for-own-.aspx Israeli workers in Egypt fly home in fear for safety - Economy - Business - Ahram Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after the protesters broke into a police station and stole weapons, the police fired [[tear gas]] in an attempt to protect themselves. The demonstrators eventually broke through the security wall and entered the offices of the embassy. Six embassy staff, who had been in a &quot;safe room&quot;, were evacuated from the site by Egyptian [[commando]]s, following the personal intervention of US President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL5E7KA0UV20110910 Israel lauds Obama's role in Cairo crisis | News by Country | Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/494183 Obama asks Egypt to protect Israeli embassy | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack, the Israeli deputy ambassador remained in Cairo; 85 staff members and their families returned to Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; The Egyptian army declared a state of alert.

== Background ==
{{main|EgyptâIsrael relations}}
[[File:Burning the Israeli flag at embassy in Cairo.jpg|thumb|right|On 15 May 2011, Egyptian protesters waved [[Palestinian flag]]s in front of the Israeli embassy in [[Giza]] as they burned a makeshift [[Israeli flag]].]]
During 2011, relations between Israel and Egypt deteriorated after the resignation of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]], reaching their lowest point since peace was established between the two nations by the [[EgyptâIsrael Peace Treaty|1979 EgyptâIsrael Peace Treaty]]. The Israeli-Egyptian border became a region of conflict and instability due to increased militant activity in Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]], and anti-Israeli sentiment was expressed in protests by masses of Egyptians in the streets of Giza.

On 18 August 2011, a squad of militants crossed the border from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] into southern Israel, [[2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks|killing eight Israelis]]. The ensuing Israeli counter-terrorist operations in close proximity to the border resulted in the deaths of &quot;at least three&quot; Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; The soldiers' deaths by Israeli fire{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} ignited protests at the Israeli Embassy in Giza.  During a demonstration on 20 August 2011, an Egyptian protester climbed 20&amp;nbsp;feet up the building's facade to remove the [[Israeli flag]].

The Egyptian [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] considered recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Tel Aviv. Eventually, Israel publicly apologized for the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews&quot;/&gt; Egypt stated that Israel's apology was &quot;insufficient.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz&quot;/&gt;

== The attack ==
{{see also|Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution under Supreme Council of the Armed Forces#September}}
On 9 September 2011, hundreds of Egyptian protesters began gathering outside of the Israeli embassy.  Around 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, they began to assault a concrete security perimeter wall with hammers and a [[battering ram]].&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube&quot;/&gt; Egyptian authorities had erected the wall following intense protests in August.

=== Building infiltration ===
At 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Saturday morning, several thousand protesters&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot;/&gt; breached the security wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egyptians protest against military rule - Middle East&quot;/&gt; By 1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. they had entered the lobby and proceeded through the rest of the building. The demonstrators ransacked the embassy, located on the 20th and 21st floors of the building, and threw items including documents, some marked &quot;[[confidential]]&quot;, from the windows of the building to the crowded street below.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram&quot;/&gt; The documents were quickly scanned and publicly commented on.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Israel later revealed that the remaining Israeli security staff had been separated from the rioters only by the steel door of a [[safe room]] in which they had taken refuge.

In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and various other senior Israeli officials watched the events unfold from a direct feed from the surveillance cameras installed in the embassy.

Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor estimated that about 3,000 protesters were involved in destroying the security wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; An Israeli diplomat condemned the attack as a &quot;serious violation&quot; of diplomatic behaviour.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera&quot;/&gt;

Immediately after the protesters had infiltrated the embassy, United States Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] received a call from Israeli [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] [[Ehud Barak]] asking for help. The United States assisted in assuring the protection of the Israeli embassy personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;haaretz1&quot;/&gt; Prime Minister Netanyahu later emphasized that he &quot;would like to thank the US President [[Barack Hussein Obama|Barack Obama]] for his help&quot; in securing the lives of the Israeli embassy staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera2&quot;/&gt;

=== Rescue of embassy staff and end of the riots===
Six Israeli security staff who were on the premises hid inside a reinforced safe room. Egyptian commando forces entered the embassy building and rescued the six Israeli guards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; All other embassy staff and their family members were escorted to [[Cairo International Airport]]. At 2:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., the Israeli ambassador and approximately 85 other Israeli diplomats and their family members arrived at the airport and were flown out of Egypt. Only the deputy Israeli ambassador remained in Egypt, staying at the US embassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes4&quot;/&gt; A senior Egyptian security official stated that the Egyptian commandos had been sent to the embassy after Israeli Ambassador Yitzhak Levanon spoke on the phone with an anonymous member of [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Egypt's ruling military council]], and asked him to arrange the safe evacuation of the embassy staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;/&gt;

The demonstration and ransacking of the embassy building continued into the early morning hours as the protesters burned tires and set several police cars on fire.  The Egyptian police eventually suppressed the riots and dispersed the thousands of rioters by using [[tear gas]] and firing warning shots into the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Prime Minister Netanyahu and Former Mossad director Efraim Halevy praised the actions of American president Obama in helping with the evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Robert. [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=238954 &quot;Defending Obamaâs pro-Israel credentials.&quot;] ''The Jerusalem Post'', 22 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following the attack, the Egyptian army heightened the state of alert in the country and reinstated martial law, otherwise known as [[State of Emergency]], on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek&quot;/&gt;

On the morning of Saturday, 10 September, [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Egypt's ruling military council]] rejected resignation requests that had been submitted by Egyptian Prime Minister [[Essam Sharaf]] and several Egyptian ministers. Their request was made because of the failure to handle the disturbances.&lt;ref name=&quot;xinhuanet&quot;/&gt;

One day after the attacks on the embassy, a group of reporters were attacked by a crowd of people still lingering near the scene of the riots. A reporter and producer were knocked to the ground and trampled, but managed to get to a vehicle in which they retreated, with protesters throwing stones at them. They were able to flee the area without sustaining any major injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angry crowd turns on journalists reporting embassy attack in Egypt&quot;/&gt;
