'''Thomas Kahlenberg''' (born March 20, 1983) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Association football|footballer]], who plays as an [[Midfielder (association football)|attacking midfielder]] for [[Germany|German]] team [[VfL Wolfsburg|Wolfsburg]]. He started his career with [[BrÃ¸ndby IF]], winning two [[Danish Superliga]] championship, and played four seasons at [[France|French]] club [[AJ Auxerre]]. He has played 29 games and scored three goals for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]], and represented Denmark at the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 European Championship]]. He was named 2004 [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish under-21 ''Player of the Year'']].

== Club career ==
At the age of 15,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hey Tommy Tommy|url=http://www.brondby.com/article.asp?aid=36326&amp;id=145|work=[[BrÃ¸ndby IF]]|date=December 21, 2005|accessdate=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlenberg moved from lower-league club [[Hvidovre IF]] to the defending Danish champions [[BrÃ¸ndby IF]] in the [[Danish Superliga]] championship.

=== BrÃ¸ndby and Auxerre ===
Kahlenberg did not make his senior debut for BrÃ¸ndby, until youth team coach [[Tom KÃ¸hlert]] was promoted to head coach in May 2002. On May 12, 2002, Kahlenberg made his Superliga debut against arch-rivals [[FC KÃ¸benhavn|KÃ¸benhavn]], at the penultimate match of the [[Danish Superliga 2001â02|2001â02 season]]. The result was a 1â1 draw, which helped BrÃ¸ndby secure the 2001â02 Danish championship on [[goal difference]].

During his first years at BrÃ¸ndby, Kahlenberg played in the central midfield, where he set up the attacks with his great technique and view for the game. In the [[Danish Superliga 2004â05|2004â05 season]], Kahlenberg was moved out as left midfielder, following the sale of [[Sweden national football team|Swedish international]] left winger [[Mattias Jonson]]. Cutting into the field from his wide position, Kahlenberg managed to become BrÃ¸ndby's [[Danish Superliga 2004-05#Top Goalscorers|2004â05 league top goalscorer]] with 13 goals, leading the club in winning ''[[The Double]]''. Kahlenberg played a combined total of 130 games for BrÃ¸ndby IF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1. holdsspillere i BrÃ¸ndby IF|url=http://brondby.com/article.asp?aid=32438|work=[[BrÃ¸ndby IF]]|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 97 games and 28 goals in the Danish Superliga championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;df&quot;&gt;[http://www.danskfodbold.com/spiller.php?ligaid=2001&amp;spillerid=10115 Thomas Kahlenberg] at DanskFodbold.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, the [[France|French]] club [[AJ Auxerre]] made a [[transfer fee]] offer of Â£2.5 million for Kahlenberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jens Gjesse|last=Hansen|title=Daniel Agger skifter til Liverpool|url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Int.fodbold/2006/01/11/100306.htm|work=[[Danmarks Radio]]|date=January 11, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2006|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; which BrÃ¸ndby accepted. Kahlenberg signed a four-year contract with Auxerre in the top-flight [[Ligue 1]] championship. Kahlenberg made the most [[assist (football)|assists]] of all players in the [[Ligue 1 2004â05|2004â05 Ligue 1]] championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;UEFA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UEFA.com's Team of the Tournament|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/Under21/news/Kind=1/newsId=427313.html|publisher=[[UEFA]]|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=February 1, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his four seasons at Auxerre, Kahlenberg played 130 games and scored 19 goals in the Ligue 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;lfp&quot;&gt;{{Lfpfr|first=Thomas|last=Kahlenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wolfsburg ===
In May 2009, Kahlenberg signed a four-year contract with the defending [[Germany|German]] champions [[VfL Wolfsburg]] for a â¬4 million transfer fee, effective from the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Denmark midfielder Kahlenberg joins Wolfsburg|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-05-28-67150075_x.htm|work=[[USA Today]]|date=May 28, 2008|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after joining Wolfsburg, Kahlenberg suffered an injury which kept him out until October 2009. He made his [[German Bundesliga]] debut for Wolfsburg in the 3â3 draw with [[1. FSV Mainz 05]] on October 31.&lt;ref name=&quot;fd&quot;&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/kahlenbergthomas/ Thomas Kahlenberg] at FussballDaten.de&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
While playing youth football at BrÃ¸ndby IF, Kahlenberg played a number of games for various Danish youth national teams on under-17 and under-19 levels from August 1999 to February 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbu&quot;&gt;[http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBasePlayerInfo.aspx?playerid=4344&amp;allmatch=1#match Thomas Kahlenberg â Alle hold (Alle kampe)] at [[Danish Football Association]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was recognized as one of the most talented Danish midfielders, and debuted for the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark under-21 national team]] in September 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbu&quot;/&gt; He debuted for the Danish senior national team under coach [[Morten Olsen]] on April 30, 2003 in a 1â0 friendly win against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dbu&quot;/&gt; He was selected as the youngest Danish player for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 European Championship]],&lt;ref name=&quot;slutrunde&quot;&gt;[http://www.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=435 Slutrundetrupper 1908â2004] at [[Danish Football Association]]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not play any games at the tournament. He subsequently won the 2004 [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish under-21 ''Player of the Year'']] award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=318 Arlas talentpriser 2009 â 1987] at [[Danish Football Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlenberg continued to play for the Denmark under-21 team until May 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;dbu&quot;/&gt; when he was selected for the Danish squad for the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2006 European Under-21 Championship]]. As age restrictions are calculated from the start of the qualification matches, in September 2006, he competed in the tournament at age 23. Even though Denmark was eliminated in the preliminary group stage, Kahlenberg managed to score three goals in three games, and he was selected for the &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UEFA&quot;/&gt; He ended his under-21 national team career after the tournament, having scored 10 goals in 26 matches for the Denmark under-21s.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbu&quot;/&gt;

After a lay-off from the senior national team, Kahlenberg was recalled for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 1|2010 World Cup qualifiers]]. In his second start of the qualifiers, he scored the winning goal against rivals [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], which helped Denmark qualify for the main tournament.
