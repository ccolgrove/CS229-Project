The '''North West 200''' is a motorcycle race meeting held each May in [[Northern Ireland]]. The course, made up of public roads running between the towns of [[Portstewart]], [[Coleraine]] and [[Portrush]] (''the Triangle'') is one of the fastest in the world, with speeds in excess of {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fastest&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/8676403.stm|title=Honda rider Steve Plater fastest at NW200 practice|agency=BBC|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=11 May 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of around fifteen events run on public roads between April and October throughout the island of [[Ireland]]. It is the largest annual sporting event in Ireland, with the race weekend attracting over 150,000 visitors from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/news/news-doe/news-doe-may-2009/news-doe-140509-other-motorists-have.htm  Other motorists have responsibility for bikers too, campaign warns] Northern Ireland Executive Website 2009-05-14 Retrieved 2010-01-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally intended to be held somewhere in the north west of Ireland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northwest200.org/history.aspx|title=The History of the North West 200|agency=North West 200 Website|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organised by the City of Derry &amp; District Motor Club, the initial event was moved to the north coast but the name was never changed. Since 1964 the event has been organised by the [[Coleraine and District Motor Club]]. In 2010 the meeting featured daytime practice on the Thursday for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.northwest200.org/news_article/103.aspx|title=Local People Urged to Support new NW200 Daytime Practice Session|agency=North West 200 Website|date=16 February 2010|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2011 North West 200 Races|2011]] event took place on Saturday 21 May. There were significant delays due to a hoax bomb alert and then an extensive oil spill on the track caused racing to be cancelled after the completion of only one race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= North West 200 racing abandoned|agency=BBC |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/northern_ireland/13467100.stm|work=BBC Sport |date= 21 May 2011|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race format==
The 'North West 200,' was originally ran over two hundred miles in as a handicap race, before changing to its current format of several separate races each running 4â6 laps during Saturday afternoon. Practice is held on the Tuesday and Thursday evenings before the race. Both the practice and races are held on closed roads but unlike the [[Isle of Man TT]] races which are run in a [[time-trial]] format, all riders compete together as with normal circuit racing.

Over the years the number and the classes of races has varied according to the latest regulations. From 1990 until 2010, there was always a 125 cc race and since 1992 the ''North West 200'' race has been for Superbikes.

==The course==
[[File:NorthWestCircuitMap2009.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=A detailed map of the circuit including corner name and indicated gears and speed|North West 200 circuit layout as of 2009.]]

The course is made up almost entirely of public roads (A2, B185 &amp; A29) but does include three speed reducing chicanes. The route, running anti-clockwise enters the outskirts of the towns passing many private houses. To help improve track safety street signs are removed at parts of the track and bales of hay are used to wrap the base of lampposts and telegraph poles. The circuit is {{convert|8.970|mi|km|abbr=on}} long, with a distance of {{convert|8.834|mi|km|abbr=on}} being covered on the first lap of every race. The original start/finish line was located near Magherabouy but moved to the Portmore Road in Portstewart in 1930.

1973 saw the first major changes to the course, which include the exclusion of the Promenade at Portstewart from the route and the moving of the start/finish line to its current location between Juniper Hill and Millbank Avenue. These changes meant the route used Station Road (B185) for the first time and saw the introduction of York Corner. Shell Hill Bridge, an iconic part of the original course was used for the last time in 1979. In 1980 a new link road, from University Corner to Ballysally Roundabout, was introduced. A chicane was introduced just before the approach to the Juniper Hill corner in 1983 and in 1988 improvements were made to [[Mather's Cross]] and the start/finish chicane was introduced to reduce the speeds around Primrose Hill as well as allowing safer access to the pitlane.

At the end of 2009 Mather's Cross was widened in order improve safety at the corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwest200.org/news_article/94.aspx Organisers Applaud Improvements at Mather's Cross] North West Official Website 2009-11-09 Retrieved 2010-01-28&lt;/ref&gt; For 2010 additional modifications were made to the circuit to improve safety. A new purpose built chicane at Matherâs Cross was introduced to reduce speeds at the corner and safety improvement made to the area at Station corner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwest200.org/news_article/114.aspx New Safety Improvements at Matherâs Cross and Station Corner] North West Official Website 2010-04-27 Retrieved 2010-05-08&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Brett]] recorded the first {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} lap of the course on a [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] 500cc in 1957. The current course lap record is held by [[Steve Plater]] at {{convert|124.109|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} which was set during the [[2006 North West 200 Races|2006]] event. The fastest recorded lap at {{convert|127.63|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was set by [[Tom Herron]] during the 1978 'North West 200' race. In 2004, [[Michael Rutter (motorcycle racer)|Michael Rutter]] became the first rider to record a top speed in excess of {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the course. During Tuesday's practice at the [[2010 North West 200 Races|2010]] event [[Stuart Easton]] set a new fastest speed trap time, touching {{convert|204|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the approach to University Corner.&lt;ref name=fastest /&gt;

==Deaths at the event==

{{see also|List of North West 200 Course fatal accidents|List of deaths by motorcycle accidents}}
The first recorded death at the event was Norman Wainwright who was killed in 1939.

===1979===
''Black Saturday'' as it is known, is regarded as the darkest day in the event's history after crashes claimed the lives of three riders, [[Tom Herron]], Brian Hamilton and Frank Kennedy who died months later from his injuries.

===Robert Dunlop===
[[Robert Dunlop]] was killed on 15 May 2008 while practising in the 250cc class. The incident occurred as he was approaching Mather's Cross during the 125/250/400cc practice session. It is understood his bike seized and Robert was thrown over his handlebars at approximately 160&amp;nbsp;mph. Fellow rider Darren Burns was following immediately behind and collided with Robert, suffering a broken leg and suspected concussion. Robert suffered severe chest injuries and died in hospital shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=Dunlop&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/motorbikes/7403931.stm|title=Dunlop dies after motorbike crash|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 May 2008|accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mark Young===
Twenty-two-year-old [[Mark Young (motorcycle racer)|Mark Young]] died during the 2009 event on 17 May 2009. He crashed at the same corner as Robert Dunlop, raising serious concerns about the circuitâs safety. It was Young's first race at the North West 200 though he had road racing experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/young/3080145 Promising rider who died at the North West 200 road race in Northern Ireland] Lasting Tribute Website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winners==
Northern Irishman [[Robert Dunlop]] holds the record number of wins, totalling fifteen victories throughout his career. His brother [[Joey Dunlop|Joey]] won thirteen races, but the event has been dominated in recent years by Englishman [[Michael Rutter (motorcycle racer)|Michael Rutter]], who has won twelve races from 1997 to 2008. The next generation of Dunlop entered the record books in 2008 when Robert's son [[Michael Dunlop|Michael]] won the 250 cc race. The following year another son, [[William Dunlop (motorcycle racer)|William]], won two races.

The early years of the event was dominated by British motorcycle manufacturers, in particular [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]]. It was only in 1964 that [[Honda]] claimed their first victory. 2010 saw [[BMW]] score their first victory at the event and also the first non-Japanese manufacturer to claim a victory since 1997. [[Yamaha]] is the only manufacturer to have a clean sweep, winning all five races in 1979.&lt;!--Note for editors: Honda did win all the races in 1998 but the 125 cc races was abandoned with no result--&gt;
