'''3e''' (''3 entertainment'') is a [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] [[television network]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Launched on [[5 January]] [[2009]] (replacing Channel 6 which previously launched in March 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Carroll |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Channel 6 rebranded by owner TV3 as 3e |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0105/1230936655682.html |work=[[The Irish Times]] |publisher= |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel is operated by Kish Media a subsidiary of [[TV3 Ireland|TV3 Group]] owned by  [[Doughty Hanson &amp; Co]].

==The TV3 Group==
The TV3 Group was established in [[January 2009]]. The network operates TV3 and its sister channel 3e and its online service '''tv3.ie'''. The networks studios is located at [[Ballymount]], [[Dublin]]. TV3 was initially the first channel from the network launched in [[1998]]. The network expanded in [[2008]] when TV3 purchased rival channel Channel 6 and rebranded the channel in January 2009 as 3e. In [[November 2008]], '''tv3.ie''' website was rebranded, with the intention to develop it into an entertainment portal. Catch up facilities, as well as exclusive content is available for TV3 programming as are news, weather, sport and entertainment updates.

==Broadcasting policy==
3e broadcasts a wide range of programming which is made up largely of [[US]], [[Australian]] and [[UK]] television acquisitions, while also airing some Irish content. 3e utilizes the existing staff at TV3 (200 employees) to operate the channel. The channel airs mainly dramas, comedy, sports and movies. The channel provides a diverse mix of programming both local and international, targeting a demographic ranging between 16 to 35 year olds.

==Availability==

The channel is currently available to 90% of homes within the Republic of Ireland through the national [[digital terrestrial television]] service [[Saorview]] since November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?threadid=2056092641&lt;/ref&gt;
It is available to 80% of homes through digital cable and satellite service such as [[UPC Ireland]], [[Magnet Networks]], [[Smart Telecom|Smartvision]] and [[Sky Ireland]].

==History==
===Concept===

The channel was originally operated by Kish Media's subsidiary ''Channel 6 Broadcasting Ltd''. This was initially owned by a consortium made up of Tullamore Beta, Barry family of Barry's Tea and Gowan Group. In its infant stages, the channels consortium invested â¬14 million to fund the project. The idea behind the channel was to compete with [[RTÃ]]'s second general entertainment channel [[RTÃ Two]] which targets a similar demographic and [[TV3 Ireland]]. It was anticipated that Channel 6 would launch further channels including a Channel 6+1 service and a music channel.

The station's first [[managing director]] was Martin Drake, who left the company after just eight months, and after a period under interim CEO Mark Kellett, the channel's top job was taken by Managing Director Michael Murphy, who later left the channel when it was fully transferred over to TV3 and integrated into the TV3 Group. In June 2008, it was reported that Kish Media were in discussions to sell Channel 6. It was later reported in [[July 2008]] that its rival [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]], would purchase the channel for around â¬10 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.ie&quot;&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/media/tv3-to-buy-channel-6-for-836410m-1441338.html ''Irish Independent'', 26 July 2008: ''TV3 to buy Channel 6 for â¬10m'']. Retrieved 2008-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was given the approval of the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]], and was approved by the Irish Competition Authority thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/tv3s-836410m-takeover-move-for-channel-6-clears-first-hurdle-1445268.html ''Irish independent'', 2 August 2008: ''TV3's â¬10m takeover move for Channel 6 clears first hurdle'']. Retrieved 2008-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, TV3 confirmed they were to rebrand Channel 6 to '''3e''' on 5 January 2009. The channel would utilize existing TV3 programming and provide TV3 audiences with a wider range of programming. 3e provides viewers with a broad mix of US and Australian acquisitions and is often used as a TV3 replay service featuring repeats of previously broadcasted programs on TV3 such as [[Ireland AM]], [[Expose (TV3 series)|Expose]] and [[Midday]]. In November 2010, the TV3 Group confirmed 3e made financial losses, but expect revenue to increase in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/1106/1224282791429.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ireland-channel-6.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Channel 6 Logo]]

== Restructuring ==
* With the announcement that TV3 Group would operate the channel. It was confirmed in December 2008 that TV3 would axe the majority of Channel 6's homegrown programming which included ''[[Night Shift (Irish TV series)|Night Shift]]'' which had a cult following. The controversial move to cancel the series was reported in the media with major criticism from music journalists and music fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.ie/channel-6s-night-shift-to-be-taken-off-air/|title=Channel 6âs NightShift to be taken off air|date=2008-12-08|accessdate=2008-12-25|publisher=''[[State (magazine)|State]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other shows which were cancelled with TV3's acquisition of Channel 6 included music shows ''Day Shift'' and ''Pop Scene'', and ''Take 6'', a weekly movie review show.

* From 2009, TV3 began to use the channel as a replay service. In late 2010, 3e began producing its own programming which includes ''FYI'' (previously [[3e#News and sport|3e News]]) and ''Uploaded''.

* 3e was made available on [[Sky Ireland]] in late 2009. Previously, under the Channel 6 branding the channel was not available on this service due to a dispute between Kish Media and Sky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/satellite/a28568/no-sky-launch-for-irelands-channel-6.html ''Digital Spy'', 29 January 2006: ''No Sky launch for Ireland's Channel 6'']. Retrieved 2008-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation was rectified on 29 September 2009 when TV3 Group and [[Sky Ireland]] confirmed that that 3e would be made available on its service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv3.ie/pr_sub.php?type=1&amp;view_pr=75 ''TV3 Press Release'', 29 September 2009: ''TV3 ANNOUNCES NEW HOME ON SKY FOR 3e ''].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It was reported on 24 July 2009; [[TV3 Ireland|TV3 Group]] sought to change 3e's licensing from the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/broadcasting-watchdog-to-rule-on-crossmedia-obrien-probe-1838223.html|title=Broadcasting watchdog to rule on cross-media O'Brien probe|date=2008-07-26|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July 2009, the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] announced that the 3e licence would be licensed under Section 34, rather than Sections 36 and 41, of the Broadcasting Act 2001.  This means that 3e is no longer a separate cable and satellite service rather it will be covered by the main terms and conditions of the existing TV3 contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282379&amp;tpl=archnewshome&amp;force=1|title=BCI Approves Changes to Setanta Ireland &amp; Awards New Contracts|date=2008-07-29|accessdate=2008-07-29|publisher=''[[Irish Film and Television Network|IFTN]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewing figures ===
* TV3 Group reported on 12 November 2009 that 3e's viewing figures had increased since moving to Sky 105. Its audience share increased by 25% from 0.9% to 1.1% - this brought the channel back to the audience figures received by Channel 6 at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/business/media/3e-to-launch-own-news--after-reporting-25pc-surge-in-new-sky-slot-1940290.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* As of 2010, 3e has increased its viewing figures through an increase in Irish programming and live sports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv3.ie/pr_sub.php?type=2&amp;view_pr=86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budget===
In [[2008]], TV3 received â¬3 million in funding from the licence fee for independent productions on the channel. In [[2009]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/1024/1224257392869.html&lt;/ref&gt; TV3 had revenues of â¬54,300,000. In the previous year (2008), TV3 received â¬62 million in advertising revenue. Increases in programme cost during 2008 included new sporting contracts with the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] and [[UEFA]], the first renewal of their contract with the British broadcaster [[ITV]] for shows such as ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X-Factor]]'' and ''[[Coronation Street]]'', a small but significant increase in programmes commissioned from independent producers and their takeover of Channel 6 (now 3e). They also increased their investment in online technology, with their online service earning a profit for the first time. In [[2009]], two rounds of redundancies reduced TV3 staff to 213 people. Staff savings have been augmented by agreed reductions in wages. The 200 staff working in TV3 now provide seven hours of live television five days a week, an increase of two hours and a staff reduction of 50 since 2007.

In [[2010]], 3e's parent company recorded losses at the station during 2009. A pre-tax loss of â¬5million was reported to the Irish Company Registrars Office (CRO). Kish Media will not look to recoup their â¬14.5million investment until such time as the channel begins to make profits and when all liabilities at the station are paid as they fall due. It is expected that the channel will move into profit in 2010, however the downturn in the Irish market and falling advertising rates did cause the channel problems during 2009. Revenue was down in 2008 from 2007, while expenses during 2008 had be reduced slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCaughren |first=Samantha |url=http://www.thepost.ie/news/ireland/3e-records-losses-but-profit-expected-this-year-47536.html |title=3e records losses, but profit expected this year |publisher=The Post |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
In [[2009]], several rearrangements of the 3e schedule occurred - as it re-branded from Channel 6 - including showing repeats of ''[[Xpose]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'' straight after [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], followed by putting ''Xpose'' on at 17:30 instead of 18:30 and removing repeat showings of ''Emmerdale'' and replacing them with repeat showings of ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Each of the changes failed to ignite 3e audience share, at first a small drop was seen.  As you can see Xpose was returned to 18:30, while a ''Coronation Street'' omnibus was on a Sunday afternoon, however ultimately both ITV soaps were dropped from the schedule.

===Homegrown===
* As Channel 6 the channel produced several shows to compete with both [[RTÃ Two]]'s and [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]'s youth orientated programming, such as, ''[[Cois Farraige]]'' an Irish surfing and surf culture show hosted by Jenny Buckley , ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' also hosted by Jenny Buckley, ''[[Day Shift]]'' a weekend morning music show, ''Game On'' a video games show, ''[[Night Shift (Irish TV series)|Night Shift]]'' a late night interactive music show hosted by [[Michelle Doherty]], ''[[Quiz 6]]'' a phone-in quiz show, where viewers could answer on screen puzzles to win cash and ''[[Take Six]]'' a movie show hosted by Elsa Jones, Sean Musanje and Serena Bellissimo. Channel 6 had cancelled all but ''Day Shift'', ''Night Shift'', ''Pop Scene'' and ''Take 6'' by the time TV3 had bought the station. TV3 cancelled all of the remaining Channel 6 programmes as they relaunch the channel as 3e.
* With the relaunch of the channel to 3e the Channel 6 programming was replaced by repeats of TV3's ''[[XposÃ©]]'', ''[[XposÃ©]]XTRA'' and ''[[The Holiday Show]]''. Towards the end of 2009 TV3 began to produce more programming ''Xccelerate'' a weekly motoring show for 3e, produced by City Productions for TV3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.tv3.ie/pr_sub.php?type=1&amp;view_pr=83 |title=IRELANDâS ONLY MOTORING SHOW REVS UP ON 3e |publisher=TV3 |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[2010]], TV3 will bring their mix of homegrown morning shows to the channel as repeats. ''[[Ireland AM]]'' will be repeated on 3e each morning at 10:15, ''The Morning Show'' will be repeated the following morning on 3e at 09:25 and ''Midday'' will be repeated the following morning on 3e at 08:35.

* Although designed as an entertainment channel, 3e started broadcasting news updates shortly after the station rebranded to 3e. ''3e News Update'' is a minute long news broadcast from [[TV3 News]]. ''3e News Update'' broadcasts Monday to Friday at 18:59, 19:59, 20:59, and 21:59. The News Updates were presented by TV3 News presenters.
* Since September 2009 TV3 Sport has provided live coverage of the [[UEFA Europa League]] (formerly the [[UEFA Cup]]) on 3e, the Irish rights for which TV3 shares with [[Setanta Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/multimediafiles/download/competitions/uefacup_/67/58/75/675875_download.pdf |title=MEDIA content rights sales: UEFA Europa League |publisher=UEFA |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CEO of the TV3 Group [[David McRedmond]] revealed in an interview with [[Hot Press]] on Thursday 8 October 2009 that '''3e''' would produce a new news programme targeting a demographic between 15 to 34 years of age. The show will air every evening and it is expected to start broadcasting at the end of October 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/David%20McRedmond/news/TV3%20boss%20compares%20Irish%20media%20control%20to%20Soviet%20State%20system/5889866.html |title=TV3 boss compares Irish media control to Soviet State system |publisher=Hot Press |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the show's launch was put back until the end of November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=O2 Ideas Room |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/3e-to-launch-own-news--after-reporting-25pc-surge-in-new-sky-slot-1940290.html |title=3e to launch own news after reporting 25pc surge in new Sky slot - Media, Business |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== On air identifiers ==
March 2006âpresent: Channel 6 launched it first set of identifiers (idents) in March 2006 and they remained on the channel up to December 2008 with the re-brand of the channel. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality. There were several indents during this period. The 'blue dot' in the centre of the six would be transformed from a symbol representing entertainment into the 'blue dot'. Examples of those symbols include, the masks for drama and comedy, film reels, a television set etc..

January 2009âpresent: Channel 6 was rebranded 3e in January 2009. The new idents were made by Dublin based Image Now. The 3e idents consists of the 'e' bouncing around the screen next to the '3',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67ZJwGUqWjQ&amp;feature=related |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}{{Failed verification#doc_editlinks|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; one is generic while the other one has the 'e' in flames trying to put them out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gJuIxr4CNE&amp;feature=related |title=3e ident January 2009 to Present - Fire |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A third ident was added in October 2009 for use before soccer matches, it shows the 'e' kicking a football against the '3'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBcMuV60Uy8 |title=3e ident January 2009 to Present - football |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth ident was added in October 2010, which features the 'e' slipping on a banana skin as a pie and rake hits it.
