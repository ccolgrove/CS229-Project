Since 1991 NSU has seen 24 players make baseball their profession, ranging from [[MLB]] to Independent Leagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsuathletics.nova.edu/baseball/forms/prosharks.pdf Retrieved on July 9, 2008.]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NSU athletes have also been successful outside of baseball. Much like many NSU baseball players, these other student-athletes, have also had the chance to pursue professional careers in both soccer and basketball.

Many athletic events at NSU take place at [[The University Center at Nova Southeastern University|University Center Arena]]. In 2005, students voted for a new school mascot, and the student body selected the Sharks. NSU's athletic teams had previously been known as the Knights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsuathletics.nova.edu/aboutus/index.cfm About the Sharks]  Retrieved on July 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
