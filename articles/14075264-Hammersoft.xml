The '''[[South Carolina Gamecocks]] women's [[basketball]] team''' represents the [[University of South Carolina]] and competes in the [[Southeastern Conference]].  The team enjoyed its greatest success under head coach [[Nancy Wilson (coach)|Nancy Wilson]] during the 1980s in the [[Metro Conference]] when it won five regular season conference championships and three conference tournament championships.  Since 2002, the team plays its home games at the [[Colonial Life Arena]].

==History==
The first Gamecocks women's basketball team to compete at an intercollegiate level dates back to 1923 when they were called the '''Pullets'''.  The first varsity team, known as the '''Carolina Chicks''', took to the court in January 1974 under the guidance of [[Pam Backhaus]].  The inaugural team compiled a record of 15-7 and were the South Carolina [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] Champions.  In 1977, with [[Pam Parsons]] as the head coach the women's basketball team, they changed their nickname to the '''Lady Gamecocks''' and made post-season trips every year with her at the helm.  However, Parsons was forced to resign when [[Sports Illustrated]] published a story, ''Stormy Weather at South Carolina'', that accused Parson of having a sexual relationship with one of her players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Pam Parsons Scandal of 1984 ''|url=http://qsaltlake.com/2005/7/williams_ben.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program enjoyed its greatest run of success when it joined the [[Metro Conference]] in 1983.  During its eight seasons in the league, the Lady Gamecocks won the regular season championship five times and the conference tournament three times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''South Carolina Women's Basketball History''|url=http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/041802aaj.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head Coach [[Susan Walvius]] resigned on April 14, 2008 and [[Dawn Staley]] was named the new head coach of the Lady Gamecocks on May 7.
