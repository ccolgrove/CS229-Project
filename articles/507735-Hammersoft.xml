These are tables of '''[[Magic: The Gathering]] card sets'''.  A [[trading card game]] published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], Magic is primarily marketed in '''base/core sets''' and in '''expansion sets'''.  Except for the game's original release (''[[Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)|Alpha]]''/''[[Beta (Magic: The Gathering)|Beta]]'') core sets through ''[[10th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Tenth Edition]]'' consisted entirely of reprints; from ''[[Magic 2010]]'' on new cards have been printed in core sets, although reprints still comprise the majority of the set&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/27a |title=Recapturing the Magic with Magic 2010 |author=Aaron Forsythe |date=Monday, February 23, 2009 |publisher= |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The core sets have ranged in size from 249 cards (''[[Magic 2010]]'') to 449 cards (''[[5th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Fifth Edition]]'').  Expansion sets, which have ranged in size from 92 cards (''[[Arabian Nights (Magic: The Gathering)|Arabian Nights]]'') to 422 cards (''[[Time Spiral]]''), are primarily comprised of new cards, with few or no reprints.  ''Compilations or reprint sets'' are distinguished by generally not being released in randomized boosters, instead containing a pre-selected card pool(possibly including new cards). [[List of Magic: The Gathering theme decks|Theme decks]] serve a similar function however they are always attached to a specific set or block, while compilations are free to pick and choose cards from any set.

All expansion sets, and all editions of the base set from ''[[6th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Sixth Edition]]'' onward, are identified by an expansion symbol printed on the right side of cards, below the art and above the text box. From ''[[Exodus (Magic: The Gathering)|Exodus]]'' onward, the expansion symbols are also color-coded to denote rarity: black for common and basic land cards, silver for uncommon, and gold for rare. Beginning with the ''[[Shards of Alara]]'' set, a red-orange expansion symbol denotes a new rarity: &quot;Mythic Rare&quot;(the ''[[Time Spiral]]'' set featured an additional purple coloration for &quot;timeshifted&quot; cards&lt;ref name=&quot;timeshifted-Rosewater&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Purple Reign | work=Making Magic | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr247 | first=Mark | last=Rosewater | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2006-09-25 | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For the early expansion sets (from ''Arabian Nights'' to ''Alliances''), the rarities of cards were often much more complicated than the breakdown into common, uncommon, and rare suggests. The actual distribution can be found in the respective set's article.  Cards in compilations are assigned rarity by Wizards, however, they do not necessarily match within the set, with some singletons rare and some mythic rare in a given set.

Wizards of the Coast assigns an internal development codename&lt;ref name=&quot;devcodenames&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Codename of the Game | work=Making Magic | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr33 | first=Mark | last=Rosewater | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2002-08-12 | accessdate=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a three-character expansion code&lt;ref name=&quot;set-code&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=August 12, 2004 | work=Ask Wizards | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0804 | first=Wendy | last=Wallace | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2004-08-12 | accessdate=2007-04-11}})&lt;/ref&gt; to each set.

==Base/core set editions==
{{anchor|core set}}
After the second version (''Beta'') of the first set, which contained two cards mistakenly excluded from the first version (''Alpha''), all subsequent base sets through ''10th Edition'' consisted of cards that had been printed before in either the original base set or an expansion set.  ''[[Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)|Alpha]]'' through ''[[5th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Fifth Edition]]'' did not have set symbols printed on the actual cards, though those sets were retroactively given set symbols in [[Wizards of the Coast]]'s official Gatherer&lt;ref name=&quot;gatherer&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Gatherer: The Official Magic: The Gathering Database | url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; database of Magic cards.

==Expansion sets==

Expansion sets beginning with ''Mirage'' have come in groups (usually three) which form a ''block'' (the preferred term in actual gameplay) or ''cycle'' (the preferred term when describing the associated [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]]) consisting of one large &quot;stand-alone&quot; expansion set of more than 300 cards, followed by one or two small expansion sets of less than 200 cards, which continue the themes introduced in the large set. In recent years the large stand-alone expansion sets have had about 250 cards. Like the base set, stand-alone expansion sets contain basic land cards; other expansion sets do not. Beginning with ''[[Alliances (Magic: The Gathering)|Alliances]]'', expansion sets were given [[codename]]s while in [[game design|development]]; the code names of the three expansions of a cycle usually fit together to form a phrase or common theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;devcodenames&quot;/&gt;

''Ice Age'' and ''Alliances'' were the first two sets to have a well-defined relationship, but were not created as a canonical block at the time of printing.  Also beginning with ''Alliances'' in June 1996, expansion sets were released in a regular pattern: the base sets were released in October with the small expansion sets being released in February and June (''Alliances'' was originally the third set of the block; it was retroactively made a second set with the release of ''[[Coldsnap]]'' in 2006). With the exceptions of ''[[Stronghold (Magic: The Gathering)|Stronghold]]'', a 1998 set released in March rather than February, and ''[[Scourge (Magic: The Gathering)|Scourge]]'', a 2003 set which was released in May rather than June, this pattern of months was never broken, over a 10-year period, until 2006, when ''[[Dissension (Magic: The Gathering)|Dissension]]'' was also released a month early in May instead of June, because of the July release of ''Coldsnap''. The third set in a block has since been released in late April or early May. Since 2005 there has been a fourth release date each year in mid-July. Since [[Magic 2010]] this has been reserved for Core Sets, since they are now released on an annual basis; before that, core sets would occupy this slot every other year, alternating with special releases such as Coldsnap and [[Eventide]].{{ref label|EVE|XXVI|}}  In recent years Wizards has experimented with other block models, with [[Lorwyn]] and [[Shadowmoor]] comprising two, connected mini-blocks of a large expansion followed by a single small expansion and the [[Zendikar|Zendikar block]] with [[Rise of the Eldrazi]] replacing the second small set with a stand alone large set.

Most early expansion sets did not have exact '''release dates'''; they were just shipped out within the space of a week, and retailers could start selling them as soon as the sets were received. By the time of ''Alliances'' in 1996, however, release dates were set as Mondays (the earliest set with an exact Monday release date might possibly have preceded ''Alliances'', but ''Alliances'' is the earliest set with a cited and confirmed Monday release date). Beginning with ''[[Mirrodin]]'' in 2003, the release dates were changed from Monday to Friday.

All sets beginning with ''[[Homelands (Magic: The Gathering)|Homelands]]''{{ref label|prerelease-first|VI|}} also have a '''pre-release date''', on which cards are sold in limited quantities in pre-release tournaments. These tournaments were formerly always held two weeks before the release date, but since ''[[Shards of Alara]]'' they are now held one week before the release date.

== Compilations/reprint sets ==
[[Reprint]] sets are sets of certain cards from previous sets that were re-released for different reasons.  Some reasons include the cards were fan favorites and popular demand brought them back or in some cases, reprints were to commemorate certain events such as widely known matches or anniversary sets.  Some reprint sets revolved around a certain theme; for example, ''[[Beatdown (Magic: The Gathering)|Beatdown]]'' was themed around old, out-of-print, heavy-hitting creatures. Reprinting a card in one of these sets does not affect when it leaves Standard and Extended.

Some decks include cards never previously printed. [[Planechase]] and [[Archenemy (Magic: The Gathering)|Archenemy]] sets feature oversized cards not legal in sanctioned formats that are intended to affect every player in game, and beginning with [[Commander (Magic: The Gathering)|Commander]], some introduce new multiplayer-oriented cards legal only in eternal formats; [[Commander (Magic: The Gathering)|Commander]] introduces 51 such, while [[Planechase (2012 Edition)]] introduces 21 such.

:{{note|size-LEALEB2ED|I}}: Two cards, the common Circle of Protection: Black and the rare Volcanic Island, were inadvertently left out of the printing of ''[[Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)|Alpha]]''. ''[[Beta (Magic: The Gathering)|Beta]]'' and ''[[Unlimited (Magic: The Gathering)|Unlimited]]'' included the two missing cards as well as one additional alternate art variant of each of the five basic lands. Consequently, those two sets each have seven more cards than ''Alpha'' did.&lt;ref name=&quot;size-LEALEB2ED&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Magic General FAQ | url=http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?p=8284086 | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2003-09-22 | quote=Circle of Protection: Black and Volcanic Island were excluded from Alpha as well as five basic lands (one of each type). | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|RevisedSummer|II}}: When the ''[[Revised Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Revised Edition]]'' was in production in 1994, a number of problems with the set became apparent. Some cards' colors were washed-out. The picture and color foreground for the Serendib Efreet were wrong (not that this was the first such misprint), and there was a growing concern with the [[Satanism|Satanic]] images on some of the cards. The solution was to print a &quot;fixed&quot; version of ''Revised Edition'', code named &quot;Edgar&quot;, which has since came to be known as ''[[Revised Edition (Magic: The Gathering)#Summer Magic|Summer Magic]]'' because it was printed in the summer of 1994. The cards were distributed in regular ''Revised Edition boosters'', but no ''Summer Edition'' starters were produced. Despite its intended function as a fixed ''Revised Edition'', there were problems with ''Summer Magic''. On some cards, the colors were too dark. Furthermore, Hurricane was printed as a blue card and thereby became the most famous and most desired ''Summer Magic'' card of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Blue Hurricane | work=Magic Arcana | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/375 | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2007-02-15 | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serendib Efreet had its artwork corrected, but the artist name was still wrong, as was that of Plateau (which had, uniquely out of the cards in Revised, received new art, but not an updated artist credit to reflect that). Because of all these flaws, the entire print run was recalled and destroyed which led to ''Revised Edition'' shortage in 1994. However, a few booster boxes survived. ''Summer Magic'' cards can sell for over $1000 for notable cards and some as high $5000. ''Summer Magic'' cards can best be recognized by their 1994 copyright date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Summer Magic Cards | work=Magic Rarities | url=http://www.magiclibrarities.net/rarities-summer.html | publisher=The Magic: The Gathering Library | accessdate=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|5ED-expansionsymbol|III}}: The only cards in ''[[Fifth Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Fifth Edition]]'' to have an expansion symbol were those printed in [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified Chinese]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Fifth Edition symbol | work=Magic Arcana | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/247 | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2002-12-12 | accessdate=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|size-8-9ED|IV}}: In addition to the 350 cards normally available in booster packs, the ''[[Eighth Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Eighth Edition]]'' Core Game contained 7 &quot;starter cards&quot; not available in booster packs, labeled with collector numbers S1 through S7. ''[[Ninth Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Ninth Edition]]'' contained 9, labeled S1 through S10 (omitting S6). These were meant to introduce new players to the game (most were &quot;vanilla&quot; creatures) but which were regarded as bad cards and disliked by experienced players.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=February 11, 2005 | work=Ask Wizards | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0205 | first=Mike | last=Turian | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2005-02-11 | accessdate=2007-08-11}})&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{note|ATQ-size|VI}}: 5 of the cards came in 4 alternate art versions making the set have 100 total cards but only 85 unique cards. The different art versions also differ in rarity causing these 5 cards to make up a total of 6 commons, 9 uncommons, and 6 rares.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatherer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Towers of Urza | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/1137 | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2006-09-08 | accessdate=2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{note|HomelandsColdsnap|IX}}: ''[[Homelands (Magic: The Gathering)|Homelands]]'' was not designed as part of the [[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|Ice Age]] Cycle and has no thematic or story-based link to the other sets in it. [[Wizards of the Coast]] retroactively declared it part of the Ice Age cycle in 1997 to fit with the then-emerging standard cycle structure. Nearly a decade later, in 2006, ''[[Coldsnap]]'', which complements ''Ice Age''âs storyline and design themes, was at last released to replace ''Homelands'' and complete the Ice Age Block. ''Homelands'' has reverted back to a standalone set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Coldsnap Q&amp;A | work=Feature Article | first=Randy | last=Buehler | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/291 | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2005-10-26 | accessdate=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{note|Coalition|XII}}: The Coalition was a group assembled by [[Urza]] to defend [[Dominaria]] against the [[invasion]] of the [[Phyrexia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Meaning of Invasion Expansion Symbol | work=News &amp; Rumors: Ahead of the Game | url=http://www.mtgnews.com/F/Topic/1078455446160_Meaning_of_Invasion_Expansion_Symbol.html | publisher=MTG News | date=2000-09-27 | accessdate=2007-04-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070505183356/http://www.mtgnews.com/F/Topic/1078455446160_Meaning_of_Invasion_Expansion_Symbol.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|morph|XIII}}: Many creatures in the [[Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering)|Onslaught]] Block had the ability to &quot;[[List of Magic: The Gathering keywords#Morph|morph]].&quot; Morphed creatures looked like &quot;clay spiders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=January 10, 2003 | work=Ask Wizards | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0103 | first=Brady | last=Dommermuth | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2003-01-10 | accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|size-CHK|XIV}}: This does not count the alternate art for the uncommon card {{mtgcard|Brothers Yamazaki}}. Counting each version separately, there are 89 uncommons and 307 cards in the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Champions of Kamigawa FAQ | url=http://boards1.wizards.com/archive/index.php/t-307584.html | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2004-09-15 | quote=Brothers Yamazaki &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;...&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; There are two versions of this card, each with different art.

:{{note|TSB|XV}}: In the Time Spiral Cycle there are special cards in each set that are &quot;timeshifted&quot;. In ''[[Time Spiral]]'' TSP refers to all non-timeshifted cards in the set while TSB, which stands for &quot;TimeShifted Bonus&quot; (during development, the timeshifted cards were known as &quot;bonus cards&quot;), refers to the 121 timeshifted reprint cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeshifted-Rosewater&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeshifted-Forsythe&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Piecing Together the Timeshifted Mosaic | work=Feature Article | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/364 | first=Aaron | last=Forsythe | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timeshifted reprint cards have a purple expansion symbol and are not counted towards the number of cards in the set. Instead they form a subset with their own collector's numbers. Each ''Time Spiral'' booster pack contains exactly one Timeshifted bonus card, replacing a common. In ''[[Planar Chaos]]'' there are 45 Timeshifted Cards (20 common, 15 uncommon, and 10 rare), however, unlike in Time Spiral they were not reprints but instead they were existing cards from the past which were &quot;colorshifted&quot; (known, iconic cards that were printed in a different color).&lt;ref name=&quot;gatherer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mmplc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Chaos Theory | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr261 | first=Mark | last=Rosewater | work=Making Magic | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2007-01-08 | accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorshifted cards are recognizable by the white text for the name and type line and different background designs from the normal cards. In contrast to the timeshifted cards in ''Time Spiral'' the colorshifted cards in ''Planar Chaos'' and ''[[Future Sight]]'' are not bonus cards, meaning that they come in rarities of common, uncommon, and rare, and are counted towards the Collector's numbers of the set.  However they are distributed differently than normal cards, with 3 of the commons in each booster being timeshifted, and one uncommon being replaced with a timeshifted uncommon 3/4 of the time and a timeshifted rare 1/4 of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmplc&quot; /&gt;  In ''Future Sight'' there are 81 timeshifted Cards, composing 27 of each rarity; these were simply included in packs like ordinary cards of their rarity.  However, unlike the previous sets these timeshifted cards have a future theme in that they have a different frame than normal cards and have keyword mechanics that may appear in future sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatherer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Future is Now, Part I | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mr274 | first=Mark | last=Rosewater | work=Making Magic | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2007-04-09 | accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|mythicrare|XVI}}: Starting in ''Shards of Alara'' Wizards of the Coast introduced a new rarity level higher than rare called Mythic Rare. A mythic rare card will appear in approximately 1 out of every 8 booster packs instead of a rare.&lt;ref name = &quot;Alarachanges&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Changes as of Shards of Alara| url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/20080602 | work=News | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2008-06-02 | accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|CHR|XVII}}: ''Chronicles'', released in 1995 between ''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|Ice Age]]'' and ''[[Homelands (Magic: The Gathering)|Homelands]]'', reprinted many previous cards, drawn from the ''[[Arabian Nights (Magic: The Gathering)|Arabian Nights]]'', ''[[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|Antiquities]]'', ''[[Legends (Magic: The Gathering)|Legends]]'', and ''[[The Dark (Magic: The Gathering)|The Dark]]'' sets, that were becoming difficult to obtain but added no new cards to the game. Despite being published between ''Ice Age'' and ''Homelands'', it is not considered part of the Ice Age Block; for purposes of tournament-legality, it was instead treated as an extension of ''[[4th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Fourth Edition]]''. The cards in ''Chronicles'' were reprinted with white borders, as opposed to their original black borders. Also Chronicles contained three uncommons with four alternate art versions meaning there are 125 total cards but only 116 unique cards and only 34 unique uncommons.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatherer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chronicles | url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/expert/Chronicles/Chronicles.asp | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|reprintexpansion|XVIII}}: Many of the early compilation sets did not have expansion symbols of their own and instead the cards within these reprint sets just retained the symbol from their former set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Anthologies | url=http://www.crystalkeep.com/magic/products/anthologies.php | publisher=Crystal Keep | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|Portal|XIX}}: ''[[Portal (Magic: The Gathering)|Portal]]'' was a series of sets featuring simplified rules intended to introduce novice players of Magic: The Gathering to the game. When they were originally released, they were not legal for [[Duelists' Convocation International|DCI]]-sanctioned tournament play, but the DCI changed its policy and the Portal sets became legal in the Vintage and Legacy tournament formats on October 20, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=March 2005 DCI Banned and Restricted List Announcement -- Magic: the Gathering | url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/announce/dci20050301a | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | accessdate=2006-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|POR-size|XX}}: 5 of the commons and 2 of the uncommons were alternate versions, so there are only 200 unique cards (85 unique common, 55 unique uncommons) in ''[[Portal (Magic: The Gathering)|Portal]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatherer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Portal Card List | url=http://www.crystalkeep.com/magic/lists/files/list-pt.txt | publisher=Crystal Keep | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|starter2000|XXI}}: ''[[Starter 2000]]'' was made up of two 22-card decks and two 15-card packs, all with a fixed selection of cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Starter | url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/starter/starter/welcome.asp | publisher=Wizards of the Coast | accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|astral|XXII}}: ''[[Astral (Magic: The Gathering)|Astral]]'' is a set of 12 cards that was never actually printed on paper and exists only in the [[Microprose]] ''[[Magic: The Gathering (MicroProse)|Magic: The Gathering]]'' [[computer game]] (with the exception of the oversized Aswan Jaguar included in the box). All 12 cards had abilities that depended on [[randomness]] and were therefore more practical to use on the computer than on paper.
:{{note|un-sets|XXIII}}: The ''Un-'' sets are [[satire|satirical]] sets which, though also published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], are not legal for [[Duelists' Convocation International|DCI]]-sanctioned tournament play.
:{{note|UNH-size|XXIV}}: ''[[Unhinged (Magic: The Gathering)|Unhinged]]'' contains 1 ultra-rare, called Super Secret Tech, which only exists as a foil rare card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Unhinged Ultra-Rare Cards | work=Magic Rarities | url=http://www.magiclibrarities.net/328-rarities-unhinged-ultra-rare-cards-english-cards-index.html | publisher=The Magic: The Gathering Library | accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|pt-atlanta|XXV}}: The first event that used ''[[Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)|Mirage]]'' product was [[Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour season 1996â97#Pro Tour â Atlanta (13â15 September 1996)|Pro Tour Atlanta]] on 13 September 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Mark | last = Rosewater | authorlink = Mark Rosewater | title = On Tour, Part 1 | publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]] | date = 26 July 2004 | accessdate = 2008-12-01 | url = http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|EVE|XXVI|}}: The Lorwyn and Shadowmoor blocks consist of two sets each. They were released over the course of one year and thus deviate from the usual three expansion sets per year policy. Eventide was the second set in the Shadowmoor block and was released in July.
:{{note|masters2-size|XXVII|}}: ''[[Masters Edition II]]'' has 5 snow-covered lands from ''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|Ice Age]]'' â it is unclear which rarity these count in.
:{{note|commander-new|XXVIII|}}: ''[[Commander_(Magic:_The_Gathering)|Commander]]'' actually contains 51 cards that have never seen print before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/146 | title=Zedruu the Greathearted | first=Mark | last=Globus | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2011-06-10 | accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{note|size-ISD|XXVIX|}}: Of the cards in ''[[Innistrad]]'', 6 commons, 7 uncommons, 6 rares, and 1 mythic are double-faced cards; though these appear in normal rarities, they are distributed differently, with one double-faced card always appearing per pack, replacing a common.
