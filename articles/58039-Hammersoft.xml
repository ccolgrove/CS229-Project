After exhibiting in small galleries in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]], the Stuckists' first show in a major public museum was held in 2004 at the [[Walker Art Gallery]], as part of the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. The group has demonstrated annually at [[Tate Britain]] against the [[Turner Prize]] since 2000, sometimes dressed in clown costumes. They have also come out in opposition to the [[Charles Saatchi]]-patronised [[Young British Artists]].

Although [[painting]] is the dominant artistic form of Stuckism, artists using other media such as [[photography]], [[sculpture]], [[film]] and [[collage]] have also joined, and share the Stuckist opposition to conceptualism and ego-art.&lt;ref name=robertjanas&gt;&quot;Stuckism International: The Stuckist Decade 1999 - 2009&quot;, [[Robert JanÃ¡s]], [http://www.victoriapress.co.uk/ Victoria Press], 2009, a: p.73 - b: p.64, ISBN 0-907165-28-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Stuckism&quot; was coined in January&amp;nbsp;1999 by Charles Thomson in response to a poem read to him several times by Billy Childish. In it, Childish recites that his former girlfriend, [[Tracey Emin]] had said he was &quot;stuck! stuck! stuck!&quot; with his art, poetry and music.&lt;ref name=milner7&gt;[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Thomson, Charles]] (August 2004), &quot;A Stuckist on Stuckism: Stella Vine&quot;, from: Ed.

There were eleven other founding members: [[Philip Absolon]], [[Frances Castle]], [[Sheila Clark]], [[Eamon Everall]], [[Ella Guru]], [[Wolf Howard]], [[Bill Lewis]], [[Sanchia Lewis]] (who joined during the first show in September and is unrelated to Bill Lewis), [[Joe Machine]], [[Sexton Ming]], and [[Charles Williams (artist)|Charles Williams]].&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;  The membership has evolved since its founding through creative collaborations:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/info.html &quot;Stuckism: Introduction&quot;], stuckism.com. Retrieved 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the group was originally promoted as painters, but members work in various other media, including poetry, fiction, performance, photography, film and music.&lt;ref name=milner7/&gt;

==Manifestos==
[[Image:2000 Real Turner Prize Show.jpg|thumb|left|The first Stuckists group of 13 artists at the ''Real Turner Prize Show'', Pure Gallery, Shoreditch, London, in October 2000]]

In August&amp;nbsp;1999, Childish and Thomson wrote ''The Stuckists'' [[manifesto]]&lt;ref name=stuckistmanifest/&gt; which places great importance on the value of painting as a medium, as well as its use for communication, the expression of emotion and of experience â as opposed to what Stuckists see as the superficial novelty, nihilism and irony of conceptual art and [[postmodernism]]. The most contentious statement in the manifesto is: &quot;Artists who don't paint aren't artists&quot;.

The second and third manifestos, respectively ''An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota'' and ''[[Remodernism]]'', were sent to [[Nicholas Serota]] which received a brief reply: &quot;Thank you for your open letter dated 6&amp;nbsp;March. You will not be surprised to learn that I have no comment to make on your letter, or your manifesto 'Remodernism'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/serotareply.html &quot;An open letter to Sir Nicholas Serota&quot;], stuckism.com, 1999. Retrieved 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Remodernism'' manifesto, the Stuckists declared that they aimed to replace postmodernism with remodernism, a period of renewed spiritual (as opposed to religious) values in art, culture and society. Other manifestos include ''Handy Hints'', ''[[Anti-anti-art]]'', ''The Cappuccino writer and the Idiocy of Contemporary Writing'', ''The Turner Prize'', ''The Decreptitude of the Critic'' and ''Stuckist critique of Damien Hirst''.

Manifestos have been written by other Stuckists, including the Students for Stuckism group. An &quot;Underage Stuckists&quot; group was founded in 2006 with their own manifesto for teenagers by two 16-year olds, Liv Soul and Rebekah Maybury, on MySpace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Manifestos/UnderageStuckists.html &quot;The Underage Stuckists Manifesto&quot;], stuckism.com.

In 2003, under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', the gallery exhibited a shark which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before [[Damien Hirst]]'s) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies.

==Responses==
In 1999, two performance artists, [[Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi]], jumped on Tracey Emin's installation ''My Bed'', a work consisting of the artist's own unmade bed, at the Tate Gallery's Turner Prize, in an unauthorised [[art intervention]]. Chai had written, among other things, the words &quot;Anti Stuckism&quot; on his bare back. Fiachra Gibbons of ''The Guardian'' wrote that the event &quot;will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=satirists&gt;Gibbons, Fiachra (1999)[http://www.guardian.co.uk/turner1999/Story/0,12119,201733,00.html &quot;Satirists Jump into Tracey's Bed&quot;]''The Guardian'' online, October 25, 1999.

The filmmaker [[Andrew Kotting]] released a manifesto declaring &quot;The work should prove anti-Stuckist, genuinely post-modern, contingent and ad hoc in its thinking.&quot; The London [[Surrealist]] group issued a manifesto denouncing Stuckism as well as Young British Artists, and stating Stuckism &quot;is a childish kicking against modernity that fails, pathetically, to challenge the underlying realities of capitalism, of the capitalist art market, of material, psychological, psychic and spiritual repression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonsurrealistgroup.wordpress.com/2006/04/12/coming-unstuck-tract-2-april-2004/ Coming Unstuck], London Surrealists Group's blog, 12 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
