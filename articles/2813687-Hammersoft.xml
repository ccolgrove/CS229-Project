'''XHDF''' is the callsign for the over the air [[Azteca 13]] network flagship station in Mexico City (Channel 13 analog and Channel 25 digital). Azteca 13 can be seen in most major cities in Mexico through its affiliates most of which are [[owned and operated]] by [[TV Azteca]]. XHDF provides [[HDTV|HD]] programming to affiliates and cable and satellite viewers. Azteca 13 can also be seen on [[DirecTV]]. Azteca 13 also provides the [[United States]] [[Azteca America]] network with programming which sometimes can be seen simultaneously.

==History==
XHDF started as an independent broadcaster in July 1968. In 1972 became a state-owned station. In 1983 passed to be one of three stations originally owned and operated by Imevision, the Mexican public broadcaster ([[XHIMT-TV]] and [[XEIMT-TV]] were the others). In [[1993]], it and XHIMT became part of the new commercial Grupo Salinas, when the Mexican government dissolved Imevision.

==Azteca 13 Internacional==
The network also operates an international version of XHDF, '''Azteca 13 Internacional''', reaching 13 countries in Central and South America. On July 15, 2004, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC in Canada]] denied a request for Azteca 13 Internacional to be broadcasted via digital cable and satellite.  However, a second subsequent request was approved on January 20, 2006. The channel is available in Canada on [[Rogers Cable|Rogers Digital Cable]] and [[VidÃ©otron]].
