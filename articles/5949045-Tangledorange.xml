On January 31, 2007 Hunter appeared on CNN's ''[[Paula Zahn]] Now'' in a piece on [[Atheism|atheists]] in America. During the open forum portion she made several controversial comments suggesting that &quot;If they [atheists] had Hallmark cards, maybe they wouldn't feel so left out. We have Christmas cards. We have [[Kwanzaa]] cards now. Maybe they need to get some atheist cards and get that whole ball rolling so more people can get involved with what they're doing. I think they need to shut up and let people do what they do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/31/pzn.01.html CNN transcript: Paula Zahn Now: Senator Joe Biden Under Fire Over Controversial Remarks; Has NFL Moved Beyond Racist Past?] January 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2011, on her Facebook page Hunter called for a boycott of the television show [[Celebrity Apprentice]] in reactions to comments Trump made about Barack Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackamericaweb.com/?q=articles/news/the_state_of_black_america_news/27520/2|title=Should Blacks Respond to Trump Birther Stance?|author=Sean Yoes|work=BlackAmericaWeb.com|date=April 13, 2011|accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She said in a later interview: &quot;So many of us were angered and outraged by Trumpâs comments and I wanted to let us know that we have power. We can do something besides grumble and complain.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediablvd.com/magazine/the_news/celebrity/publishing_magnate,_karen_hunter,_organizes_boycott_of_%93celebrity_apprentice%94_201105092498.html|title=Publishing Magnate, Karen Hunter, Organizes Boycott of âCelebrity Apprenticeâ|author=Frederic Germay|work=MediaBlvd Magazine|date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
