'''Cloud''' is a browser-based operating system created by Good OS LLC, a [[Los Angeles]]-based corporation.  The company initially launched a Linux distribution called [[gOS (operating system)|gOS]] which is  heavily based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], now in its third incarnation.

== Overview ==
Cloud is a simplified [[operating system]] that runs just a [[web browser]], providing access to a variety of web-based applications that allow the user to perform many simple tasks without booting a full-scale operating system. Because of its simplicity, Cloud can boot in just a few seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;register&quot;&gt;{{cite web|

Combining a browser with a basic operating system also allows the use of [[cloud computing]], in which applications and data &quot;live and run&quot; on the Internet instead of the hard drive. 

Cloud can be installed and used together with other operating systems, or act as a standalone operating system. When used as a standalone operating system, hardware requirements are relatively low.

In 2009, Cloud was only officially available built into the [[Gigabyte Technology|GIGABYTE]] [[Gigabyte M912|M912]] Touch Screen [[Netbook]].

Early reviews compared the operating system's user interface to [[Mac OS X]] and noted the similarity of its browser to [[Google Chrome]], although it is actually based on a modified [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;register&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
