==Biography==
===Early years===
Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and [[Nils Torvalds]],&lt;ref&gt;TORVALDS, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the grandson of poet [[Ole Torvalds]]. Both of his parents were campus radicals at the [[University of Helsinki]] in the 1960s.  His family belongs to the [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking minority]] (5.5%) of Finland's population. Torvalds was named after [[Linus Pauling]], the American [[Nobel Prize]]-winning chemist, although in the book ''Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution'', Torvalds is quoted as saying, &quot;I think I was named equally for [[Linus van Pelt|Linus]] the [[Peanuts]] cartoon character&quot;, noting that this makes him half &quot;Nobel-prize-winning chemist&quot; and half &quot;blanket-carrying cartoon character&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;moody&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moody|first=Glyn|title=Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution|publisher=Perseus Books Group|year=2002|page=336|url=http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/perseus/book_detail_redirect.do?imprintCid=BA&amp;isbn=0738206709|isbn=0738206709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torvalds attended the [[University of Helsinki]] between 1988 and 1996, graduating with a master's degree in [[computer science]] from NODES research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/nodes/ |title=NODES research group |publisher=Cs.helsinki.fi |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His academic career was interrupted after his first year of study when he joined the [[Finnish Army]], selecting the 11-month officer training program to fulfill the [[Conscription in Finland|mandatory military service]] of Finland. In the army he holds the rank of [[Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]], with the role of a ballistic calculation officer.&lt;ref&gt;Torvalds, 2001, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed to [[UNIX]] for the first time, in the form of a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[MicroVAX]] running [[ULTRIX]].&lt;ref&gt;Torvalds, 2001, page 53&lt;/ref&gt;  His M.Sc. thesis was titled ''[[Linux]]: A Portable Operating System''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/staff&lt;/ref&gt;

His interest in computers began with a [[Commodore VIC-20]].&lt;ref&gt;TORVALDS, 2001, pages 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; After the VIC-20 he purchased a [[Sinclair QL]], which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. He programmed an [[assembly language]] and a [[text editor]] for the QL, as well as a few games.&lt;ref&gt;TORVALDS, 2001, pages 41-46&lt;/ref&gt; He is known to have written a ''[[Pac-Man]]'' clone named ''Cool Man''. On January 5, 1991&lt;ref name=&quot;first_interview&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.se/~m9339/linux/linuxdoc/linuxnews03a.html |title=L i n u x N e w s |publisher=Abc.se |date=1991-01-05 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; he purchased an [[Intel 80386]]-based [[IBM PC]]&lt;ref&gt;Torvalds, 2001, page 60&lt;/ref&gt; and spent a month playing the game ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' before receiving his [[MINIX]] copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.&lt;ref name=&quot;moody&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title= What would you like to see most in minix? |author=Linus Benedict Torvalds |date=25 August 91 20:57:08 GMT |newsgroup= comp.os.minix |id= 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI |url= http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b?dmode=source  |accessdate={{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}} | quote=I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
After a visit to [[Transmeta]] in late 1996,&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxonlinebio&quot; /&gt; Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he would work from February 1997 to June 2003. He then moved to the [[Open Source Development Labs]], which has since merged with the [[Free Standards Group]] to become the [[Linux Foundation]], under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], to be closer to the OSDL's [[Beaverton, Oregon]]âbased headquarters.

From 1997 to 1999, he was involved in [[Executable and Linkable Format#86open|86open]] helping to choose the standard binary format for Linux and [[Unix]]. In 1999, he was named to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[Technology Review]] [[TR35|TR100]] as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?TRID=495 |title=1999 Young Innovators Under 35: Linus Torvalds, 29 |publisher=[[Technology Review]] | year=1999 | accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Red Hat]] and [[VA Linux]], both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with [[stock option]]s in gratitude for his creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

|work=60 Years of Heros|publisher=TIME|author=Gumbel, Peter|accessdate=2008-06-14 | date=2006-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, both companies [[initial public offering|went public]] and Torvalds' share value temporarily shot up to roughly $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.11/linus_pr.html|title=Leader of the Free World|author=Rivlin, Gary|accessdate=2008-06-14|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;unauthbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/linus.html|title=Linus Torvalds: A Very Brief and Completely Unauthorized Biography|work=The Linux Information Project|publisher=Bellevue Linux Users Group|date=24 January 2006|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His personal mascot is a [[penguin]] nicknamed [[Tux]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9605/0855.html Re: Linux Logo prototype.], a Thu, 9 May 1996 message from Linus Torvalds (torvalds@cs.helsinki.fi)&lt;/ref&gt; which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the mascot of the Linux kernel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.org/info/penguin.html Why a Penguin?]  from Linux Online&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Torvalds believes &quot;[[open source]] is the only right way to do software&quot;, he also has said that he uses the &quot;best tool for the job&quot;, even if that includes [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8 Linus Torvalds at Google, on Git], 9:50-10:00&lt;/ref&gt; He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary [[BitKeeper]] software for version control in the Linux kernel. However, Torvalds subsequently wrote a free-software replacement for BitKeeper called [[Git (software)|Git]]. Torvalds has commented on official [[GNOME]] developmental mailing lists that, in terms of [[desktop environment]]s, he encourages users to switch to [[KDE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html |title=Printing dialog and GNOME |publisher=Mail.gnome.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8745257437.html |title=Linus versus GNOME |publisher=Desktoplinux.com |date=2007-02-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Torvalds thought [[KDE4|KDE 4.0]] was a &quot;disaster&quot; because of its lack of maturity, so he switched to [[GNOME]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;it was a half-baked release (...) I'll revisit it when I reinstall the next machine&quot;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=Software&amp;articleId=9126619&amp;taxonomyId=18&amp;pageNumber=5 Q&amp;A: Linux founder Linus Torvalds talks about open-source identity]&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the loss of productivity,
he switched to [[XFCE]] after the GNOME3 release, with another harsh post against [[GNOME]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/106327083461132854143/posts/SbnL3KaVRtM |title=Linus and GNOME3 |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Linus/Linux connection==
{{Main|History of Linux}}
Initially Torvalds wanted to call the kernel he developed ''Freax'' (a combination of &quot;free&quot;, &quot;freak&quot;, and the letter X to indicate that it is a Unix-like system), but his friend [[Ari Lemmke]], who administered the [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] [[server (computing)|server]] where the kernel was first hosted for downloading, named Torvalds' directory ''linux''.

==Authority and trademark==
As of 2006, approximately two percent of the Linux kernel was written by Torvalds himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;unauthbio&quot;/&gt; As thousands have contributed code to the Linux kernel, such a percentage represents one of the largest personal contributions to the overall amount of code. Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Open Life&quot;&gt;Henrik Ingo. Open Life: The Philosophy of Open Source. Ingram, 2005. 42-45. [http://openlife.cc/files/OpenLife-aa.pdf Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

Torvalds owns the &quot;Linux&quot; [[trademark]], and monitors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/linux/00/01/19/0828245.shtml |title=Linus Explains Linux Trademark Issues |publisher=Slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of it chiefly through the [[Linux Mark Institute]].

==Personal life==
Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds ([[nÃ©e]] Monni)&amp;nbsp;â a six-time Finnish national [[karate]] champion&amp;nbsp;â whom he first met in the autumn of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;TORVALDS, 2001, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this page/book confirms the date, her name, and the karate champ info --&gt; Torvalds was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendants to send him an [[e-mail]] as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.&lt;ref name=&quot;moody&quot; /&gt; Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, Patricia Miranda (*5.12.1996), Daniela Yolanda (*16.4.1998), and Celeste Amanda (*20.11.2000),&lt;ref name=&quot;nndbbio&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/444/000022378/ |title=Torvalds' bio on |publisher=Nndb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; two of whom were born in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;oreg100914&quot;/&gt; Linux kernel's ''reboot'' system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.&lt;ref name=&quot;reboot2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://man.flashnux.com/en/debian/6/6.0.1/man2/reboot.2.html |title=Debian's reboot(2) man page |accessdate=2011-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torvalds describes himself as &quot;completely [[irreligion|a-religious]] â [[atheist]]&quot;, adding that &quot;I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place.'&quot; He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in America it has become very politicized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Interview: Linus Torvalds | first=Marjorie | last=Richardson | work=[[Linux Journal]] | url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3655 | date=November 1, 1999 | accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the issue of [[separation of church and state|church and state separation]], Linus also said, &quot;Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Interview: Linus Torvalds | first=Marjorie | last=Richardson | work=[[Linux Journal]] | url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3655 | date=November 1, 1999 | accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Torvalds became a United States citizen and [[Voter registration#United States|registered to vote in the United States]]; he is unaffiliated with any U.S. political party, saying, &quot;I have way too much personal pride to want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oreg100914&quot;/&gt;

==Recognition==
;Academics
In 1997, Torvalds received his Master degree (Laudatur Grade) from Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki.  Two years later he received honorary doctor status at [[Stockholm University]], and in 2000 he received the same honor from his ''alma mater''.&lt;ref&gt;Torvalds, 2001, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Torvalds received the [[Howard Vollum|Vollum Award]] from [[Reed College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.reed.edu/news_center/press_releases/2005-2006/082205LinuxCreator.html |title=Linux creator Linus Torvalds honored with Reed College's Vollum Award |publisher=Web.reed.edu |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Industry
In 1998 Torvalds received an [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] [[EFF Pioneer Award|Pioneer Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/awards/pioneer/1998.php |title=Torvalds, Stallman, Simons Win 1998 Pioneer Awards |publisher=W2.eff.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 he was awarded the [[Lovelace Medal]] from the [[British Computer Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.14769 Talking to Torvalds], [[British Computer Society]], September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, he shared the [[Takeda Award]] for Social/Economic Well-Being with [[Richard Stallman]] and [[Ken Sakamura]].  In 2008, he was inducted into the Hall of Fellows of the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release| url=http://www.computerhistory.org/press/2008-Fellows-Award-Announcement.html | title=The Computer History Museum Announces the 2008 Fellow Awards Recipients | publisher=[[Computer History Museum]] | date=18 June 2008 | accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|  url=http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Linus,Torvalds/ | title=Fellow Awards: Linus Torvalds | work=[[Computer History Museum]] | date=21 October 2008 | accessdate=22 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[C&amp;C Prize]] by the [[NEC Corporation]] in 2010 for &quot;contributions to the advancement of the information technology industry, education, research, and the improvement of our lives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linus-Torvalds-awarded-2010-C-C-Prize-1122542.html|title=Linus Torvalds awarded 2010 C&amp;C Prize|author=Chris von Eitzen|work=The H|publisher=[[Heinz Heise]]|date=21 October 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Media
[[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] has recognized Torvalds multiple times:
*In 2000, he was 17th in their [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]] Poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/century.html | work=Time | title=The 2010 Time 100 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2004, he was named one of the most influential people in the world &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994026,00.html | title= Linus Torvalds: The Free-Software Champion | author= [[Lawrence Lessig]] | date= April 26, 2004 | publisher= [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]| accessdate= October 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''InfoWorld'' presented him with the 2000 Award for Industry Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Petreley. ''This year's Award for Industry Achievement goes to the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds''. [[InfoWorld]]. Jan 17, 2000. Page 82.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 Torvalds appeared as one of &quot;the best managers&quot; in a survey by ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/toc/05_02/B39150502manager.htm |title=The Best &amp; Worst Managers Of The Year |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2005-01-10 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, ''[[Business 2.0]]'' magazine named him one of &quot;10 people who don't matter&quot; because the growth of Linux has shrunk Torvalds' individual impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=By Business 2.0 Magazine staff |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/21/technology/10dontmatter.biz2/index.htm |title=10 people who don't matter |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2004, viewers of [[YLE]] (the Finnish Broadcasting Company) placed Torvalds 16th in the network's [[Suuret Suomalaiset|100 Greatest Finns]].  In 2010, as part of a series called ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.|The Britannica Guide]] to the World's Most Influential People'', Torvalds was listed among ''The 100 Most Influential Inventors of All Time'' (ISBN 9781615300037).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Linus Torvalds named one of the 100 most influential inventors | work=[[The H]] | url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Linus-Torvalds-named-one-of-the-100-most-influential-inventors-922622.html | date=4 February 2010 | accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Space
In 1996, an asteroid ([[9793 Torvalds]]) was named after him.

;Literature
The 1999 novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]] features several characters who use &quot;Finux&quot;, a Unix-like operating system developed in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| first=Neal | last=Stephenson | authorlink=Neal Stephenson | url=http://web.mac.com/nealstephenson/Neal_Stephensons_Site/Old_site.html | title=Old site | year=1999 | accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
