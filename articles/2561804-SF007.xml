The '''Frontalis [[muscle]]''' , also known as the [[occipitofrontalis]] or [[epicranius]], is thin, of a quadrilateral form, and intimately adherent to the [[superficial fascia]]. It is broader than the [[Occipitalis]] and its fibers are longer and paler in color. It is located on the front of the head. 

It has no bony attachments. 

Its medial fibers are continuous with those of the [[Procerus]]; its immediate fibers blend with the [[Corrugator supercilii muscle|Corrugator]] and [[Orbicularis oculi]], thus attached to the skin of the eyebrows; and its lateral fibers are also blended with the latter muscle over the [[zygomatic]] process of the [[frontal bone]].

In the eyebrows, its primary function is to lift them (thus opposing the orbital portion of the orbicularis), especially when looking up. It also acts when a view is too distant or dim.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2008. [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From these attachments the fibers are directed upward, and join the [[galea aponeurotica]] below the [[coronal suture]]. 

The medial margins of the Frontales are joined together for some distance above the root of the [[Human nose|nose]]; but between the Occipitales there is a considerable, though variable, interval, occupied by the [[galea aponeurotica]].

It could be part of [[occipitofrontalis muscle]].
