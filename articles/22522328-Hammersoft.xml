Maurice &quot;Moe&quot; Strauss was one of the four founders of the Delaware Valley-based automotive parts retailer [[Pep Boys]] â Manny, Moe &amp; Jack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pepboys.com/about_pep_boys/inside_pep_boys/the_pep_boys_story/&lt;/ref&gt;  After mustering out of the Navy in 1921 he and three friends from World War I, Emanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Rosenfeld, Graham &quot;Jack&quot; Jackson and Moe Radavitz, chipped in $200 each to open a single auto parts supply store on 63rd and Market Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

He reportedly came up with the name of the company and commissioned the Manny, Moe &amp; Jack caricatures that serve as the PepBoys logo after visiting a dress shop called: Minnie, Maude and Mabel's during a 1923 trip to California.

Strauss served as president of the company after Rosenfeld's death from 1960 to 1973 and was a member of its board of directors until his death in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/The-Pep-BoysManny-Moe-amp;-Jack-Company-History.html&lt;/ref&gt;
