He served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] from 1997 to 2001.

==Early life, family and education==
Born in [[Tarboro, North Carolina]], Shelton was raised just outside the small town of [[Speed, North Carolina]]. [[North Carolina Highway System|North Carolina Highway 122]], which runs through Speed to Hobgood, North Carolina (right past the homestead he was raised on), was later named &quot;General Henry Hugh Shelton Hwy&quot; in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/collateral/articles/s05.who.did.that.sign.say.pdf &quot;Who Did That Sign Say?&quot; p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; Shelton attended [[North Carolina State University]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and was a member of [[Pershing Rifles]]. He earned a degree in [[Textile manufacturing|textile engineering]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; while earning his Army commission through [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] training. Shelton's further education includes a master's degree in political science from [[Auburn University at Montgomery]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; in 1973 as well as studies at the [[Air Command and Staff College]] and the [[National War College]].&lt;ref name=nytimes97&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/17/us/man-in-the-news-henry-hugh-shelton-general-who-sets-pace.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Man in the News: Henry Hugh Shelton; General Who Sets Pace|first=David|last=Stout|newspaper=[[NY Times]]|date=1997-09-17|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelton married Carolyn L.

==Military service==
Shelton served two tours of duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; with the [[5th Special Forces Group]], and with the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]],&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; followed by a series of command and staff assignments. Following the [[Gulf War]], Shelton commanded the [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd Airborne Division]] at [[Fort Bragg]] in his home state of [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; In 1993, he was given command of [[U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps|XVIII Airborne Corps]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Shelton led the Joint Task Force responsible for [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] in [[Haiti]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; In 1996, Shelton, a [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces soldier]], was promoted to the rank of [[General officer|General]] and the position of Commander in Chief of [[United States Special Operations Command]] (SOCOM).

Upon the retirement of [[John M.

Later during his time in that office he coined the phrase &quot;[[Dover test]]&quot;, testing the support for a war based on the reaction of the people after seeing American casualties returning at the [[Dover Air Force Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-11-03/politics/column.shields.opinion.dover_1_dover-test-iraq-today-s-bush?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS|title=Time to take the Dover test|date=2003-11-03|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], Shelton was on a plane to NATO meeting in Europe, but turned back and returned to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|transcripturl=http://www.patriotresource.com/wtc/federal/1001/shelton.html|title=[[Larry King Live]]|Station=CNN|airdate=2001-10-01|accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Shelton's end of term, Bush nominated then-Vice Chairman Air Force General [[Richard Myers]] who was sworn in and on October 1, 2001.

[â¦] I'll just say Wes won't get my vote,&quot; casting doubt upon the presidential contender's legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.losaltosonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12066&amp;Itemid=47 |title=Los Altos Town Crier - Gen.

On March 1, 2008, General Shelton announced his endorsement of Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Presidential Primary]], stating, &quot;Iâve been with Senator Clinton when she has been with our military men and women. I know from those experiences that she understands the demands and sacrifice of military life. I am confident she will always put the readiness and well being of our troops first. She is ready to be Commander-in-Chief.&quot; General Shelton was the second Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to endorse Senator Clinton, the first being General [[John Shalikashvili]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=6280&lt;/ref&gt;
