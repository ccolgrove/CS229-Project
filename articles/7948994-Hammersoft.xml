{{Main|Iranian sex tape scandal}}
In 2006, Ebrahimi became the centre of an Iranian sex tape scandal when a videotape of a woman, claimed to be Ebrahimi, having sex with a man was leaked to the internet and released on CD. She subsequently became the subject of an official investigation handled by [[Tehran]]'s chief prosecutor, [[Saeed Mortazavi]].  The unnamed man on the tape, who is suspected of releasing it, reportedly fled to [[Armenia]] but was subsequently returned to Iran and charged with breach of public morality laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title= Iranian actor in sex video scandal says ex-fiance faked footage |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/iran/story/0,,1954553,00.html |publisher= The Guardian | first= Robert |last=Talt |date= November 22, 2006 |accessdate= 2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the Guardian, Ebrahimi denied being the woman in the film and dismissed it as a fake made by a vengeful former fiancÃ© who used studio techniques to form a montage of incriminating images designed to destroy her career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt;

Rumours of an attempted suicide were also denied by Ebrahimi with a public message: ''&quot;I just want to tell my country's people that I am alive. I am thinking about the strength of Iranian women and will defend the respect of the girls and women of my nation.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Sex footage leaves actress fighting to save honour |url= http://news.scotsman.com/movies.cfm?id=1663762006 |publisher= The Scotsman | first= Michael |last=Theodoulou |date= November 10, 2006 |accessdate= 2006-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
