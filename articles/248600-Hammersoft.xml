'''Social Democrats, USA''' ('''SDUSA''') was the  principal association of [[American left|U.S.]] [[social democracy|social democrats]] from 1972â2005. 

SDUSA was founded in 1972 when the [[Socialist Party of America]] renamed itself Social Democrats,&amp;nbsp;USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;

The New York Times reported on the Convention for three other days:

When the Socialist Party changed its name to Social Democrats,&amp;nbsp;USA, the civil-rights leader [[Bayard Rustin]] became its public spokesman. According to Rustin, SDUSA aimed to transform the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] into a social-democratic party.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT74&quot;/&gt; Harrington left SDUSA to found the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] in 1973. 

SDUSA's organizational activities included sponsoring discussions and issuing position papers; it was known mainly because of its members' activities in other organizations. SDUSA included  [[African American Civil Rights Movement|civil-rights activists]] and leaders of [[American labor movement|labor unions]], such as  Bayard Rustin, [[Norman Hill]], and [[Tom Kahn]] of the [[AFLâCIO]], and [[Sandra Feldman]] and [[Rachelle Horowitz]] of the [[American Federation of Teachers]]. SDUSA members helped to support free [[trade union|labor-union]]s; in particular, Tom Kahn organized the [[AFLâCIO]]'s support of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Poland's Solidarity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis32&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penn Kemble]] and [[Carl Gershman]] cooperated with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] administrations on [[democracy promotion]]. Other members included the &lt;!-- [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] --&gt; philosopher [[Sidney Hook]]. 

SDUSA ceased operations in 2005, following the death of Penn Kemble. In 2008â2009 two small organizations emerged, each proclaiming  itself to be the successor to SDUSA.

In its 1972 Convention, the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] had two Co-Chairmen, [[Bayard Rustin]] and [[Charles&amp;nbsp;S. Zimmerman]] (of the [[International Ladies Garment&amp;nbsp;Workers' Union]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorin149&quot;&gt;Gerald Sorin, ''The Prophetic Minority: American Jewish Immigrant Radicals, 1880-1920.''

Glaser, who were re-elected by [[acclamation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt; In his opening speech to the Convention, Co-Chairman Bayard Rustin called for SDUSA to organize against the  &quot;reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration&quot;; Rustin also criticized the &quot;irresponsibility and Ã©litism of the 'New Politics' liberals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt;

The Party changed its name to &quot;Social Democrats,&amp;nbsp;USA&quot; by a vote of 73 to&amp;nbsp;34.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported on the 1972 Convention on other days, e.g.,

&lt;/ref&gt; Changing the name of the Socialist Party to &quot;Social Democrats USA&quot; was intended to be &quot;realistic&quot;: the intention was to respond to the end of the running of actual Socialist Party candidates for office, to respond to the confusions of Americans. ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed that the Socialist Party had last sponsored a [[Darlington Hoopes|candidate for President]] in [[Presidential Election Of 1956|1956]], who received only 2,121 votes, which were cast in only 6 states. Because the Socialist Party no longer sponsored party candidates in elections, continued use of the name &quot;Party&quot; was &quot;misleading&quot; and hindered the recruiting of activists who participated in the Democratic Party, according to the majority report. The name &quot;Socialist&quot; was replaced by &quot;[[social democracy|Social Democrats]]&quot; because many American associated the word &quot;[[democratic socialism|socialism]]&quot; with [[Soviet communism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt; Moreover, the organization sought to distinguish itself from two small Marxist parties, the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of America|Socialist Labor Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT27&quot;&gt;{{cite article|title=Young Socialists open parley; to weigh 'New&amp;nbsp;Politics' split|newspaper=New York Times|year=1972|month=27 December|ref=harv|page=25|author=Anonymous|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70B10FF3B5C177B93C5AB1789D95F468785F9&amp;scp=7&amp;sq=Young+socialists&amp;st=p|url2=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/721227-sdusa-news.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1972 convention, the majority (&quot;Unity Caucus&quot;) won every vote, by a ratio of two to one. The Convention elected a national committee of 33 members, with 22 seats for the majority caucus, 8 seats for the &quot;Coalition Caucus&quot; of [[Michael Harrington]], 2 for the left-wing &quot;Debs Caucus&quot;, and one for the &quot;independent&quot; [[Samuel H. Friedman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT73&quot;&gt;{{cite article|title='Firmness' urged on &lt;!-- CAPITALIZED! --&gt;Communists: Social&amp;nbsp;Democrats reach end of U.S.&amp;nbsp;Convention here|newspaper=New&amp;nbsp;York Times|year=1973|month=1 January|page=11|author=Anonymous|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C15F73F551A7493C3A9178AD85F478785F9|url2=http://www.marxisthistory.org/personal/730101-sdusa-news.pdf|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman and the minority caucuses had opposed the name change.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt;

The convention voted on and adopted proposals for its program by a two-one vote. On foreign policy, the program called for &quot;firmness toward Communist aggression&quot;. However, on the Vietnam War, the program opposed &quot;any efforts to bomb Hanoi into submission&quot;; instead, it endorsed negotiating a peace agreement, which should protect Communist political cadres in South Vietnam from further military or police reprisals. Harrington's proposal for a [[ceasefire]] and [[immediate withdrawal]] of U.S. forces was defeated.&lt;!--  A Vice Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), [[Carl Gershman]] introduced the international program that was approved. --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT73&quot;/&gt; Harrington complained that, after its convention, the Socialist Party had endorsed [[George McGovern]] only with a  statement loaded with &quot;constructive criticism&quot; and that it had not mobilized enough support for McGovern. The majority caucus's [[Arch Puddington]] replied that the California branch was especially active in supporting McGovern, while the New York branch were focusing on a congressional race.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT27 &quot;/&gt;

Even before the convention, Michael Harrington had resigned as an Honorary Chairperson of the Socialist Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt; Some months after the convention, he resigned his membership in SDUSA. Harrington and his supporters from the Coalition Caucus soon formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC). Many members of the Debs caucus resigned from SDUSA and formed the [[Socialist Party USA]].

In domestic politics, the SDUSA leadership emphasized the role of the [[American labor movement]] in advancing [[civil rights]] and [[economic justice]]. The domestic program followed the recommendations of Rustin's article &quot;From Protest to Politics&quot;. In it, Rustin analyzed the changing economy and its implications for American Negroes. Rustin wrote that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban Negro working-class, particularly in the northern US. The needs of the Negro community demanded a shift in political strategy, where Negroes would need to strengthen their political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. It was time to move from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.&lt;ref name=&quot;RustinFPTP&quot;/&gt; A particular danger facing the Negro community was the chimera of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of &quot;[[Black power]]&quot; which Rustin dismissed as a fantasy of middle-class Negroes that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]], while alienating the white allies needed by the Negro community.&lt;ref name=&quot;RustinSeparatism&quot;/&gt;

SDUSA documents had similar criticisms of the agendas advanced by middle-class activists increasing their role in the Democratic Party. SDUSA members stated concerns about an exaggerated  role of &quot;middle-class&quot; [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|peace activist]]s in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], particularly associated with the &quot;[[New Politics]]&quot; of Senator [[George McGovern]], whose [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|Presidential candidacy]] was viewed as a ongoing disaster for the Democratic Party and for the USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt; In electoral politics, SDUSA aimed to transform the Democratic Party into a social democratic party.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT74&quot;/&gt;

In foreign policy, most of the founding SDUSA leadership called for an immediate cessation of the [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing]] of [[North Vietnam]]. They demanded a negotiated peace treaty to end the Vietnam War. However, the majority opposed a unilateral withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam, suggesting that such a withdrawal would lead to an annihilation of the free labor-unions and of the political opposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These positions had been advanced by organizations like  &quot;[[Penn Kemble#Negotiations Now!|Negotiations Now!]]&quot; since the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gershman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gershman|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Gershman|title=Totalitarian menace (Controversies: Detente and the left after Afghanistan)|journal=Society|year=1980|month=3 November|publisher=Transactions (purchased by Springer)|location=New York|issn=0147-2011|pages=9â15|volume=18|issue=1|doi=10.1007/BF02694835}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam and the victory of the Vietnamese Communists, SDUSA supported humanitarian assistance to refugees and condemned Senator [[George McGovern|McGovern]] for his failure to support such assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The View from Washington|journal=Asian Affairs|volume=6|number=2|month=NovemberâDecember|year=1978|pages=134â135|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|jstor=30171704|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Carl|last=Gershman|url=http://www.archive.org/details/AfterTheDominoesFell|title=After the dominoes fell|journal=Commentary (May 1978)|location=New York|publisher=Social Democrats, USA|year=1978|series=SD papers|volume=3|ref=harv|authorlink=Carl Gershman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational activities==

SDUSA was governed by biannual conventions which invited the participation of interested observers. These gatherings featured discussions and debates over proposed resolutions, some of which were adopted as organizational statements. The group frequently made use of outside speakers at these events: Non-SDUSA intellectuals ranged from [[neoconservative]]s like [[Jeanne Kirkpatrick]] on the right to [[democratic socialist]]s like [[Paul Berman]] on the left; similarly, a range of academic, political, and labor-union leaders were invited.  These meetings also functioned as reunions for political activists and intellectuals, some of whom worked together for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Harold|last=Meyerson|authorlink=Harold Meyerson|issue=Fall|year=2002|volume=49|number=4|title=Solidarity, Whatever|url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=552|journal=Dissent|page=16|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDUSA also published a newsletter and occasional position papers. 

SDUSA issued statements supporting labor unions and workers' interests at home and overseas. It supported the existence of [[Israel]] and the Israeli labor movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Challenge&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.archive.org/details/TheAmericanChallengeASocial-democraticProgramForTheSeventies|title=The American challenge: A social-democratic program for the seventies|location=New York|publisher=SDUSA|year=1973|author=Social Democrats, USA|&lt;!-- authorlink=Social Democrats, USA --&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opposed many of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|G.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Bush administration{{'s}}]] domestic policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;muravchik&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Muravchik|2006}}:&lt;p&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joshua|last=Muravchik|authorlink=Joshua Muravchik|url=http://www.aei.org/article/23700|title=Comrades|journal=[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/comrades/ Commentary Magazine]|date=January 2006|accessdate=15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; From&amp;nbsp;1979â1989, SDUSA members were active providing support of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|''Solidarnosc'' (Solidarity), the independent labor-union of Poland]].

The organization also attempted to exert influence through endorsements of Presidential candidates. The group's 1976 National Convention, held in New York City, formally endorsed the Democratic ticket of [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Walter Mondale]] and pledged the group to &quot;work enthusiastically&quot; for the election of the pair in November.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Freedom, Economic Justice Themes of SD Convention,&quot; ''New America'' [New York], vol. 13, no. 15 (Aug.-Sept. 1976), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization took a less assertive approach during the divisive 1980 campaign, marked as it was by a heated primary challenge to President Carter by Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]; SDUSA chose not to hold its biannual convention until after the termination of the fall campaign. The election of conservative [[Ronald Reagan]] was chalked up to the failure of the Democrats to &quot;appeal to their traditional working class constituency.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Social Democracy Faces Crucial Era,&quot; ''New America'' [New York], vol 17, no. 11 (December 1980), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 1980 long-time National Director [[Carl Gershman]] resigned his position, to be replaced by [[Rita Freedman]].&lt;ref name=NewDir&gt;&quot;Rita Freedman New SD Director,&quot; ''New America'' [New York], vol. 17, no. 2 (Feb. 1980), pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman previously had served as organizer and chair of SDUSA's key New York local.&lt;ref name=NewDir /&gt;

Dues in Social Democrats, USA were paid annually in advance, with members receiving a copy of the organization's official organ, the tabloid-sized newspaper ''[[New America (newspaper)|New America]].'' The dues rate was $25 per year in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wanted: Dues Cheaters&quot; (ad), ''New America'' [New York], vol. 20, no. 5 (Sept.-Oct. 1983), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member activities==
Small organizations associated with the DebsâThomas Socialist Party have served as schools for the leadership of social-movement organizations, including the civil-rights movement and the sixties radicalism. These organizations are now chiefly remembered because of their members' leadership of large organizations that directly influenced USA and international politics.&lt;ref&gt;Aldon Morris, ''The Origins of the Civil Rights Movement: Black Communities Organizing for Change'' (New York: The Free Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After 1960 the Party also functioned &quot;as an educational organization&quot; and &quot;a caucus of policy advocates on the on the left wing of the Democratic Party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hamby|2003|p=25|loc=footnote 5}}: {{cite journal|first=Alonzo L.|last=Hamby|year=2003|title=Is there no democratic left in America? Reflections on the transformation of an ideology|doi=10.1017/S0898030600000695|journal=Journal of Policy History|volume=15|pages=3â25|doi=10.1353/jph.2003.0003|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, SDUSA was known mainly because of the activities of its members, many of whom publicly identified themselves as members of SDUSA. Members of SDUSA have served as officers for governmental, private, and not-for-profit organizations. [[A.&amp;nbsp;Philip Randolph]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and [[Norman Hill]] were leaders of the [[African American civil rights movement]]. [[Tom Kahn]], [[Sandra Feldman]], and Rachelle Horowitz were officers of labor unions. Carl Gershman and [[Penn Kemble]] served in governmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly in foreign policy. Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] was a [[public intellectual]]. 

Writing after the death of [[Tom Kahn]], [[Ben Wattenberg]] commented that SDUSA members seemed to be
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
&quot;ingeniously trying to bury the Soviet Union in a blizzard of letterheads. It seemed that each of Tom's colleaguesâPenn Kemble, Carl Gershman, Josh Muravchik and many moreâran a little organization, each with the same interlocking directorate listed on the stationery. Funny thing: The Letterhead Lieutenants did indeed churn up a blizzard, and the Soviet Union is no more.&lt;p&gt;
I never did quite get all the organizational acronyms straightâYPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISLâbut the key words were &quot;democratic&quot;, &quot;labor&quot;, &quot;young&quot; and, until events redefined it away from their understanding, &quot;socialist&quot;. Ultimately, the umbrella group became &quot;Social Democrats, U.S.A&quot;, and Tom Kahn was a principal &quot;theoretician&quot;.&lt;p&gt;

They talked and wrote endlessly, mostly about communism and democracy, despising the former, adoring the latter. It is easy today to say &quot;anti-communist&quot; and &quot;pro-democracy&quot; in the same breath. But that is because American foreign policy eventually became just such a mixture, thanks in part to those &quot;Yipsels&quot; (Young People's Socialist League), with Tom Kahn as provocateur-at-large.&lt;p&gt;

On the conservative side, foreign policy used to be ''anti-communist,'' but not very ''pro-democracy.'' And foreign policy liberal-style might be piously ''pro-democracy,'' but nervous about being ''anti-communist.'' Tom theorized that to be either, you had to be both.&lt;p&gt;

It was tough for labor-liberal intellectuals to be &quot;anti-communist&quot; in the 1970s. It meant being taunted as &quot;Cold Warriors&quot; who saw &quot;Commies under every bed&quot; and being labeled asâthe unkindest cutâ&quot;right-wingers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wattenberg&quot; &gt;{{cite article|month=22 April|year=1992|first=Ben|last=Wattenberg|authorlink=Ben Wattenberg|title=A man whose ideas helped change the world|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=19 November 2011|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-04-22/news/1992113044_1_tom-kahn-foreign-policy-anti-communist|format=html|ref=harv|id=Syndicated: (Thursday 23 April 1993).  &quot;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110504812  Remembering a man who mattered]&quot;.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;


====Service in Democratic and Republican administrations====
SDUSA members have served in government since the 1970s, and the service of some members in Republican administrations has been associated with controversy. SDUSA members like Gershman were called &quot;State Department socialists&quot; by {{harvtxt|Massing|1987}}, who wrote that the [[foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration|foreign policy of the Reagan administration]] was being run by [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], a claim that was called a &quot;myth&quot; by {{harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lip34&quot;&gt;
&quot;A 1987 article in ''The New Republic'' described these developments as a Trotskyist takeover of the Reagan administration&quot; wrote {{harvtxt|Lipset|1988|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Trotskyist&quot; charge has been repeated and even widened by journalist [[Michael Lind]] in 2003 to assert a takeover of the [[foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration]] by former Trotskyists;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The weird men behind George&amp;nbsp;W.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Muravchik|2006|&lt;!-- p= ONLINE --&gt;}}. Addressing the allegation that SDUSUA was a &quot;Trotskyist&quot; organization, Muravchik wrote that in the early 1960s, two future members of SDUSA, [[Tom Kahn]] and [[Paul Feldman]]  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;became devotees  of a former Trotskyist named Max Shachtmanâa fact that today has taken on a life of its own. Tracing forward in lineage through me and a few other ex-YPSLâs [members of the [[Young Peoples Socialist League]]] turned neoconservatives, this happenstance has fueled the accusation that neoconservatism itself, and through it the foreign policy of the Bush administration, are somehow rooted in 'Trotskyism.'
&lt;p&gt;
I am more inclined to laugh than to cry over this, but since the myth has traveled so far, let me briefly try once more, as I have done at greater length in the past, to set the record straight.[See &quot;The Neoconservative Cabal,&quot; ''Commentary'', September 2003] The alleged connective chain is broken at every link. The falsity of its more recent elements is readily ascertainable by anyone who cares for the truthânamely, that George Bush was never a neoconservative and that most neoconservatives were never YPSLâs. The earlier connections are more obscure but no less false. Although Shachtman was one of the elder statesmen who occasionally made stirring speeches to us, no YPSL of my generation was a Shachtmanite. What is more, our mentors, Paul and Tom, had come under Shachtmanâs sway years after he himself had ceased to be a Trotskyite.

===A. Philip Randolph===
[[Image:A. Philip Randolph 1963 NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Picture of A. Philip Randolph.|A. Philip Randolph was a visible member of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas and then of Social Democrats, USA.]]
{{main|A. Philip Randolph}}
The long-time leader and intellectual architect of the civil rights movement, A. Philip Randolph was also a visible member of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas. He remained with the organization when it changed its name to SDUSA. Along with [[ILGWU]] President [[David Dubinsky]], Randolph was honored at the 1976 SDUSA convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hook76&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=Sidney|last=Hook|authorlink=Sidney Hook|url=http://www.archive.org/details/TheSocialDemocraticProspect|title=The social democratic prospect: Social democracy and America|location=New York|publisher=Social Democrats, USA|year=1976|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. Philip Randolph]] came to national attention as the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]. Randolph proposed a march on [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to protest racial discrimination in the [[armed forces]]. Meeting with [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[Oval Office]], Randolph respectfully, politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that Negroes would march in the capital unless desegregation would occur. The planned march was canceled after President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the [[Fair Employment Act]]), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.

In 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at [[Madison Square Garden]] to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, in war industries, in government agencies, and in labor unions.&amp;nbsp; Following the act, during the [[Philadelphia Transit Strike]] of 1944, the government backed African-American workers' striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.

In 1947, Randolph, along with colleague [[Grant Reynolds (civil rights leader)|Grant Reynolds]], renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent [[Civil disobedience|Civil Disobedience]].&amp;nbsp; On July 26, 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] abolished [[racial segregation]] in the armed forces through [[Executive Order 9981]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dol&quot;&gt;

Randolph was the nominal leader of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was organized by [[Bayard Rustin]] and his younger associates. At this march, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] delivered his &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech. Soon aferwords, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was passed.

===Bayard Rustin===
[[File:Bayard Rustin NYWTS 2.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Rustin, 1965]]
{{main|Bayard Rustin}}
Bayard Rustin was National Chairman of SDUSA. He also was President of the [[A.&amp;nbsp;Philip Randolph Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RustinGershman&quot; &gt;{{citation|first1=Bayard|last1=Rustin|first2=Carl|last2=Gershman|title=Africa, Soviet imperialism and the retreat of American power|authorlink1=Bayard Rustin|authorlink2=Carl Gershman|url=http://www.archive.org/details/AfricaSovietImperialismAndTheRetreatOfAmericanPower|location=New York|publisher=Social Democrats, USA|year=1978|series=SD papers|volume=2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rustin's selected writings have been republished as ''Time on two crosses: the collected writings of Bayard Rustin'' (San Francisco : [[Cleis Press]], 2003). Rustin's writings had appeared in an earlier collection&gt;

Rustin had had a long association with A. Philip Randolph and with pacifist movements. In 1956 Rustin advised [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] who  was organizing the [[Montgomery bus boycott]].  According to Rustin, &quot;I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began.  In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns.&quot;  Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin Bayard Rustin - Who Is This Man], State of the Reunion, radio show, aired February 2011 on NPR, 1:40-2:10, accessed March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Rustin wrote the following reports:
*''The revolution in the South&quot;'' Cambridge, Mass. : Peace Education Section, American Friends Service Committee, 1950s
*''Report on Montgomery, Alabama'' New York: War Resisters League, 1956
*''A report and action suggestions on non-violence in the South'' New York: War Resisters League, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Rustin and King began organizing the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).

Rustin and Randolph organized the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963. On September 6, 1963 Rustin and Randolph appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine as &quot;the leaders&quot; of the March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.life.com/image/52259555/in-gallery/23101#index/0 Life Magazine], September 6, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

====From protest to politics====
After passage of the 1964 [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] and 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]], Rustin advocated closer ties between the civil rights movement and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its  base among the working class.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rust belttFULL.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of the &quot;Rust Belt&quot; of the Midwestern US, which suffered a decline of heavy industry in the 1970s and 1980s.|Rustin predicted that automation would reduce the demand for low-skill labor, leading to a catastrophic decline for the African-American community, despite the gains in civil rights of the 1960s. This map shows the &quot;rust-belt&quot; region of the USA, which suffered plant closings and job losses.]] --&gt;
With the assistance of [[Tom Kahn]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RHKahn&quot;/&gt; Rustin wrote the 1965 article &quot;From protest to politics&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;FPTP&quot; &gt;{{cite journal|title=From protest to politics: The future of the civil rights movement|first=Bayard|last=Rustin|month=February|year=1965|journal=Commentary|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/from-protest-to-politics-the-future-of-the-civil-rights-movement/|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzed the changing economy and its implications for American Negroes. This article stated that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban Negro working-class, particularly in the northern US. To pursue its economic agenda, the Negro community needed to shift political strategy, strengthening its political alliance with mostly white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.). As its agenda shifted from civil rights to economic justice, the Negro community's tactics needed to shift from protest to politics, wrote Rustin.&lt;ref name=RustinFPTP&gt;Rustin wrote the following reports:
*''Civil rights: the true frontier'' New York, N.Y.: Donald Press, 1963
*''From protest to politics: the future of the civil rights movement'' New York: League for Industrial Democracy, 1965
*''The labor-Negro coalition, a new beginning'' [Washington? D.C. : American Federationist?, 1968
*''Conflict or coalition?: the civil rights struggle and the trade union movement today'' New York, A. Philip Randolph Institute, 1969
&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular danger facing the Negro community was the chimera of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of &quot;[[Black power]]&quot;, for which Rustin expressed contempt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Wearing my hair Afro style, calling myself an Afro-American, and eating all the chitterlings I can find are not going to affect Congress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RKRustin&quot; &gt;{{cite journal|title=From protest to patronage|first=Randall|last=Kennedy|month=29 September 29|year=2003|journal=The Nation|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/protest-patronage|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Rustin wrote that &quot;Black power&quot; repeated the moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]], while alienating the white allies needed by the Negro community.&lt;ref name=&quot;RustinSeparatism&quot; &gt;Rustin wrote the following reports:

=====Influence on William Julius Wilson=====
{{See also|William Julius Wilson}}
Rustin's analysis was supported by the later research by William Julius Wilson.&lt;ref name=&quot;RKRustin&quot;/&gt; Wilson documented an increase in inequality within the Black community, following educated Blacks moving into white suburbs and following the decrease of demand for low-skill labor, as industry declined in the Northern USA. Such economic problems were not being addressed by a civil rights leadership focused on &quot;[[affirmative action]]&quot;, a policy benefiting the truly advantaged within the Black community. Wilson's criticism of the neglect of working-class and poor African Americans by civil rights organizations led to his being mistaken for a conservative, despite his having identified himself as a Rustin-style social democrat. Wilson has served on the advisory board of Social Democrats, USA.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson's
''The Declining Significance of Race'' won the [[American Sociological Association|American Sociological Association's]] [[Sydney Spivack Award]]. In ''The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American Institutions'' (1978) [[Split labor market theory|Wilson]] argues that the significance of race is waning, and an African-American's class is comparatively more important in determining his or her life chances.

His ''The Truly Disadvantaged'', which was selected by the editors of the ''[[New York Times]]'' Book Review as one of the 16 best books of 1987, and received ''The Washington Monthly'' Annual Book Award and the Society for the Study of Social Problems' C. Wright Mills Award. In ''The Truly Disadvantaged: The Inner City, the Underclass, and Public Policy'' (1987), Wilson was one of the first to enunciate at length the &quot;[[spatial mismatch]]&quot; theory for the development of a ghetto underclass. As industrial jobs disappeared in cities in the wake of global [[economic restructuring]], and hence urban [[unemployment]] increased, women found it unwise to marry the fathers of their children, since the fathers would not be breadwinners.

His ''[[When Work Disappears]]: The World of the New Urban Poor'', which was selected as one of the notable books of 1996 by the editors of the New York Times Book Review and received the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award.
His ''The Bridge Over the Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics'' reaffirms the need for a coalition strategy, as Rustin suggested.

In Wilson's most recent book, ''More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City'' (2009), he directs his attention to the overall framing of pervasive, concentrated urban poverty of African Americans.  He asks the question, &quot;Why do poverty and unequal opportunity persist in the lives of so many African Americans?&quot;  In response, he traces the history and current state of powerful structural factors impacting African Americans, such as discrimination in laws, policies, hiring, housing, and education.  Wilson also examines the interplay of structural factors and the attitudes and assumptions of African Americans, European Americans, and social science researchers.  In identifying the dynamic influence of structural, economic, and cultural factors, he argues against either/or politicized views of poverty among African Americans that either focus blame solely on cultural factors or only on unjust structural factors.  He tries &quot;to demonstrate the importance of understanding not only the independent contributions of social structure and culture, but also how they interact to shape different group outcomes that embody racial inequality.&quot;  Wilson's goal is to &quot;rethink the way we talk about addressing the problems of race and urban poverty in the public policy arena.&quot;  [http://www.prrac.org/pdf/WJWMayJune2009PRRAC.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor movement: unions and social democracy====
Rustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the Negro community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social-democratic politics.

He was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL-CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper.

On the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]]. He was a founding National Co-Chairman of Social Democrats, USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT74&quot;&gt;{{cite article|title=Socialists seek to transform the Democratic Party|first=C.

====Human rights, especially ending discrimination against gays====
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a [[human rights]] and [[Election monitoring|election monitor]] for [[Freedom House]]. He also testified on behalf of New York State's [[Gay]] Rights Bill.  In 1986, he gave a speech &quot;The new 'niggers' are gays,&quot; in which he asserted,
{{bquote|Today, blacks are no longer the litmus paper or the barometer of social change. Blacks are in every segment of society and there are laws that help to protect them from racial discrimination. The new &quot;niggers&quot; are gays.... It is in this sense that gay people are the new barometer for social change.... The question of social change should be framed with the most vulnerable group in mind: gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gays Are the New Niggers |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/damnation/gays-are-the-new-niggers/ |date=June 26, 2009 |author=Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou |publisher=Killing the Buddha |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rustin also helped to write a report on peaceful means to end [[Apartheid]] (racial segregation) in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;

Accessed February 19, 2011. &quot;Norman Hill was born in Summit, N.J.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;) is an influential [[African-American]] administrator, [[activist]] and labor leader.

Graduating in 1956, he was one of the first African-Americans to graduate from [[Haverford College]]. Joining the civil rights movement and working in Chicago, Hill was an organizer for the Youth March for Integrated Schools, and then Secretary of Chicago Area Negro American Labor Council, and Staff Chairman of the Chicago March Conventions. In the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), Hill was first the East Coast Field Secretary and then National Program Director.  He assisted [[Bayard Rustin]] with organizing the 1963 March on Washington. As National Program Director of CORE, Hill coordinated the route 40 [[desegregation]] of restaurants, the Waldorf campaign, and illustrated the civil rights demonstration that took place at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]].

From 1964 to 1967, Norman Hill served as the Legislative Representative and Civil Rights Liaison of the Industrial Union department of the [[AFL-CIO]]. He was involved in the issue of raising minimum wage and the labor delegation on the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] against [[racial discrimination]] in politics and voting in the southern United States.

In 1967, Hill became active in the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]]. He began as Associate Director, but later became Executive Director, and finally President. As Associate Director, Hill coordinated and organized the Memphis March in 1968, after [[Martin Luther King]]âs assassination. In his career at the A. Philip Randolph Institute, Hill created over two hundred local chapters of this organization across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

====Support of Solidarity, the Polish union====
[[Image:Borsen gdansk roads to freedom exhibition 21p.jpg|thumb|right|The Polish labor-union's demand for legality were supported by Tom Kahn, who testified on behalf of the AFL-CIO  to the US Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;KahnPodhoretz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis31&quot;/&gt; The picture displays the [[21 demands of MKS|21 demands of Solidarity]].]]
{{See also|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}

When he became an assistant to the President of the [[AFL-CIO]] from 1972â1986, Kahn developed an expertise in international affairs.

Kahn was deeply involved with supporting the Polish labor movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis31&quot;/&gt;  The trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] (''SolidarnoÅÄ'') began in 1980. The Soviet-backed communist regime headed by General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] declared [[martial law]] in December&amp;nbsp;1981. [[Lane Kirkland]] appointed Kahn to organize the AFL-CIO's support of Solidarity. Politically, the AFL-CIO supported the [[21 demands of MKS|twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers]], by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL-CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund, which raised almost $300,000 by 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis31&quot;/&gt; These funds purchased printing presses, and office supplies. The AFL-CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puddington&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Puddington|2005}}:&lt;p&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surviving the underground: How American unions helped solidarity win|first=Arch|last=Puddington|&lt;!-- authorlink=Arch Puddington --&gt;|journal=American Educator|issue=Summer|year=2005|publisher=American Federation of Teachers|url=http://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/summer2005/puddington.cfm|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis31&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Shevis|1981|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFLâCIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help.&lt;ref name=&quot;RHKahn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KahnPodhoretz&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis31&quot;/&gt; On September 12, [[Lech Walesa]] welcomed  international donations with this statement: &quot;Help can never be politically embarrassing. That of the AFL-CIO, for example. We are grateful to them. It was a very good thing that they helped us. Whenever we can, we will help them, too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Puddington|2005}} quotes &quot;Polish Strike Leader Thanks U.S. Labor,&quot; Associated Press, September 12, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn explained the AFLâCIO position in a 1981 debate:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- There may be those who are willing to witness
the sacrifice of the most important workersâ movement to have appeared in half a
century in the interests of making a larger point about the character of the enemy, a point which ought not to need remaking, but the AFL-CIO, for reasons flowing from its very existence, cannot be among them.&lt;br /&gt;
 --&gt;
&quot;&lt;!-- To do all in our power to nourish and extend the life of Solidarity is the overriding compelling mission of the AFL-CIO in the present Polish situation. It is an obligation from which we could not shrink without doing damage to the ''raison dâetre'' of the American labor movement itself. Discharging this obligation entails risks, of course, but it is up to Solidarity, the ones on the front line, who know better than we the opportunities and dangers before them, to define the aid they need. It was not for us to tell the workers of Poland what was good for them, how they should go about doing what no other workers in history had done.  --&gt;'''Solidarity made its needs known''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Emboldening added&quot;&gt;Emboldening added.&lt;/ref&gt; with courage, with clarity, and publicly. As you know, '''the AFL-CIO responded by establishing a fund for the purchase of equipment requested by Solidarity'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Emboldening added&quot;/&gt; and we have raised about a quarter of a million dollars for that fund.
&lt;p&gt;
This effort has elicited from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and
Bulgaria the most massive and vicious propaganda assault on the AFLâCIO ... &lt;!-- that we
have seen --&gt; in many, many years. The ominous tone of the most recent attacks leaves
no doubt that '''if the Soviet Union invades, it shall cite the aid of the AFL-CIO as evidence of outside anti-Socialist intervention'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Emboldening added&quot;/&gt; aimed at overthrowing the Polish state. &lt;!-- I might add that much of this propaganda quotes extensively from American leftists, like those around ''Counter-Spy'' magazine, who ... charged the AFL-CIO with being in cahoots with the ubiquitous&lt;ref&gt;Opening statement by Tom Kahn in {{harv|Kahn|Podhoretz|2008|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; CIA. Consciously or not, much of the leftist attack ... serves the Sovietsâ purpose of discrediting our aid of Solidarity and of laying the basis of charging Lech Walesa, like Anatoly Sharansky, with CIA connections&quot;. --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn 2008 234&quot;&gt;Opening statement by Tom Kahn in  {{harvtxt|Kahn|Podhoretz|2008|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;&lt;!-- Despite all these problems which the AFL-CIO has faced, it may well be that our
task in Poland is clearer and simpler than that of the U.S. government or other
private institutions. Our job is to strengthen Solidarity. We can only do that by
responding to Solidarityâs stated needs.  --&gt;&lt;!-- Worth quoting at length, because Kahn is distinguishing between the purpose of labor and of other institutions, church and state, in a morally and rhetorically admirable debate BEGIN --&gt;&lt;!--  The U.S. government obviously will be
responding to other factors as well. And even those whose main concern is the
survival of the Church may view matters differently. After all, the Church could
survive by retreating into passivity. If Solidarity did that, it would cease to be
Solidarity and become more like the fake institution it replaced.  --&gt;&lt;!-- END Worth quoting at length, because Kahn is distinguishing between the purpose of labor and of other institutions, church and state, in a morally and rhetorically admirable debate --&gt;All this is by way of introducing the AFLâCIOâs position on economic aid to Poland. In formulating this position, our first concern was to consult our friends
in Solidarity ...&lt;!--  to find out what they thought from their vantage point about what
position the AFLâCIO should take --&gt;. We did consult with them ...&lt;!-- in a lengthy
discussion --&gt; and their views are reflected in the statement unanimously adopted by
the AFLâCIO Executive Council&lt;!--  at its February meeting --&gt;.&lt;!--  I would like to read to
you the relevant paragraphs of that statement --&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'&lt;!-- The Polish economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the result of
mismanagement of the Polish government and the inefficiencies inherent in
the Soviet-imposed economic system. Yet, Polandâs economic troubles are
cited to counter Solidarityâs demands for a forty-hour week, better wages,
and lower prices. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Because we share the aspirations of Polish workers for a better life and for an
economic climate more conducive to Solidarityâs success, the AFL-CIO is
prepared to support an extension of Western credits to Poland, but only under
conditions that safeguard the rights and interests of the workers. Polandâs
debts to the West already amount to more than $20 billion, the largest of the
East bloc countriesâ debt. To ensure repayment, the international banking
community has in the past pressured the Polish government into policies&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn 2008 234&quot;/&gt;
of austerity, which have been borne by the workers by higher prices and
longer work weeks. The extension of credits or rescheduling of Polandâs debt
could intensify the exploitation of Polish workers and threaten their hard
won gains.  --&gt;The AFL-CIO will support additional aid to Poland '''only if it is conditioned on the adherence of the Polish government to the&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;points of the Gdansk Agreement'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emboldening added&quot;/&gt; Only then could we be assured that the Polish
workers will be in a position to defend their gains and to struggle for a fair
share of the benefits of Western aid.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Opening statement by Tom Kahn in  {{harvtxt|Kahn|Podhoretz|2008|p=235}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In testimony to the Joint Congressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Kahn suggested policies to support the Polish people, in particular by supporting Solidarity's demand that the Communist regime finally establish legality, by respecting the [[21 demands of MKS|twenty-one rights guaranteed by the Polish constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=Tom|title=Moral duty|journal=Society |date=March 3, 1982 |publisher=Transactions Publishers (purchased by Springer)|location=New York|issn=0147-2011|&lt;!-- what is this? --&gt;51|volume=19|number=3|doi=10.1007/BF02698967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AFL-CIO provided the most aid to Solidarity, but substantial additional aid was provided by Western-European labor unions, including the U.&amp;nbsp;K.{{'s}} [[Trades Union Congress]] and especially the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis32&quot;/&gt;

=====Criticism of AFLâCIO=====
[[File:Lkirkland.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of Lane Kirkland|SDUSA leader Tom Kahn was appointed by [[Lane Kirkland]] ''(pictured)'', the President of the [[AFL-CIO]] after [[George Meany]], to organize the AFL-CIO's aid to [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], the Polish labor union that challenged communism in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis31&quot;/&gt;]]
The AFL-CIO's support enraged the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Its support worried the [[Carter Administration]], whose Secretary of State [[Edmund Muskie]] told Kirkland that the AFL-CIO's continued support of solidarity could trigger a Soviet invasion of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Puddington|2008}} wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Kirkland's embrace of Solidarity brought him into immediate conflict with the Carter administration. Despite the administration's avowed commitment to human rights, Edmund Muskie, secretary of state, decided that quiet diplomacy was the most prudent course to follow in the Polish crisis. He summoned Kirkland to his office for lunch on September 3, 1980, during which he gave a 'negative assessment' of the Polish aid fund that the AFL-CIO had just launched and declared that the federation's open support for Solidarity could be 'deliberately misinterpreted' by the Kremlin in order to justify military intervention. Muskie was not alone in deploring labor's Polish initiative. In a ''New York Times'' column, Flora Lewis called the Workers Aid Fund 'most unfortunate.' [[Flora Lewis]], &quot;Let the Poles Do It,&quot; ''New York Times'', September 5, 1980.]&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis32&quot;/&gt; After Kirkland refused to withdraw support to Solidarity, Muskie met with the USSR's Ambassador, Anatoly Dobyrnin, to clarify that the AFL-CIO's aid did not have the support of the US government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevis32&quot;/&gt;

Aid to Solidarity was also opposed by [[neo-conservative]] [[Jeanne Kirkpatrick]], who argued that communism could not be overthrown and that Solidarity was doomed.&lt;ref name=&quot;KahnPodhoretz&quot; &gt;The prospects of Solidarity and the morality of aiding Solidarity were debated by neo-conservative Podhoretz, who opposed aid to Solidarity as aiding the Soviet Union and failing to help the Polish people, and Kahn, who favored U.S. financial support of Poland only if Poland agreed to allow free labor-unions and freedom of the press, among other demands. {{harv|Kahn|Podhoretz|2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Aid through the 1980s=====
Later, the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] provided $1.7 million for Solidarity, which was transferred via the AFL-CIO. In both 1988 and 1989, the U.S. Congress allocated $1 million yearly to Solidarity via the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puddington &quot;/&gt;
In total, the AFL-CIO channeled 4 million dollars to Solidarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puddington&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The AFL-CIO had channeled more than $4 million to it, including computers, printing presses, and supplies&quot; according to {{harvtxt|Horowitz|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandra Feldman===
{{Main|Sandra Feldman}}
Sandra Feldman (October 13, 1939 - September 18, 2005) was an American civil rights activist, educator and labor leader who served as president of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT) from 1997 to 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite article|title=Sandra Feldman, scrappy and outspoken labor leader for teachers, dies at 65|newspaper=New York times|first=Joseph|last=Berger |date=September 20, 2005 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/nyregion/20feldman.html?sq=Sandra%20Feldman&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2&amp;pagewanted=all|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She helped to organize and was [http://www.socialdemocratsusa.org/oldsite/NewApproachesinEducation.html the keynote speaker at the 1999 SDUSA workshop on &quot;American Labor in the New Economy: A Day of Dialogue,&quot;January 22, 1999].

====Socialist activism====
She became active in [[socialist]] politics and the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt; When she was 17 years old, she met civil rights activist [[Bayard Rustin]], who became her mentor and close friend. During her early years in the civil rights movement, Feldman worked to integrate [[Howard Johnson's]] restaurants in [[Maryland]]. She soon became employment committee chairwoman of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] in [[Harlem]]. She also participated in several [[Freedom Rides]], and was arrested twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

====Teaching====
Upon graduation from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1962, Feldman worked for six months as a substitute third-grade teacher in [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]]. She continued to be active in the civil rights movement, working to desegregate Howard Johnson restaurants in Maryland.&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt; She participated in the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a [[master's degree]] program in literature at [[New York University]]. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the [[American Federation of Teachers]], which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won [[collective bargaining]] rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt; During this time, Feldman became an associate of [[Albert Shanker]], then an organizer for the [[United Federation of Teachers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

====United Federation of Teachers (UFT)====
{{See also|Albert Shanker|American Federation of Teachers}}
In 1966, on the recommendation of Rustin, Shankerânow executive director of the UFTâhired Feldman as a full-time field representative. Over the next nine years, Feldman became the union's executive director and oversaw its staff. She was elected its secretary (the second-most powerful position in the local) in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

After just two years on the UFT staff, Feldman played a crucial role in the [[American Federation of Teachers#Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike|Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike]]. The city of New York had designated the Ocean Hill-Brownsville area of Brooklyn as one of three decentralized school districts in an effort to give the minority community more say in school affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt; The crisis began when the Ocean Hill-Brownsville governing board fired 13 teachers for allegedly sabotaging the decentralization experiment. Shanker demanded that specific charges be filed and the teachers given a chance to defend themselves in [[due process]] proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt;

A protracted fight erupted between those in the community who supported the Ocean Hill-Brownsville board and those supported the UFT. Many supporters of the local school board resorted to racial invective. Shanker was branded a racist, and many African-Americans accused the UFT of being &quot;Jewish-dominated&quot;. Feldman was often at the center of the strike.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, ''Pickets, Parents, and Power,'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; The UFT emerged from the crisis more powerful than ever, and Feldman's hard work, good political judgment and calm demeanor won her widespread praise within the union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt;

Shanker was elected president of the AFT in 1974, but retained his post as president of the UFT. In 1986, Shanker retired as UFT president, and Feldman was elected president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt;

====UFT President after Shanker====
Feldman was known for being a quiet but very effective leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members. She lobbied so fiercely for Bernard Gifford as New York City schools chancellor that [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr. (Deputy Mayor)|Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], President of the New York City Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Feldman backed off and he was given a free hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt;

She was instrumental in helping [[David Dinkins]] win election as mayor of New York in 1989 by using union members and resources to build a winning electoral coalition of black and white voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;FeldmanNYT&quot;/&gt; But once mayor, Dinkins stalled on signing a new contract with the teachers' union. Feldman rarely criticized Dinkins publicly for his actions, but she kept the UFT out of Dinkins' 1993 re-election. Dinkins lost in a tight race to [[Rudy Giuliani]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

====American Federation of Teachers (AFT)====
Feldman had been elected an AFT vice president in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuther.wayne.edu/ward/aft/people.html See the list of AFT vice presidents at]&lt;/ref&gt; serving on the national union's executive council and the executive council's executive committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

After Shanker died in February 1997, Feldman won election as the AFT's president in July 1998, becoming the union's first female president since 1930. Feldman re-emphasized the AFT's commitment to educational issues. She also renewed the union's focus on organizing: During her tenure, the AFT grew by more than 160,000 new members (about 17 percent).
With Feldman as President, in 2002, AFT delegates approved a four-point plan: 1) building a &quot;culture of organizing&quot; throughout the union, 2) enhancing the union's political advocacy efforts, 3) engaging in a series of publicity, legislative, funding and political campaigns to strengthen the institutions in which AFT members work, and 4) recommitting the AFT to fostering democratic education and human rights at home and abroad. Feldman moved quickly to ensure that the plan was implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

In May 1997, Feldman was elected to the [[AFL-CIO]] executive council and appointed to the executive council's executive committee. During her tenure at the head of the AFT, Feldman also served as a vice president of [[Education International]] and was a board member of the [[International Rescue Committee]] and [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;

===Sidney Hook===
[[Image:Sidney Hook.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of Sidney Hook|Philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] gave the keynote speech to the second convention of SDUSA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hook76&quot;/&gt;]]
{{Main|Sidney Hook}}
Sidney Hook (December 20, 1902 â July 12, 1989) was an American [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] philosopher known for his contributions to public debates. A student of [[John Dewey]], Hook continued to examine the [[philosophy of history]], of [[philosophy of education|education]], [[political philosophy|politics]], and of [[ethics]]. He was known for his criticisms of [[totalitarianism]] ([[fascism]] and [[MarxismâLeninism]]). A pragmatic [[social democracy|social democrat]], Hook sometimes cooperated with [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], particularly in opposing [[communism]]. After WWII, he argued that  members of conspiracies, like the [[Communist Party USA]] and other [[democratic centralism|Leninist conspiracies]],  ethically could be barred from holding offices of public trust.&lt;ref&gt;
Hook was a public intellectual for more than five decades:

&lt;/ref&gt;

Hook gave the keynote speech to the July 17-18, 1976 convention of SDUSA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hook76&quot;/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the Social Democrat, democracy is not merely a political concept but a moral one. It is democracy as away of life. What is &quot;democracy as a way of life.&quot; It is a society whose basic institutions are animated by an equality of concern for all human beings, regardless of class, race, sex, religion, and national origin, to develop themselves as persons to their fullest growth, to be free to live up to their desirable potentials as human beings. It is possible for human beings to be politically equal as voters but yet so unequal in educational, economic, and social opportunities, that ultimately even the nature of their political equality is affected. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- The Social Democrat therefore is interested in extending the area of equal opportunity beyond the political sphere to all other areas of social life. He believes that all social institutions to the extent to which they are modifiable must be judged by their, fruits or consequences an the lives of individual persons. It is from this premise of &quot;democracy as a way of life,&quot; of equal opportunity for all to develop themselves as persons, taken as a regulative moral ideal, not as an inexorable, &quot;dialectical&quot; law of history, that the social democrat derives the justification for multiple programs of social reform-whether it be social security, health and unemployment insurance, a guaranteed minimum family income, occupational safety, or improved and extended public education. --&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to the principled defense of freedom, and to opposition to all forms of totalitarianism, let it be said that to its eternal credit, the organized labor movement in the United States, in contradiction to all other sectors of American life, especially in industry, the academy and the churches, has never faltered, or trimmed its sails. Its dedication to the ideals of a free society has been unsullied. Its leaders have never been Munich-men of the spirit.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want to conclude with a few remarks about the domestic scene and the role of Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. Our spiritual task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are few in number and limited in influence. So was the Fabian Society of Great Britain. But in time it reeducated a great political party and much of the nation. We must try to do the same.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Penn Kemble===
{{Main|Penn Kemble}}
Richard Penn Kemble (January 21, 1941 â October 15, 2005), commonly known as &quot;Penn,&quot; was an American [[political activist]] and a founding member of SDUSA. He supported [[free labor unions]] and democracy in the USA and internationally, and so was active in the civil rights movement, the labor movement, and the social-democratic opposition to communism. He founded organizations including [[Negotiations Now!]], [[Frontlash]], and [[Prodemca]]. Kemble was appointed to various government boards and institutions throughout the 1990s, eventually becoming the Acting Director of the [[U.S. Information Agency]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot; &gt;{{cite article|title=Political activist Penn Kemble dies at&amp;nbsp;64|first=Joe|last=Holley|
newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 19, 2005 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/18/AR2005101801743_pf.html|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{cite article|newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London |title=Penn&amp;nbsp;Kemble: Dapper Democratic Party activist whose influence extended across the spectrum of US politics (21&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1941 â15&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;2005) |date=October 31, 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article584709.ece|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After moving to New York, Kemble stood out as a neatly dressed, muscular Protestant youth, in a urban political setting that was predominantly Catholic and  Jewish. He worked at ''[[The New York Times]]'' but was fired for refusing to cross a [[picket line]] during a typesetters' [[strike action|strike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot;/&gt; A leader in the East River chapter of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], Kemble helped to organize a non-violent [[sit in|blockade]] of the [[Triborough Bridge]] during rush hour, to raise consciousness among [[suburbanite]]s of the lives of Harlem residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot;/&gt; Kemble was a founder of [[Negotiation Now!]], a group which called for an end to the bombing of [[North Vietnam]] and a negotiated settlement of the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot; /&gt; He was opposed to a unilateral withdrawal of U.S forces from Vietnam.

In 1972, Kemble was a founder the [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]] (CDM), an association of centrist Democrats that opposed the &quot;new politics&quot; liberalism  exemplified by [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[George McGovern]], who suffered the worst defeat of a Presidential candidate in modern times, despite the widespread dislike of Nixon.&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt; Kemble was Executive Director of CDM from 1972â76, at which time he left to become a special assistant and speechwriter for Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot; /&gt;  He remained with Moynihan until 1979. Concerned about the direct and indirect role of the [[Communist Party USA]] and of sympathizers of [[Marxist-Leninist]] politics in the US Peace Movement and in the [[National Council of Churches]], Kemble helped found the [[Institute on Religion and Democracy]]. From 1981 until 1988 was the President of the [[Friends of the Democratic Center in Central America|Committee for Democracy in Central America]] (PRODEMCA), which opposed the [[Sandinista]]s and related groups in [[Central America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot; /&gt;

He supported the Bill Clinton's campaign for the Presidency. During the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]], Kemble served first in 1993 as the Deputy Director and then in 1999 as Acting Director of the [[U.S. Information Agency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt; He was also made a special representative of [[Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine K. Albright]] to the [[Community of Democracies Initiative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NeoSD&quot;&gt;[http://www.socialdemocratsusa.org/oldsite/PennWashTimes.html &quot;Social democrat neocon&amp;nbsp;(sic.)&quot;], ''Washington Times'', October 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Kemble was appointed to the [[Board of International Broadcasting]] by [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President]] [[George&amp;nbsp;W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot; /&gt; He also became the [[Washington, D.C.]] representative of [[Freedom House]]; in his last years, he was especially involved in supporting peace efforts in the Middle East. [[Secretary of State]] [[Colin L. Powell]] appointed Kemble to be the Chairman of the International Eminent Persons Group on Slavery, Abduction and Forced Servitude in [[slavery in Sudan|Sudan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot; /&gt; Despite being diagnosed with brain cancer, Kemble spent his last months organizing a conference on the contributions of [[Sidney Hook]], the late pragmatic philosopher and SDUSA spokesperson; Carl Gershman took over the leadership of the conference after Kemble's cancer made it impossible for him to continue.
