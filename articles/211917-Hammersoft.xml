The '''University of California, Santa Barbara''', commonly known as '''UCSB''' or '''UC Santa Barbara''', is a [[public university|public]] research university and one of the 10 general campuses of the [[University of California]] system. The main campus is located on a {{convert|1022|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in [[Goleta, California]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} from [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and {{convert|100|mi|km}} northwest of Los Angeles. Founded in 1891 as an independent teachers' college, UCSB joined the University of California system in 1944 and is the third-oldest general-education campus in the system.

UCSB is a comprehensive doctoral university and is organized into five colleges offering 87 undergraduate degrees and 55 graduate degrees. The campus is the 5th-largest in the UC system by enrollment with 19,800 undergraduate and 3,050 graduate students. The university granted 5,442 bachelors, 576 masters, and 310 Ph.D. degrees in 2006â2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portrait&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bap.ucsb.edu/IR/UCSB_Portrait.pdf |format=PDF|title=UCSB Portrait |publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara |accessdate=October 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, UCSB was ranked 39th among &quot;National Universities&quot; by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]],&lt;ref name=&quot;US News&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/santa-barbara-ca/ucsb-1320|title=America's Best Colleges 2008: National Universities: Top Schools |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 29th worldwide by the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/top-200.html |title=Top 200 â The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2010â2011 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

UCSB was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]] in 1995. UCSB was the #3 host on the [[ARPAnet]].

The [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]] compete in the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Big West Conference]]. The Gauchos have won NCAA national championships in men's soccer and men's water polo.

==History==
UCSB traces its origins back to the Anna Blake School which was founded in 1891 and offered training in home economics and industrial arts.&lt;ref&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara, 1975â76 General Catalog Issue, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbsdk12.org/schools/history/SBCC-UCSB.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The Anna Blake School was taken over by the state in 1909 and became the Santa Barbara State Normal School. In 1921, a liberal arts program was authorized and the school was renamed again to [[California State University#Former campuses|Santa Barbara State College]]. Intense lobbying by an interest group in the City of Santa Barbara, led by [[Thomas Storke]] and Pearl Chase, persuaded the State Legislature, Governor [[Earl Warren]], and the [[Regents of the University of California]] to move the State College over to the more research-oriented University of California system in 1944. The State College system sued to stop the takeover, but the Governor did not support the suit. A state initiative was passed, however, to stop subsequent conversions of State Colleges to University of California campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadtman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Stadtman, Verne |title=The University of California, 1868â1968, page 346|publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=|year=1970 |page=594 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1958 the school was known as Santa Barbara College of the University of California, before taking on its current name. 

Originally, the Regents envisioned a small, several thousand-student liberal arts college, a so-called &quot;[[Williams College]] of the West&quot;, at Santa Barbara. Chronologically, UCSB is the third general-education campus of the University of California, after Berkeley and UCLA (the only other state campus to have been acquired by the UC system). The original campus the Regents acquired in Santa Barbara was located on only {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of largely unusable land on a seaside mesa. The availability of a {{convert|400|acre|ha|sing=on}} portion of the land used as [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara]] until 1946 on another seaside mesa in [[Goleta, California|Goleta]], which the Regents could acquire for free from the federal government, led to that site becoming the Santa Barbara campus in 1949. Originally, only 3000â3500 students were anticipated, but the post WWII [[baby boom]] led to the designation of general campus in 1958, along with a name change from &quot;Santa Barbara College&quot; to &quot;University of California, Santa Barbara,&quot; and the discontinuation of the industrial arts program for which the State college was famous. A [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]], Samuel B. Gould, was appointed in 1959. All of this change was done in accordance with the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]].

In 1959, UCSB Professor Douwe Stuurman hosted the English writer [[Aldous Huxley]] as the university's first visiting professor.&lt;ref name=&quot;The 50th Anniversary of Aldous Huxleyâs UCSB Lecture Series&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2009/mar/24/50th-anniversary-aldous-huxleys-ucsb-lecture-serie/ |title=The 50th Anniversary of Aldous Huxley's UCSB Lecture Series |accessdate=May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley delivered a lectures series called &quot;The Human Situation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Human-Situation-Lectures-Given-Barbara/dp/0701121432&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s UCSB became nationally known as a hotbed of anti-Vietnam War activity.  Events during the era included a bombing at the school's faculty club in 1969, which killed the caretaker, Dover Sharp, and the spring 1970 burning of the [[Bank of America]] branch building in the student community of [[Isla Vista]],  during which time one male student, Kevin Moran, was shot and killed.  UCSB's anti-Vietnam activity impelled then Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] to impose a [[curfew]] and order  the [[California National Guard|National Guard]] to enforce it.  Weapon-carrying guardsmen were a common sight on campus and in Isla Vista during this time.  

In 1995, UCSB was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]], an organization of leading research universities, with a membership consisting of 59 universities in the [[United States]] (both [[State university system (United States)|public]] and [[private university|private]]) and two universities in [[Canada]].

[[California State University#Former campuses|Santa Barbara State College]] was under the supervision of a [[President]], but in 1944, when it became a campus of the [[University of California]], the title of the chief executive was changed to [[Provost (education)|Provost]]. In September 1958, the [[Regents of the University of California]] established Santa Barbara as a general University campus and at the official title of the chief executive was changed to [[Chancellor]]. UCSB's first Provost was thus [[Clarence L. Phelps]], while UCSB's first Chancellor was [[Samuel B. Gould]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~ucalhist/general_history/campuses/ucsb/officers.html |title=University of California History Digital Archives |publisher=Sunsite.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UCSB 06.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A view over the school's lagoon to one of the Channel Islands]]
UCSB is located on cliffs directly above the Pacific Ocean. UCSB's campus is completely autonomous from local government and has not been annexed by the city of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and thus is not part of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;annex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facm.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/2006_NW_Campus_LRDPA/UCSB%20_90%20LRDP%20text%20with%20_06%20N%20and%20W%20Campus%20Amend.pdf|title=UCSB Long Range Development Plan â 1990|accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|year=1990|author=University of California, Santa Barbara|work=Page 16|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070629112004/http://facm.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/2006_NW_Campus_LRDPA/UCSB+_90+LRDP+text+with+_06+N+and+W+Campus+Amend.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ellwood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://facilities.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/ucsb_lrdp.asp|title=Open Space Habitat Management Plan for the Ellwood-Devereux Coast: Reports and Documents|accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=University Of California Santa Barbara|year=1990|author=University Of California Santa Barbara |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070811154530/http://facilities.ucsb.edu/planning/ellwood-devereux/documents/ucsb_lrdp.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it appears closer to the recently formed city of [[Goleta, California|Goleta]], a parcel of the City of Santa Barbara that forms a strip of &quot;city&quot; through the ocean to the Santa Barbara airport, runs through the west entrance to the university campus. Although UCSB has a Santa Barbara mailing address, as do other unincorporated areas around the city, only this entry parcel is in the Santa Barbara city limits. Like all other UC and CSU campuses, it is self-governing and cannot be incorporated into either city. The campus is divided into four parts: Main (East) Campus {{convert|708|acre|ha}} that houses all academic units plus the majority of undergraduate housing, Storke Campus, West Campus and North Campus. The campuses surround the community of [[Isla Vista, California|Isla Vista]].

UCSB is one of a few universities in the United States with its own beach. The campus, bordered on three sides by the Pacific Ocean, has miles of coastline as well as its own lagoon. The campus has numerous walking and bicycle paths across campus, around the lagoon and along the beach.

Much of the campus' early architecture was designed by famed architect [[William Pereira]] and his partner [[Charles Luckman]], and made heavy use of custom tinted and patterned concrete block. This design element was carried over into many of the school's subsequent buildings.

The [[Lagoon]] is a large body of water adjacent to the coastline, between San Rafael and San Miguel Residence Halls. It was created from a former tidal salt marsh flat and is fed by a combination of run-off and ocean water used by the Marine Science Building's aquatic life tanks; thus, it is a unique combination of fresh and salt water. Many of the older campus buildings are being replaced with newer, more modern facilities. The [[UCSB Libraries]], consisting of the Davidson Library and the Arts Library, hold more than 3 million bound volumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2010/nov/09/uscb-library-celebrates-3-millionth-book/ |title=The Santa Barbara Independent UCSB Library Celebrates 3 Millionth Book |publisher=Independent.com |date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and millions of [[microform]]s, government documents, manuscripts, maps, satellite and aerial images, sound recordings, and other materials. The 24 Hour Study Room, formerly known as the RBR (Reserved Book Room), is adjacent to the Davidson Library, which is located in the middle of the UCSB campus.

Campbell Hall is the university's largest lecture hall with 862 seats. It is also the main venue for the UCSB Arts and Lectures series, which presents special performances, films, and lectures for the UCSB campus and Santa Barbara community.

[[Storke Tower]], completed in 1969, is the tallest building in [[Santa Barbara County]]. It can be seen from most places on campus, and it overlooks Storke Plaza. It is home to a five-octave, 61-bell [[carillon]]. [[KCSB 91.9FM Santa Barbara|KCSB 91.9]] and the ''[[Daily Nexus]]'' have headquarters beneath Storke Tower.

The UCSB Family Vacation Center founded in 1969, is a summer family camp located on campus that draws over 2,000 guests each summer. The staff of over 50 includes many UCSB students who have been extensively trained as camp counselors.
===Layout===
The university (itself termed a &quot;campus&quot; of the University of California) is divided into two physical campuses, a West Campus and East Campus. The vast majority of university facilities, including all lecture halls and laboratories, are in the East Campus. The two campuses are connected by a large strip (known as the North and Storke Campuses) to the north which contain university housing and athletic fields. Thus, the university surrounds Isla Vista on three sides.

West Campus, aside from a few buildings dedicated to faculty housing, has largely been leased out to private organizations, and includes a school for the mentally disabled and a large nature preserve. The largest sand dunes on the south-facing coast of the Santa Barbara Channel are located here.

The East Campus centers around two [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]s, separated from each other by the main library and bus circle, and the life sciences buildings. Along the western quad are Storke Plaza and buildings housing the various arts, social sciences, and humanities departments. The Student Resource Building and the Events Center are also located along this quad. Surrounding the wider, park-like eastern quad are buildings housing the physical sciences departments and the College of Engineering. Directly to the south of, but not adjacent to, the eastern quad are the life sciences and psychology departments, as well as most of the on-campus housing. The southernmost section of the campus is dominated by the lagoon. The peninsula extending from the beach into the lagoon contains an elaborate labyrinth.

===Bicycles===
Along with [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]], UCSB is known for its extensive biking system. Bicycles [[Segregated_cycle_facilities#Bikeways_that_use_independent_rights-of-way|have exclusive right of way]] on paths throughout East Campus. [[Bicycle stand]]s and [[bicycle locker|lockers]] are ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.as.ucsb.edu/bikes/AS_BIKESMap_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; UCSB is unique among bicycle-heavy areas in that most travel is done within a small radius.&lt;ref&gt;http://police.ucsb.edu/Web/CSO/BicycleProgram.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

Santa Barbara is one of the ten major campuses affiliated with the [[University of California]]. The University of California is governed by a 26-member [[Board of Regents]], 18 of which are appointed by the [[Governor of California]] to 12-year terms, 7 serving as ''[[ex officio]]'' members, and a single student regent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Governance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/governance.html |title=About UC - Shared Governance |publisher=The University of California |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of Chancellor was created in 1952 to lead individual campuses. The Board of Regents appointed [[Henry T. Yang]] to be the 5th Chancellor of the university in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://chancellor.ucsb.edu/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and schools===

*[[College of Creative Studies]]
*[[UCSB College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]
*[[UCSB College of Letters &amp; Science|College of Letters &amp; Science]]
*[[Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management]]
*[[Gevirtz Graduate School of Education]]

UC Santa Barbara has three colleges: the [[UCSB College of Letters &amp; Science|College of Letters &amp; Science]], the [[UCSB College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], and the [[College of Creative Studies]]. The College of Creative Studies offers students an alternative approach to education by supporting advanced, independent work in the arts, mathematics, and sciences. The campus also has two professional schools, the [[Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management]], located in [[Bren Hall]], and the [[Gevirtz Graduate School of Education]].

===Academic year===
The university runs on a [[academic quarter (year division)|quarter system]]. There are three terms in the normal academic year: fall, winter, and spring, as well as a summer term. At the beginning of each term, there are one to three days of Pre-instructional Activities, where faculty meet to discuss instructional plans. During this period, students acquaint themselves to the campus and have the opportunity to take placement tests. At the end of each term, one week is devoted to final exams and special academic activities. There are 146 days of instruction, with a minimum of 48 per term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.registrar.ucsb.edu/cal2012.htm|title=Approved Academic Calendar for 2011-2012|publisher=UCSB Office of the Registrar|accessdate=14 May 2011|date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCSB hosts 12 National Research Centers, including the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]], the [[National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis]], the [[Southern California Earthquake Center]], and the [[California Nanosystems Institute]]. Eight of these centers are supported by the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucsb.edu&quot;/&gt; UCSB is also home to [[Microsoft Station Q]], a research group working on [[topological quantum computer|topological quantum computing]] where American mathematician and [[Fields Medal]]ist [[Michael Freedman]] is the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stationq.ucsb.edu/index.html |title=Microsoft Station Q |publisher=Stationq.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching and degrees===
The focus of the University of California is on research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt; Like all University of California campuses, UCSB focuses on academic development instead of vocational learning. Undergraduate teaching is centered on lectures, with larger lecture classes having sections. Sections may be tutorial style, or they may be set up as seminars or discussions. For undergraduates, UCSB confers both [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] and [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degrees. Music majors may pursue a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree. Graduate teaching involves seminar style classes and an emphasis on research and further study. UCSB confers [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degrees. Those studying music may pursue a [[Master of Music|M.M.]] or [[Doctor of Musical Arts|D.M.A.]] degree. Students pursuing a career in education may receive a [[Master of Education|M.Ed.]] or [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]] degree.

Over the years, other political parties and organizations have also been known to be active on campus, such as the Environmental Affairs Board, [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]], [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarians]], [[NORML]], and the Queer Student Union.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Several presidential and vice presidential candidates have visited the campus in recent years, including [[Hillary Clinton]], [[John B. Anderson]] and [[Peter Camejo]]. The campus has also seen a resurgence of anti-war sentiment among students. 

There are a variety of on campus centers offering social, recreational, religious, and preprofessional activities for students. The UCSB Multicultural Center puts on numerous activities every year to support students of color and promote awareness of diversity issues on campus. Other organizations and centers include the ''[[Daily Nexus]]'', the campus newspaper, the La Cumbre Yearbook, the school radio station, [[KCSB 91.9FM Santa Barbara|KCSB 91.9]], ''The Bottom Line'', an alternative weekly newspaper, and the Gaucho Free Press, the campus's conservative magazine. The UCSB Recreation Center also hosts a variety of activities, from Adventure Programs to [[ballroom dancing]] classes.
Further UCSB Hillel offers a space for UCSB's large Jewish population and a place for Jewish students to come together in a unique building in Isla Vista.
Students socialize at the [[UCSB Arbor|Arbor]], the [[UCSB UCen|UCen]], the Coral Tree Cafe the Courtyard Cafe and for a special lunch, the Faculty Club.

===Housing===
[[Image:San Nicolas, UCSB.jpg|thumb|right|San Nicolas residence hall.  As of September 2008, six of the on-campus residence halls are named after the islands in the nearby [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] chain.]]
[[Image:De La Guerra dining common, UCSB.jpg|thumb|right|De La Guerra dining commons]]

There are 8 [[residence halls]] at UCSB, seven of which are located at the Main campus, and one of which, Santa Catalina Dorms (Formerly known as Francisco Torres or FT), is located near the entrance to West campus north of [[Isla Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.housing.ucsb.edu/hchoices/reshalls-descriptions.htm ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Catalina has, not only its own dining commons, Portola Dining Commons, but it has a heated swimming pool, two lounges, numerous study rooms, 2 Recreational Rooms, a gym, as well as tennis courts and an expansive lawn. Because Santa Catalina is nearly {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}}. off-campus it has its own Campus police station as well as housing offices and Res-Net support center.

The Main Campus residence halls are found in two different locations. On the east end of campus are the residence halls named after five of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]]: [[Santa Rosa Island, California|Santa Rosa]], [[Santa Cruz Island|Santa Cruz]], [[Anacapa Island|Anacapa]], [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]] and [[San Nicolas Island|San Nicolas]]. There are two dining commons located near the Channel Islands residence halls. The Ortega Dining Commons is located between San Miguel and the University Center [[UCSB UCen|(UCen)]], and the De La Guerra Dining Commons (better known as DLG) is located between Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, and San Nicolas.

The two other residence halls, San Rafael and [[Manzanita Village]], are located on the west side of campus and primarily house continuing and transfer students. The Carrillo Dining Commons is located in [[Manzanita Village]], right next to San Rafael Hall. Manzanita Village was completed in 2002, and is the newest residence hall on campus.

In addition the University also has four housing complexes for Graduate students and their families: the recently completed San Clemente Villages for single graduate students, Santa Ynez Apartments, El Dorado Apartments, Westgate Apartments, and family student housing: West Campus Apartments and the Storke Apartment complexes. There is also Faculty Housing at the West Campus Point and new construction underway at the North Campus.

Students may also choose to rent housing in the bordering community of Isla Vista. An estimated average for rent costs is $500â$800 US/month to share a bedroom, and includes trash pickup and water utilities. Low-cost housing is limited, with the cheapest source being the [[Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative]].

Other sources of housing include the Greek System, and outlying communities (i.e. Goleta, Santa Barbara, Isla Vista, Montecito). Many students live in Isla Vista, which is immediately adjacent to campus. Isla Vista since the early 1960s has a reputation of being a party environment. UCSB is also affiliated with the [[Santa Barbara Student Housing Cooperative]] in Isla Vista, which seeks to provide low rent co-op housing regardless of gender, race, social, political, or religious affiliation, and thereby influencing the community to eliminate prejudice and discrimination in the community.

===Services===
There are a number of academic resources offered by the university, including a [[writing center]], open [[computer lab]]s, a [[machining|machine shop]], and drop-in academic advising.

A large Recreation Center provides classes and facilities for students and faculty. The Center has [[swimming pool]]s, [[racquetball]] courts, a rock wall, and exercise machines. The University Center has facilities for meetings and presentations, and also contains a bookstore, restaurants and a cashier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/ sa.ucsb.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

UCSB has a health clinic. Students with ailments or seeking medical assistance may consult a physician at the clinic. The clinic also offers basic health care and provides emergency medicine and contraceptives. The university is the only UC campus with its own Paramedic Rescue Unit. It is staffed by full-time professional paramedics and part-time undergraduate [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]s.

SexInfo, which was started in 1976 by Professors John and Janice Baldwin, is run by students doing advanced course work and research on [[Sexology|sexuality]] through UCSB's [[Sociology]] Department. The site is dedicated to providing accurate information about sexuality in a way that is both informative and personal. SexInfo answers questions sent in by readers from all over the world, as well as regularly updates and posts articles on various topics related to human sexuality. This program helps students getting their degree in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Snedden |first=Megan | title= A.S.

UCSB's sports teams compete in the [[Big West Conference]], with the exception of the men's water polo, men's and women's swimming, and the men's volleyball teams, which are in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]]. Santa Barbara is best known for its women's [[basketball]] and [[UCSB soccer|men's soccer]] teams. In 2006, UCSB won their first NCAA Men's Soccer title and its second overall NCAA championship (1979 water polo) in school history.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncaas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaasports.com/soccer/mens/recaps/d1_1203_517049/2006|title=UC Santa Barbara 2, UCLA 1|accessdate=September 16, 2007|publisher=NCAA sports.com|year=2006|author=NCAA sports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:NewUCSBLogo.png|thumb|left|250px]]
While there are some 400 students in ICA, there are over 700 in Club Sports Teams including: [[Alpine skiing|Alpine Racing]], [[Cycling]], [[Fencing]], [[Field Hockey]], [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's lacrosse|Lacrosse]], [[Roller Hockey]], [[Rugby union|Rugby]], [[Sailing]], [[Soccer]], [[Triathlon]], [[Ultimate Frisbee]], [[Water Ski]] and [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]. Many of these teams are highly regarded and compete against Intercollegiate teams from across the US. For example [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] has produced several national team members including Nine-time National Rowing Team member Amy Fuller, winner of several [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and World Championship medals and currently head of the [[UCLA]] Rowing Program. The UCSB Cycling Team has also produced several national team members, Olympians, and members of numerous US and international professional teams.

Many other hundreds of students participate in a large Intramural program consisting of Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Flag Football, Golf, Floor Hockey, Indoor and Outdoor Soccer, Racquetball, Squash, Running, Softball, Tennis, Table Tennis, Ultimate Frisbee, Volleyball, Inner tube water polo, and Kickball.

One non-sanctioned sport also draws many students to UCSB: surfing.  The on-campus beaches include a number of decent surfing sites, including &quot;Poles,&quot; &quot;Campus Point,&quot; &quot;Depressions&quot; and &quot;Sands&quot; and &quot;Devereaux Point&quot; on the west campus.  Because Campus Beach actually faces South and East, and is shielded by the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, the surf is usually quite small.  However, a large North or West swell can wrap in to create great waves which are typically very clean and good for surfing. UCSB has a surf team that competes in NSSA (National Scholastic Surfing Association) competitions, and is generally considered one of the best in the nation. They continued their reputation by winning a record 14th National Title at the college level in 2010's finals.
