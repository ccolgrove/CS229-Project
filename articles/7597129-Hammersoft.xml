{{Main|Children of Earth}}
The 4-5-6 served as the main [[antagonist]]s during [[Children of Earth|the third series]] of ''[[Torchwood]]''.

They are unnamed aliens with whom the government of the United Kingdom made a deal in 1965; the 456 extorted twelve children in return for a cure to an Earth-bound virus which was about to mutate. They are only known by the frequency they are using, 456. When asked for their species name by [[List of Torchwood characters#John Frobisher|John Frobisher]], they chose to go by this name. They seem to require (or at least prefer) a highly toxic atmosphere, and to be non-humanoid of form, possessing three insect like heads which appear to spew green slime whenever the creatures are aggravated or pressured. In Children of Earth: Day Four, parts of the 456 were briefly seen when a government operative entered its chamber with a portable video camera. It had 3 heads, which possessed mandibles. The rest of the body is trunklike, like a giant caterpillar. A swelling is briefly shown at the end of the creature. After the 456 return to Earth over forty years later, an ambassador of the species demanded that 10% of the world's children be given to the race as a gift, or else the entire human race would be destroyed. To ensure humanity would accept this deal, the 456 announced their arrival several days in advance by possessing and speaking through every pre-pubescent child on earth. A closer view of the visiting 456 specimen showed it had incorporated the bodies of human children into its own, the two being connected by four vine-like tentacles, because of an unnamed chemical pre-pubescents produce that the creatures use like a drug. According to the 456 themselves, such children 'feel no pain', and 'live long beyond their natural span'. The children do not appear to have physically grown, although they are wizened perhaps mutated in some way and appear to be aware of their surroundings and their own condition; they breathe using respirators. The 456 are responsible for the death of [[Ianto Jones]] when they release a deadly virus into a building where Ianto was present. They are eventually defeated when [[Jack Harkness]] manages to reverse the frequency of a previous transmission made by the 456 and turn it into a weapon against them, driving them away from Earth, although he is forced to sacrifice his grandson Steven to use him as the source of the frequency broadcast in the first place.

'''[[Abaddon]]''', a demon sealed away &quot;before time&quot; not unlike the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Beast|Beast]] from the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episodes &quot;[[The Impossible Planet]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Satan Pit]]&quot; (it is described as the &quot;son of the great Beast&quot;), appears in &quot;[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]&quot;, revealed to have been sealed beneath the [[Rift (Whoniverse)|Rift]]. The villainous [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Bilis Manger|Bilis Manger]] had schemed to ensure his freedom, manipulating the Torchwood Three crew. Bilis refers to Abaddon as his &quot;god&quot;.

Abaddon killed all those who fell in his shadow; he devoured life. [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack]] attempted to sacrifice himself by using his [[immortality]] to destroy the demon when it tried to absorb too much, leaving Jack dead for days but causing the monster to choke to death.

Abaddon is also referred to in ''[[The Twilight Streets]]'', where Bilis reveals that Abaddon was actually an agent of the Light, sentient light particles that sought to imprison their Dark counterparts back in the rift; the energies Abaddon took from people were simply 'collateral damage' as Abaddon gathered strength for the coming battle. Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, the [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] of these novels in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.

Abaddon's design is somewhat reminiscent of the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s foe, [[List of Doctor Who villains#Destroyer|The Destroyer]], most notably in the curved horns, long face, blue, scaly skin and animalistic snout.

It is also referred to in Series 2 of ''Doctor Who'' by the [[Ood]] in the episode &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; in terms of Beast's various aliases: &quot;Some may call it Abaddon.&quot;

The '''Adipose''' are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode &quot;[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]&quot;. Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to &quot;[[List of Doctor Who villains#Matron Cofelia|Miss Foster]]&quot;, or Matron Cofelia of the Five Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet, Intergalactic Class, to create a new generation. She formulated a drug that would cause human fat ([[adipose tissue]]) to morph by [[parthenogenesis]] into Adipose children. The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the host's entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Partners&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]] | series = [[Doctor Who]] | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[BBC One]] | city = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Shadow Proclamation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MonsterFiles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/?episode=S4_01&amp;character=&amp;action=videostream&amp;playlist=/doctorwho/playlists/s4_01/video/s4_01_v_01.xml&amp;video=1&amp;date=&amp;summary=Captain%20Jack%20reveals%20facts,%20figures%20and%20top%20secret%20info%20about%20the%20Adipose.&amp;info=&amp;info2=&amp;info3=|title=The Monster Files|publisher=BBC |date=5 April 2008|accessdate=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; forbids seeding, or breeding aliens, on a level 5 planet such as Earth. Level 5 means pre-warp capabilities, as said in &quot;Partners in crime.&quot;

In the parallel universe created in &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot;, the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace because of the absence of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] (&quot;[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]&quot;). Over 60 million Americans (roughly 20% of the total population of the United States) were killed in this timeline as a result.

In &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot; and &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot; it is revealed that the breeding planet, Adipose 3, was one of the 27 planets relocated to the Medusa Cascade by the New [[Dalek]] Empire. After their defeat, Adipose 3 and the other planets were returned to their original positions.

In &quot;[[The End of Time]]&quot;, an Adipose is shown in a bar along with other aliens the Tenth Doctor had previously encountered. Five Adipose [[action figure]]s were released as part of the first series 4 wave.

'''Aggedor''' is the Sacred Royal Beast of the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#P|Peladon]], whose spirit is worshiped there. The real creature upon which the legend is based is a large, hairy beast with a single horn.

===Alien tumour===
A sentient '''alien [[Tumor|tumour]]''' was shown to have grown on the brain of [[Owen Harper|Owen's]] [[Engagement|fiancÃ©e]], Katie, in flashback sequences in &quot;[[Fragments (Torchwood)|Fragments]]&quot;. Attempting to operate on the young woman, all doctors present in the room were killed when the alien life form released a rapidly dissipating toxic nerve gas in self-defence. The effects of the &quot;tumour&quot; caused Katie to exhibit symptoms of early onset [[Alzheimer's disease]].

===Ancient Lights===

'''The Ancient Lights''' were entities that controlled a universe before the [[Big Bang]]. Surviving the explosion, they endured and eventually passed their power into the human Martin Trueman, a low level middle-aged conman, in ''[[Secrets of the Stars]]''. The Ancient Lights gave Trueman the power to control all life with an astrological sign, as well as other abilities such as energy blasts. These powers were based on ancient physics from the Light's native universe. Through Trueman, the Lights intended to enslave all life as they had done in their own universe. Luke Smith's artificial birth meant he had no astrological sign and could not be controlled by the Ancient Lights, allowing him to break Trueman's hold over the people of Earth. As the Ancient Lights began to fade, Trueman (who had long believed he would have a special destiny) refused to give up his connection and became one with the Lights.

{{Doctor Who race

|type=Humanoid

|start=''[[The Leisure Hive]]''
}}
The '''Argolin''', who appeared in the [[Fourth Doctor]] story ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' by [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]], are the inhabitants of [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Argolis]]. In 2250, the Argolin, led by Theron, fought and lost a 20-minute [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[#Foamasi|Foamasi]]. As a result of this war, the Argolin became sterile. They were long-lived, but when they neared the end of their life they aged and declined very rapidly.

The Argolin who survived the war put aside their race's traditional warlike ways and remade Argolis as &quot;the first of the leisure planets&quot;, catering to tourists from many worlds. They built a &quot;Leisure Hive&quot; dedicated to relaxation and cross-cultural understanding; due to radioactive fallout from the war, the Argolin planned to live in the Hive for at least three centuries. Argolis continued to struggle financially, and by 2290 faced possible bankruptcy. A rogue faction of Foamasi known as the West Lodge attempted to purchase the entire planet to use as a criminal base, sabotaging recreation facilities to encourage the Argolin to sell. The criminal nature of the offer was exposed by a Foamasi agent, aided by the Fourth Doctor and [[Romana]].

Since the Argolin were sterile, they attempted to renew their race using [[cloning]] and [[tachyon]]ics, but only one of the clones, Pangol, survived to adulthood. Pangol was mentally unstable and obsessed with the Argolin's former warrior culture. He attempted to create an army of tachyonic duplicates of himself, but was unsuccessful and was eventually restored to infancy through the same tachyonic technology that had created him.

In appearance, Argolin are humanoids with greenish skin. Their heads are covered with what appears to be elaborately coiffed hair capped with small domes covered in beads, which fall off when the Argolin become sick or die.

In ''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', an alien resembling an Argolin is present in the Iceworld plaza.

===Arkan===
The '''Arkan''' are a race mentioned and briefly glimpsed in &quot;[[Cyberwoman]]&quot;. They are described by Jack as being incredibly boring and mostly made of liquid, hence &quot;the cells would be a mess&quot; if they were interrogated at Torchwood. One of their leisure ships is spotted over Cardiff Bay. They are politely asked to leave Earth's atmosphere via a message from [[Toshiko Sato|Toshiko]]'s computer as they are &quot;spooking the locals.&quot;

===Atraxi===

&lt;!---Please do not add Autons as they're a type of robot and are already mentioned on the List of Doctor Who robots article---&gt;

===Attention Seeker===
Referred to as &quot;the '''Attention Seekers'''&quot; by Jack, these are aliens which are viewed as gods, appearing in a 2007 entry to the ''Torchwood website''. Written in a pseudo-[[blog]] form, the ''Cardiffboyoboy blog'' story relays a young man's series of encounters with Jack Harkness during an alien invasion on the Cardiff [[gay bar|gay clubbing]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/false_gods/intercepted_blog.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070227115611/www.torchwood.org.uk/html/false_gods/intercepted_blog.shtml| archivedate=2007-08-24 | title= Intercepted Blog - Cardiffboyoboy |accessdate=2008-05-19 |work= Torchwood.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attention Seekers are originally a race who are accustomed to worship as deities on their home, which they feed on. They travel place to place and from time to time, masquerading as gods and being worshipped by countless societies until they &quot;go out of fashion&quot; there. Finding themselves in the comparatively more [[secular]] but [[vanity|vain]] 21st century Britain, Captain Jack explains to the narrator Peter that it has been forced to assume the form of a strikingly beautiful person who draws power from all the attention drawn to them. However, rather than copulate with one man every night, Jack ambiguously describes that the creature ends up [[Dogging (sexual slang)|in the car park]] where it can &quot;get the serious devotion of a crowd&quot;, mentioning how it's &quot;Odd how people still get on their knees to worship, isn't it?&quot;. Jack later explains though, that while it was originally relatively harmless in its activities, it has become increasingly hungry and thereby dangerous, so Jack is forced to kill it with a few clicks of his [[List of Torchwood items#Time Agent Wrist-Strap|Time Agent Wrist-Strap]], which he uses to trigger car alarms to clear the car park, and later a [[vehicle explosion|car explosion]] to kill the creature.

===Bane===

[[File:Bane TSJA.jpg|150px|thumb|[[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Davey|Davey]] in his natural Bane form.]]
The '''Bane''', in their natural form, are large tentacled aliens with one eye. They appear in ''[[Invasion of the Bane]]'' and ''[[Enemy of the Bane]]''. They exhibit some level of mind-reading abilities. [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Bane Mother|Bane Mothers]] are particularly large and are known to eat members of their young who fail them. They are able to appear human through the use of image translators. The Bane sought to enslave mankind by getting them addicted to the soft drink, ''Bubble Shock!'', which contained organic Bane secretion, which takes control of its human host when activated. [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Mrs Wormwood|Mrs Wormwood]] headed the Bane's disguised human front and created the [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Archetype]], Luke.

===Bannerman===
{{Main|Delta and the Bannermen}}

===Bees===
A story arc in Series 4 referred to the disappearance of [[bee]]s, culminating in &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot;, where it was revealed that some bees were aliens from Melissa Majoria who created a path the Doctor could follow to find Earth and the other planets stolen by the Daleks.

===Blathereen===

The '''Blathereen''' are a family related to Slitheen, but are orange in colour and do not use skin suits. In the episode ''[[The Gift (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Gift]]'', a family of Slitheen-Blathereen landed on earth with a gift of friendship called rakweed. Mr Smith scans it and announces it harmless until Luke takes a high dose of rakweed spores and goes into a coma. Sarah Jane then confronts the Blathereen with a super soaker full of vinegar. She is captured but escapes using her sonic lipstick. Meanwhile Rani, Clyde and K9 discover that the bell destroys the spores of rakweed by drowning out the sound they make and interfering with their communication. Sarah Jane later uses this to kill the Blathereen.

===The Blessing===

&lt;!--Felt that the significance of this necessitated a listing somewhere, was not sure where to put it. Please move if feel more relevant to Torchwood items/or Torchwood characters --&gt;

In &quot;[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]&quot; The Blessing is revealed to be an [[Antipodes|antipodal]] geological formation connected to the Earth's [[morphic field]] running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires. [[Jack Harkness]] theorises that it may have been caused by the interaction of Rachnos Huon particles and Silurian hibernation matrixes, though its origins are unknown. The Families are unsure of whether or not to classify the Blessing as alive or not, though it is stated to have a degree of sentience. One of its features is that it has the ability to show an approaching human the content of their own soul, which has caused some to commit suicide, other's to find convinction. The Mother believed that this reaction was a result of the Blessing attempting to communicate with the Human Race.

In &quot;[[The Blood Line]]&quot; it is revealed that the worldwide immortality investigated by Torchwood was a result of Jack's blood being introduced to The Blessing's Morphic Field. It is implied that this was a result of the Blessing interpreting The Families interference as a threat, and the subsequent immortality being a gift of kindness to humanity. Jack and Rex (who has been infused with Jack's blood) manage to reset the Miracle through exposing it to Jack's (now mortal) blood at each end of the Blessing. However, The Blessing does not Reset everything back to the way it was and, perhaps as a result of the presence of Jack's blood, brings Rex back as also immortal.

===Blowfish===

An otherwise unnamed, humanoid, bipedal alien '''[[Tetraodontidae|blowfish]]''' features in &quot;[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (Torchwood)|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang]]&quot;. The blowfish, played by [[Paul Kasey]], holds part of [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Captain John Hart|Captain John]]'s puzzle box. It is possible that the Blowfish was known to John. Overcome by Earth's pleasures, the blowfish takes [[cocaine]], steals a [[sports car]] and takes a teenage girl hostage, only to attract the attention of Torchwood and the local media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A young blowfish appears in the episode &quot;[[Fragments (Torchwood)|Fragments]]&quot;, in flashback sequences involving Jack's first mission for the Torchwood Institute, during which Jack captures the fish for committing various crimes but is then outraged when it is shot after being captured.

A blowfish and two other fish-like creatures appear in the ''[[Torchwood Magazine]]'' short story ''The Book of Jahi''. The blowfish has taken on the name Mr. Glee and has been operating as a crime boss in Cardiff for some time.

===Brain Parasite===
A '''brain parasite''' appears in the episode &quot;[[Immortal Sins]]&quot; as an intended tool of [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#The Trickster's Brigade|the Trickster's brigade]]. According to dialogue within the episode, brain parasites are a metre long with four hooked mandibles around the mouth. They implant their larvae using these hooked mandibles, travel to the brain, and eventually cause insanity.

In 1927, the Trickster's Brigade obtained a brain parasite and brought it to America, planning to infect [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and drive him insane, which would cause him to eventually drop out of [[World War II]] and change the timeline. The Torchwood Institute learned of this and sent Jack Harkness to dispose of the parasite, which he did so with the help of [[#Angelo Colasanto|Angelo Colasanto]].

===Brain of Morphoton===

===Bruydac===
The '''Bruydac''' feature in the novel, ''[[Another Life (Torchwood)|Another Life]]''. Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.

The Bruydac are a race of [[bipedal]], [[humanoid]] aliens hailing from the eponymous planet, [[List of Doctor Who planets#B|Bruydac]]. They are over 7&amp;nbsp;feet tall, have broad shoulders and long, thin arms ending in thick claws. They have exposed skulls featuring a bony ridge from the bridge of their nose, to the back of their head. Their eyes are covered by heavy lids and are red and white in colour. Bruydac appear to breathe in much the same way humans do, through their mouths, with their [[lungs]] in their chest.

They possess slight [[psychic]] ability, and are able to possess humans from afar with the aid of a small [[List of Torchwood items#B|device]] inserted into the spine of the victim. When under the control of a Bruydac, a small green-grey [[starfish]]-shaped creature begins to grow in the victim's [[stomach]] which, when at a certain size, is ejected through the victim's mouth. If placed in water, the starfish begins to grow. When exposed to [[oxygen]] the &quot;starfish&quot; gains the ability to digest any natural material, including rubber and living tissue.

Bruydac ships accept several different forms of fuel, including [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], and are cylindrical in shape.

In ''Another Life'' a Bruydac battle cruiser is slowly pushing its way through the Cardiff [[Rift (Whoniverse)|Rift]] causing adverse weather conditions in the entire bay. If the ship were to force its way the entire way through, it would send a wave down the entire Bristol channel comparable to a [[tsunami]]. The lone Bruydac warrior aboard the ship, injured after a crash that killed the rest of his crew, is waiting to recover and for a way to power his ship so that he may return home.

A translucent humanoid who [[Spirit possession|possessed]] the body of a 19th century prostitute named Mary was encountered in the episode &quot;[[Greeks Bearing Gifts (Torchwood)|Greeks Bearing Gifts]]&quot;. She was a member of a race which communicated exclusively via [[telepathy|telepathic]] [[List of Torchwood items#A|pendants]], and claimed to be a political exile, sent to Earth by a [[List of Torchwood items#Two person transporter ship|teleporter]] now in Torchwood's possession. At one point, &quot;Mary&quot; calls herself [[Philoctetes]], in reference to his exile on [[Lemnos]]. She gave her telepathic necklace to Toshiko, and seduced her into letting her into Torchwood to regain the teleporter.

On arriving on Earth in 1812, the alien killed her guard and possessed Mary. In this form she needed to consume human hearts to maintain the host's youth, taking one a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/lowry/notes.shtml Operation Lowry: Notes from Owen]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Mary&quot; threatened Tosh in order to regain the teleporter and Jack exchanged it for Tosh. However, Jack had reprogrammed the coordinates, sending &quot;Mary&quot; into the center of the Sun instead of back to her homeworld.

In ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' episode &quot;[[Invasion of the Bane]]&quot;, [[Sarah Jane Smith]] helps an alien of the same race to find its way home. It is later revealed that this alien was a &quot;[[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures monsters and aliens#Arcateenians|star poet]]&quot;, from [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Arcateen V]], who gave Sarah Jane a device via which she promised to help her with her poetry whenever she needs it. [[Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Mr Smith's]] Alien Files on the official ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' website described her race as Butterfly People.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sja/mrsmith.shtml?nonflash&amp;pg=alien4 BBC - The Sarah Jane Adventures - Mr Smith]&lt;/ref&gt; The Butterfly People are also referenced in the novel ''[[Something in the Water]]'' (published March 2008) where they are called &quot;Arcateenians&quot;. Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains unclear.

&quot;Mary&quot; possessed [[superhuman strength|strength]] large enough to shatter human bones in a manner resembling a gunshot and could move at superhuman speeds, also possessing acute senses able to notice that there was something different about Jack. The poet alien in ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' was able to fly home with some assistance from Sarah Jane Smith. &quot;Mary's&quot; opinions of her human form seemed to be mixed: she disliked watching people talk using conventional speech; which was considered archaic on her home world, but she said she liked the body which she found &quot;so soft, so wicked&quot;. She also expressed a dim view of human nature, considering humans to be a race who inherently desired to invade others.

===Butterfly Person or Arcateenian===

[[File:Butterfly Person.jpg|150px|thumb|A Butterfly Person says goodbye to [[Sarah Jane Smith]].]]
[[Maria Jackson]] witnessed [[Sarah Jane Smith]]'s encounter with a '''star poet''' from [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Arcateen V]] in ''[[Invasion of the Bane]]''. This alien gave Sarah Jane a device with which to summon her whenever Sarah Jane needed help with poetry. The same device was later used by [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]] to defeat the [[#Bane|Bane]]. Another member of the same species, dubbed &quot;[[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Butterfly People|Mary]]&quot;, was seen in the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode &quot;[[Greeks Bearing Gifts (Torchwood)|Greeks Bearing Gifts]]&quot;. While ''Torchwood'' showed that the race uses pendants to communicate telepathically and that they possess [[superhuman strength|superior strength]], speed, senses and the ability to [[spiritual possession|possess humans]] and [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]], &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot; also showed they have the ability to fly. It's assumed that most of this race are benevolent, and that Mary, the first of them to have been seen in any series related to ''[[Doctor Who]]'', was a criminal and an outcast.

[[Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Mr Smith's]] Alien Files on the official website described the race as '''Butterfly People''',&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; although the ''Torchwood'' website uses the term '''Arcateenian'''. They are also referenced in the ''Torchwood'' spin-off novel ''[[Something in the Water]]'', where they are also called Arcateenians. The ''Torchwood'' website also claims that Henry Parker from the episode &quot;[[A Day in the Death]]&quot; possessed a full-length Arcateenian translation of ''[[The Fog (1975 novel)|The Fog]]'' by [[James Herbert]], which &quot;Includes the foreword from the later edition. Extensively footnoted, largely to explain planet-specific references.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchwood/sites/arg/pages/episodes.shtml?folder=tw_case_ep08&amp;tab=3&amp;page=2 BBC - Torchwood - Episodes / Episode 8 / A Day in the Death - Report]&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that they are, at least in an academic capacity, familiar with Earth culture. Like all spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains unclear.

The '''Carrionites''', as seen in &quot;[[The Shakespeare Code]]&quot;, are a race of witch-like beings. The species originates from the Fourteen Stars of the Rexel Planetary Configuration. They use advanced science which appears much like [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]]. The Carrionites use words to manipulate the universe and defy physics. They possess the ability to discover a person's true name; however, when attempting to name the Doctor, the Carrionite Lilith remarked &quot;there is no name&quot;, but then mentioned Rose's name, apparently sensing his connection to her. In the &quot;old&quot; times of the universe, they were banished through powerful words by the [[#Eternal|Eternals]].

The three Carrionites shown in &quot;[[The Shakespeare Code]]&quot; were [[List of Doctor Who villains#Lilith|Lilith]], [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Mother Doomfinger|Mother Doomfinger]] and [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Mother Bloodtide|Mother Bloodtide]]. They are defeated by [[William Shakespeare]] with the help of the Doctor and Martha, who helped him find the right words to defeat the Carrionites, ending with &quot;[[List of spells in Harry Potter#Expelliarmus (Disarming Charm)|expelliarmus]]&quot;. The Carrionites were re-trapped in a crystal ball by this. According to Lilith, Shakespeare accidentally released Doomfinger, Bloodtide and Lilith while he was distraught over his son Hamnet's death from the plague.

According to the audio commentary of the third season of Doctor Who, Carrionites are all female and call each other &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot; according to their relative ages. In the novel ''[[Forever Autumn (Doctor Who)|Forever Autumn]]'', it is revealed that they were banished for warring with a similar race, the Hervoken, who also used a science resembling magic.

In its helpless state, it was found and stored in a warehouse where it was then cut up and turned into [[meat]] to be sold to food companies. When cut up, as well as exhibiting the ability to [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], it also showed a visible increase in size with each regeneration. When Torchwood infiltrate the warehouse with the aim of freeing the creature, the scientists forget to inject it with [[sedative]], causing it to flail about wildly, breaking free from its bonds. This leads Owen to ultimately inject the whale with [[poison]], killing it out of mercy.

===Caxtarids===
The Caxtarids are humanoids with metallic red hair and eyes, who appear in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novels ''[[Return of the Living Dad]]'' and ''[[The Room with No Doors]]'', both by [[Kate Orman]]. They come from the star system [[Lalande 21185]], and are expert torturers. Amongst the planets they have conquered is Kapteyn 5, home of more than sixty sentient species including avians and butterfly-people.

The Caxtarids were wiped out by a virus that destroyed DNA. This was created by the government to be used against &quot;the rebels&quot;. The Doctor attempted to prevent its use, but it was activated ten years after his involvement, during another rebellion.

A green-eyed Lalandian, who says she is a &quot;different caste&quot; from the Caxtarids, appears in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Seeing I]]'', by Orman and [[Jonathan Blum]]. The same book states that the Caxtarids (or Ke Caxtari) do not deal in weapons, but do trade in people.

The Sleeper Agents are tasked with gathering intelligence. To do so, they hide on their target planet, take on the form of the planet's dominant species, and absorb as much knowledge as they can to aid in the invasion. Sleeper Agents can be stationed in excess of 10 years to aid their integration into society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

To aid their hiding, they are provided with an [[Microchip implant (human)|implant]] able to gather information subconsciously and protect them against potential attacks. In the case of Earth, the implant is hidden in the arm of the human shell. It provides a [[blade]] weapon for use in emergencies, an impenetrable nano-metre thick body [[Energy shield|shield]] and a technology mask allowing vital signs to be hidden. When the Sleeper Agents first arrive, their memory is erased and stored in part of the implant to help them maintain their disguise. When the invasion is ready to take place, their memories are reactivated, overriding their &quot;human&quot; personalities and motivations.

In &quot;Sleeper,&quot; the Sleeper Agents are planning to [[wikt:hijack|hijack]] 10 [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]] with the aim of devastating the planet and making it easy for their race to take over.

Like many more recent aliens, such as the [[Judoon]] and [[Hath (Doctor Who)|Hath]], the Cheetah People strongly resembled a real animal, [[cheetah]]s. The Cheetah People were depicted as [[barbarian|savages]] and had the ability to turn others into Cheetah People, including for a while the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]]. The Cheetah People in ''Survival'' had been kidnapping people and taking them to their planet.

The '''Chelonians''' are a race of cybernetic humanoid [[tortoise]]s who have appeared in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] novels. The first appearance of the Chelonians was in the [[Seventh Doctor]] [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[The Highest Science]]'' by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]]. They returned in ''[[Zamper]]'' and also featured in the [[Fourth Doctor]] missing adventure ''[[The Well-Mannered War]]''; as well as in the short stories ''The Hungry Bomb'', ''Fegovy'', and ''The Body Bank'', all by Gareth Roberts and published in the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Yearbook 1995'', the anthology ''Decalog 3: Consequences'', and the ''Doctor Who Storybook 2008'' respectively. They are also mentioned in the New Adventures books ''[[Oh No It Isn't!]]'' and ''[[Beyond the Sun (Bernice Summerfield)|Beyond the Sun]]'' featuring Bernice Summerfield.

The Chelonians are a war-like race from the planet Chelonia. They are [[hermaphroditic]] and lay eggs. Some of their cybernetic enhancements include [[X-ray vision]] and improved hearing. Chelonians consider humans to be [[parasitism|parasites]] and often try to eliminate them. There is a pacifistic faction, however, and at some point following the Doctor's recorded encounters with them, they took control and the society began devoting its energies towards [[floristry|flower arrangement]]. [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] listed the Chelonians amongst the races with fleets orbiting Earth in &quot;[[The Pandorica Opens]]&quot;.

===Chimera===
The '''Chimera''' is a creature that features in the comic ''[[List of Torchwood comics|The Legacy of Torchwood One!]]''.

The '''Cybermen''' were originally a race of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet [[Mondas]]. As they implanted more and more artificial parts into their bodies, as a means of self-preservation, they became coldly logical and calculating, with emotion all but deleted from their minds. The Cybermen also have a rivalry with the [[Daleks]].

In &quot;[[Rise of the Cybermen]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Age of Steel]]&quot; of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second revived series]], the Cybermen originated from a parallel version of Earth and were created by [[John Lumic]], a genius obsessed with immortality. He forcibly 'upgraded' everyone in the parallel earth.

They were created by Dr. [[Kit Pedler]] (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and [[Gerry Davis (screenwriter)|Gerry Davis]] in 1966, first appearing in the serial ''[[The Tenth Planet]]''.

===Dalek Humans===
The Dalek Human race were created by the Cult of Skaro in New York in the year 1930 in &quot;[[Evolution of the Daleks]]&quot;. They were human bodies, with Dalek minds inside. The Cult was relying on a gamma strike from the sun to release the energy needed to splice the human and Dalek genomes together. However, [[Dalek Sec]], with the Doctor's help, wanted to change the process to give them emotions. The other members of the Cult of Skaro believed that Sec was no longer a true Dalek and turned on him. The Doctor held onto the spire of the [[Empire State Building]] as the gamma strike occurred, resulting in his Time Lord DNA mixing with the Dalek Humans' DNA, giving the Dalek Humans the potential for free will. Dalek Caan deemed the experiment a failure, and put all of the Dalek Humans to death.

===Dalek===

A warlike race of mutant creatures who live within mobile battle armor. They are lifelong enemies of The Doctor, and he is the only being whom they fear. They are bent on destroying all life forms other than themselves. The creatures themselves somewhat resemble jellyfish, with a single eye and many tentacles. They first appeared in the 1963 serial [[The Daleks]].

A data ghost is an echo of a dead human's last few moments alive. Data ghosts are the result of an imprint of a person's consciousness at the moment of their death, stored on a neural relay incorporated in Commander Lux suits. In &quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot;, Data Ghosts appear at the death of Miss Evangelista and Proper Dave. Data Ghosts typically only last up to a few minutes. The Data Ghost of Miss Evangelista was &quot;saved&quot; onto the Library's hard-drive as a result of mixed wireless signals. As a result of [[data corruption]], the version of Miss Evangelista saved in the library's computer appeared deformed and possessed superior intelligence. Later in the episode, the Doctor preserves River Song's consciousness using his sonic screwdriver.

===Death===
A being described only as &quot;'''[[Death (personification)|Death]]'''&quot; appears in the episode &quot;[[Dead Man Walking (Torchwood)|Dead Man Walking]]&quot;. An entity connected to the second [[List of Torchwood items#R|Resurrection Gauntlet]], it manifests by using [[Owen Harper]] as a host after [[Jack Harkness]] brings him back to life. A strange energy the Torchwood team is unable to explain gradually overtakes him before releasing itself and taking a physical form: a skeleton shrouded in black vapour. Death then proceeds to undertake a cycle it had attempted once before in the [[middle ages]] when a young girl, Faith, was resurrected by the glove and brought Death into the world in a similar fashion. If Death can kill 13 people, it will &quot;walk the world forever,&quot; taking victims at random to feed its rapacious hunger. However, before it can reach its 13th victim, the already-dead Owen stalls Death for long enough that it weakens and dissipates: the same way in which Faith defeated Death in the Middle Ages. Owen then re-absorbs the energy so that he may continue living in his [[undead]] state.

Death was first mentioned as &quot;something in the darkness&quot; by [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Suzie Costello|Suzie Costello]] in &quot;[[They Keep Killing Suzie]]&quot;.

In 2006, both the [[Tenth Doctor]] series of ''Doctor Who'' and its spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' expanded upon a notion of actual malicious supernatural entities existing in the [[Whoniverse|''Doctor Who'' universe]]. &quot;[[The Impossible Planet]]&quot; introduced the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Beast|Beast]], a [[Satan]]-like demon remaining from the universe before our own, sealed in planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#K|Krop Tor]] by the &quot;Disciples of Light&quot;.

The '''Draconians''' (also called '''Dragons''', a derogatory term) are a humanoid race encountered in the 26th century. They have tall, pointed heads with prominent brows, pointed ears and patches of scaly skin. Common interstellar travel and attempts at colonization have brought them into frequent and occasionally hostile contact with humans, leading to a treaty establishing a frontier between the two empires. The Draconians are very intelligent and at least as advanced as their human counterparts. They have appeared only in the [[Third Doctor]] serial [[Frontier in Space]].

They are omnivores, known to eat even the thrusters of spacecraft, but prefer to eat flesh. They hunt by scent, and will almost never abandon prey once they have found it.

===Droon===
The '''Droon''' feature in the novel, ''[[Border Princes]]''. Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.

The Droon are a species of small [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[Insect migration|migratory]] [[insect]]s, born from pale blue eggs about 2&amp;nbsp;inches long. Upon arrival, they take up residence in a warm and moist place, most often the [[Paranasal sinus|sinus passages]] of humans where they reside in a [[fugue state]]. At this point they are relatively harmless, only causing the host mild, [[Common cold|cold]]-like symptoms. Usually, after a few months, the Droon leave of their own accord or die and, during a [[sneeze]], get ejected without the host even knowing.

However, occasionally an egg, roughly one in ten, will pupate and begin to advance to the next stage of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. When a Droon is about to hatch from its egg, it causes sudden elevations in [[Alpha wave|alpha-wave patterns]] making it easy to judge when a Droon is about to be a threat. When a Droon hatches, it is no longer pale blue, but a dark blue, almost black, insect with long, thin [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]]. In this stage of their life, they are more dangerous than their pupal stage.

When the Droon are considered dangerous, Torchwood may use their [[List of Torchwood items#A|Anti-Droon audio paddle]] to forcibly extract the Droon from the host.

In ''Border Princes'' an elderly husband and wife, Mr and Mrs Peeters are infested by the Droon which have to be [[pest control|exterminated]] before they hatch.

The Eknodine appear as green eye-stalks that look out of their host's mouth. The Eknodine attack by breathing a gas upon their victims that turns them to dust.

The Eknodine are only seen in the fictional version of Upper Ledworth created by the Dream Lord. However the Doctor recognises them, suggesting they exist in his reality, though entities within dreams ring familiar to the dreamers, as did Mrs. Hammil, along with the entire elderly community of the fictional Upper Ledworth.

The '''Entity''' was a gaseous form capable of 'eating' the whole of time and space. In an attempt to stop it, the Doctor had imprisoned it in a vase which he kept in the [[TARDIS]]'s Drawing Room. [[Amy Pond|Amy]] accidentally broke the vase and released it, and it consequently attempted to devour her. The Doctor warned that he would contain it once again if it did not release her; after it obliged, he let it out into space to feed on 'Chronomites', tiny [[krill]]-like creatures that, after being killed, will 'rewind' and regenerate to the moment before they were killed. This allows the Entity to feed harmlessly for eternity.

In ''[[The Mad Woman in the Attic]]'', Eve was evacuated to [[Earth]] by her parents when their race was destroyed by the [[Daleks]]. Her sentient ship, Ship, crashed on a beach at Danemouth, where it ordered Harry, a funfair caretaker, to keep Eve away from civilisation for her to play games until Ship rebooted.

Called &quot;'''fairies'''&quot; by mankind, [[Jack Harkness]] notes that these creatures do not actually have a name. Fairies are not [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] life-forms, but have lived alongside humanity since the dawn of time, and although mankind has ascribed positive, friendly aspects to them, Jack insists that they are dangerous. Their exact nature is unclear, although Jack vaguely describes them as part myth, part spirit world and part reality jumbled together, mixed with &quot;old moments and emotions&quot;, all moving backwards and forwards through time and seen only out of the corner of one's eye.

Fairies and children are linked, and Jack says that fairies were once children, taken from various time periods stretching millennia into the past. These children are the Chosen Ones, who the fairies protect and avenge if harm comes to them, until the time that they claim the children for their own. The fairies require these children in order to continue their race's existence.

In &quot;[[Small Worlds (Torchwood)|Small Worlds]]&quot;, fairies are seen in two forms: one a small, glowing humanoid form with [[butterfly]]-like wings and the other a much larger, more monstrous form. They are also undetectable by technology, and can appear and disappear at will. They also have control of the elements, able to create sudden gales or rainstorms and direct them with pinpoint accuracy. It is also said that they can make &quot;great storms, wild seas, [and] turn the world to ice.&quot;

A common method of killing their victims is to &quot;steal their breath&quot;, asphyxiating them by clogging their throats with [[rose]] [[petal]]s. Their ability to move back and forth in time is demonstrated by the appearance of Jasmine, a Chosen One taken in [[Chronology of the Doctor Who universe#2000s|the present]], in fairy form in a 1917 photograph.

Jack speculates that fairies may be &quot;part Mara&quot;. However, his noting of &quot;Mara&quot; as the origin of the word &quot;[[nightmare]]&quot; and their ability to steal the breath from their victims suggests that he is referring to the [[Mara (folklore)|Mara]] of [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]]/[[Norse mythology|Scandinavian mythology]]. It is unclear whether any reference was intended to the [[Mara (Doctor Who)|Mara]] of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories ''[[Snakedance]]'' and ''[[Kinda (Doctor Who)|Kinda]]''. [[Christopher Bailey]], writer of ''Snakedance'' and ''Kinda'', was a practising Buddhist and named ''Doctor Who'''s Mara after the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] demon [[Mara (demon)|Mara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Shannon Patrick Sullivan | title = A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Kinda | url = http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/5y.html | accessdate = 2006-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foamasi''' are an intelligent, bipedal race of [[reptile]]s resembling humanoid [[chameleon]]s who appeared in the 1980 [[Fourth Doctor]] story ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' by [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. The race's name is a near-anagram of the word &quot;[[mafia|mafioso]]&quot;. The Foamasi fought and won a 20-minute [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[#Argolin|Argolin]]. They communicate by means of chirps and clicks, translated by an interpreting device held in the mouth. Although they became mostly a peaceful race from having learned the error of their ways from the devastating war, a renegade faction called the West Lodge exists and frequently attempted to arouse hostilities between the two races.

After their victory, the Argolin's home planet of [[List of Doctor Who planets#A|Argolis]] was officially owned by the Foamasi government. Two saboteurs from the West Lodge tried to force the Argolins to sell them the Leisure Hive, so they could use it as a new base. They were thwarted by a group of Foamasi, one claiming to be a member of the Foamasi government, who used a web-spewing gun to ensnare them and return them to their home planet. Some Foamasi disguise themselves as humanoids by fitting into skin-suits which are smaller than the Foamasi's own bodies.

A Foamasi assassin appears in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''Placebo Effect'' by [[Gary Russell]]. In this novel, it is explained that the Foamasi can fit into disguises smaller than their bodies because their bones are hollow and collapsible.

The '''Forest of Cheem''' is a race of sentient, [[biped]]al trees that are direct descendants of the Old Earth Trees. The trees were sold to the Brotherhood from the Panjassic Asteroid field, who experimented on the trees, and, after hundreds of years the trees grew arms and started walking. Eventually, the entire race of Trees got on their Barkships after they heard the Great Calling, travelling through space for five thousand years. The word 'cheem' means 'tree' in the forest's language.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Adventures, Issue 21, 17 -30 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Forest of Cheem appear in the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode &quot;[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]&quot; by [[Russell T Davies]]. According to the [[Ninth Doctor]], they are of huge financial importance due to their land holdings and forests on various planets; and they have &quot;roots&quot; everywhere.

The Forest respect all forms of life, but neither respect nor understand various [[technology|technologies]] such as computers. They were aware of the [[Time Lord]]s and their fate in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. The ''Doctor Who Annual 2006'' classifies them as one of the higher species who were aware of the course of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] and its history-changing effects and also states that they were mortified by the bloodshed.

The group of Trees seen on ''Platform One'' was led by Jabe Ceth Ceth Jafe (named in ''Doctor Who: Monsters and Villains''), and also included Coffa and Lute. Coffa and Lute appear again in the comic strip story &quot;Reunion of Fear&quot; in ''[[Doctor Who - Battles in Time]]'' #6.

The human survivors describe the Futurekind as what they may become if they do not reach 'Utopia', though that seems to be just a myth. The Futurekind are aggressive towards normal humans and hunt them for food.

===GENIE===
In the [[BBC Books]] novel ''[[The Stone Rose]]'', the GENIEs (Genetically Engineered Neural Imagination Engines) are artificial life forms developed by a scientist working in artificial reality. They resemble a cross between a small dragon and a [[platypus]] ensconced in a box, and are capable of altering reality and perception according to people's desires, whether spoken or thought. Lacking free will, they are thus compelled to grant &quot;wishes&quot;, potentially causing disruption when in the presence of human beings.

===Gangers===
{{main|The Rebel Flesh|The Almost People}}

The '''Gangers''' (a truncation of [[DoppelgÃ¤nger]]) are made from 'fully programmable' material called the Flesh, used to hold the consciousness of a human worker. They were used as a [[slavery|work gang]] mining [[aid]]. After a [[solar storm]] caused them to fully develop personalities (in Jennifer's case, fuse with her progenitor), they openly rebelled against their human progenitors on the island. After they were brought to life, they developed unique abilities like being able to stretch out parts of their body, or become a large deadly monster. They could look human with some effort, but really had smooth unnatural skin. The Flesh made a Ganger of the Eleventh Doctor with a Ganger of his companion, Amy Pond, secretly replacing the original, for predominantly the first half of the thirty-second season. A Ganger of her infant, Melody Pond, was used to fool Amy, in &quot;[[A Good Man Goes to War]]&quot;.

The '''Gelth''' appeared in the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode ''[[The Unquiet Dead]]''. They were a new race of alien villains that the [[Ninth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler]] encountered in the 2005 series. They were the first element of the new series that attracted attention for being &quot;too scary&quot;. Following complaints, many of which were made by [[Mediawatch UK]], the [[BBC]] stated that in future, episodes of that nature would be forewarned by a statement of &quot;may not be suitable for under 8s&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The Gelth are blue gaseous life-forms. They claimed to have lost their corporeal forms as a consequence of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], though later actions by the Gelth put the truth of this statement in doubt. They arrived on Earth via [[Rift (Whoniverse)|the spacetime rift]] at an undertaker's house in [[Cardiff]] in 1869. Their forms could not be maintained in Earth's atmosphere without suspension in a gaseous medium. They proceeded to take possession of recently deceased corpses and in gas pipes common to [[Victorian era]] households. When they are possessing these corpses, they look close to being ordinary humans (provided that the corpse has yet to enter the autolytic stage of decomposition), with only two fundamental differences: their irises vanish or turn white, and blue veins are clearly visible on their ghastly pale skin. Gelth make an unearthly shrieking noise for an unknown reason, particularly when they've possessed someone.

Claiming to be on the verge of extinction, the Gelth convinced the Doctor to aid their entrance to Earth via Gwyneth, the undertaker's servant girl who had developed psychic powers due to growing up near the rift. The Gelth actually numbered in the billions and intended to take the Earth by force, and to use its murdered population as vessels for themselves. The Gelth were thwarted when Gwyneth sacrificed herself, blowing up the building and sealing the rift. Whether all the Gelth that came through the rift perished is unclear.

In &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot;, Rose asked whether &quot;ghostshifting&quot; Cybermen might have been Gelth, which the Doctor stated was not the case.

'''Gorgons''' are a parasitic race that resemble ethereal snakes, based on the mythological [[Gorgon]]. In ''[[Eye of the Gorgon]]'', three members of this species visited Earth through a portal that was opened by a specific talisman. Once there, they remained on the planet for three thousand years, following the loss of the talisman. In order to remain hidden, they formed a sisterhood of nuns that protected them from the human world. Two members of their kind were slain, one by a Greek hero and another by Professor Edgar Nelson-Stanley and his wife, [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Bea Nelson-Stanley|Bea]]. A single Gorgon remained to look for the talisman, which Bea gave to [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]], who in turn gave it to his adoptive mother [[Sarah Jane Smith]].

Gorgons inhabit other species and move to successive hosts as each grows weak and dies in order for them to survive. Gorgons attack by means of a process resembling rapid fossilisation, which gives the appearance that the victim has been turned to stone.However,Luke and Clyde managed to avoid this by running.People who suffer this can still hear for a least for a few minutes and can even cry.It is reversible for a few hours using the talisman.The Gorgons are native to the planet Gorgos, 100 million light years from Earth.

===Haemovore===
{{Infobox Doctor Who race
| name=Haemovore
| type=Decayed humanoid

| planet=Earth
| start=''[[The Curse of Fenric]]''
}}
'''Haemovores''' appeared in the [[Seventh Doctor]] story ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'' by [[Ian Briggs]]. [[Vampire|Vampiric]] creatures that fed on blood, they were the end result of human [[evolution]] in a possible far future, caused by millennia of pollution. As part of his final game against the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], the entity known as [[List of Doctor Who villains#Fenric|Fenric]] transported the most powerful Haemovore, called the &quot;Ancient One&quot;, through time to [[Viking Age]] [[Northumbria]]. There it waited, trapped beneath the [[North Sea]] for centuries, occasionally drawing victims into the water and transforming them into Haemovores.

Soon after the transformation, victims appeared much as they did in life, except for elongated fingernails and a corpse-like pallor. Later they became deformed blue-grey humanoids covered in [[octopus]]-like suckers. The Ancient One was the least human in appearance; in its own time, it was the last living thing on Earth.

During [[World War II]], Fenric released the Ancient One. Fenric's plan was that the Ancient One was to release the toxin which would pollute the world and thus [[Predestination paradox|create its own future]].

The Haemovores had the ability to [[hypnosis|hypnotically]] paralyse their victims so they could feed and drain them of blood. Not all of their victims were turned into Haemovores, although the selection process was never explained. The Haemovores were impervious to most forms of attack, surviving being shot at close range by a [[submachine gun]] at one point. They could be destroyed in the traditional vampire-killing fashion of driving a stake through their chests. They could also be repelled by their victim's faith, which formed a psychic barrier, like the Doctor's faith in his companions, Ace's faith in the Doctor, Captain Sorin's faith in the [[Communist Revolution]], and even the Reverend Wainwright's failing faith in God.

Ultimately, the Seventh Doctor convinced the Ancient One to turn against Fenric, and it released the toxin within a sealed chamber, destroying itself and Fenric's host. Whether this means that the future the Ancient One came from was averted is not clear, although the Doctor seemed to think so.

===Handbots===
'''The Handbots''' were programmed to help the citizens of Apalapucia with their &quot;kindness&quot;. Their medicine however would kill any aliens from the outside world. Should the patient refuse to be injected with medicine, the Handbots would crack open their &quot;blank&quot; faces to shoot out a needle. If the patient dodges the needle, other Handbots then were teleported to help inject the patient. In &quot;[[The Girl Who Waited]]&quot;, the TARDIS landed on the planet Apalapucia who was under quarantine due to the outbreak of Chen7, a virus that can kill anyone with two hearts within a day, specifically Apalapucians and the Doctor himself. [[Amy Pond]], who was under quarantine, was chased by the Handbots who tried to give her their &quot;kindness&quot;.

The '''Krillitanes''' are an alien race that first appeared in the episode &quot;[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]&quot;. They had infiltrated the Deffry Vale [[comprehensive school]] on present day Earth, increasing the intelligence of the pupils with Krillitane oil. Using the children as part of a giant computer program, they hoped to crack the secrets of the Skasis Paradigm, the Universal Theory that would give them control over the basic forces of the universe and turn them into gods. Their scheme was foiled by the [[Tenth Doctor]] and his companions, though not before they attempted to ask the Doctor to join them in remaking the universe.

The Krillitanes are a composite race who pick and choose physical traits they find useful from the species they conquer, incorporating them into their own bodies. When the Doctor last encountered them they looked like humans with very long necks, but by the time of &quot;School Reunion&quot;, they possessed a [[bat]]-like form which they obtained from the conquest of Bessan ten generations prior. However, they were able to maintain a morphic illusion of human form, which could be discarded if needed.

A side effect of their rapid evolution made the very oil they were using to enhance the intelligence of Deffry Vale's children toxic to their own systems, reacting with them like an acid. As bat creatures, they sleep in a way similar to Earth bats, hanging from a ceiling with wings covering their bodies. Like Earth bats, they are sensitive to loud or high frequency noises, as demonstrated when they were temporarily disabled by the school's fire alarm. They are also carnivorous and have no qualms in devouring other sentient life-forms for food.

&lt;!-- Speculation commented out until source can be found
The bat-like Krillitanes bear some resemblance to the Malevilus, powerful aliens who established a [[Roman Empire]] on a parallel Earth that eventually conquered the galaxy, from the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]'' comic strip story ''Doctor Who and the Iron Legion'' (DWW #1-#8).--&gt;

They spread via seed pods which travel in pairs and are violently hurled through space by frequent volcanic eruptions on their unnamed home planet. The pods when opened are attracted to flesh and are able to infect and mingle their DNA with that of the host, taking over their body and slowly transforming them into a Krynoid. The species can also exert a form of telepathic control over other plant life in the surrounding area, making it suddenly dangerous and deadly to animal-kind. In the later stages of development the Krynoid can also control the vocal cords of its victims and can make itself telepathically sympathetic to humans. Fully grown Krynoids are many meters high and can then release hordes of seed pairs for further colonisation.

Two pods arrived on Earth at the South Pole during the prehistoric [[Pleistocene]] era and remained dormant in [[Antarctica]] until discovered at the end of the twentieth century. One of them hatched after being exposed to ultra-violet light, and took control of a nearby human scientist. The [[Fourth Doctor]] intervened in the nick of time and ensured the Krynoid was destroyed in a bomb, but the second pod was stolen and taken to the home of millionaire botanist Harrison Chase in England. Chase ensured the [[germination]] of the second pod, which overtook his scientific adviser Arnold Keeler, and transformed its subject over time into a virtually full-sized Krynoid. Unable to destroy the creature by other means, and with the danger of a seed release imminent from the massive plant, the Doctor orchestrated an RAF bombing raid to destroy the creature before it could germinate.

The Krynoid are also featured in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio story for [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] entitled ''[[Hothouse (Doctor Who audio)|Hothouse]]''.
Also featured in BBV audios 'The Root of all Evil', and 'The Green Man'.

The '''Logopolitans''' of the planet Logopolis were featured [[Logopolis|in the episode of the same name]]. The Logopolitans were a race of strange looking [[mathematician]]s concerned with [[entropy]] to make sure [[heat death of the universe]] did not occur.

}}
The '''Macra''' first appear in the 1967 [[Second Doctor]] story ''[[The Macra Terror]]'' by [[Ian Stuart Black]]. They are an intelligent, giant [[crab]]-like species from an unnamed planet colonised by humanity in the future. The Macra invade the control centre of the colony and seize the levers of power without the colonists â including their Pilot â knowing what had happened. Thereafter the Macra only appear at night, when the humans are in their quarters, observing a curfew. They have strong hypnotic powers which alter human perception. They also have the ability to ensure messages are vocalised through electronic apparatus such as television or sensor speakers. Both these tools are used to keep the human colonists under control, believing they are blissfully happy. This provides a cover for the Macra to use the colonists as miners in a vast gas mine. The gas is deadly to the miners but vital to the Macra, enabling them to move more quickly and rejuvenating their abilities. The [[Second Doctor]] effects a revolution on the Macra planet and helps engineer an explosion in the control centre, destroying the Macra in charge.

The Macra are also featured in the 2007 episode &quot;[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]&quot;, becoming the only one-off opponent of the Doctor in the classic series to appear in the revived series so far. In the episode, some Macra are found to be alive below New New York, a city of [[List of Doctor Who planets#N|New Earth]]. They live in the thick fog of exhaust gases on the main motorway under the city, tracking the flying cars by their lights and snatching at them when they get too close. The Doctor says that the species is billions of years old and once developed a small empire as &quot;the scourge of this galaxy&quot;, but the Macra beneath New New York must have [[Devolution (biology)#Streamlining evolution|devolved]] into nothing more than beasts. The status of the Macra beyond &quot;Gridlock&quot; is yet to be seen.

The '''Malmooth''' are a race of humanoid [[insectoid]]s native to the planet Malcassairo, who are all but extinct by the year one hundred trillion. The last surviving member of their race, '''Chantho''', played by [[Chipo Chung]], appears in &quot;[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]&quot;. A devoted assistant to Professor Yana for seventeen years, when the Professor is revealed to be [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] and proceeds to turn on the Doctor and his companions, Chantho threatens to kill him. He electrocutes her, but she manages to shoot him before dying, forcing him to [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]].

A feature of Chantho's speech is that she starts with &quot;chan&quot; and ends her sentences with &quot;tho&quot;. She considers it &quot;rude&quot; to do otherwise, tantamount to [[profanity|swearing]].

Physical features of the Malmooth include an insectoid exoskeleton and mandibles, and the ability to survive by drinking their own internal milk.

The Eighth Doctor encountered another of the Malmooth during a flashback sequence in IDW's 'Doctor Who: The Forgotten' issue 5.

'''The Master''' is the Doctor's childhood friend, a fellow [[Time Lord]], although they became enemies as adults. He first appeared in [[Terror of the Autons]] in 1971, played originally by [[Roger Delgado]] and various other actors in later serials. He was played most recently by [[John Simm]] from 2007-2010.

===Mayfly===
The '''Mayfly''' is an [[insect]]oid creature seen in the episode &quot;[[Reset (Torchwood)|Reset]]&quot;. It is used by medical research facility The Pharm, run by Professor [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Aaron Copley|Aaron Copley]] as part of a drug that is capable of resetting a human body suffering from normally fatal diseases to a healthy state. However, it eventually kills the host as it reproduces inside the body; at worst, the mayfly kill each other until only one is left. This grows inside the chest until it bursts out, but all human subjects to date have died before they reach that stage. During Torchwood's investigation of The Pharm, [[Martha Jones]] is briefly infested with a mayfly, and is the only person to survive because her travels in the [[TARDIS]] have apparently improved her immune system. [[Owen Harper|Owen]] uses the singularity scalpel to remove the mayfly from her body before it can do so itself. After Ianto and Gwen discover the parent mayflies behind the Pharm, Jack has the entire facility destroyed so that the mayflies can no longer be used, and they are allowed to die in peace.

===The Meddling Monk===
{{Main|The Meddling Monk}}
The '''Meddling Monk''' is a [[Time Lord]] first encountered by the [[First Doctor]] in the 1965 serial [[The Time Meddler]], and later in [[The Daleks' Master Plan]]. In the first story he attempted to manipulate history for his own gains, while in the second he allied briefly with the Daleks in order to defeat the Doctor. Unlike [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] he and the Doctor have no knowledge of each other prior to the first meeting.

He is never directly called a Time Lord, as the term was not introduced until the [[Second Doctor]] serial [[The War Games]], but his description as being from the Doctor's home planet indicates that he is one. As such he is the first instance of a Time Lord other than the Doctor and his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman|Susan]]. His [[TARDIS]] is also the first example of a TARDIS other than the Doctor's.

===Medusoid===
'''Medusoids''' are hairy jellyfish with claws, teeth, and a leg. They are mentioned only in passing by [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in the episode [[Frontier in Space]], who was once captured by them and interrogated via mind probe.

The '''Melkene''', referenced in the novel ''[[Border Princes]]'', are an extinct race of advanced aliens, capable of creating exceptionally lifelike &quot;[[robot|artificials]].&quot; Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains unclear.

During an [[wikt:interplanetary|interplanetary]] war with a rival species, the Melkene created a race of robots called the '''Serial G'''. These robots reach a height of 14&amp;nbsp;feet and possess a devastatingly powerful heat ray. The Serial Gs fought back against their creators when the war was over and wiped them out before going to ground across the galaxy. In ''Border Princes'', Mr. Dine of [[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#&quot;The First Senior&quot;|The First Senior]] attacks and destroys a fully functioning Serial G.

===Men In Black===

'''Men In Black''' are androids that first appeared in the animated [[Tenth Doctor]] serial ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]''. In ''[[The Vault of Secrets]]'', Mister Dread and the Alliance of Shades attempts to incinerate the gang, for they refused to hand over a disc required to enter the Vault of Secrets as well as Androvax, who wanted to revive the last survivors of the Veils. Clyde tricks two Men In Black at one point by jumping away from two incineration blasts both fired at, causing the blasts to destroy each other. The gang were able to get Mister Dread to allow Androvax and his race to leave in their ship without any harm by having him beam them into outer space.

{{Infobox Doctor Who race

The '''Menoptra''' (spelled '''Menoptera''' in the novelisation of the serial) appeared in the [[First Doctor]] story ''[[The Web Planet]]'', by [[Bill Strutton]] (1965). They are an intelligent, bipedal insectoid species from the planet [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]]. In appearance, they resemble a cross between giant [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[bee]]s, with each Menoptra possessing four large wings. They have yellow and black stripes around their bodies and appear to be around six feet tall, but do not seem to have typical insect body parts (such as [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] or an abdomen).

Peaceful and kindly by nature, the Menoptra move in a unique, stylised way and their vocal inflections are stilted. They were very welcoming of the [[First Doctor]], [[Ian Chesterton|Ian]], [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara]], and [[Vicki]]; but showed an animosity towards their fellow insectoids, the [[#Zarbi|Zarbi]], as well as an abhorrence for the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Animus|Animus]], a hostile alien intelligence that had taken over the originally passive Zarbi and almost all of Vortis. Once it was clear that the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] was willing to help them defeat the Animus, they were only too glad to assist in any way they could.

The assumption is that once the Animus was defeated, the Menoptra, Zarbi and the rest of the inhabitants of Vortis were able to live together in peace.

Both stories were written by [[Philip Martin (screenwriter)|Philip Martin]]. Other Mentors include Lord Kiv, their leader. Typical Mentor business practice includes arms dealing and slave trading. In ''Mindwarp'', Lord Kiv has his brain transplanted into a primitive Mentor body, which has retained the tail sting that modern Mentors no longer have.

An unnamed and unseen creature, found on the surface of the planet Midnight, an environment supposedly inimical to all life. Described briefly as a &quot;shadow&quot; glimpsed running across the landscape, it was encountered in Shuttle Bus 50 in &quot;[[Midnight (Doctor Who)|Midnight]]&quot;. It violently boarded and took over the body and mind of Sky Silvestry, repeating the speech patterns of the passengers, influencing them, and then consuming the Doctor's voice. The shuttle's hostess ultimately sacrificed herself by opening a door and sucking them both out of the bus, where Silvestry's body was presumably vaporised by the deadly Xtonic sunlight. Though its hold on the Doctor and the other passengers was broken, the nature and fate of the creature itself remains uncertain. Disturbingly, even the Doctor had no idea what the creature was.

A being that feeds on peoples beliefs. When the Doctor meets it, it is completely taken over by it's instincts. It does not want to feed on people but it has no choice. It makes an entire fake hotel with someone's fear in each room. The Doctor gives this being space to die when he  cuts off the food supply by stopping Amy from trusting him. When the Minotaur feeds, it makes the person worship it and want to be killed by it.

The '''Mona Lisa''' is an alien organism that exists in a mineral that was used in paint supplied by Giuseppe Di Cattivo in the 15th century. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] used the paint for his famous [[Mona Lisa]], and when the picture is brought into proximity with Giuseppe's notorious painting of The Abomination - a painting considered too terrifying to be seen - both the pictures come to life in ''[[Mona Lisa's Revenge]]''. In order to release The Abomination, she forced Clyde to draw a key that she could use to turn the key to reality. The Mona Lisa was successful in doing so, but accidentally transforms a previous drawing of [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] to life as well, who locks The Abomination and return all moving paintings to its original positions.

The '''Movellans''', who made their first and only appearance to date in the [[Fourth Doctor]] serial ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'', originated from outside the galaxy and were adversaries of the [[Dalek]]s.

The Movellans outwardly resemble physically attractive humans, of various ethnicities and both genders. All of the Movellan androids and gynoids wear white, form-fitting uniforms and wear their hair in silver [[braid]]s. Being androids, the Movellans are stronger and have more endurance than normal humans. However, the major weakness of the Movellan design is that each android's external power pack, carried on its belt, can be easily removed to completely shut down the android. The power pack circuitry can also be modified, reprogramming the android to obey human orders.

They are mentioned again in ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]'', as a virus of their invention was central to that story's plot.

===Night Travellers===
The '''Night Travellers''' feature in the episode &quot;[[From Out of the Rain]]&quot;, portrayed as a travelling circus group in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. They were described as only appearing at night, and &quot;out of the rain&quot;. This suggests that some kind of H20 Scoop technology may have been used, but since the Night Travellers were humans, this is unlikely. The Night Travellers stole the breaths of their audiences in order to keep a permanent audience, the people themselves vanishing along with the Night Travellers. However, with the rise of [[film|cinema]] in the 20th Century, travelling circuses diminished, including the Night Travellers. Jack Harkness called them an extinct species. However, the Night Travellers survived on old film reels.

The certain Night Travellers in particular were of the Joshua Joy Travelling Show, led by the creepy [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] called the Ghostmaker, who carried a silver flask with him to store the captured breath of his victims. He was infatuated with Pearl, whom he describes as a living [[mermaid]] due to her deep love and connection with water. The two escape from a film reel played in the Electro Cinema in Cardiff, and begin collecting breaths again to rebuild their lost audience. However, this time, the victims are left alive but severely dehydrated. The Ghostmaker and Pearl decide to bring the other travellers back into the world and continue travelling again. Stealing the film from the workshop of Jonathon Penn, the two go to the Electro Cinema and play the footage, bringing their other companions out - a [[weightlifter]], a pair of clowns, a tattooed man and a pair of jugglers who doubled as firebreathers.

However, unbeknownst to the Night Travellers, Jack and Ianto Jones record all of them onto a new film strip. Ianto stole the Ghostmaker's silver flask and lures him out into the sunlight. Jack exposes the new film strip to sunlight. Exposed to the light, the Night Travellers are all erased from existence. Seconds before his demise, the Ghostmaker opens the silver flask and casts the captured breaths to the air, destroying all but one breath. Despite their defeat, Jack claimed they could return if more footage of them was recorded. This is also hinted in a final scene of the episode in which a father and son buy an old film reel at a car boot sale. The boy drops the reel which opens, a familiar melody of circus music echoing out, which is heard by Jack. The Ghostmaker was portrayed by [[Julian Bleach]] who would go on to play [[Davros]] in the finale of Season 4 of [[Doctor Who]].

===Nightmare Man===

The '''Nightmare Man''' is rather not an alien, but rather a trans-dimensional being who had found a way into Luke's mind in ''[[The Nightmare Man (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Nightmare Man]]''. He then fed off of Luke's fear and became real, trapping Luke in the dimension human minds travel to when they dream. The Nightmare Man begins to integrate within other people's mind, including Clyde and Rani, trapping them as well in separate dreams. However, as fear can only be caused by loneliness in his terms, Luke was able to get Clyde and Rani to imagine a door that led to Luke. There, they tricked The Nightmare Man (after getting his attention for they were together) into trapping himself inside the dimension forever. May be related to the emotion-feeding Pied Piper.

===Nimon===

===Nostrovite===
The '''Nostrovites''' feature in the episode &quot;[[Something Borrowed (Torchwood)|Something Borrowed]]&quot;. Jack describes them as 'carnivorous alien shape-shifters with a taste for human flesh'. Nostrovites hunt in pairs and mate for life. They are most notable for their method of reproduction; after fertilisation, the female passes her eggs to the male, who stores them in a protective pouch in the throat, where they can be passed into a suitable host through a bite. The eggs are incubated within the host until they are ready to hatch; the female then tracks down the host and tears them open to free the offspring. Female Nostrovites are also resilient to injury; one survives being shot with two full clips of bullets, while her mate is killed by only a few shots from Gwen the previous night (Although Owen speculated that she was being driven by maternal rage more than anything else). They only appear to attack living prey: the female does not attack Owen when she realises he is dead. The female adapts to pose as a woman in a black dress, Rhys's mother Brenda and Jack, after only brief encounters with the latter two, suggesting at some slight psychic power (The female also attempted to use Gwen's attraction to Jack to put her off-guard by posing as him). However, they are unable to imitate smells; Gwen recognises Rhys' real mother by her (disgusting) perfume. When they are revealed as Nostrovites, their eyes turn red and their teeth become elongated and grey.

'''Olympians''' (also known as '''Gods''') were a race of tall near-humans from the planet Olympus and one of the most powerful races in the universe. They were responsible for controlling certain parts of the universe and could change certain things at their will. Olympians were immortal and could never die of old age. They could also use powers on a massive scale including controlling the TARDIS by simply emitting electricity at the console and also appear in a gigantic form amongst clouds which they could then unleash massive amounts of power. All Olympians served Zeus although some were known to go on their own will. They were very advanced however some of their methods were primitive. The Olympian Prometheus was the one responsible for starting life in the universe.

The [[Fourth Doctor]] and K9 met them in the story ''The Life Bringer'' which they freed Prometheus and travelled to their home planet.

These [[caterpillar]]-like creatures were once [[#Menoptra|Menoptra]], but they elected to instead burrow under the ground and abandon the world of light and flight above. It is implied that they may have been driven there by the malevolent [[List of Doctor Who villains#Animus|Animus]].

They have larger eyes than their Menoptra brethren, and have no [[wing]]s. However, they have numerous arms and appear to &quot;hop&quot; in a stylised way. They speak with inflection different to that of their [[bee]]-like cousins, but their speech is a strange dialect of the language of the &quot;upper world&quot; and words and phrases they have coined for themselves.

At the story's end, the Animus is defeated and the Optera are persuaded to return to the surface, where they look forward to their children learning the joys of flight; implying that once back on the surface the Optera will redevelop wings. It is assumed that all of species indigenous to [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] are now living peacefully together.

===Osiran===
{{Main|Pyramids of Mars}}

The '''Osirans''' were a powerful alien race who were equal to the [[Time Lord]]s and much of whose history became encoded in [[Egyptian mythology]]. [[Sutekh]], a renegade who became evil, was one of them. He was pursued across the galaxy by his brother [[Horus]] and was finally defeated on Earth by the combined might of 740 Osirans. Sutekh was trapped in a hidden black pyramid in Egypt, held in place by an energy beam transmitted from a pyramid on [[Mars]]. Once the beam was disabled, the Doctor managed to travel back to earth before it released Sutekh and using a control from the TARDIS was able to set the end of the transit tunnel millions of years into the future so when it released Sutekh he was dead.

In issue #1 of the IDW published Doctor Who comic book, a Sycorax is collecting near-extinct species to use with shape-shifters for expensive hunts. The Sycorax race also make a return in the [[Tenth Doctor]] comic strip &quot;The Widow's Curse&quot;, in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' #395.

A race of [[Parasitism|parasitic]] alien [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] feature in the novel ''[[Slow Decay]]''.
The parasite starts its life as an egg which hatches in the body of a living creature and lives in the intestines, feeding on the host's food. At a certain age, or when its host is killed, the parasite turns into a winged creature with two sharp ends. It can impale itself into another creature, lay eggs in the corpse, and leave. A scavenger may devour the corpse, and, unwittingly, the parasite eggs, which would hatch and the life cycle continue. The hosts of the parasite feel extreme hunger, gradually grow slimmer and their weakness makes it possible for them to bring down a fully grown Weevil. Rhys eats one of the eggs, thinking that it is a very effective [[dieting|weight loss]] pill.

The peg dolls are simply small dolls that creep out a young boy (really a Tenza) who can &quot;put&quot; anything he fears in his cupboard, even people. When people are in the dolls house in the cupboard the dolls want to &quot;play&quot;, and do so by chasing them and turning them into dolls by touch. However, when the boy can face his fears, all the people in the cupboard go back to where they were before, even if they were turned into a doll. These include; Amy Pond, Elsie Rossiter and Jim Purcell. (&quot;''[[Night Terrors (Doctor Who)|Night Terrors]]''&quot;)

===Pied Piper===

Based on the mythical piper in the fairytale, the '''Pied Piper''' was an energy entity from the Jeggorabax Cluster, home to beings that feed on emotions. The species' spacecraft resembled meteorites; one such ship crash landed on Earth in the Weserbergland Mountains, [[Lower Saxony]] in 1283. Feeding off the emotion of fear, it assumed the human disguise of [[The Pied Piper]] and stole away all the children of the town of [[Hamelin]], creating fear from parents.

The [[First Doctor]], [[John and Gillian]] first meet the Pied Piper in the comic ''Challenge of the Piper''. This is also the first story to ever feature the Pied Piper in ''Doctor Who''. {{DWspinoff}}

Over the centuries, the creature continued to abduct children and terrify their parents, using many guises including Odd Bob the Clown, who kidnapped children in wartime New York. In the 2009 story ''[[The Day of the Clown]]'', posing as both the ringmaster Elijah Spellman and as Odd Bob, the entity established a museum in [[Ealing]] named Spellman's Magical Museum of the Circus, made possible by the presence of the Weserbergland Meteorite at the Pharos Institute. Because of Sarah Jane's affiliation with Pharos, she broke some of the meteorite and used it to trap the alien in it, after having weakened it by laughing at its clown form instead of fearing it. The meteorite was then sealed in a special emotion-proof container made out of Halconite steel in Sarah Jane's attic.

{{Doctor Who race

In &quot;[[Daleks in Manhattan]]&quot; and &quot;[[Evolution of the Daleks]]&quot; (2007), the [[Cult of Skaro]] experimented on humans and turned them into '''Pig Slaves''' if they possessed a low level of intelligence. Just why the Daleks chose such a form for their slaves is unknown. The Pig Slaves captured subjects for the Dalek experiments, taking them through the sewers of [[Manhattan]] to the basement of the [[Empire State Building]]. Some pigs hid in the Broadway theatre where the [[showgirl]] Tallulah performed. Tallulah later sees her &quot;missing&quot; boyfriend, Laszlo, but does not immediately recognise him because he has been mutated into a half-pig/half-man form. Laszlo still retains most of his memory and personality since he managed to escape from the Daleks before the process could be completed. He leaves a single white rose for Tallulah in her [[dressing room]] each night before her performance and is able to resist the Daleks, unlike the other mutants. True Pig Slaves are extremely aggressive and savage creatures, and according to Laszlo, capable of slitting a throat with their bare teeth. However, they are also vulnerable and have very short lifespans, only surviving a few weeks.

The Torchwood Institute website states that 1930s New York suffered an infestation similar to the [[Weevil (Torchwood)|Weevil]] infestation of Cardiff in the late 2000s, and that it was covered up by rumours of [[sewer crocodile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torchwood.org.uk/html/weevils/images/paper-scrap.jpg |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070419033407re_/www.torchwood.org.uk/html/weevils/images/paper-scrap.jpg| archivedate=7 May 2007| title=1950s Torchwood memo (partial) |accessdate=26 January 2007 |work=BBC -created Torchwood Institute website }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is presumably intended by the website's producers to tie in the New York's Pig Slave infestation of Daleks in Manhattan with the stories of the Torchwood universe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Plasmavores are shape-changing aliens that live on [[haemoglobin]]. They absorb blood from their victims, which in turn changes their own blood chemistry to that of the victim, allowing them to mimic other species when medically scanned.

===Primord===
{{Main|Inferno (Doctor Who)#Primord|l1=Inferno}}
Primords were humans mutated by slime produced as a by-product of Project Inferno. The creatures were never actually called Primords in the story, although they were credited as such. In some circumstances, the infection could be transmitted if a Primord touched a human and heat would cause the transformation to progress at a more rapid pace. Primords were resistant to pistol fire, although they could be injured by repeated rifle fire and killed by sudden drops in temperature or in falls. The degree of intelligence displayed by the Primords was variable; they acted primarily on instinct, but displayed signs of organisation and tactics, especially in the early stages. They made a high-pitched, screeching sound, which the Doctor claimed that he had heard during the eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, suggesting that he had encountered, or at least heard, the creatures before.

The '''Pyroviles''' are a race of aliens which appeared in the episode &quot;[[The Fires of Pompeii]]&quot;. With a stone skin held together by living magma, their shape resembles [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Centurion]]s. One of their ships fell to Earth thousands of years ago, shattering them into dust. The earthquake that caused [[Mount Vesuvius]] to erupt in the year 79 re-awakened them, and they possessed human [[host (biology)|hosts]] in nearby [[Pompeii]]. These hosts helped the few adult Pyroviles who had survived to construct an energy conversion matrix to use lava inside [[Mount Vesuvius]] to conquer Earth and power the conversion of the whole human race into adult Pyroviles in order to replace their homeworld of Pyrovilia, which was &quot;lost&quot;. Throwing water over them is fatal, since it causes their magma to cool. They are also capable of breathing fire; their breath is shown as powerful enough to incinerate a human in seconds. The invading Pyroviles were supposedly destroyed in the AD 79 eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].

In &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot;/&quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, it is revealed that Pyrovilia was among the 27 planets snatched into the Medusa Cascade by the New [[Dalek]] Empire. After their defeat, all the planets were returned to their rightful places with Pyrovilia being returned by Donna Noble who helped defeat the invasion of Earth. With the reappearance of their homeworld, there may be hope for any remaining Pyroviles.

The '''Racnoss''' appeared in the [[Tenth Doctor]] story &quot;[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]&quot; in 2006.

The Racnoss were an ancient race of aliens from the Dark Times of the universe. Half-humanoid, half-arachnid in appearance, they were an invasion force who consumed everything on the planets they conquered. Their race was wiped out by the Fledgeling Empires, including the [[Time Lord]]s, over 4.6&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. Nearly all of the survivors of the race escaped in their ship to where the Earth would later [[Solar nebula#Formation of planets|form]], serving in place of a [[planetesimal]] as its core, hibernating for billions of years, with the exception of their [[List of Doctor Who villains#Empress of the Racnoss|Empress]]. She would later come to Earth in her ship, the Webstar, seeking to use the Huon particles which had been recreated by the [[Torchwood Institute]] as a means of resurrecting her &quot;children&quot; before feasting on the human population of Earth. The last Racnoss were presumed wiped out when the Doctor drained the waters of the Thames down the shaft leading to their ship; the Empress was killed when her own ship was destroyed by the British army at the order of [[Mr. Saxon]].

The Empress appears briefly in a flashback in [[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|&quot;Turn Left&quot;]]. In the parallel universe created by Donna Noble, she has still been defeated, but the Doctor, taking too long to escape without Donna's assistance, was drowned and died with her, the water killing him too quickly for him to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]], causing the Earth to become a [[dystopia]] over the next few years.

Native to [[List of Doctor Who planets#R|Raxacoricofallapatorius]], Raxacoricofallapatorians are grouped by extended family names which are sometimes used to refer to their species generically. They hatch from eggs and are composed of living calcium. Capital punishment is practised on the home world, which involves immersion of convicted criminals in acid that slowly dissolves them while still alive.

The Slitheen family are a ruthless criminal sect motivated by profit. Convicted for their crimes on Raxacoricofallapatorius, they face execution if they return.

The Blathereen family are sworn enemies of the [[Slitheen]], and have infiltrated the prison on the planet Justicia.&lt;ref&gt;BBC BOOK, The Monsters Inside&lt;/ref&gt;

A Raxacoricofallapatorian makes a cameo appearance in an alien bar in ''[[The End of Time]]''.

'''Reapers''' appeared in the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode &quot;[[Father's Day (Doctor Who)|Father's Day]]&quot;, written by [[Paul Cornell]]. Although not named on screen, they were referred to as &quot;Reapers&quot; in the publicity material for the episode. The production team based their design on the [[Grim Reaper]], with their tails shaped like [[scythe]]s.

Reapers are multi-limbed, flying creatures similar to [[pterosaur]]s, with a large wingspan, sharp teeth both in the form of a beak and a secondary mouth in their torsos, coupled with a rapacious attitude. The Reapers are apparently extradimensional, materialising and dematerialising out of the [[spacetime]] vortex. They are attracted to temporal [[physical paradox|paradoxes]] that damage time, like bacteria swarming around a wound. They then proceed to &quot;sterilise&quot; the wound by consuming everyone in sight.The older the thing they devour the more it satifies them.

Once in this dimension, however, they can be blocked by material barriers. The older the barriers, the more effective they are, but even the oldest of barriers cannot stop them forever. Paradoxes can also allow them to directly materialise at the spot of the paradox. If the timeline is restored, they vanish, with their actions reversed as if they had never happened.

In &quot;Father's Day&quot;, the Doctor explained that when the [[Time Lord]]s were still around, there were laws to prevent the spread of paradoxes and that such paradoxes could be repaired. This implies that the Reapers are a natural phenomenon whose manifestation could be prevented if the paradox was resolved quickly. However, with the elimination of the other Time Lords in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], there was no longer any agency that could repair time.
&lt;!-- Speculation commented out until a source to verify this can be found
The Reapers are reminiscent of the [[#Vortisaur|Vortisaur]]s of the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[radio drama|audio plays]], the Hunters of the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[The Pit (Doctor Who)|The Pit]]'' by Neil Penswick, and the depiction of the Chronovores (first featured in ''[[The Time Monster]]'') in Cornell's own novel ''[[No Future]]''.

An unnamed gaseous alien parasite that comes to Earth to feed on [[orgasm]]ic energy in &quot;[[Day One (Torchwood)|Day One]]&quot;. Composed of vorax and ceranium gases, Earth's atmosphere is poisonous to the alien, so it needs to take a human host to survive for prolonged periods. It vies for control with its host, causing physiological changes that will eventually cause the host's internal organs to explode.

The alien also makes its host secrete a blend of ultra-powerful [[pheromone]]s that cause tremendous sexual attraction in those around it for the purposes of feeding. Coupling with the host is fatal, causing the host's partner to disintegrate into a pile of dust at climax and allowing the alien to absorb the energy from the orgasm.

The '''Shalka''' appear to be a [[snake|serpentine]] alien race made of living rock and [[magma]], but they are actually bioplasmic entities, living plasma, their physical appearance merely a &quot;crust&quot; concealing their true forms. They breathe volcanic air and prefer high temperatures, being most comfortable underground where lava meets [[metamorphic rock]]. They communicate through high-pitched screaming, which they can use for a variety of effects, like tunnelling through rock or mentally controlling other life forms. They also use sound as a part of their technology.

In an alternate timeline, the Shalka arrived on Earth via meteorite, initially landing near [[Mount Ruapehu]], New Zealand, subsequently establishing a beachhead for their planned invasion of Earth beneath the [[Lancashire]] town of Lannet. They also created a stable [[wormhole]] for landing their invasion force, which could also be converted into a [[black hole]] to dispose of their enemies, as they tried to do with the [[Shalka Doctor|Doctor]].

As they claimed to have done to billions of planets before, they intended to implant Shalka larvae into key segments of the population, mind controlling them into emitting a scream that would destroy the [[ozone layer]]. In this way, the Shalka intended to raise the surface temperature of the planet to the point where the human race would perish but the Shalka could thrive. The Shalka would then live beneath the surface, with the rest of the universe believing that Earth's inhabitants had died of self-inflicted ecological damage. The Doctor defeated their plans with the help of the British military and a Lannet barmaid named [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Alison Cheney|Alison]].

However, the band of Shansheeth Sarah Jane and former companion [[Jo Grant|Jo Jones]] ([[Katy Manning]]) encounter want to use the companions' memories of the Doctor, in conjunction with their Memory Weave device to create a TARDIS key with which they can steal the TARDIS and prevent death across the timeline.

===&quot;Simon&quot;===
'''&quot;Simon&quot;''' was an alien mentioned on the Torchwood website, specifically in an article attached to, and especially in, Amanda Davies' diary. He was travelling on Earth, seeking to discover the source of life. He wandered into a countryside village and was taken in by the Davies family. Simon, having based his appearance on Jon Bon Jovi, near-instantly seduced the family's daughter - Amanda, and ultimately left her pregnant with an alien baby (which itself quickly developed, and began to degrade her health). Simon then disappeared around the same time as Jack Harkness arrived (implying he had been captured or killed by Torchwood), and later Jack met with Amanda's father and (apparently) made an agreement to have the entire village, including Amanda, subjected to amnesia pills, have all records and evidence that the Davies' existed in the village (including Amanda's diary) confiscated, have the alien baby removed before Amanda died, and then send the Davies family away with a new identity.

===&quot;The First Senior&quot;===
'''The First Senior''' is an organization from an alien planet featured in the novel ''[[Border Princes]]''. Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.

The race that inhabit the planet are described as &quot;shades,&quot; [[Ghost#Terminology|wraith]]-like [[Shade (mythology)|shadows]] covered in [[Spine (botany)|thorns]]. This is their true form but they are able to take on any shape they desire. When taking on a different form, they don't just change appearance, but physically change into the object they are copying. However, when not inhabiting their true form, they lose many of the advantages that stem from it including [[Transparency (optics)|near invisibility]] and extreme speed. They do however retain superior strength and an excellent fighting ability. This is evident by the fact a shade can take on a fully functional [[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Melkene|Serial G]] unit, and crush [[List of Torchwood items#A|The Amok]] with its bare hands.

Despite being [[gas]]eous, they have [[Sentience#Artificial intelligence|sentient]] [[robot]]ic brains capable of [[uploading and downloading]] information from a central [[Server (computing)|server]] on their planet and performing complex calculations.

Similar to [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood Three]], The First Senior monitor the [[Rift (Whoniverse)|Rift]], at another of its anchor points on their planet. However, their organization is a lot more advanced than Torchwood; on their home planet, they have an entire [[royal family]] dedicated to guarding the Rift (the Border to them), led by the &quot;Border Prince.&quot;

When The First Senior discovered the existence of Torchwood, out of curiosity, they sent in an agent known as The Principal. The Principal took the guise of a human, [[List of Torchwood minor characters#&quot;James Mayer&quot;|James Mayer]], who inserted himself into Torchwood by implanting himself into the team's [[Memory|memories]], making them believe he had always been a member. The First Senior then erased The Principal's own memories so that he couldn't inadvertently reveal his true identity.

Also inserted onto Earth was a protector for The Principal, Mr Dine. Mr Dine made sure The Principal didn't come to any harm and that The Principal was efficiently recalled when his time with Torchwood was over. When The Principal is to be recalled, he regains his memory, through a computer signal, and all memories of him are removed from people he has interacted with, through the removal of a 100&amp;nbsp;mile wide memory-creation radius.

The Skith are ice-based, telepathic aliens. They see themselves as explorers and seekers of knowledge, but their methodology is to pull information from the minds of others. They appear as humanoid figures made of blue ice, except the Skith Leader, who is a larger figure made of red ice, and the Mindcore, which transmits telepathic information to and from the Worldmind on their homeworld, and resembles a giant, tentacled head, made out of blue ice. Those infected by Skith telepathic ice gradually become Skith-like drones themselves.

They first appeared in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip &quot;The First&quot; (#s 385â389), where they are based at the South Pole, and intercept the [[Ernest Shackleton]] expedition, before being stopped by the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones. In the story &quot;Age of Ice&quot; (#s 408â410), the surviving Skith Leader reappears in present-day Australia, when he believes his people have come to rescue him. However, in the time that has passed since &quot;The First&quot;, the Skith philosophy has changed, and they are now initialising a fullscale invasion. Based on the information absorbed from the Doctor's mind in the earlier story, they have constructed a duplicate TARDIS.

In &quot;The Crimson Hand&quot; (#s 416â420), it is revealed that the first action of the Hand was to destroy the Skith Throneworld.

The Slitheen are able to wear a human's skin as a disguise, using a compression field to shrink themselves. As they are mostly made of calcium and, they are vulnerable to [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]]).

The Slitheen have appeared in the ''Doctor Who'' episodes ''[[Aliens of London]]'', ''[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]'' and ''[[Boom Town]]'' and the interactive episode, ''[[Attack of the Graske]]''.

The Star Whale is a giant whale like creature, presumed to be the last of its kind, used to pilot the Starship UK, so as to save its citizens from the dangerous solar flares. The whale has the features of other animals such as an anglerfish's angler, an octopus' tentacles and a scorpions' tail. It arrived on Earth as it heard the children of the United Kingdom crying, and was unable to bear the sound. Believing its arrival to be a one-in-a-million miracle, the people of Britain captured it and built their ship around it, torturing it in order to keep the ship flying. Over the years, they realised that they could not justify keeping the creature in agony, but feared that if they set it free, the ship and all those aboard would be destroyed, so they chose to forget, and fed those who protested to the beast. When the Doctor learnt of this, he decided to render the creature brain-dead, ending its suffering and saving the lives of all those on the ship, but [[Amy Pond|Amy]] set it free, revealing that the whale had volunteered to help, and that contrary to the beliefs of the station's masters, that it would continue flying without the need to torture it.

{{See also|The Christmas Invasion}}
The '''Sycorax''' first appeared in the debut [[Tenth Doctor]] story &quot;[[The Christmas Invasion]]&quot; in 2005.

The Sycorax appear to be skinless humanoids wearing mantles of bone, usually keeping their features concealed under helmets. They are proficient in the use of weapons like swords and whips, the latter which can deliver an energy discharge that disintegrates the flesh of its target. Their language is called Sycoraxic. The Sycorax also appear to have technology that is either disguised or treated as magic, referring to &quot;curses&quot; and the Doctor's regenerative abilities as &quot;witchcraft&quot;. The Sycorax leader referred to an &quot;armada&quot; that they could use to take Earth by force if their blood control plan failed. They also appear to have a martial society, with traditions of honourable combat, yet they have no qualms about killing prisoners. According to the BBC website, the Sycorax facial structure was inspired by the skull of a horse.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

According to a write-up by [[Russell T Davies]] on the BBC website{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}, the Sycorax originated on an asteroid in the distant JX82 system, known as the Fire Trap. They were [[Biological uplift|uplifted]] when a spaceship crashed on their asteroid and the Sycorax Leader enslaved the survivors, forcing the aliens to teach them about their technology. The asteroid was then retrofitted into the first of many spaceships, which the Sycorax then used to raid other planets, becoming feared interstellar scavengers. This reputation is made clear in their attitude to other 'inferior' races. The Sycorax leader comments to Rose that he would not 'dirty his tongue' with her language, and their translated word for 'human' can also be taken to mean 'cattle'. Their armada is permanently in orbit around the Jewel of Staa Crafell.

In ''The Doctor Who Files'' books, the name of the Sycorax homeworld is given as &quot;Sycorax&quot;. It is unclear if this is another name for the Fire Trap. Furthermore, after the destruction of the Fire Trap, the Sycorax spread further through the galaxy, and like humans are one of three species that continually survive and adapt, even unto the End of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Starships And Spacestations 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The name [[Sycorax]] is used in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''. Shakespeare's Sycorax has died before the play begins; she is described as a witch who was the mother of the beast [[Caliban]]. The Shakespearean name is referenced in the third series episode &quot;[[The Shakespeare Code]]&quot; when the Doctor finds a horse's skull in The Globe's prop cupboard. He comments that it &quot;Reminds [him] too much of the Sycorax&quot;. Shakespeare remarks he likes the sound of the word, obviously then going on to use it in ''[[The Tempest]]''.

The [[Sycorax]] also make a brief appearance in the [[11th Doctor]] episode [[The Pandorica Opens]] as one of the races in the alliance formed to trap the Doctor.

The '''Terileptils''' appeared in the [[Fifth Doctor]] serial ''[[The Visitation (Doctor Who)|The Visitation]]'' by [[Eric Saward]]. They are a [[reptilian humanoid]] species, they cannot survive long without breathing soliton gas, which is highly combustible when combined with oxygen. As an advanced society, they enjoy a heightened appreciation of both aesthetics and warfare, and have been known to employ bejewelled [[android (robot)|androids]]. Criminal punishment in Terileptil society includes life imprisonment working in tinclavic mines on the planet Raaga, often with sub-standard medical care.

In 1666, a group of Terileptil prison escapees hidden near London attempted to use a genetically enhanced version of the [[Black Plague]] to destroy humanity. The destruction of their lab in Pudding Lane, with help from the Doctor, causes the [[Great Fire of London]].

The Terileptils destroyed the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] which did not appear again until the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who TV Movie]].

According to the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''The Dark Path'' by [[David A. McIntee]], by the 34th century, their homeworld Terileptus is a member of the Galactic Federation, and a noted builder of starships. A Terileptil also appears as the chief engineer on a Federation starship. The planet is destroyed during the events described in the novel.

===Teselecta===
The '''Teselecta''', first shown in &quot;[[Let's Kill Hitler]]&quot;, is a robot-like machine with the ability to change its appearance. It is commanded by humans, however smaller robots referred to as antibodies patrol its interior and incinerate intruders. The Teselecta are sent through time by an organization called &quot;The Justice Department&quot; with the intent to remove people from their established time stream to enforce punishment on them, though it does this only shortly before their end. This is regarded as a responsibility that comes with the capability of time travel. The Teselecta is not bigger on the inside, instead its crew are actually shrunk by means of a miniaturization ray and a compression field. They have access to numerous files on important people. In &quot;Let's Kill Hitler&quot;, Amy and Rory are trapped within a Teselecta and chased by its robotic &quot;immune system&quot;, the antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/dw/news/bulletin_110817_01/Lets_Kill_Hitler BBC - Doctor Who - Let's Kill Hitler - News &amp; Features]&lt;/ref&gt; Wrist-bands worn by the crew stop the robots attacking them, and anybody not wearing this band is incinerated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Later in the episode the crew of the Teselecta are evacuated by what appears to be a trans-mat-beam. The Teselecta reappears in the Series 6 Finale &quot;[[The Wedding of River Song]]&quot;. The Doctor is supposed to be killed in Lake Silenco, Utah,  so he hides with his [[TARDIS]] inside the robot which takes his form, making it appear he is killed. To the extent of how much the Teselecta imitates a lifeform, it expelled light similar to regeneration energy when faking the Doctor trying to save himself.

The '''Tetraps''' are a [[bat]]-like race from the planet Tetrapyriarbus. A pack of Tetraps was employed by [[Rani (Doctor Who)|the Rani]] to help defend her [[List of Doctor Who items#G|Giant Brain]] in the [[Seventh Doctor]]'s debut story, ''[[Time and the Rani]]'' (1987) by [[Pip and Jane Baker]]. The Rani armed a pack of Tetraps for this purpose and used them as general henchmen to terrorise the native Lakertyans.

Tetraps have four eyes, one on each side of their head, giving them all-round vision, and put this to good use in stalking fugitives. Like bats, they sleep by hanging upside-down in a cavern. They feed off a dark red-coloured sludge that the Lakertyan leader releases down a chute into a trough.

Tetraps possess limited intelligence, but they soon realise that the Rani's plans would have them all killed on [[List of Doctor Who planets#L|Lakertya]]. This is confirmed when their leader, Urak, hears of her plans and she later leaves him to guard over her laboratory rather than take him with her in her [[TARDIS]], thus condemning him to death. Urak and the enraged Tetraps capture the Rani in her ship and take her back to their home planet, to force her to help solve their natural resource shortages.

They look exactly like humans, although [[Third Doctor|the Third Doctor]] appears to recognize their race specifically in [[Planet of the Daleks]]. Although they were once a warlike society, a nuclear war with the Daleks which nearly wiped out life on the Skaro caused them to develop a totally nonviolent agrarian society.

===The Abomination===

Mentioned in ''[[Mona Lisa's Revenge]]'', '''The Abomination''' is a fifteenth-century painting by Giuseppe Di Cattivo. The painting was considered too terrifying to be seen. The paint used contained a mineral that hosted an alien organism. Once in close proximity to the [[Mona Lisa]] (painted with the same mineral paint), the Abomination and Mona Lisa came to life. The painting of the Abomination was stored in a vault that required a complex puzzle key to open it. When Mona Lisa came to life, she sought the key to release the Abomination.

===The Berserker===

'''The Berserkers''' were a cult of aliens that used pendants that give the wearer psychic powers, so that others are compelled to obey them. In the episode ''[[The Mark of the Berserker]]'', one such pendant was found at Park Vale School, by a boy, Jacob. He used the pendant but discarded it, fearing its power and the mysterious tattoos it produces on the wearer. Rani picked it up, and then put it in Sarah Jane's attic. When Clyde invited his estranged father, Paul Langer, to see the alien artefacts stored in the attic, his father stole the pendant. He used it to make Clyde forget about his mother and friends, calling Clyde his soldier. Clyde's father was possessed until Clyde threw the pendant into the sea and destroyed its power.

===The Dark===
Allies of The Blue Beast, [[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Pwccm|Pwccm]], '''The Dark''' are beings made of pure [[darkness]] that feature in the novel ''[[The Twilight Streets]]''. Normally these beings would have been defeated and sent back to the Rift by [[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Abaddon|Abaddon]], but Jack's defeat of Abaddon allowed the Dark free rein. As the team investigated the situation, the Dark showed them glimpses of an alternate future where the Dark corrupted Toshiko, Owen and Gwen, driving them to capture Jack and use his immortality as a means of controlling the Rift, thus gaining access to advanced technology and turning Torchwood into a world-spanning empire. It is only thanks to Ianto's sacrifice that Jack is able to draw the Dark out of his friends by engaging the Rift Manipulator, although he, Tosh and Owen die in the process. With the knowledge of this future driving them, the team are thus convinced to work with [[List of Torchwood minor characters#Bilis Manger|Bilis Manger]] by channelling the Dark into a box and subsequently sending them back into the Rift. Like all ''Torchwood'' spin-off media, its [[canon (fiction)|canonicity]] in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.

===The Dead===

'''The Dead''' are an alien species appearing in the episode [[Lost Souls (Torchwood)|Lost Souls]], broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] to celebrate the switching on of the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. In the episode The Dead managed to enter our universe during a test run of the machine, and fed off the [[neutrons]] of the humans it came in contact with. It had psychic abilities to persuade humans that it was deceased friends of people it came in contact with, which it used on Dr Harrington and Ianto Jones. It was destroyed when Torchwood, working with Martha Jones and the staff at [[CERN]], fired an anti-proton beam into the Large Hadron Collider.

===The Family of Blood===
{{Main|Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|The Family of Blood|l1=Human Nature}}
The Family of Blood was an alien race that feasted on [[Time Lord]]s to prolong their own lifespan and increase their powers. Shortly before World War I, a &quot;family&quot; of them came to Easton Boy's School, where they took over people's bodies in order to get to the Doctor. They used animated scarecrows for henchman and to find bodies for the family in order to take them over. When they located the Doctor (who had converted his biology from Time Lord to human, they sent an army of scarecrows to hunt him. The Doctor eventually resumed his Time Lord form and imprisoned all of the family's members.

A nickname given by the Tenth Doctor to the aquatic infection found in the water found in Mars' ice caps. When the Flood infect a human, the host's irises fade to white, his teeth blacken and cracks form all around his mouth. The resulting zombie-like creature then seeks to infect everyone around it with the water that they can shoot from any part of their body. The Mars base Bowie Base One fell under the Flood.  The Flood are presumably destroyed when Bowie Base One detonates its nuclear self-destruct, blowing up the base and the glacier the Flood were trapped in.

Unknown which planet these creatures are based from, although they can be converted from any humanoid species. They wear cloaks with hoods draped over where their head should be, giving the impression that they still have a head. Under the hood, the skin is tied into a tight knot where the head has been cut away, however most outsiders are unaware of this because, unless under very special circumstances, one incurs a penalty of death if they ever see under the hood. The monks are endowed with the ability to throw lightning from their hands.

===The Swarm===
{{Main|Planet of the Dead}}

Also know by the Unified Intelligence Task-Force (U.N.I.T) as Stingrays, they are flying [[manta ray]]-like creatures, with metal exoskeletons that allow them to travel from planet to planet via wormholes. They consume everything on a planet, turning it into desert; and then swarm over the planet's surface, generating a wormhole which allows them to travel to the next planet.

The Stingrays are apparently arthropods, as they are exothermic, and possess an exoskeleton composed of metal that has been ingested then exuded to the exoskeleton. They are voracious feeders, eating both organic and inorganic materials ranging from flesh and bone to plant matter to metals and plastic. They also produce vast numbers of young and grow from birth to adult in under a year, as shown when the doctor shows a year-old clip of San Helios before its Stingray infestation.

They travel to other planets through wormholes created in the fabric of Spacetime by circling a planet faster and faster, and as each swarm can contain billions of giant stingrays, they rip a hole in space. Their wormholes can transport the whole swarm an infinite distance through space.

===The Trickster's Brigade===
'''The Trickster's Brigade''' serve the recurring ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' villain, [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures creatures and aliens#The Trickster|The Trickster]]. They, which takes shape of many lifeforms such as a beetle, also feed on chaos in time as the Trickster does. In &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot;, a [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Time Beetle|Time Beetle]], a member of ''The Trickster's Brigade'', attaches itself onto the back of companion [[Donna Noble]], altering time to where she never met the Doctor in &quot;[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]&quot;, leading to his death. This causes the deaths of to-be-companion [[Martha Jones]] as well as ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' characters [[Sarah Jane Smith]], [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]], [[Maria Jackson]], and [[Clyde Langer]] (&quot;[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]&quot;) who attempted to restore the Royal Hope Hospital back to its location and halt the plans of the [[Judoon]]. London is destroyed after the fall of the ''Titanic'' (&quot;[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]&quot;) and no help is offered from America due to the Adipose crisis (&quot;[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]&quot;). [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood Three]] sacrifices themselves to save planet Earth from the [[Sontaran]]s (&quot;[[The Poison Sky]]&quot;) to keep the air unpoisoned. The alternate Donna, with help from Rose Tyler and UNIT is able to foil the brigade's plans before [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|reality is destroyed by Davros]] by traveling back in time and sacrificing herself to set history right.

In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode &quot;[[Immortal Sins]]&quot;, [[Jack Harkness]] and [[List of Torchwood characters#Angelo Colasanto|Angelo Colasanto]] discovers that ''The Trickster's Brigade'' plans to cause the victory of [[Nazi Germany]] by assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] by use of a [[List of Torchwood creatures and aliens#Brain Parasite|brain parasite]].

===The Trickster===

'''The Trickster''' is a being beyond the universe which seeks to manifest itself through causing chaos. It can interfere in deaths, by making deceptive deals to prolong life at a price. It can only exist within the universe for brief periods, without physical form, sometimes in a mirror or other reflective surface. It is a member of the Pantheon of Discord. Played by [[Paul Marc Davis]], the Trickster is a recurring nemesis in ''The Sarah Jane Adventures''. Though the character does not directly appear in the series' related programmes (parent show ''Doctor Who'' and adult sister show ''[[Torchwood]]''), the Trickster's attempts to change history have nevertheless been depicted.

In ''[[Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane?]]'', in order to create chaos of sufficient magnitude, the Trickster removed Sarah Jane from history so that an asteroid that only she could have stopped would hit the Earth. The Trickster altered an incident in Sarah Jane's childhood in 1964 that originally led to the death of her best friend Andrea. The Trickster switched the places of the two girls after gaining Andrea's consent, creating a timeline in which Sarah Jane died at age 13. Preferring a meaningless destruction of Earth rather than for profit or military conquest, the Trickster also influenced the various alien threats Sarah Jane had faced on Earth to stay away from the planet, creating a peaceful timeline up until the impending asteroid strike. Keeping Sarah Jane in [[Limbo]], it further planned to use her to find and remove the Doctor from history, which would create a timeline of diabolical chaos, wherein the many tragedies the Doctor averted would have instead proceeded.

The [[List of creatures and aliens in Doctor Who#Time Beetle|Time Beetle]] that consumed time energy by changing an individual's personal timeline in the ''Doctor Who'' episode &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot; was described as part of &quot;[[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#The Trickster's Brigade|the Trickster's Brigade]]&quot;. Its alteration of [[Donna Noble]]'s history led to the Doctor's death, resulting in a timeline similar to that planned by the Trickster. The alternate timeline included the off-camera deaths of [[Sarah Jane Smith|Sarah Jane]], [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]], [[Clyde Langer|Clyde]], [[Rani Chandra (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Rani]] and [[Maria Jackson|Maria]] - as well as the Doctor's would-be companion, [[Martha Jones]] - in the events otherwise depicted in &quot;[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]&quot;. This plot is foiled by the alternate Donna with help from [[Rose Tyler]] and UNIT who create a time machine to send her back in time and set things right.  The alternate Donna is forced to sacrifice herself to do so, but recalls the timeline after history is restored.

In ''[[The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith]]'', the Trickster returned with the [[Graske]]. It manifested in 1951 after Sarah Jane saved her parents' lives. By 2008 it had completely devastated the planet and enslaved the human population, and was working on conquering other planets. Sarah Jane returned to the point of his manifestation in an attempt to stop him, but could not think of a suitable method. Her parents willingly drive off in their car, leading to their death, causing the Trickster to vanish and the original time to be restored. The Trickster materialised through the Abbott's Gate at the old monastery in Sarah Jane's home village of Foxgrove. This entry point was razed for the construction of an [[Great Britain road numbering scheme#A roads|A road]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Mr Smith states the history of Foxgrove to Sarah Jane at her request in ''[[The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trickster returned in ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]'', having made a deal with lawyer Peter Dalton after an accident at home, granting Dalton his life and the love he never had, Sarah Jane Smith. Sarah Jane fell in love with Dalton, and agreed to marry him, but the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor]]. The Trickster took the hotel out of time, trapping Sarah Jane and Peter in one second while the Doctor, K9, Luke, Clyde and Rani were trapped in another. Realising that the Trickster intended for Sarah's marriage to end her life of defending the Earth, Sarah Jane convinced Peter that he must break the deal, sacrificing himself so that Sarah Jane could continue to save the world. The Trickster made reference to the Tenth Doctor's future [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] and added that the Doctor's first meeting with the Pantheon of Discord had sent ripples back through time. The Trickster was revealed to be vulnerable to artron energy, the power source of the [[TARDIS]]; Clyde became charged with artron energy when he came in contact with the TARDIS while it was attempting to penetrate the Trickster's time rift. He was able to use the energy to harm the Trickster, draining its energy long enough for the Doctor to penetrate the Trickster's temporal trap.

The Trickster is briefly referenced in the ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' episode &quot;[[Immortal Sins]]&quot;. In the episode, [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] and his boyfriend/companion [[List of Torchwood characters#Angelo Colasanto|Angelo]] intercept and destroy an alien parasite that the Trickster's brigade had planned to use to infect U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and create an alternate timeline where [[Nazi Germany]] won [[World War II]].

The '''Time Beetle'''&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode accompanying &quot;Turn Left&quot;, [[Russell T Davies]] stated that the production team refer to it as the Time Beetle.&lt;/ref&gt; is a member of the ''Trickster's Brigade'', a group of aliens that serve the [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures monsters and aliens#The Trickster|Trickster]]. The Time Beetle, similar to the Trickster himself, feeds on time energy and can cause a victim to change a decision they made in the past, thereby altering history. The change in history is usually very minor, affecting only the person the beetle attaches to, and the universe usually &quot;compensates&quot; for the discrepancy.

When the beetle attaches to Donna in &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot;, it prevents her from ever meeting the Doctor, resulting in disaster for Earth. The Doctor, Martha Jones, Sarah Jane Smith, and Torchwood staff [[Ianto Jones]] and [[Gwen Cooper]] were all killed, the city of London was completely destroyed when the ''Titanic'' crashed into Buckingham Palace, Captain [[Jack Harkness]] was taken to the Sontaran homeworld, and millions of people died from threats the Doctor would have otherwise prevented. If the alternative future had continued, [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|reality would have been destroyed by Davros]].  In the alternate timeline, the beetle was attached to the back of the alternate Donna Noble who traveled back in time and set history right.  Afterwards, the beetle dies when Donna is restored to the correct timeline.

In an accompanying &quot;Monster Files&quot; episode, Captain Jack raised doubts over whether the whole of the Trickster's Brigade consists of beetles, suggesting all individuals are of different species.

In the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode &quot;[[Immortal Sins]]&quot;, the ''Trickster's Brigade'' is mentioned as they attempt to cause the victory of [[Nazi Germany]] by assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] through a parasite.

===Time Lord===

{{Main|Time Lord}}
{{See also|Doctor (Doctor Who)}}
The '''Time Lords''' are a race of humanoid aliens to which [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]], among other characters, belongs. Time Lords have the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] when mortally wounded. This process creates for them an entirely new body and results in major changes in personality, but retains the Time Lord's memories and identity. It is suggested in [[The Power of the Daleks]] that some detectable feature is retained, as the [[Dalek|Daleks]] are immediately able to recognize the [[Second Doctor]], even though he has just regenerated. Supposedly this regeneration can occur 12 times, resulting in 13 total incarnations, but this has been circumvented in some cases, potentially leading to infinite regenerations. It is unknown if any other limitations exist, such as a maximum lifespan between regenerations, although it seems likely that this is the case as extended periods of time do produce natural physical changes in Time Lords.

Time Lords exhibit various other superhuman abilities, including certain [[Time Lord#Mental powers|mental powers]], and resistance to otherwise harmful effects such as extreme cold and radiation. They possess a binary vascular system (two hearts), and therefore a faster heart rate, as well as a cooler internal body temperature.

The first Time Lord to appear other than The Doctor and his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] is [[The Meddling Monk]], in the 1965 serial [[The Time Meddler]], but the term itself is not used until [[The War Games]], when the race as a whole is introduced.

As of the 2005 revival series, the Time Lords are essentially extinct, apart from The Doctor, as they have been destroyed by him during [[Time War (Doctor Who)|the Time War]].

It has actually no meaning in that language.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are the last remnants of humanity from the year 100&amp;nbsp;trillion. Originally intending to travel to [[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]], the last refuge of a dying universe, they find nothing but &quot;the dark and the cold&quot; of space. Losing the last shred of hope they had, they turned on themselves, cannibalising their own bodies to create a new cyborg race. As part of this process they regress into little more than children with [[group mind (science fiction)|shared memories]]. The name Toclafane is given to them by [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], who takes it from the Gallifreyan equivalent of the [[bogeyman]].

The Toclafane's cyborg forms possess energy devices capable of killing and disintegrating targets. They are equipped with numerous retractable blades. The first four to be seen also exhibit apparent teleportation or cloaking abilities, not displayed by others of their race. All that remains of their bodies are barely recognisable human faces wired into basketball-sized mechanical spheres.

In &quot;[[The Sound of Drums]]&quot;/&quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot;, the Master rescues four Toclafane from the end of the universe prior to an eventual [[Big Freeze]], using them to fake a first contact situation in order to draw the world's leaders into one place for easy capture. He then uses a &quot;[[List of Doctor Who items#P|paradox machine]]&quot; to allow the future of the human race to slaughter many in the present, in short bringing the six billion humans that are alive in the year 100&amp;nbsp;trillion to return in the form of the Toclafane. The paradox machine creates a temporal paradox, allowing them to kill their ancestors without damaging themselves, and thus establish the Master's rule over Earth. After subduing Earth, the Master aims to establish a new [[Time Lord]] empire with himself as the leader and the Toclafane as his people and ground troops. This plan is foiled when the paradox machine is destroyed, causing time to rewind and trapping the Toclafane back at the end of the universe.

The Toclafane feature on the cover of the [[New Series Adventures]] novel, ''[[The Story of Martha]]'', which chronicles Martha's adventures during [[Last of the Time Lords|The Year That Never Was]].

'''Travist Polong''' is an orange, metre-long, five-eyed [[slug]]/[[slater]]-like alien. Sarah Jane attempted to catch it at a hospital at Tarminster in ''[[The Mark of the Berserker]]'', but left to deal with a Berserker.

Travist Polong was later delivered to Sarah Jane in ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]'' after she saw it on eBay in its dormant stage. Rani and Clyde took it inside Rani's house, but it escaped. They chased it to 13 Bannerman Road, where they caught it in a garbage can. Sarah Jane directed Rani to order Mr Smith to teleport it to Polongus, its home planet. Sarah Jane described Travist Polong as &quot;not evil, just trouble&quot;.

Humanoid fly creatures, they trade with other civilisations for their excrement. They communicate with clicks that the TARDIS didn't translate because it was not on the same planet as The Doctor and Lady Christina de Souza. The Doctor speaks with them through their own language while they understand The Doctor through a one-way telepathic translating communication device.

===Usurian===
{{Main|The Sun Makers}}

The '''Usurians''' from the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#U|Usurius]] are a species that abandoned military conquest in favour of economic conquest. They enslaved humanity after their engineers made [[List of Doctor Who planets#M|Mars]] suitable for human habitation, humans having depleted the [[List of Doctor Who planets#E|Earth's]] resources. Once humanity had depleted Mars's resources as well, the Usurians engineered [[List of Doctor Who planets#P|Pluto]] so that humans could inhabit it. They created six artificial &quot;Suns&quot; around it and installed [[List of Doctor Who villains#The Collector|the Collector]] to oversee the collection of taxes from their human workforce. They intended to abandon Pluto and leave humanity to become extinct once the humans had exhausted its resources, there being no economically viable planet to relocate humanity to once more. The humans on Pluto revolted against the Collector and seized control of Pluto. The revolutionaries intended to relocate to Earth as the [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]] assured them it would have regenerated in their absence.

The Usurians have knowledge of the [[Time Lords]], graded as &quot;Grade 3&quot; in their &quot;latest market survey&quot;, considering [[Gallifrey]] to be of low commercial value. Usurians can adopt a [[humanoid]] form but in their natural state they resemble [[seaweed]]. Shock can force them to revert to their natural form. According to the Doctor, Usurians are listed in a &quot;flora and fauna&quot; of the universe written by a Professor Thripthead under poisonous fungi.

===Uvodni===

The '''Uvodni''' is a bug-like race, first introduced in ''[[Warriors of Kudlak]]''. [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#General Kudlak|General Kudlak]] served in his race's military until injuries forced him to retire. In order to gain more troops for his race's continuing war effort, Kudlak was dispatched to Earth. He seized control of the Combat 3000 laser game franchise, which he secretly used to find human children with strong combat skills. These children were teleported to Kudlak's orbiting spaceship and dispatched to fight in his race's war. Kudlak took orders from a battle computer that used the image of a female of his race as an avatar, which he referred to as &quot;Mistress&quot;. An error left the computer unable to comprehend the concept of the war ending, so it withheld from Kudlak an announcement of peace from his emperor for over a decade. When this fact was revealed, by intervention of Luke Smith's computer hacking, Kudlak destroyed the computer. He then dedicated his life to finding and returning the already dispatched human children, hoping to gain inner peace by doing so.

===Vampire===
A number of different types of vampire have appeared in televised Doctor Who:
* In the fourth episode of the 1965 [[First Doctor]] serial ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'', [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], [[Ian Chesterton]], [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] and [[Vicki]] encounter [[Count Dracula]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster]], who make short work of a pursuing party of [[Dalek]]s. The Doctor speculates that the monsters and the haunted mansion that they inhabit are the products of [[nightmare]]s created from the human [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. As the [[TARDIS]] and the Daleks' time capsule leave, it is revealed that the monsters are in fact funfair robots.
* The [[Fourth Doctor]] encounters [[vampire]]s whilst travelling in E-Space in the 1980 serial ''[[State of Decay]]''. The Doctor, [[Romana]], [[Adric]] and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] encounter three vampires, Aukon, Camilla and Zargo. It is revealed that the three are servants of the giant King Vampire, a member of the Great Vampires who once fought a great war against the [[Time Lord]]s but were eventually defeated. By escaping to E-Space, the King Vampire was the sole surviving member of its race. The Doctor defeats the King Vampire by launching the lesser vampires' tower â actually the command module of the ship piloted by the originally human trio â and using it as a stake to pierce the giant vampire's heart. The three servant vampires perish along with their king.
* The [[Eleventh Doctor]], [[Rory Williams]] and [[Amy Pond]] encountered vampiric, lobster-like aliens in 16th century [[Venice]] in &quot;[[The Vampires of Venice]]&quot;. They were able to breathe underwater and had vampire-like qualities such as a vulnerability to sunlight, no reflections and a thirst for [human blood]. Their leader, Signora [[List of Doctor Who villains#Signora Rosanna Calvierri|Rosanna Calvierri]], has a perception filter that allows herself and her family to take humanoid forms, except for her brood which lived under the river. They planned to flood Venice in an attempt to continue their civilisation since their own planet Saturnyne was destroyed by [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Cracks in the universe|cracks]]. When the Doctor foiled their plan, Rosanna committed suicide by allowing her brood to [[Cannibalism|devour]] her.

Vampires have also appeared in Doctor Who stories in other media. Vampires related to the Great Vampires seen in ''State of Decay'' are featured prominently in the Virgin New Adventures novel ''[[Blood Harvest]]'', the Missing Adventure ''[[Goth Opera]]'', the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel ''[[Vampire Science]]'', and the Big Finish Productions audio dramas ''[[Project: Twilight]]'' and ''[[Project: Lazarus]]''. The Eighth Doctor Adventure ''[[The Eight Doctors]]'' also features them in a flashback to ''State of Decay''; in addition, the war between the vampires and the Time Lords is a significant plot element in the New Adventure ''[[Damaged Goods (Doctor Who novel)|Damaged Goods]]''. Other vampires or vampire-like creatures have been featured in the Missing Adventure ''[[Managra]]'', the audio drama ''[[UNIT: Snake Head]]'', the BBCi webcast ''[[Death Comes to Time]]'', the short story ''The Feast of the Stone'' (featuring [[Shalka Doctor|an alternate Ninth Doctor]]), the ''[[Bernice Summerfield]]'' anthology ''[[The Vampire Curse]]'', and the ''[[Torchwood]]'' website.

===Varga plant===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Varga Plants
|type=Animal/plant hybrid
|affiliation=[[Dalek]]s
|planet=Skaro
|start=&quot;[[Mission to the Unknown]]&quot;
}}
The '''Varga plants''' (sometimes '''Vaarga''') appeared in the [[First Doctor]] episode &quot;[[Mission to the Unknown]]&quot; and the serial ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which were essentially a prologue and main epic respectively. They were created by [[Terry Nation]].

Varga Plants grew naturally on the Daleks' homeworld, [[Skaro]], and when the Daleks set up a base on the planet Kembel they brought some Varga plants with them to act as sentries in the jungle surrounding their base. They were suited to this as they could move around freely by dragging themselves along with their roots.

Varga plants resemble [[Cactus|cacti]]; they are covered in fur and thorns. Anyone pricked by a Varga thorn will be consumed by the urge to kill, while simultaneously becoming a Varga plant themself. This grisly fate befell astronauts Jeff Garvey and Gordon Lowery, and their commander, Marc Cory, was forced to kill them.

The plants later made an appearance in the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio ''[[I, Davros: Purity]]''. In this, it was revealed that the Varga plants were one of the oldest species on Skaro, but for most of their history had been immobile. Since the start of the Kaled-Thal war however, exposure to radiation and chemical weapons had caused them to rapidly evolve into a much deadlier form, capable of self-locomotion. It was this discovery that caused [[Davros]] to become interested in genetically engineering creatures in order to create weapons of war. In ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Dalek Empire II: Dalek War|Dalek Empire II: Dalek War]]'', they were found on a terraformed Jupiter where they infected earth troops. They appeared in ''[[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games|City of the Daleks]]'' where after the Time War they infested the ruined Dalek city of Kaalann on Skaro but here their appearance was much different.

===Vashta Nerada===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Vashta Nerada
|type=Carnivorous swarm
|affiliation=Unknown
|planet= Practically universal
|start=&quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot;
}}
{{Main|Silence in the Library|Forest of the Dead}}
Vashta Nerada (literally: the shadows that melt the flesh) are microscopic swarm creatures which, when present in a high enough concentration, are totally indistinguishable from shadows, and use this to their advantage in approaching and attacking prey. They are described as the &quot;[[piranha]]s of the air&quot;, able to strip their victims to the bone in an instant in high enough densities. The Doctor says that almost every planet in the universe has some, including [[Earth]], and claims that they can be seen as the specks of dust visible in unusually bright light. On most planets, however, Vashta Nerada exist in relatively low concentrations, feeding primarily on [[carrion]], with attacks on people being comparatively rare. In the episode &quot;[[Silence in the Library]]&quot;, an unusually high concentration of Vashta Nerada had completely overrun the 51st century &quot;Library&quot;, resulting in the apparent death of everyone inside at the time.

Vashta Nerada normally live in forested areas, and reproduce by means of microscopic spores which can lay dormant in wood pulp. In the episode &quot;[[Forest of the Dead]]&quot;, this is revealed to be the reason for their unusual prevalence in The Library, as it is made known that the books and The Library itself were constructed of wood from the Vashta Nerada's native forest feeding grounds. Individually, Vashta Nerada are non-sentient, but if a large enough concentration come together, they can form a group mind of human-level intelligence capable of communication.

The fourth episode of ''[[Doctor Who: The Adventure Games]]'', &quot;Shadows of the Vashta Nerada&quot;, features them as the leading villain.

===Veil===

'''Veils''' are able to step into the bodies of others, controlling them. They can also induce a trance by touching their victims.This can be done with their extremely long tong.-* In the episode, ''[[Prisoner of the Judoon]]'', [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters#Androvax|Androvax]], the last Veil, was a fugitive responsible for destroying twelve planets, and was pursued by the [[Judoon]] after the Judoon prison ship containing him crashed on Earth. He then returned on the episode ''[[The Vault of Secrets]]'', seeking help from Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani due to the fact that he was ill and wanted to return to his own kind. Androvax was successful in awakening the survivors of the Veils as he searches for a new world for them to reside in.

===Venusian===
Venusians are inhabitants of the planet [[Venus]], the closest planet to [[Earth]]. They had large feet, and six arms. The [[Third Doctor]] often employed a form of Venusian martial art (called Venusian [[aikido]] or Venusian [[karate]]) and sang Venusian [[lullabies]] (to the tune of ''[[God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen]]''). Venusian aikido is allegedly very hard for two-armed beings to learn. Its use appeared in the serials [[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]], [[Day of the Daleks]], and others. The [[Seventh Doctor]] favored a more subtle version which involved applying a single finger, seen in ''[[Survival (Doctor Who)|Survival]].'' The [[Fourth Doctor]] revealed to [[Davros]] in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' that a battle between the Venusians and the Daleks &quot;in the Space Year 17,000&quot; was ended by the intervention of a group of battleships from the planet Hyperon. Although Venus today is utterly devoid of life, the [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'' shows Venus to have been inhabited billions of years ago, before the surface became too hot to support life.

===Vervoid===
{{Main|Terror of the Vervoids}}

Artificially created plant-based humanoids who possess problem-solving intelligence and the power of speech; they were intended to perform tasks usually carried out by robots, but for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately they instead decided to eradicate all of 'animalkind'. Vervoids had about the size and strength of humans, but were covered in leaves which provided them with energy through photosynthesis. They possessed thorns so poisonous they could kill a human on contact, and could produce copious amounts of methane-based swamp gas.

===Vespiform===
{{Doctor Who race
|name=Vespiform
|type=Morphing insectoids
|planet= Unknown, Silfrax Galaxy
|start=&quot;[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]&quot;
}}
{{Main|The Unicorn and the Wasp}}
The Vespiform are a [[insectoid]] species resembling giant [[wasp]]s, born ''en masse'' in hives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Each possesses the ability to morph into other species. It also has the ability to breed with other species, including humans, to produce offspring. The ''Monster Files'' feature establishes them as an ancient race and that they have fought the [[The Dominators|Quark rebels]].&lt;ref&gt;[ BBC â Doctor Who â Videos â Series Four]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vespiform have a telepathic connection to objects called firestones, which contains part of their mind. Like Earth's wasps, the Vespiform are vulnerable to water. A Vespiform-human hybrid can live a normal life as a human until a burst of intense emotion awakens its alien biology. When the Vespiform morphs into another species it emits a purple light.

In &quot;[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]&quot;, a Vespiform appears and goes on a killing spree in the style of [[Agatha Christie]]'s murder mystery books. Eventually it turns out the reason for Vespiform's killings was due to his firestone in the possession of rich Lady Eddison while reading Christie's novels. Furthermore, the Vespiform is revealed to be Lady Eddison's illegitimate son: Reverend Golightly. In the end, trying to get the firestone back, the Vespiform dies chasing after the item when Donna Noble throws it into a lake.

===Vinvocci===
{{Main|The End of Time}}
The Vinvocci are a race of spiky green aliens who first appeared in ''[[The End of Time]]''. A pair of Vinvocci came to Earth as part of a salvage operation to recover Vinvocci techonologyâa medical device for healing entire planets, which Joshua Naismith named the &quot;Immortality Gate&quot;. They possess disguise technology referred to by the Doctor as a Shimmer. When the Doctor notes a similarity to Bannakaffalatta from ''[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]'', noting the distinction that &quot;he was small, and red&quot;, the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.

===Visian===
{{Main|The Daleks' Master Plan}}
'''Visians''' are invisible creatures indigenous to the planet [[List of Doctor Who planets#M|Mira]]. They are completely invisible, detectable only by their footprints and the sounds they make while moving through the jungle. [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] states that they are 8 feet tall and extremely hostile, evidenced by the fact that they attack both the Doctor's party and the Daleks indiscriminately.

===Viyrans===
The Viyrans are an elusive race of aliens heard in [[Big Finish Productions]] audio stories.
They originate from a distant galaxy that waged a huge war using a wide variety of powerful technologically advanced [[biological weapons]]. A final peace agreement was reached and the biological weapons were gathered together at the Amethyst Viral Containment Station with the intention of destroying them. But then there was an incident involving the [[Sixth Doctor]] and the [[Daleks]] and all of the dangerous virus weaponry was spread throughout the universe, landing on various worlds and causing havoc.

The Viyrans come from that distant galaxy. Their job is to seek out all the stray viruses, neutralise them and cure any victims, if possible. They also feel it's their duty to make sure no one finds out anything about any of this, in case someone of low morals tries to track down some of these viruses themselves.

They have no real spoken language, but communicate [[psychically]] or through hand motions or sometimes by trying to replicate an individual's voice. They can also time travel. What they actually look like is a mystery, but they are humanoid in shape, always appearing in a white type of [[hazmat suit]]. When they find an infected location, they block off the area and work in secret, never letting anyone know they were there, before, during or after. They collect all the victims in flying glass coffins and attempt to cure them. If the infected individuals can be cured, they are returned and their memories of the events are erased. If not, they are destroyed.

The first appearance of The Viyrans was in a short story called ''No One Died'' from the 2007 Doctor Who Storybook, featuring the [[Tenth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler]]. Their first appearance in an audio story was ''[[The Mind's Eye &amp; Mission of the Viyrans#Mission of the Viyrans|Mission of the Viyrans]]'' with the [[Fifth Doctor]] and [[Peri Brown]]. The viral explosion is witnessed in ''[[Patient Zero (Doctor Who audio)|Patient Zero]]''. In ''[[Blue Forgotten Planet]]'' it is revealed that [[Charley Pollard]] is employed by the Viyrans after they cure a virus she contracted.

Although they did not appear themselves, their engineered viruses were featured in ''[[I.D. &amp; Urgent Calls#Urgent Calls|Urgent Calls]]'', ''[[Exotron &amp; Urban Myths#Urban Myths|Urban Myths]]'' and ''[[The Wishing Beast &amp; The Vanity Box]]''. These one part stories (and ''Mission of the Viyrans'') were listed in their booklets as being part of the &quot;Virus Strand&quot; arc. Some of the viruses they've tried to neutralise include a virus that can destroy the minds of an entire planet (''No One Died''), a particle that can induce beneficial coincidences for communications devices (''Urgent Calls''), an exaggerating frenzy illness (''Urban Myths''), a living wish-granting device (''The Wishing Beast &amp; The Vanity Box'') and a rapidly spreading contagion that crudely distorts DNA, slowly killing its victims (''Mission of the Viyrans'').

===Vogan===

===Vondrax===
A race known as the '''Vondrax''' appear in the novel ''[[Trace Memory (Torchwood)|Trace Memory]]'' by [[David Llewellyn (author)|David Llewellyn]]. According to Jack Harkness, the Vondrax are &quot;said to be one of the oldest sentient lifeforms in the universe&quot;, and feed on ''tachyon radiation''. They are capable of time travel, and frequently change shape. In ''Trace Memory'' they adopt a humanoid form, wearing suits and bowler hats, and carrying umbrellas. The character of Torchwood agent Valentine says that &quot;in Japan they (the Vondrax) were said to resemble Samurai. In Egypt they came ''like gods''.&quot; The Vondrax are able to kill their victims by simply looking at them, a technique that only fails to work on Jack, and in fact seems to have the reverse effect, killing the Vondrax itself.

===Vortisaur===

'''Vortisaurs''' are fictional creatures from the [[Eighth Doctor]] series of [[Doctor Who]] audio plays by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]. Much like the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Reaper|Reapers]] of the [[Doctor Who|TV series]], Vortisaurs are a species of time-sensitive flying [[reptile]]s with cosmetic similarities to [[pterosaur]]s. They live exclusively in the [[Time vortex (Doctor Who)|space-time vortex]], the dimension which time machines like the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor's]] [[TARDIS]] pass through as they travel from point to point. Vortisaurs are drawn to the chronal distortions radiated by objects traversing the vortex, and occasionally scavenge from ships wrecked and lost in that environment. Their jaws are fixed with sharp teeth; on biting, beyond the physical wound, the chronal energies of the creature age the wound and the surrounding tissue by decades. The Doctor appears to have extensive training in the handling of Vortisaurs, referring to them as &quot;bloodhounds&quot; and showing a proficiency for handling of the beasts. On at least two occasions he offers anecdotes of his days as a youth, riding Vortisaurs bareback.

In ''[[Storm Warning (Doctor Who audio)|Storm Warning]]'', the Doctor encounters a flock of Vortisaurs scavenging from the hulk of a time ship; his efforts to drive them off, only result in his being attacked himself. Although he manages to retreat to 1930 [[France]], materialising his TARDIS on board the Airship [[R101]], he unknowingly tows one of the creatures along with him, a fact revealed when it begins to attack the airship crew. The Doctor and his new [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Charley Pollard|Charley]] use the Vortisaur as a ride to escape the crash of the airship. Charley takes a liking to the Vortisaur, naming it [[List of Doctor Who spin-off companions#Ramsay|Ramsay]] after the then-[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald|James Ramsay MacDonald]]. After a few serials of failed domestication attempts, Ramsay is eventually released back into the vortex.

Later seasons of Eighth Doctor stories also include Vortisuars. ''[[No More Lies (Doctor Who audio)|No More Lies]]'' features bridled Vortisaurs ridden by marauding time warriors; again showing his affinity for the species, the Doctor at one point mounts one of these Vortisaurs, quickly giving it the name &quot;[[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret]]&quot;. In ''[[The Book of Kells (Doctor Who audio)|The Book of Kells]]'', the Doctor discovers that a Vortisaur has been pulled out of the space-time vortex like his own TARDIS, and turned into [[vellum]] by a [[Abbey of Kells|group of monks]]. It is described as being indigo with stripes.

==W==
===Water hag===
A bio-organic race known only as '''water hags''' which grow their babies in mens throats because they need testosterone. They appear in the novel ''[[Something in the Water]]''.

===Waterhive===
The '''Waterhive''' is the description given to an unnamed alien race from the [[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|New Series Adventures]] novel ''[[The Feast of the Drowned]]''. They are composed of water and can take over the body of a drowned being. The body is thus preserved, although the eyes of their host will become &quot;pearly&quot;, forcing glasses to be worn. They infiltrated the high ranks of the Navy in order to send sailors and their loved ones to their watery graves. Their plan was to use the living drowned as human incubators for their larvae, this failed when the Doctor reduced the hive to atoms.

{{Doctor Who race

|start=''[[The Ark in Space]]''
}}
The '''Wirrn''' are an [[insectoid]] race that made their debut in the 1975 [[Fourth Doctor]] story ''[[The Ark in Space]]''. The name is sometimes spelled '''Wirrrn''', which is a spelling originating from the novelisation of the story.

The Wirrn claim to have originated from Andromeda (whether they meant the [[Andromeda Galaxy|galaxy]], the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation]], or even a planet named &quot;Andromeda&quot; is unclear), but were driven into space by human settlers. They are slightly larger than humans, dark green and wasp-like in appearance, and live mostly in space, although their breeding colonies are terrestrial. Their bodies are a self-contained system, their lungs being able to recycle waste [[carbon dioxide]] and only needing to touch down occasionally on planetary bodies for food and [[oxygen]]. The Wirrn's life cycle involves laying their eggs in living hosts; the larvae emerge to consume the host, absorbing its memories and knowledge. A Wirrn larva is a green slug-like creature, varying in size from a few inches to 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;metres across. It can &quot;infect&quot; another organism through contact with a substance it excretes, mutating them into an adult Wirrn and connecting their consciousness to the hive mind.

In ''The Ark in Space'', the Wirrn found Space Station Nerva in orbit around an Earth devastated centuries before by solar flares. The survivors had lain in [[suspended animation]] waiting for the planet to recover, but had overslept by several millennia. The Wirrn intended to use the sleepers as a food source and claim the empty Earth for their own, as both a means of survival and an act of revenge against the human race for taking their former territories. In the course of their plan, Noah, leader of Nerva, was infected and converted to their kind. However, Noah still retained &quot;more than a vestige of human spirit&quot;, probably thanks to the encouragements of the Doctor, and led the Wirrn into Nerva's transport ship even though he knew it was rigged to explode. It did so, ending the Wirrn threat.

The Wirrn have also appeared in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Placebo Effect (Doctor Who)|Placebo Effect]]'' by [[Gary Russell]], and in the audio play ''Wirrn: Race Memory'', produced by [[BBV]]. [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] used them in the audio stories ''[[Wirrn Dawn]]'' with the Eighth Doctor and ''[[Wirrn Isle]]'' with the Sixth. A dead Wirrn appears briefly in television story ''[[The Stones of Blood]]''.

===Xeraphin===
{{Doctor Who race

The '''Xeraphin''' were an ancient species encountered by the [[Fifth Doctor]] in the story ''[[Time-Flight]]'' by [[Peter Grimwade]]. Originating from the planet Xeriphas, they possessed immense psychokinetic and scientific powers. The Doctor believed the race to have been wiped out during the crossfire during the Vardon/Kosnax war. Instead, the entire race fled to Earth in an escaping spacecraft. The ship crashed near present day Heathrow some 140 million years ago. When the Xeraphin emerged they built a Citadel to mark their new home but the Xeraphin were so plagued with [[radiation]] that they abandoned their original humanoid bodies and transformed into a single bioplasmic [[wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] intelligence within a sarcophagus at the heart of the Citadel.

The arrival of [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] coincided with their emergence from the gestalt state when the radiation effects had subsided, and his influence caused the emergence of a split personality of good and evil, each side competing for their tremendous power while yearning to become a proper species once again. The Master, who was stranded on Earth at the time too, succeeded in capturing the Xeraphin as a new power source for his [[TARDIS]]. However, the Doctor's intervention meant his nemesis' TARDIS was sent to Xeriphas where events became out of his control.

Before fleeing Xeriphas and the Xeraphin, the Master took with him [[Kamelion]], a Xeraphin war weapon with advanced shape-changing abilities dependent on the will of its controller. Kamelion was freed from the Master and joined the Doctor's TARDIS crew in ''[[The King's Demons]]''.

'''Xyloks''' are a crystalline race that crashed into Earth as a meteorite about 60 million years ago. Consequently, the Xyloks that survived the crash were trapped beneath the surface of the Earth, regrowing over thousands of millennia.

After the eruption of mount [[Krakatoa]] in 1883, one of the Xyloks was found in the post-volcanic aftermath. It was eventually passed to [[Sarah Jane Smith]] by a geologist friend when she was researching volcanic activity, 18 months prior to the events of ''[[The Lost Boy (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|The Lost Boy]]''. During her studies of the crystalline structure, she found that it could use her laptop to communicate. The Xylok agreed to help Sarah Jane protect Earth, and was integrated into the supercomputer [[Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Mr Smith]], built by Sarah Jane under the instruction of the Xylok. Unbeknownst to Sarah Jane, this was a ploy, in anticipation that it would one day be able to release the imprisoned Xylok race. Sarah Jane and her companions were able to thwart its intentions; as a result, Mr Smith was reprogrammed and became a benefit to the human race once again.

===Zaralok===
{{Main|Doctor Who: The Adventure Games#Shadows of the Vashta Nerada}}
The '''Zaralok''' was a shark-like creature that prowled the waters around the flooded 23rd century London, now little more than a network of underwater tunnels codenamed 'Poseidon'. When the Doctor and Amy land the [[TARDIS]] in Poseidon, the Zaralok immediately attacks, attempting to ram its way into the glass tunnels. While constantly having to evade the monster, the two slowly unravell the mystery of Poseidon, which has fallen under threat from not only the Zaralok, but also the [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Vashta Nerada|Vashta Nerada]] and otherworldly radiation. They eventually discover that all the anomalies arrived at the city when the [[USS Eldridge]], an American WWII-era ship which had vanished through a wormhole to another world hundreds of years ago, suddenly jumped back through into the sea several days ago. However, the ship became lodged in the wormhole and held it open, allowing the creatures and the radiation to seep through. The Doctor and Amy travel to the wreckage of the Eldridge and are able to close the wormhole; the Zaralok is seen being dragged back to its own world, while the other anomalies disappear with it.

They are roughly eight feet long, and the [[#Menoptra|Menoptra]] claim that they are &quot;little more than cattle&quot;.

They possess little [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] but were not at all aggressive until the Animus arrived. They were enslaved to the alien [[consciousness]] and considered the [[butterfly]]-like Menoptra their mortal enemies. Only they could control the [[woodlouse]]-like venom grubs, also known as larvae guns.

They returned to their normal ways after the Animus was defeated by the [[First Doctor]], [[Ian Chesterton]], [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] and [[Vicki]]. It is presumed that the various species on Vortis are now living peacefully together.
