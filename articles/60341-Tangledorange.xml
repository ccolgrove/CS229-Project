'''Richmond''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|r|Éª|tÊ|m|É|n|d}} {{respell|RICH|mÉnd}}) is a city in western [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]], [[California]], United States. The city was incorporated on August 7, 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecrailhist&quot;&gt;[http://elcerritowire.com/history/pages/railchron.pdf East Shore and Suburban Railway Chronology], ''[[El Cerrito Historical Society]]'', June 2007, retrieved August 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], part of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. It is a residential inner suburb of [[San Francisco]], as well as the site of heavy industry, which has been undergoing a shift towards a service and commercial economy since the 1970s. Richmond almost completely surrounds the city of [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and the [[unincorporated area]]s of [[North Richmond, California|North Richmond]], [[El Sobrante, California|El Sobrante]] and [[East Richmond Heights, California|East Richmond Heights]]. The city has a reputation for being crime-plagued, although this problem is centralized in the urban core, with many parts of Richmond having a low crime rate. The city's [[Richmond Police Department|own police department]], however, has described the city as having a chronic violent crime problem for &quot;decades&quot; and in 2010, Richmond was ranked the 6th most dangerous city in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_16688493?source=most_viewed East Bay cities ranked among most dangerous in U.S.], Bay City News Services.

The city is headed by mayor [[Gayle McLaughlin]], making Richmond the largest city in the country with a [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Green Party mayor takes the reins | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | date = January 10, 2007 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/10/BAGPQNG56H1.DTL | first=Jason B. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2010 [[United States Census|U.S. Census]], the city's population is at 103,701. This makes Richmond the 61st largest city in the state.

==History==
[[Image:Richmondunderpass.jpg|thumb|right|An [[East Shore and Suburban Railway|E&amp;SR]] streetcar in the Macdonald Avenue subway in downtown Richmond, 1906.]]

The [[Ohlone Indians]] were the first inhabitants of the Richmond area, settling an estimated 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name = &quot;History of Richmond&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Richmond | publisher = City of Richmond | url = http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.asp?NID=112 | accessdate = 2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Richmond&quot; appears to predate actual incorporation by more than fifty years. Edmund Randolph, originally from [[Richmond, Virginia]], represented the city of San Francisco when California's first legislature met in San Jose in December 1849, and he became state assemblyman from San Francisco. His loyalty to the town of his birth caused him to persuade a federal surveying party mapping the San Francisco Bay to place the names &quot;Point Richmond&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot; on an 1854 geodetic coast map, which was the geodetic map at the terminal selected by the [[San Joaquin Valley Railroad]]; and by 1899 maps made by the railroad carried the name &quot;Point Richmond Avenue,&quot; designating a county road that later became Barrett Avenue, a central street in Richmond.

The [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] had its terminus at Richmond.&lt;ref name=CGN&gt;{{California's Geographic Names|689}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first post office opened in 1900.&lt;ref name=CGN /&gt;
	
Richmond was founded and incorporated in 1905, carved out of [[Rancho San Pablo]], from which the nearby town of San Pablo inherited its name. Until 1919, the city had the largest [[winery]] in the world; the small abandoned village of [[Winehaven, California|Winehaven]] remains fenced off along Western Drive in the [[Point Molate Area]]. In the 1920s the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was active in the city. In 1930 the [[Ford Motor Company]] opened an assembly plant which moved to Milpitas in the 1960s. The old Ford plant has been a National Historic Place since 1988, and has recently{{When|date=July 2011}} been converted into an events center (Ford Point Building - The Craneway).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmondca4business.com/news/documents/ScenicEastBayEventVenue-FordPointCranewayNov07.pdf Richmondâs Historic Ford Point Building Craneway, ''Bay Crossings'', November 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was a small town at that time, until the onset of [[World War II]] which brought on a rush of migrants and a boom in the industrial sector. [[Standard Oil]] set up operations here in 1901, including a what is now the [[Chevron Richmond Refinery]] and [[Oil depot|tank farm]], which are still operated by [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]. There is a pier into San Francisco Bay south of [[Point Molate]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} for oil tankers. The western terminus of the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] was established in Richmond with ferry connections at Ferry Point in the Brickyard Cove area of [[Point Richmond]] to San Francisco.

At the outset of [[World War II]], the four [[Richmond Shipyards]] were built along the Richmond waterfront, employing thousands of workers, many recruited from all over the United States, including many African-Americans and women entering the workforce for the first time. Many of these workers lived in specially-constructed houses scattered throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including Richmond, Berkeley and Albany. A specially-built rail line, the [[Shipyard Railway]], transported workers to the shipyards. Kaiser's Richmond shipyards built 747 [[Victory ship|Victory]] and [[Liberty ship]]s for the war effort, more than any other site in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rosie the Riveter--World War II Home Front National Historical Park: World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area | publisher =National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/ros.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city broke many records and even built one Liberty ship in a record five days. On average the yards could build a ship in thirty days. The medical system established for the shipyard workers at the [[Richmond Field Hospital]] eventually became today's [[Kaiser Permanente]] [[HMO]].&lt;ref&gt;Rickey Hendricks, ''A Model for National Health Care: The History of Kaiser Permanente'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1993), 40-47, 63&lt;/ref&gt; It remained in operation until 1993 when it was replaced by the modern [[Richmond Medical Center]] hospital, that has subsequently expanded to a large multiple building campus.

Point Richmond was originally the commercial hub of the city, but a new downtown arose in the center of the city. It was populated by many department stores such as [[S. H. Kress &amp; Co.|Kress]], [[J.C. Penney]], [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[Macy's]], and [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]]. During the war the population increased dramatically and peaked at around 120,000 by the end of the war.  Once the war ended the shipyard workers were no longer needed, beginning a decades-long population decline.  The Census listed 99,545 residents in 1950. By 1960 much of the temporary housing built for the shipyard workers was torn down, and the population dropped to about 71,000. Many of the people who moved to Richmond were [[African-American|black]] and came from the Midwest and South. Most of the white men were overseas at war, and this opened up new opportunities for ethnic minorities and women. This era also brought with it the innovation of [[daycare]] for children, as a few women could care for several dozen women's children, while most of the mothers went off to work in the factories and shipyards.

In the 1970s the Hilltop area including a large shopping mall was developed in the northern suburbs of the city; this further depressed the downtown area as it drew away retail clients and tenants. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the [[Richmond Parkway (California)|Richmond Parkway]] was built along the western industrial and northwestern parkland of the city connecting Interstates 80 and 580.

In the early 1900s, the Santa Fe railroad established a major rail yard adjacent to Point Richmond. The railroad constructed a tunnel through the Potrero San Pablo ridge to run a track from their yard to a ferry landing from which freight cars could be transshipped to San Francisco. Where this track crosses the main street in Point Richmond, there remain two of the last operational [[Wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] grade crossing signals in the United States, and the only surviving examples of the &quot;upside-down&quot; type. The wigwag is an antiquated type of railroad crossing signal which was phased out in the 1970s and 80s across the country. There was controversy in 2005 when the State Transportation Authority ordered the BNSF railroad company to upgrade the railroad crossing signals. A compromise was achieved that included installing new modern crossing gates, red lights and bells while not removing, but simply shutting off the historic ones and preserving their functionality for special events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baycrossings.com/Archives/2002/06_July/going_wiggy_over_wig-wags.htm &quot;Going Wiggy over Wig-Wags - Pt. Richmondâs Wig-Wag Controversy,&quot; by Jim Mallory], BayCrossings.com, July 6, 2002, retrieved May 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pullman Company]] also established a major facility in Richmond in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pullmanshops.com Pullman Shop official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility connected with both the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific and serviced their passenger coach equipment. The Pullman Company was a large employer of [[African American]] men, who worked mainly as [[porter (railroad)|porters]] on the Pullman cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphiliprandolphmuseum.com A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them settled in the East Bay, from Richmond to Oakland, prior to World War II.

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] had planned to visit Richmond just prior to his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contracostatimes.com/search/ci_5791647 Son of King shining light on poor, by John Geluardi], ''Contra Costa Times'', May 1, 2007, retrieved May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the city celebrated its centennial. This coincided with the repaving and streetscaping project of [[Macdonald Avenue]]. The city's old rundown commercial district along Macdonald has been designated the city's &quot;Main Street District&quot; by the state of California. This has led to funding of improvements in the form of state grants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-853061.html TTCA Welcomes the City of Richmond Into the California Main Street Program.], Business Wire, December 13, 2007, retrieved May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

Richmond, like much of the coastal [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], enjoys a very mild [[Mediterranean climate]] year round. The climate is slightly warmer than the coastal areas of San Francisco, [[San Francisco Peninsula|the Peninsula]], and Marin County; it is however more temperate than areas further inland. The average highs range from 57 Â°F (14 Â°C) to 73 Â°F (23 Â°C) and the lows between 43 Â°F (6 Â°C) to 56 Â°F (13 Â°C) year round.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmondweather&quot;/&gt; Richmond usually enjoys an &quot;[[Indian summer]]&quot;, and September is, on average, the warmest month. January is on average the coldest month.

The highest recorded temperature in Richmond was 107 Â°F/41.6 Â°C in September 1971 while the coldest was 24 Â°F/-4.4 Â°C in January 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmondweather&quot;/&gt;

The rainy season begins in late October and ends in April with some showers in May. Most of the rain occurs during stronger storms which occur between November and March and drop 3.3 to {{convert|4.91|in|mm}} of rain per month. January and February are the rainiest months.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmondweather&quot;/&gt;

Like most of the Bay Area, Richmond is made up of several [[microclimate]]s. Southern parts of the city and the ridges receive more [[fog]] than northern areas. Summer temperatures are higher in inland areas, where the moderating influence of San Francisco Bay is lessened. The average wind speed is 6 to 9 miles  per hour with stronger winds from March through August; the strongest winds are in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmonddata&quot;/&gt; The city also enjoys more than 80% sunshine 7 months out of the year and 10 with 60% or more. December and January are the darkest months with about 45% average brightness.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmonddata&quot;/&gt; The city experiences virtually no snowfall, and brief hail annually. The city is very humid in the morning with the lowest humidity being in the high 70% range. This may be due to San Francisco Bay's notorious fog and also the fact that a majority of Richmond lies on a flat coastal plain predominantly consisting of reclaimed tidal marshes, inter-tidal flats, and [[Seep (hydrology)|seep]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfei.org/ecoatlas/Habitat/maps/SFBay/pastpres1.html Bay Area EcoAtlas], retrieved June 19, 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morning humidity is 75% to 92% year round; afternoon humidity is more variable. This percentage is in the high 20s to mid 30s (%) May through October (the summer months) and climbs or descends through 40% to 70% during the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmonddata&quot;/&gt;

==Environment==
[[Image:Raildumbartrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|Endangered California Clapper Rails live in Wildcat and San Pablo Marshes.]]

Richmond is home to many species of animals. [[Canada Goose|Canada Geese]] visit the city on their annual migrations. [[Harbor Seal]]s live in the Castro Rocks and [[pigeon]]s and [[gull]]s populate the sidewalks and parking lots. Tadpoles and [[frog]]s can be found in the local creeks and vernal pools. [[Vole|Field mice]] and [[lizard]]s are also found. [[Heron]]s and [[egret]]s nest in protected areas on Brooks Island. [[Deer]], [[falcon]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[duck]]s, [[fox]]es, [[owl]]s, and [[mountain lion]]s live in Wildcat Canyon and [[Point Pinole Regional Shoreline]].

San Marcos is a series of about ten condominium multistory buildings between Hilltop Mall and Country Club Vista. Richmond Transit Village has been constructed in the former west parking lot and an adjacent empty lot of the combined Richmond BART and Amtrak station. The development is part of the city's downtown revitalization efforts.

==Casinos==

Many casinos have been proposed for the West Contra Costa area. [[Point Molate]] would have a casino, resort, and a luxury shopping mall. [[Sugar Bowl Casino]] proposes a casino, steakhouse, and a buffet promoted by the [[Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians|Pomo Tribe's Scotts Valley Band]] near the border between [[North Richmond, California|North Richmond]] and the city of Richmond's [[Parchester Village, Richmond, California|Parchester Village]] whose resident's have lauded as a boon to fight crime by adding more of a police presence and creating jobs for shiftless youth, but residents from neighboring newly developed sub-divisions along the [[Richmond Country Club]] were fervently opposed based on potential losses to property values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/14/BAGOT8UIRN27.DTL Neighbors at odds over casino plan Proposal pits poor community against new subdivision].

The projects have been the subject of much civic debate supporters contend that the often cash-strapped government would get a major new source of revenue, while opponents air their concerns over the ramifications including an increase in already high crime rates, lowered property values, and worsening neighborhood quality of life.

Point Molate is currently slated to either become a housing and conference center or a [[casino]] resort shopping area, or even a large regional park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/04/09/MN15155.DTL&amp;hw=richmond+environmental+catastrophe&amp;sn=005&amp;sc=603 Time Bomb Or Treasure], Sfgate.com, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', April 9, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond city government operates under a [[Council-manager government|council-manager system]] with 9 members (including mayor and vice mayor) elected to alternating 4-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Richmond Government | publisher = City of Richmond | url = http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.asp?NID=27 | accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the city is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold. By the early 1990s, not a single [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] remained on the council. Most mayors have been African-American. George D. Carroll, who was voted by the City Council to become Mayor on July 6, 1964, was described at the time as &quot;the first Negro mayor in California and first in America with the exception of small, scattered all-Negro communities in the Deep South,&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Negro Councilman Elevated to Richmond Mayor's Post&quot;, ''Oakland Tribune'', July 7, 1964, p19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Corbin]] was the mayor throughout the 1990s and was an exception, as she is white. In the early 2000s [[Gayle McLaughlin]] was the first Green elected to the council, with the support of the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA), a coalition of liberal Democrats, progressive independents, and Greens. In November 2006, McLaughlin was elected mayor. The city council has four African Americans, four whites and two Latinos. Richmond has formerly been home to black culture and activist movements, most notably the [[Black Panther Party]].

In 2006 the city implemented a computer program that it had ordered from a German firm that provides the city with statistical interactive maps. These maps cover such areas as signage locations, streets, crime hot-spots, and zoning information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/winter0203articles/city-of-richmond.html The City of Richmond, California, Implements Enterprise Framework], ESRI&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the city won a contest in which its previously substandard website was upgraded and improved to make it more modern and functional. The prize includes 2 years of free webmastering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicplus.com/Archive.asp?ADID=189 Grand Prize-Winning âExtreme Makeoverâ Website Is Unveiled!], CivicPlus, January 5, 2007, retrieved June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There has recently been controversy regarding appointments of councilpersons Sandhu and Thurmond who were not elected at-large or were appointed to the ballot on a Yes/No basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contracostatimes.com/search/ci_5412730 Council shifts way it fills seats], [[Contra Costa Times]], by Joshua Geluardi, March 11, 2007, retrieved May 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently Mayor McGlaughlin and Councilperson Butt have opposed Chevron's plans of modifications to the refinery that would increase pollution by using dirtier, thicker, but cheaper crude oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Johnson | first = Chip | title = California city questions Chevron's refinery upgrade | publisher = San Francisco Chronicle | url = http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/24005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Richmond has eight community centers which are located within city parks.&lt;ref name=&quot;infosys&quot;/&gt; Many of the city's community centers were closed in the early 2000s following budget miscalculations and financial difficulties. In the 2006 city elections many candidates ran on platforms promising to reopen these community centers, most of which had been closed due to budget cuts. That election also featured a city sales tax increase, Measure Q, which failed.

There are 53 voting precincts in Richmond. During the regular [[2006 Richmond, California city election|election on November 7, 2006]] 21,575 of 37,605 (57.37%) registered voters cast their ballots.&lt;ref name=&quot;electresult&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/DocumentView.asp?DID=977 OFFICIAL RESULTS OF THE 2006 MUNICIPAL ELECTION HELD ON NOVEMBER 7, 2006], retrieved August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana===
The city has eight marijuana dispensaries and although the city has passed legislation approving them and has legalized their presence, the city management does not since it had sued to close them, for operating from partially to blatantly illegally. It is trying enforce an injunction supporting removing their operating licenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pot&quot;&gt;[http://www.eastbayexpress.com/LegalizationNation/archives/2010/07/22/will-richmond-close-its-pot-clubs-before-its-new-law-goes-into-effect Will Richmond close its pot clubs before its new law goes into effect?], East Bay Express&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that although the city council has passed an ordinance permitting them the city management refuses to cooperate with the spirit of the law because it has yet to take effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;pot&quot;/&gt; The question remains if the clubs will be closed before the law takes effect allowing them to open.&lt;ref name=&quot;pot&quot;/&gt; A moratorium on new clubs expires in January 2011 with no political will to renew it. Furthermore the city taxes [[medical cannabis]] at 2% and recreational marijuana at 10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;pot&quot;/&gt;

==Government==
Richmond is served by the [[Richmond Police Department]] and Richmond Fire Department. Dozens of parks are run by the Richmond Parks &amp; Recreation Department. The Richmond Civic Center is currently undergoing a seismic upgrade and renovations program. Some buildings are being refurbished while other buildings will be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;civicupgrade&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/index.asp?NID=833 Civic Center Revitalization], Mitigative and negative declaration, City of

The city received widespread attention in 2009 when a [[2009 Richmond High School gang rape|girl was gang raped]] at a homecoming dance at Richmond High School.

The city has in recent years suffered from a high crime rate, so serious that the city council at one point requested a declaration of a state of emergency and asked for the intervention of the Contra Costa County Sheriff and the [[California Highway Patrol]] in order to ameliorate the crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/17/BAGM0DA7LS1.DTL 4 on council call for a state of emergency], by Jim Herron Zamora, Sfgate.com, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', June 17, 2005, retrieved May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Murder, vehicle theft and larceny rates are all high, although they tend to be concentrated in certain areas such as the [[Iron Triangle, Richmond, California|Iron Triangle]] and areas surrounding adjacent unincorporated [[North Richmond, California|North Richmond]], which is outside the jurisdiction of the Richmond Police Department.

In 2004, Richmond was statistically the most dangerous city in California and was named the 8th most dangerous city in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalism.berkeley.edu/ngno/stories/004050.html The Iron Triangle: Richmond's Forgotten Neighborhood], North Gate News Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Those rankings have changed and Richmond is now the third most dangerous in California behind Compton and Oakland and 11th most dangerous nationally according to the [[Morgan Quitno]] rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15475741 Report finds St. Louis most dangerous U.S. city.]&lt;/ref&gt; For every 100,000 people there were 38.3 [[murder]]s, 50.4 [[rape]]s, 485.8 [[robbery|robberies]], 512 [[assault]]s, 1110.7 [[burglary|burglaries]], 3497.4 counts of [[larceny]] and 2471.4 [[Motor vehicle theft|thefts of vehicles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;richmonddata&quot;/&gt; Richmond had 42 murders in 2006; and the city experienced a record of 62 homicides in 1991 out of a population of 98,000, which was 7 times the national average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ojjdp.ncjrs.org/pubs/gun_violence/profile04.html Profile 4: Comprehensive Homicide Initiative], Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, US Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many gangs graffiti their &quot;tags&quot; to mark their territory thus blighting the city with vandalism. A high ranking [[MS-13]] (or ''mara salvatrucha'') leader, JosÃ© Santos Bonilla, was captured in the southwestern [[Richmond Annex, Richmond, California|Annex]] neighborhood in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/27/MNG1GK6KLR20.DTL Leader of notorious MS-13 gang arrested], by Jason B.

Richmond is also home to the [[West County Detention Center]] in the [[Point Pinole Regional Shoreline|Point Pinole area]]. It is a male and female county jail.

RichmondWorks and Richmond Summer YouthWorks are city programs which aim to decrease unemployment and crime and have led to hundreds receiving employment at area retail businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Operation Safe Homes | publisher = The U.S. Conference of Mayors | url = http://www.usmayors.org/uscm/best_practices/bp_volume_4/ca-richm.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fires, medical emergencies and other disasters are handled by the [[Richmond Fire Department]] which has seven fire stations in the city. Medical and trauma patients are transported by American Medical Response Paramedics and EMTs.&lt;ref name=&quot;infosys&quot;/&gt;

Sewage is largely handed by the Richmond Sewage Treatment Plant in [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/incontracosta/detail?entry_id=81900 Richmond wastewater treatment plant to resume operations amid controversy].

==Education==
[[Image:De Anza High School Sign.jpg|thumb|De Anza High School, located in a nearby unincorporated area, serves many Richmond students]]
The public schools in Richmond are administered by the [[West Contra Costa Unified School District]], formerly the Richmond Unified School District. There are also many private schools, mostly Catholic schools under the authority of the [[Diocese of Oakland]].

The city has five high schools: [[De Anza High School]], [[Salesian High School (Richmond, California)|Salesian High School]], [[Richmond High School (Richmond, California)|Richmond High School]], and  [[John F. Kennedy High School (Richmond, California)|Kennedy High School]]  . In addition, there are two charter high schools, Leadership Public Schools: Richmond and West County Community High School.  There are also three middle schools, sixteen elementary schools, and seven elementary-middle schools. Richmond also hosts three adult education schools.

The [[Contra Costa Community College District]] serves all of Contra Costa County, and Richmonders who decide to attend a community college typically go to [[Contra Costa College]], located in the neighboring city of San Pablo.

79.8% of Richmonders have a high school diploma or equivalent compared with 84.2% nationally, however 27.1% have a bachelor's degree compared with a statistically similar 27.2% countrywide.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmonddata3&quot;/&gt;

All Richmond schools have banned junk food, such as candy, soda, [[Twinkies]], pizza, and other like items in attempt to curb [[childhood obesity]] and change children's eating habits. It has been speculated that this was done preemptively since some believe the state will soon mandate such restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9060700.html Contra Costa, Calif., School District Bans Soda, Junk Food, by Kara Shire], ''Contra Costa Times'', August 30, 2003, retrieved May 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the implementation of an exit exam requirement for California high schools, the [[CAHSEE]], some Richmond high school students have been protesting the requirement. In 2007, over 28% of Richmond High School students has passed the CAHSEE, a prerequisite for graduating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orovillemr.com/news/bayarea/ci_6083333 Richmond students protest Exit Exam results], [[Oroville Mercury Register]], June 7, 2007, 2007-06-07&lt;/ref&gt;  Some students were angered with the new CAHSEE requirement. They sued the district in the pursuit of eliminating the requirement. In July 2007 a compromise was reached in which the district would provide 2 additional years of educational assistance for the purposes of passing the exam.

==Attractions and landmarks==
The city of Richmond has dozens of parks, National Historic Park, and 10 sites listed under the [[National Register of Historic Places]]&lt;ref name=&quot;natlregrich&quot;&gt;[http://www.nr.nps.gov/iwisapi/explorer.dll?IWS_SCHEMA=NRIS1&amp;IWS_LOGIN=1&amp;IWS_REPORT=100000039 Impromptu Web Query&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{NRIS dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Point Richmond]], which is in effect a village within Richmond, is known for its small-town charm and its quaint shops. ''The Point'', as it is known by locals, offers owner-operated stores, coffee shops, and historic benches and streetlights. [[The Masquers Playhouse]] is a performing arts center that offers shows and productions year round. Hotel Mac is one of the oldest buildings in the area and has classic early 20th century architecture, like many other buildings in the area. There is also [[The Plunge]], a natatorium which had been closed due to seismic safety issues but was re-opened in August 2010 after the retrofitting was completed. The city expressed a desire to demolish the building at one point, but this was halted by the actions of a neighborhood preservation campaign which continues its mission to &quot;''Save the Plunge!''&quot;.

[[Image:RedOakVictory2.JPG|thumb|The [[SS Red Oak Victory (AK-235)|Red Oak Victory]] at Ferry Point in Brickyard Cove, 2006]]

The Ferry Point Tunnel is one of the oldest tunnels in California. Built in 1899, this structure still gives access to many attractions and neighborhoods in Brickyard Cove. The tunnel goes to the Golden State Railroad Museum, the USS ''Red Oak Victory'', and many beaches and parks, and to Ferry Point where an abandoned ferry-rail pier still stands with a historic ferry slip still standing, though somewhat damaged by fire. It can be viewed from an adjacent fishing pier.

The [[USS Red Oak Victory (AK-235)|USS ''Red Oak Victory'']] (AK-235) is a restored World War II [[Victory ship]], the 558th ship made in Richmond. [[Liberty ship|Liberty]] and Victory ships transported troops and supplies during World War II.

During [[World War II]] the city sprawled and its population increased dramatically. This led city leaders to construct the Richmond Civic Center in 1957. This center houses the city hall, a small convention center, library, hall of justice, police headquarters, and arts center.

The Richmond Public Library, the only public library independent of the Contra Costa County Public Libraries system, lies in the heart of the civic center. It houses over 204,686 books, 4,014 audio materials, 5,277 video materials, and 491 serial subscriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmonddata&quot;/&gt;

The [[Richmond-San Rafael Bridge]] extends {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1}} across San Pablo Bay. The bridge is the origin of the term ''rollercoaster span'', due to its curves, bumps, and appearance which have also earned the bridge the nickname of ''The Rollercoaster Bridge''. It was built in 1957, and connects Contra Costa County with [[Marin County]]. Automobiles are charged a [[USD|$]]4 toll in the westbound (towards Marin) direction only.

The [[Golden State Railroad Museum]] is a complex series of model railroad layouts in a museum in the Brickyard Cove area of Point Richmond. A visitor can operate trains of various eras, and there are miniature freight and passenger terminals, trestles, tunnels, and meticulously detailed town and city scenes, many of which are copied from real life scenes of the 1950s.

The Santa Fe Railroad Terminal operated as the western terminus for the railroad from the late 19th century to the late 20th century&lt;!--some actual dates here would be nice --&gt;. It has now been transformed into a museum to exemplify the feel of the terminal in that era.

Keller Beach is one of the city's beaches, located at Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline, a park in Brickyard Cove. It offers picnicking, sunbathing, wading, and swimming. The beach is overlooked by vehicles exiting the Brickyard Cove drive, Ferry Point tunnel and houses on the steep cliffs above. The beach, as with most of the cove, offers spectacular panoramic bay views of the Oakland hills, bridges, the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate.

Point Molate Beach Park is a park on the western coast of Richmond along Western Drive. It was originally a Chinese shrimp camp in the 1870s.

Point San Pablo yacht harbor accommodates hundreds of private boats.

East Brother Light Station on East Brother Island (one of the [[Brother Islands]]) is host to an exclusive [[bed and breakfast]]. It is only accessible by private boat. Visitors come and stay for the day and picnic for free or they may pay for a room.

The city also is also home to a radio controlled model airplane airport, [[Breuner Airfield]] that is located in [[Breuner Marsh]] a contested piece of land and near Point Pinole Regional Park in the Parchester Village neighborhood.

==Leisure and culture==
Several [[regional park]]s administered by the [[East Bay Regional Park District]] lie within the city, including the [[Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline]] and the [[Point Pinole Regional Shoreline]]. They are linked by the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]]. Part of the former shipyard is now a marina.

The Richmond Art Center, founded by Hazel Salmi in 1936, is one of the oldest continually operating non-profit art centers on the entire West Coast of the United States. Its programming includes exhibitions, adult and youth education, and community initiatives. The Center currently (as of 2005) provides some of the only arts education programming in the Richmond City School District, relying primarily on public donations and private grants as its means of support.

There is also the East Bay Center for the Performing Arts, Hilltop Multiplex, or Masquers Theaters in Point Richmond.

The [[Richmond Progressive Alliance]] and [[United States Green Party|Green Party]] are active political parties in Richmond. The [[House Rabbit Society]] has its national headquarters in Richmond.

===Art===
Richmond is home to the [http://www.niadart.org National Institute of Art and Disabilities Art Center], also known locally as the NIAD Art Center. NIAD is a non-profit organization hosting over sixty client artists weekly. NIAD's client artist's work can be seen at NIAD's on-site gallery, the Florence Ludins-Katz Gallery. NIAD has a gift shop.

===Parks and recreation===
[[Image:kellerbeach1.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Beach goers wading at Keller Beach in [[Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline]] in southern Richmond between [[Point Richmond]] and [[Brickyard Cove]].]]

The city has {{convert|292.6|acre|km2|1}} of parkland, that is 1.5% of the city's land territory. A new national park, [[Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park]] is now under construction in the former Kaiser shipyards and other wartime industrial sites in Richmond. The park is a memorial to the six million women who labored on the home front, symbolized by the mythical figure &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;. Richmond was selected for the park because it has many intact buildings that were constructed for 56 wartime industries. Its four shipyards produced an amazing 747 large ships and set production records. The home front changed Richmond from a predominantly rural community of 23,600 residents to a diverse population of over 100,000 people within a year. Industries operated around the clock and public housing, schools, day care centers, health care and merchants mobilized to support the new workforce that arrived on the city's doorstep. Fortunately, Richmond's turbulent and productive home front years were well chronicled and photographed. The National Park Service provides interpretive services and operates a Visitor Center in the craneway of the Ford Assembly Building.

Richmond also has number of local parks and two large regional parks are under the authority of the East Bay Regional Parks District, a consortium of most of the Parks and Recreation lands and facilities of Alameda and Contra Costa County.

[[Wildcat Canyon Regional Park]] is the city's largest park at {{convert|2428|acre|km2|0}}. The park once housed a dance hall and roller rink and has distinctive stonework throughout, which was the rationale for its placement on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline | East Bay Regional Parks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It features San Pablo Creek, trails, forests, horseback riding, picnic areas, and a play structure for children, as well as horses for rent and mountain biking trails. High school students practice cross-country in the park. It is situated in the eastern Richmond hills and stretches into Berkeley's [[Tilden Regional Park]] in Alameda County. The park has diverse animal and plant life including great horned owls, opossums, king snakes, rubber boas, turkey vultures and many others.

[[Point Isabel Regional Shoreline]] is the largest off-leash dog park in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/16/BAG2F88OGP1.DTL Point Isabel Shoreline the largest off-leash dog park in the nation], by Glen Martin, San Francisco Chronicle, August 16, 2004, retrieved July 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Richmond Greenway]] is a project costing millions of dollars to transform an old rail line into a walking, jogging, and biking trail. It will span east to west from the end of the Ohlone Trail that follows the BART line from El Cerrito to Berkeley. It will also follow the BART line to Richmond station and continue to Point Richmond. Pedestrian bridges will be used to cross major avenues such as San Pablo Avenue and 23rd Street. An additional side project will add a bike lane/bike trail between the Richmond Greenway and the Ohlone trail at Potrero Avenue via 23rd Street, Carlson Boulevard, Cutting Boulevard, and Potrero. It is currently under construction.

Richmond is home to four marinas: the Brickyard Cove Yacht Club, Point San Pablo Yacht Club, Marina Bay Marina, and Channel Marina in the Santa Fe channel.  In addition, Richmond has the &quot;Richmond Plunge&quot;, a municipal [[natatorium]] dating back to 1926 and which reopened August 14, 2010.  The pool is located in the [[Point Richmond, California|Point Richmond]] neighborhood.

===Public transportation===
====Rail====

[[Amtrak]] provides intercity passenger rail service from [[Richmond Station (California)|Richmond Station]], an intermodal connection shared with the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system. The station is located downtown and has a transit center with connections to [[AC Transit]] and [[Golden Gate Transit]] buses as well as taxis.

There are two Amtrak lines serving this station. The regional [[San Joaquin (Amtrak)|San Joaquin Route]] runs from nearby Oakland to the south through Richmond and [[Martinez, California|Martinez]] to the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], terminating in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. Passengers continuing on to Los Angeles or other points in [[Southern California]] may transfer at Bakersfield for connecting Amtrak Thruway bus services.

The second Amtrak line, the [[Capitol Corridor (Amtrak)|Capitol Corridor]] runs from [[San JosÃ©, California|San JosÃ©]] to the state capitol, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], through Richmond, Fairfield, and Davis; some trains continue to the northern Sacramento suburb of [[Auburn, California|Auburn]]. This route is the third most heavily used Amtrak line in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amtrakcapitols.com/stations/ Amtrak.com], Capitol Corridor, Stations (map), retrieved July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] has one station in the city of Richmond, mentioned above, which serves as the northern terminus of the [[Richmond-Millbrae Line|Richmond-Millbrae]] and [[Richmond-Fremont line]]s. Two other stations are located near Richmond, [[El Cerrito del Norte]] and [[El Cerrito Plaza (BART)|El Cerrito Plaza]], both in El Cerrito. The [[Richmond Station (California)|Richmond BART station]] had over 1.7 million passengers in 1998 while the Amtrak station carried 238,893 in 2006.

Before AC Transit and BART the [[Key System]] provided a network of several rail lines on the [[East Shore and Suburban Railway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bayrails&quot;&gt;[http://www.bayarearails.org/photogal/full.php?id=1327&amp;s=24 keysystemmap.gif], BayRails, retrieved August 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bus====
AC Transit provides 14 bus lines in the city including local service throughout the city including [[bus rapid transit|BRT]] line 72R along San Pablo Avenue, &quot;Transbay&quot; commuter service across the Bay Bridge to the [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal]] and also owl &quot;[[All-Nighter]]&quot; service along the BART line. The lines are: 7, 29, 70, 71, 72, 72M, 72R, 74, 76, 376, 800, H, L, LC, LA

In June 2007, after engaging with the community for feedback with public hearings, AC Transit implemented the West Contra Costa County Service Plan which realigned existing service finds to reroute portions of certain lines, eliminate service to areas with low ridership, and replace service in some areas with service from a different route providing direct service to areas previously requiring tedious transfers. Furthermore, a great effort was made to provide a better transfer at Richmond Station as well as the [[Richmond Parkway Transit Center]]. The changes are covered by Phase I and use no new monies which would be required to completely implement the plan: Phase II. Phase II will use Regional Measure J funds to expands service providing lines along corridors which are undeserved or not served, and increasing hours and decreasing headways. Two of the greatest changes will be extending BRT service to Richmond Parkway Transit Center and providing service along the Ohio Avenue corridor. These changes have effected the northern neighborhoods of the city and the adjacent communities of El Sobrante and San Pablo the most. Phase I was originally supposed to be implemented in late 2006, but the implementation has been delayed until June 2007. Phase II has a target date of mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actransit.org/news/articledetail.wu?articleid=d00173cf New Date: Upcoming Service Changes], AC Transit Marketing, March 15, 2007, retrieved June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actransit.org/riderinfo/SChanges_Hayward_07.htm AC Transit Service Changes], retrieved June 7, 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://www.actransit.org/riderinfo/SChanges_Hayward_07.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20070524040606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actransit.org/aboutac/bod/memos/9d6c4b.pdf West County Service Plan Community and Drivers Input (PDFs)], retrieved June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actransit.org/planning_focus/details.wu?item_id=28 West Contra Costa County Service Plan (PDFs)], retrieved June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The voyage took approximately 45 minutes one-way. The service began in 1999, but was discontinued in the late 2000s in the economic downturn following the dot-com bust. Ferry ridership plummeted and the service became economically unsustainable, which led [[Red and White Fleet]] to discontinue the service. The Richmond ferry terminal is at Ford Point located adjacent to the historic [[Ford Richmond Plant|Ford Plant]] in [[Marina Bay, Richmond, California|Marina Bay]] which is now open as an industrial park and under renovation. The terminal had its own dedicated [[AC Transit]] feeder service from [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond]] and [[Downtown Richmond, Richmond, California|downtown Richmond]] with route 374 also now discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtc.ca.gov/news/transactions/ta09-1099/richmond_ferry.htm MTC - News - Transactions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/09/27/MN62955.DTL Richmond Ferry to Sail], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/10/06/MN66248.DTL Richmond Ferry Wins Praise But Few Riders], ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Richmond Ferry Terminal|new ferry service]] from Richmond is planned for 2008 by the [[San Francisco Bay Area Water Transit Authority]].
