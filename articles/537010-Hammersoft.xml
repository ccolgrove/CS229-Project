The '''University of Texas at Dallas''', also referred to as '''UT Dallas''' or '''UTD''', is a public [[research university]] in the [[University of Texas System]]. The main campus is in the heart of the [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], [[Texas]], [[Telecom Corridor]], {{convert|18|mi|km}} north of [[Downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]. The institution, established in 1961 as the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest and later renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS), began as a research arm of [[Texas Instruments]]. In 1969 the founders bequeathed SCAS to the State of Texas and [[Preston Smith (governor)|Governor Preston Smith]] signed the bill officially creating the University of Texas at Dallas.

UTD offers over 142 academic programs across its seven schools and hosts more than 50 research centers and institutes. With a number of interdisciplinary degree programs, its curriculum is designed to allow study that crosses traditional disciplinary lines and to enable students to participate in collaborative research labs. Entering freshmen average math and critical reading SAT scores are consistently above 1200 and are among the highest of the public universities in Texas. The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] classifies UT Dallas as a &quot;comprehensive doctoral research university&quot; and a &quot;high research activity institution&quot;. Research projects include the areas of space science, bioengineering, cybersecurity, nanotechnology, and behavioral and brain sciences.

UT Dallas owns approximately {{convert|710|acre|km2}} of generally contiguous land in Richardson, Texas consisting of {{convert|445|acre|km2}} for campus development and another {{convert|265|acre|km2}} adjacent to the main campus. From 2007 the university has added or started construction on more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of new facilities including the first academic structure in Texas to be rated a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum facility. In addition to the new facilities a $30-million campus landscape enhancement was completed in late 2010 and the university received a &quot;B-&quot; on the 2011 ''College Sustainability Report Card'', which includes efforts to protect and conserve natural resources.

The school has a Division III athletics program in the [[American Southwest Conference]] and fields 13 intercollegiate teams. Student activities include more than 160 registered organizations and students provided more than 20,000 volunteer hours at community agencies in 2010. The university has a nationally recognized debate team, recruits worldwide for its chess team and the only school in Texas to field teams in all three of the major pre-law competitions. As of the 2010 fall commencement the university had over 68,250 alumni, who have earned more than 74,900 degrees.

==History==
===Establishment===
[[File:Founders Building-1964.jpg|thumb|left|The Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Science, (later named the Founders Building), opened in 1964.]]
The UT Dallas founders, [[Eugene McDermott]], [[Cecil Howard Green]] and [[J. Erik Jonsson]], purchased [[Geophysical Service Incorporated]] (GSI) on December 6, 1941, the day before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. With the increase in defense contracts the General Instrument Division of GSI grew to the point it was reorganized as Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) in 1951 with GSI a wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kso4OUQ0GgoC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=The+Graduate+Research+Center+of+the+Southwest&amp;q=The%20Graduate%20Research%20Center%20of%20the%20Southwest|publisher=The MIT Press|date= June 22, 1989|title=Cecil and Ida Green, Philanthropists Extraordinary|isbn=0262192764|pages=153â162|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualified personnel required by TI were not readily available in the [[DallasâFort Worth metroplex|Dallas-Fort Worth area]] because the region's universities did not provide enough graduates with advanced training in engineering and physical sciences. TI was forced to recruit talent from other states during its expansion and the founders observed in 1959 that &quot;To grow industrially, the region must grow academically; it must provide the intellectual atmosphere, which will allow it to compete in the new industries dependent on highly trained and creative minds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/student/catalog/undergrad10/about.html|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas |title=History |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate for this shortage they established the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in 1961. The institute initially was housed in the Fondren Science Library at [[Southern Methodist University]]. Land for the center was acquired by Jonsson, McDermott, and Green in Richardson in 1962 and the first facility, the Laboratory of Earth and Planetary Science (later named the Founders Building), opened on the grounds of the present-day UTD campus in 1964. The Graduate Research Center of the Southwest was renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS) in 1967 and in 1969 the founders transferred the land and assets of SCAS to the State of Texas. On June 13, 1969 Governor Preston Smith signed the bill adding the institution to the University of Texas System and creating the University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Champagne|first=Anthony|title=Handbook of Texas Online: University of Texas at Dallas|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|date=2010-02-22|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/UU/kcu10.html|accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 the school accepted its first students. Physics, biology and geological sciences were the first PhD degrees offered. Francis S. Johnson served as interim president and William B. Hanson was named the director of the Division of Atmospheric and Space Sciences now known as the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utd500.utdallas.edu/historyframe.html|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas |title=William B.

===Expansion and growth===
[[File:Engineering and Computer Science Complex.jpg|thumb|Engineering and Computer Science Complex]]
In July 1971, [[Bryce Jordan]] became the universityâs first president and served until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/40years/transcripts/jordan.html|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas |title=Bryce Jordan Transcription|accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the campus consisted of only one facility, the  Founders Building. During Jordan's 10 year tenure the university's received 275 acres (1.11 km2) of land in 1972 from the [[Hoblitzelle Foundation]] and the campus expanded with the addition of a number of new facilities including the Hoblitzelle Hall, Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gard|first=Wayne|title=Handbook of Texas Online:TEXAS RESEARCH FOUNDATION|publisher=Texas State Historical Association||url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/snt02|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/development/donor-report/Donor-Report-Fall-2011.pdf|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas |title=Donor Report, Fall 2011|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Association of Colleges and Schools|publisher=[[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]]|url=http://www.sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=73200|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1975 only graduate students were enrolled. Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; The university's first bachelor's degree was awarded at the school's spring commencement in 1976. The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/calliercenter/|title =Callier Center for Communication Disorders|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1975, the [[University of Texas at Dallas academic programs#School of Management|School of Management]] opened and has become the university's largest and offers programs at the undergraduate, graduate and executive levels. UT Dallas's first [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate, the late [[Polykarp Kusch]], was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982. When he retired, the university endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme Concerns of the Lively Mind in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2009/04/09-001.php|title=2009 Kusch Lecture To Showcase Mission to Mars|accessdate=2010-05-31|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the [[Rutford Ice Stream]] and [[Mount Rutford]] in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antarctic Peak named for Robert Rutford&quot;/&gt; Rutford served as head of the university until 1994. During his tenure as president, the university secured approval for a school of engineering, added freshmen and sophomores to its student body and built the first on-campus housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/create/print.html|title=Printable Timeline|accessdate=2011-01-29|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; UT Dallas school of engineering opened in 1986 due to the efforts of business, community and education leaders.

The loop road will be designed to help keep traffic contained within the campus, rather than on the cityâs roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cor.net/Bond/2010Bond.aspx?id=11897|title=City of Richardson Bond Election|date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2011-09-16|publisher=City of Richardson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''UTD Mercury'' noted in a February 15, 2011 article that a lack of on-campus parking has been an ongoing problem. Additional parking lots were added in 2010 and 2011. However, due to the continued increase in enrollment, the lack of available parking spaces continues to be a frustrating issue for the students. In November 2011 the UT System Board of Regents approved initial plans for two five-story parking structures. The two structures will increase the Universityâs parking capacity by 1,500 spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2011/11/22-14191_Garages-Lot-Expansions-to-Add-Nearly-1700-Parking-_article-wide.html|title=Garages, Lot Expansions to Add Nearly 1,700 Parking Spaces|date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2011-11-21|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university received a &quot;B-&quot; on the 2011 ''College Sustainability Report Card'', which includes efforts to protect and conserve natural resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =College Sustainability Report Card 2011 | publisher =Sustainable Endowments Institute | url =http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-texas-dallas| accessdate = 2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:UT Dallas Student Service Building.JPG|thumb|Student Services building]]
Early architecture on the campus exhibits typical characteristics of [[Brutalism]], a popular civic style when the structures were designed and built. In accordance with this style, many of the early buildings are pale, off-white, precast concrete with repetitive structures. Later architecture exhibits late modern or [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] features such as bronze glass, bronze aluminum frames, unadorned geometric shapes, unusual surfaces, and unorthodox layouts. This later modern styling is seen in the Engineering and Computer Science building, School of Management, Cecil and Ida Green Center, and Natural Science and Engineering Research Lab facility (sometimes called the Mermaid Building due to its colorful anodized shingles). The Student Services building, completed in 2010, is the first academic structure in Texas to be rated a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum facility by the [[U.S. Green Building Council|United States Green Building Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2011/2/10-8711_UT-Dallas-Building-Awarded-Highest-Green-Status_article.html|title=UT Dallas Building Awarded Highest Green Status|accessdate=2011-02-08|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide protection from inclement weather and extreme temperatures, many of the buildings on campus are connected by a series of elevated indoor walking paths also referred to as [[skyway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/pardonourprogress/images/Indoor-Walking-Path-Map.pdf|title=Indoor Walking Path|accessdate=2011-07-25|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape Architecture===
[[File:UTD mall.JPG|thumb|left|Campus mall]]
A 30-million dollar Campus Landscape Enhancement Project, largely funded by Margaret McDermott the wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott (1899-1973), was started in October 2008 and completed in late 2010. The project encompassed all aspects of landscape architecture from campus identity to pedestrian strategies, future growth patterns, sustainability and establishing a campus core. The project included the reforestation of the main entry drive with more than 5,000 native trees. Each tree hand-picked and individually arranged by the landscape architect after careful study of native stands in Texas, which includes the commitment to a [[Riparian zone|riparian]] corridor consisting of a densely planted natural creek bed along the central entry median to the campus [[Avenue (landscape)|AllÃ©e]]. The main mall or 'AllÃ©e' includes 116 hand-picked columnar 'Claudia Wannamaker' Magnolias alongside five reflecting pools and four human-scale chess boards to represent the national and international achievements of the school's chess team.  At the northern terminus of the AllÃ©e and between the McDermott Library and the Student Union is a pavilion-sized plaza. The plaza includes a granite fountain complete with mist column, an overhead trellis to be eventually covered in [[wisteria]] vines and a temperature-modifying shade structure design. The landscape architecture firm of [[Peter Walker (architect)|Peter Walker and Partners]] (PWP) was the prime consultant for the project. PWP is recognized for design of the {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Millennium Parklands in Sydney, Australia for the 2000 Summer Olympics and currently the World Trade Center Memorial at Ground Zero in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/facilities/files/CLEP-Executive-Summary-Nov-2010.pdf|title=Campus Landscape Enhancement Project

[[File:UT Dallas Love Jack.jpg|thumb|upright|Love Jack]]
Some of the traditions that give UT Dallas its distinctive flavor are Homecoming, Annual Oozeball Tournament, Ceremonial Mace, Legacy Lane, Welcome Week, Sounds of Class, Family Day, Splatterbeat and Cecil Greenâs Head. Cecil Green helped found the University of Texas at Dallas and outside Green Hall there is a bronze bust of Cecil Green. Rubbing Greenâs head for good luck has become a tradition for many students on their way to exams or presentations. Holiday Sing is one of the oldest tradition on campus, the annual Holiday Sing started in 1976 and is hosted by the School of Arts and Humanities during the month of December. In front of the Erik Jonsson Academic Center is the sculpture ''Jack'', created in 1971 by artist [[Jim Love (artist)| Jim Love]] (1927 - 2005). Margaret McDermott, wife of UTD founder Eugene McDermott (1899-1973), presented the sculpture to the university in 1976. The sculpture is affectionately known on campus as the Love Jack. Recently added is the Spirit Rock on the mall between the Jonsson and Green buildings. Students and organizations are allowed to paint whatever they like on the rock, provided it conforms to rules of student conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/traditions/|title=Traditions|date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2011-09-16|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utdallas.edu/student/sg/spiritrock/|title=Spirit Rock|date=2009-01-14|accessdate=2011-09-16|publisher=The University of Texas at Dallas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
