==History==
A Parish Magazine of 1898 states &quot;an afternoon service at the Church room on Grange Fell has been recommenced for the winter months&quot;. This 'room' was in the home of Mrs Nell Smith who provided accommodation so people in the area could worship regularly. The Present Building was built in 1907, it was dedicated on 26 April 1907 year by the then Bishop of Carlisle, Rt Revd Dr Diggle. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grangepcc.homecall.co.uk/fell.htm Fell Church Grange PCC]&lt;/ref&gt;
