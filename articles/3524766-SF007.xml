'''YouTube''' is a [[Video hosting service|video-sharing]] website, created by three former [[PayPal]] employees in February 2005, on which users can upload, view and share videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Surprise!

The company is based in [[San Bruno, California]], and uses [[Flash Video|Adobe Flash Video]] and [[HTML5]]&lt;ref name=&quot;youtubehtml5&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.youtube.com/html5 | title = YouTube HTML5 Video Player | work = YouTube | accessdate =April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; technology to display a wide variety of [[user-generated content|user-generated]] video content, including movie [[Video clip|clips]], TV clips, and music videos, as well as amateur content such as [[video blogging]] and short original videos. Most of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals, although media corporations including [[CBS]], [[BBC]], [[VEVO]], [[Hulu]], and other organizations offer some of their material via the site, as part of the YouTube partnership program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=BBC strikes Google-YouTube deal|author=Weber, Tim| publisher = BBC| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6411017.stm|accessdate=January 17, 2009 | date=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unregistered users may watch videos, and registered users may upload an unlimited number of videos. Videos that are considered to contain potentially offensive content are available only to registered users 18 years old and older. 

In November 2006, YouTube, LLC was bought by [[Google|Google Inc.]] for US$1.65 billion, and now operates as a [[subsidiary]] of Google.

{{Main|History of YouTube}}
[[File:Youtube founders.jpg|thumb|400px|From left to right: [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]]]]
YouTube was founded by [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen]], and [[Jawed Karim]], who were all early employees of [[PayPal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-11-21-video-websites_x.htm | title = Video websites pop up, invite postings | work = USA Today | date = November 21, 2005 | accessdate =July 28, 2006 | last = Graham | first = Jefferson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurley had studied design at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], while Chen and Karim studied [[computer science]] together at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube: Sharing Digital Camera Videos |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]| url =http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126|accessdate=November 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in [[San Francisco]]. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, while Hurley commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party &quot;was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=The Gurus of YouTube|author=Cloud, John| publisher = Time Magazine| url =http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1570721,00.html|accessdate=November 29, 2008 | date=December 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube began as a venture-funded technology startup, primarily from a $11.5 million investment by [[Sequoia Capital]] between November 2005 and April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Venture Firm Shares a YouTube Jackpot|author=Miguel Helft and Matt Richtel| publisher = The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/technology/10payday.html|accessdate=November 30, 2008 | date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and Japanese restaurant in [[San Mateo, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Ready for Its Close-Up|author=Sara Kehaulani Goo| publisher = Washington Post| url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100600660.html|accessdate=November 29, 2008 | date=October 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[domain name]] &lt;code&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/code&gt; was activated on February 14, 2005, and the website was developed over the subsequent months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://whois.domaintools.com/youtube.com| title = Whois Record for &lt;code&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/code&gt; | accessdate =April 1, 2009 | work = | publisher =DomainTools }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first YouTube video was entitled ''[[Me at the zoo]]'', and shows founder Jawed Karim at the [[San Diego Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=YouTube: Overnight success has sparked a backlash|author=Alleyne, Richard| publisher = Daily Telegraph| url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2480280/YouTube-Overnight-success-has-sparked-a-backlash.html|accessdate=January 17, 2009 | location=London | date=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video was uploaded on April 23, 2005, and can still be viewed on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw|title=Me at the zoo|publisher=YouTube|date=April 23, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube offered the public a [[beta test]] of the site in May 2005, six months before the official launch in November 2005. The site grew rapidly, and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day, and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=YouTube serves up 100 million videos a day online |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-16-youtube-views_x.htm |work= |publisher= ''USA Today''|date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data published by [[market research]] company [[comScore]], YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the United States, with a [[market share]] of around 43 percent and more than 14 billion videos viewed in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=comScore Releases May 2010 U.S. Online Video Rankings|author=| publisher =[[comScore]]| url =http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/6/comScore_Releases_May_2010_U.S._Online_Video_Rankings|accessdate=June 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube says that over 48 hours of new videos are uploaded to the site every minute, and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;48_hours&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = YouTube users uploading two days of video every minute|author=Shane Richmond| publisher = Daily Telegraph| url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8536634/YouTube-users-uploading-two-days-of-video-every-minute.html|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=May 26, 2011| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Eric Schmidt, Princeton Colloquium on Public &amp; Int'l Affairs|author=| publisher = YouTube| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXmDxf7D_g#t=14m52s|accessdate=June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] as the entire Internet in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Web could collapse as video demand soars|author=| publisher = Daily Telegraph| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/07/nweb107.xml|accessdate=April 21, 2008 | location=London | first=Lewis | last=Carter | date=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] ranks YouTube as the third most visited website on the Internet, behind [[Google]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Alexa Traffic Rank for YouTube (three month average)|author=| publisher = [[Alexa Internet]]| url =http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youtube.com|accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of the name &lt;code&gt;www.youtube.com&lt;/code&gt; led to problems for a similarly named website, &lt;code&gt;www.utube.com&lt;/code&gt;. The owner of the site, [[Universal Tube &amp; Rollform Equipment]], filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being overloaded on a regular basis by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube has since changed the name of its website to &lt;code&gt;www.utubeonline.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Help!

In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with [[MGM]], [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], and [[CBS]], allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for US viewers called &quot;Shows&quot;. The move was intended to create competition with websites such as [[Hulu]], which features material from [[NBC]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = MGM to Post Full Films on YouTube|author=Brad Stone and Brooks Barnes| publisher = The New York Times| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10mgm.html?ref=technology|accessdate=November 29, 2008 | date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043001853.html |title=It's Official: Disney Joins News Corp., NBCU In Hulu; Deal Includes Some Cable Nets |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |date=April 30, 2009 |author=Staci D.

In March 2010, YouTube began free streaming of certain content, including 60 cricket matches of the [[Indian Premier League]]. According to YouTube, this was the first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Cricket: IPL goes global with live online deal| publisher = The Guardian| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/20/youtube-live-indian-premier-league|accessdate=February 6, 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=January 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2010, the YouTube website launched a new design, with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site. Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: &quot;We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =YouTube redesigns website to keep viewers captivated | publisher = AFP| url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jfGfKKsiwbxNv8XoUbm8ZlRZZWyw|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, it was reported that YouTube was serving more than two billion videos a day, which it described as &quot;nearly double the prime-time audience of all three major US television networks combined&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = YouTube serving up two billion videos daily|author=Chapman, Glenn| publisher = AFP| url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jK4sI9GfUTCKAkVGhDzpJ1ACZm9Q|accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, YouTube reported in its company blog that the site was receiving more than three billion views per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;48_hours&quot; /&gt;

In October 2010, Hurley announced that he would be stepping down as chief executive officer of YouTube to take an advisory role, and that [[Salar Kamangar]] would take over as head of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggtnJSISuXoPHgxu6HwPJJqVTT6g?docId=CNG.f7ff59e3829714d23524d35ed1afdd63.921|title=Hurley stepping down as YouTube chief executive|accessdate=October 30, 2010 |date=October 29, 2010|work=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
=== Video technology ===
==== Playback ====
Viewing YouTube videos on a personal computer requires the [[Adobe Flash Player]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to be installed on the [[web browser|browser]]. The Adobe Flash Player plug-in is one of the most common pieces of software installed on personal computers and accounts for almost 75% of online video material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Flash moves on to smart phones|author=| publisher = BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8287239.stm|accessdate=November 30, 2009 | date=October 5, 2009 | first=Jonathan | last=Fildes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, YouTube launched an experimental version of the site that uses the built-in multimedia capabilities of web browsers supporting the [[HTML5]] standard. This allows videos to be viewed without requiring [[Adobe Flash Player]] or any other plug-in to be installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labnol.org/internet/youtube-video-without-flash-player/9016/|title=Watch this YouTube Video without the Flash Player|author=|date=|accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/11/08/html5-youtube-viewer-close-but-not-quite-there/|title=HTML5 YouTube viewer: close, but not quite there|author=|date=|accessdate=November 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The YouTube site has a page that allows supported browsers to opt in to the HTML5 trial. Only browsers that support HTML5 Video using the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] or [[WebM]] formats can play the videos, and not all videos on the site are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/html5|title=YouTube HTML5 Video Player|author=|date=|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20005378-264.html?tag=mncol|title=Google tries freeing Web video with WebM|author=Shankland, Stephen|publisher= [[CNET.com]]|date=May 19, 2010|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uploading ====
All YouTube users can upload videos up to 15 minutes in duration. Users who have a good track record of complying with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos of unlimited length, which requires verifying the account, normally through a [[mobile phone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=71673 Video length for uploading] YouTube Help.

YouTube originally offered videos at only one quality level, displayed at a resolution of 320x240 [[pixel]]s using the [[Sorenson codec|Sorenson Spark]] codec (a variant of [[H.263]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;incomplete-h263&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaourantin.net/2005/08/quest-for-new-video-codec-in-flash-8.html |title=The quest for a new video codec in Flash 8 |author=Tinic Uro |quote=We went this route before with Sorenson Spark which is an incomplete implementation of H.263 and it bit us badly when trying to implement certain solutions. |date=August 13, 2005 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flash-video&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.macromedia.com/f4v/video_file_format_spec_v10_1.pdf |title=Adobe Flash Video File Format Specification Version 10.1 |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |format=PDF |page=72 |quote=Sorenson H.263 |year=2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[monaural|mono]] [[MP3]] audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sorensonmedia.com/news/?n=379|title=Market Demand for Sorenson Media's Sorenson Spark Video Decoder Expands Sharply|publisher=Sorenson Media|date=June 2, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, YouTube added an option to watch videos in [[3GP and 3G2|3GP]] format on mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/06/17/youtube-mobile-goes-live/|title=YouTube Mobile goes live|date=June 17, 2007|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, a high quality mode was added, which increased the resolution to 480x360 pixels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2008/03/youtube-videos-in-high-quality.html|title=YouTube Blog&amp;nbsp;â YouTube Videos in High Quality|date=March 24, 2008|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, [[720p]] [[high-definition video|HD]] support was added. At the time of the 720p launch, the YouTube player was changed from a [[4:3]] [[aspect ratio]] to a [[widescreen]] [[16:9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10104182-2.html?tag=mncol;txt|title=YouTube videos go HD with a simple hack|work=CNET|date=November 20, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this new feature, YouTube began a switchover to [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] as its default video compression format. In November 2009, [[1080p]] HD support was added. In July 2010, YouTube announced that it had launched a range of videos in [[4K resolution|4K]] format, which allows a resolution of up to 4096x3072 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/whats-bigger-than-1080p-4k-video-comes.html |title = What's bigger than 1080p? 4K video comes to YouTube |publisher =Official YouTube Blog|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20010174-248.html|title = YouTube now supports 4k-resolution videos|work=CNET|date=July 9, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2010|first=Josh|last=Lowensohn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube videos are available in a range of quality levels. The former names of standard quality (SQ), high quality (HQ) and high definition (HD) have been replaced by numerical values representing the vertical resolution of the video. The default video stream is encoded in [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] format, with stereo [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10396826-2.html|title=YouTube to get high-def 1080p player|date=November 29, 2009|publisher=CNET|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 3D videos ====
In a video posted on July 21, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ANcspdYh_U|title=YouTube in 3D|publisher=YouTube|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload [[3-D film|3D videos]]. The videos can be viewed in several different ways, including the common [[Anaglyph image|anaglyph]] (cyan/red lens) method which utilizes glasses worn by the viewer to achieve the 3D effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/news167575864.html|title=YouTube in 3D?|work=Physorg|date=July 23, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009|first=Miranda|last=Marquit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techie-buzz.com/video-tools/youtube-3d-videos.html|title=YouTube 3D Videos|date=July 20, 2009|work=Techie Buzz|first=Keith|last=Dsouza|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thinkdigit.com/Internet/YouTube-adds-a-dimension-3D-goggles-not_3219.html|title=YouTube adds a dimension, 3D goggles not included|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=August 3, 2009|work=thinkdigit|first=Kshitij|last=Sobti}}&lt;/ref&gt; The YouTube [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] player can display stereoscopic content interleaved in rows, columns or a checkerboard pattern, side-by-side or [[Anaglyph image|anaglyph]] using a red/cyan, green/magenta or blue/yellow combination. In May 2011, an [[HTML5]] version of the YouTube player began supporting side-by-side 3D footage that is compatible with [[Nvidia 3D Vision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4354/youtube-adds-stereoscopic-3d-video-support-and-3d-vision-support-too |title=YouTube Adds Stereoscopic 3D Video Support (And 3D Vision Support, Too) |author=Ryan Smith |publisher=[[AnandTech]] |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content accessibility ===
One of the key features of YouTube is the ability of users to view its videos on web pages outside the site. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of [[HTML]], which can be used to embed it on a page outside the YouTube website. This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in [[social networking]] pages and [[blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/sharing|title=Sharing YouTube Videos|author=YouTube|date=|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embedding, as well as ranking and commenting, can be disabled by the video owner.

YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends for them to be viewed through its website interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/t/terms|title=Terms of Use, 5.B|publisher=YouTube|date=|accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of videos, such as the weekly addresses by President [[Barack Obama]], can be downloaded as [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] files.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10144823-2.html|title=(Some) YouTube videos get download option|author=CNET|date=January 16, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] allow users to download YouTube videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/---mark-milian.html?cid=149000259|title=YouTube looks out for content owners, disables video ripping|author=Milian, Mark|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 19, 2009|accessdate=February 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through [[Google Checkout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/12/AR2009021203239.html|title=YouTube Hopes To Boost Revenue With Video Downloads|publisher=Washington Post|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=February 19, 2009 | first=Leena | last=Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Platforms ====
Some [[smartphone]]s are capable of accessing YouTube videos, dependent on the provider and the data plan. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, and uses [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] streaming for the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.youtube.com/|title=YouTube Mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/06/mobile-youtube.html|title=Mobile YouTube|author=Google Operating System|date=June 15, 2007|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including [[Apple TV]], [[iPod Touch]] and the [[iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/20youtube.html|title=YouTube Live on Apple TV Today; Coming to iPhone on June 29|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[TiVo]] service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gizmodo.com/5026092/tivo-getting-youtube-streaming-today|title=TiVo Getting YouTube Streaming Today|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, YouTube launched &quot;YouTube for TV&quot;, a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] [[video game console]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/01/youtube-wii-ps3.html|title=YouTube video comes to Wii and PlayStation 3 game consoles|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 15, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Coming Up Next...

=== Localization ===
On June 19, 2007, Google CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] was in Paris to launch the new [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;local&quot;/&gt; The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 34 countries and a USA version.&lt;ref name=&quot;countries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5sbofbU9A|title=YouTube launches in Argentina|publisher=|date=September 9, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webdoodles.org/webimages/youtube_content_locations.png |title=YouTube content locations |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YouTube interface suggests which local version should be chosen on the basis of the [[IP address]] of the user. In some cases, the message &quot;This video is not available in your country&quot; may appear because of copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Learn More: Video not available in my country|author=|publisher = YouTube Help| url = http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en-uk&amp;answer=92571|date=|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interface of the YouTube website is available in 51 different language versions, including Catalan, Danish, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Norwegian and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], which do not have local channel versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;languages&quot;/&gt;

Plans for YouTube to create a local version in Turkey have run into problems, since the Turkish authorities asked YouTube to set up an office in Turkey, which would be subject to Turkish law. YouTube says that it has no intention of doing this, and that its videos are not subject to Turkish law. Turkish authorities have expressed concerns that YouTube has been used to post videos insulting to [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]] and some material offensive to Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Long-standing YouTube ban lifted only for several hours|author=| publisher = Today's Zaman| url = http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=145219&amp;bolum=101|date=June 19, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Turks censor YouTube censorship|author=Danforth, Nick| publisher = San Francisco Chronicle| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/30/ED68191LKM.DTL|date=July 31, 2009|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the British [[Royalties|royalty]] collection agency [[PRS for Music]] led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the United Kingdom. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach agreement on a licensing deal. The dispute was resolved in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Music videos back on YouTube in multi-million pound PRS deal|author=Barnett, Emma|publisher = Daily Telegraph| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6127624/Music-videos-back-on-YouTube-in-multi-million-pound-PRS-deal.html|date=September 3, 2009|accessdate=September 3, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Now YouTube stops the music in Germany|author=|publisher = The Guardian| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/apr/01/youtube-digital-music-and-audio|date=April 1, 2009|accessdate=April 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== April Fools ==
YouTube has featured an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] prank on the site on April 1 of every year since 2008:
* '''2008:''' All the links to the videos on the main page were redirected to [[Rick Astley]]'s music video &quot;[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]&quot;, a prank known as &quot;[[Rickrolling]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://techcrunch.com/2008/03/31/youtube-rickrolls-users/ | title=YouTube RickRolls Users | publisher=TechCrunch.com | date=March 31, 2008 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ryanspoon.com/blog/2008/03/31/youtube-rickrolls-april-fools-in/ | title=YouTube RickRolls April Fools In | publisher=RyanSpoon.com | date=March 31, 2008 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2009:''' When clicking on a video on the main page, the whole page turned upside down.

* '''2010:''' YouTube temporarily released a &quot;TEXTp&quot; mode, which translated the colors in the videos to random upper case letters. YouTube claimed in a message that this was done in order to reduce bandwidth costs by $1 per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/03/textp-saves-youtube-bandwidth-money.html | title=TEXTp saves YouTube bandwidth, money | publisher=YouTube | date=April 1, 2010 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2011:''' The site celebrated its &quot;100th anniversary&quot; with a &quot;1911 button&quot; and a range of [[Photographic print toning|sepia-toned]] silent, early 1900s-style films, including &quot;Flugelhorn Feline&quot;, a parody of [[Keyboard Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8421394/YouTube-goes-back-to-1911-for-April-Fools-Day.html| title=YouTube goes back to 1911 for April Fools' Day| publisher=Daily Telegraph | date=April 1, 2011 | accessdate=April 1, 2011| location=London| first=Shane| last=Richmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On December 3, 2006, [[Iran]] temporarily blocked access to YouTube, along with several other sites, after declaring them as violating social and moral codes of conduct.

* On January 24, 2010, [[Libya]] blocked access to YouTube after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in [[Abu Salim prison]] in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

== Social impact ==
{{Main|Social impact of YouTube}}
[[File:Charlie.png|thumb|right|[[Charlie Bit My Finger]] is YouTube's most-viewed user generated video.]]
Before the launch of YouTube in 2005, there were few easy methods available for ordinary computer users who wanted to post videos online. With its simple interface, YouTube made it possible for anyone with an Internet connection to post a video that a worldwide audience could watch within a few minutes. The wide range of topics covered by YouTube has turned video sharing into one of the most important parts of [[Cyberculture|Internet culture]].

An early example of the social impact of YouTube was the success of [[The Bus Uncle]] video in 2006. It shows a heated conversation between a youth and an older man on a bus in Hong Kong, and was discussed widely in the mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Irate HK man unlikely Web hero|author=Bray, Marianne| publisher = CNN| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/07/hk.uncle/|accessdate =May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another YouTube video to receive extensive coverage is ''guitar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjA5faZF1A8|title=guitar|date=December 20, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2009|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which features a performance of [[Pachelbel's Canon]] on an [[electric guitar]]. The name of the performer is not given in the video. After it received millions of views ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed the identity of the guitarist as [[Lim Jeong-hyun]], a 23-year-old from South Korea who had recorded the track in his bedroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-heff&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = Heffernand|first=Virginia|title= Web Guitar Wizard Revealed at Last|publisher =The New York Times|date = August 27, 2006

''[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]'', which was uploaded on May 22, 2007, is a [[viral video]] that has received the most views of any user generated YouTube video, with over 300 million views.&lt;ref name=&quot;tube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM|title=Charlie bit my finger â again !|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article6898146.ece|title= Harry and Charlie Davies-Carr: Web gets taste for biting baby|last=Chittenden |first=Maurice |date=November 1, 2009|work=[[The Times]]| accessdate=November 20, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stack&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/meet-youtubes-224-million-girl-natalie-tran/story-e6frfro0-1225843291213|title=Meet YouTube's 224 million girl, Natalie Tran |last=Stack |first=Brittany|date=March 21, 2010|work=Â¨[[The Sunday Telegraph]]|accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clip features two [[England|English]] brothers, with one-year-old Charlie biting the finger of his brother Harry, aged three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lowered-expectations-web-redefines-quality-2010-2|title= Lowered Expectations: Web Redefines 'Quality'|last=Learmonth |first=Michael|date=February 22, 2010|work=[[Advertising Age]]|accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed YouTube on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, describing it as: &quot;Providing a safe home for piano-playing cats, celeb goof-ups, and overzealous lip-synchers since 2005.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (December 11, 2009), &quot;THE 100 Greatest MOVIES, TV SHOWS, ALBUMS, BOOKS, CHARACTERS, SCENES, EPISODES, SONGS, DRESSES, MUSIC VIDEOS, AND TRENDS THAT ENTERTAINED US OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS&quot;.

The decision was criticized by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], which called the court ruling &quot;a setback to privacy rights&quot;.&lt;ref name=privacy_bbc&gt;{{Cite document |title=Google must divulge YouTube log |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7488009.stm |date=July 3, 2008 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Google Told to Turn Over User Data of YouTube |last=Helft |first=Miguel |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/technology/04youtube.html |date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Viacom's lawsuit against Google was rejected in a [[summary judgment]], with U.S. federal Judge [[Louis L. Stanton]] stating that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = US judge tosses out Viacom copyright suit against YouTube |author=Lefkow, Chris| publisher = AFP| url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h_AfErLSMMGD417l8aR0CYib0aNQ|accessdate=June 24, 2010 | date=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2008, a US court ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected [[fair use]] of the material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who had made a home video of her 13-month-old son dancing to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song &quot;[[Let's Go Crazy]]&quot;, and posted the 29-second video on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Bob|last= Egelko|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/20/MNU412FKRL.DTL |quote= |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=August 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC]], Matt Smith sued Summit Entertainment for the wrongful use of copyright takedown notice on YouTube. He asserted seven courses of action and four were ruled in Smith's favor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smith v.

==== Content ID ====
In June 2007, YouTube began trials of a system for automatic detection of uploaded videos that infringe [[copyright]]. The system was regarded by Google CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from [[Viacom]], which alleged that YouTube profited from pirated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= Kevin J.|last= Delaney|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=YouTube to Test Software To Ease Licensing Fights |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118161295626932114.html|quote= |work=Wall Street Journal |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, which became known as Content ID, creates a ID File for copyrighted audio and video material, and stores it in a database. When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found. When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video. YouTube describes Content ID as &quot;very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid_more More about Content ID] YouTube. Retrieved December 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube, and concluded that while the system was &quot;surprisingly resilient&quot; in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos, it was not infallible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testing YouTube's Audio Content ID System|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/testing-youtubes-aud|date=April 23, 2009|author=Von Lohmann, Fred|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases, as the videos have not been checked by a human for [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube's January Fair Use Massacre|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/01/youtubes-january-fair-use-massacre|date=February 3, 2009|author=Von Lohmann, Fred|accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID, it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid_dispute Content ID disputes] YouTube. Retrieved December 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube has cited the effectiveness of Content ID as one of the reasons why the site's rules were modified in December 2010 to allow some users to upload videos of unlimited length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/12/up-up-and-away-long-videos-for-more.html Up, Up and Away - Long videos for more users] YouTube, December 9, 2010. Retrieved December 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial content ===
YouTube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos. The uploading of videos containing [[defamation]], [[pornography]], and material encouraging criminal conduct is prohibited by YouTube's [[terms of service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guidelines&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=| url = http://youtube.com/t/community_guidelines| title = YouTube Community Guidelines | publisher = YouTube| accessdate =November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial areas have included [[Holocaust denial]] and the [[Hillsborough disaster]], in which 96 football fans from Liverpool were crushed to death in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =YouTube criticized in Germany over anti-Semitic Nazi videos|author=| publisher = Reuters| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/898004.html|accessdate=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Fury as YouTube carries sick Hillsboro video insult|author=| publisher = icLiverpool| url = http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=fury-as-youtube-carries-sick-hillsboro-video-insult%26method=full%26objectid=18729523%26page=1%26siteid=50061-name_page.html|accessdate=May 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's terms of service.&lt;ref name=&quot;guidelines&quot;/&gt; In July 2008, the Culture and Media Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] stated that it was &quot;unimpressed&quot; with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that &quot;proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting [[user-generated content]]&quot;. YouTube responded by stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =YouTube attacked by MPs over sex and violence footage|author=| publisher = The Daily Telegraph| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/07/31/dlyoutube131.xml|accessdate=August 21, 2008 | location=London | first1=James | last1=Kirkup | first2=Nicole | last2=Martin | date=July 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In October 2010, U.S. Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] urged YouTube to take down from its website videos of imam [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], saying that by hosting al-Awlaki's messages, &quot;We are facilitating the recruitment of homegrown terror&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/10/25/rep-weiner-calls-youtube-al-awlakis-videos/ |title=Al-Awlaki's YouTube Videos Targeted by Rep. Weiner |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=October 25, 2010 |accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; British security minister [[Pauline Neville-Jones]] commented: &quot;These Web sites would categorically not be allowed in the U.K. They incite cold-blooded murder, and as such are surely contrary to the public good.&quot; In November 2010, YouTube removed from its site some of the hundreds of videos featuring al-Awlaki's calls to ''[[jihad]]''. It stated that it had removed videos that violated the siteâs guidelines prohibiting &quot;dangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts&quot;, or came from accounts &quot;registered by a member of a designated [[foreign terrorist organization]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/world/05britain.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1289639324-GpxO1vB7vZ5y1qXSlTRnWA |title=YouTube Withdraws Clericâs Videos |publisher=The New York Times|date=November 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |first1=John F. |last1=Burns |first2=Miguel |last2=Helft}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, YouTube added &quot;promotes terrorism&quot; to the list of reasons that users can give when flagging a video as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =YouTube is letting users decide on terrorism-related videos|author=Bennett, Brian| publisher =[[Los Angeles Times]]| url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-youtube-terror-20101213,0,3375845.story|accessdate=December 14, 2010 | date=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== User comments ===
Most videos enable users to leave comments, and these have attracted attention for the negative aspects of both their form and content. When ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 2006 praised [[Web 2.0]] for enabling &quot;community and collaboration on a scale never seen before&quot;, it added that YouTube &quot;harnesses the stupidity of crowds as well as its wisdom. Some of the comments on YouTube make you weep for the future of humanity just for the spelling alone, never mind the obscenity and the naked hatred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1569514,00.html &quot;Time's Person of the Year: You&quot;], ''Time'', December 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 described users' comments on YouTube as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;Juvenile, aggressive, misspelled, sexist, homophobic, swinging from raging at the contents of a video to providing a pointlessly detailed description followed by a LOL, YouTube comments are a hotbed of infantile debate and unashamed ignorance â with the occasional burst of wit shining through.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2009/nov/03/youtube-funniest-comments &quot;Our top 10 funniest YouTube comments â what are yours?&quot;], ''The Guardian'', November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In September 2008, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' commented that YouTube was &quot;notorious&quot; for &quot;some of the most confrontational and ill-formed comment exchanges on the internet&quot;, and reported on YouTube Comment Snob, &quot;a new piece of software that blocks rude and illiterate posts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2668997/YouTubes-worst-comments-blocked-by-filter.html &quot;YouTube's worst comments blocked by filter&quot;], ''Daily Telegraph'', September 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
