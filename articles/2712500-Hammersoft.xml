'''Microsoft Office 2007''' (officially called '''2007 Microsoft Office System''') is a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office System]], [[Microsoft]]'s [[Office suite|productivity suite]]. Formerly known as '''Office 12''' in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was released to [[volume license key|volume license]] customers on November 30, 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hill | first =Brandon | title =Vista, Office 2007 Now Available for Volume Licensing | publisher =DailyTech | date= December 1, 2006 | url =http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=5165 | accessdate =2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made available to retail customers on January 30, 2007. These are, respectively, the same dates [[Windows Vista]] was released to volume licensing and retail customers. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new [[graphical user interface]] called the ''Fluent User Interface''&lt;ref&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/HA101679411033.aspx The Microsoft Office Fluent user interface overview]&lt;/ref&gt; (initially referred to as the [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon User Interface]]), replacing the menus and toolbars â which have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception â with a tabbed toolbar, known as the Ribbon. Office 2007 requires [[Windows XP]] with Service Pack 2 or higher, [[Windows Server 2003]] with Service Pack 1 or higher, Windows Vista or Windows 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;sysreqs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/HA101668651033.aspx |title=2007 Microsoft Office release system requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office 2007 is the last version of Microsoft Office which is officially supported on [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]].

The 'Ribbon User Interface' is a task-oriented Graphical User Interface ([[GUI]]). It features a central menu button, widely known as the 'Office Button'. The Ribbon Interface has been improved in [[Microsoft Office 2010]].

Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief among these is [[Microsoft Groove|Groove]], a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses, which was originally developed by [[Groove Networks]] before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is [[SharePoint#Microsoft Office SharePoint Server|Office SharePoint Server 2007]], a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports &quot;[[Excel Services]]&quot;, a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.

[[Microsoft FrontPage]] has been removed from the Office suite entirely. It has been replaced by [[Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer]], which is aimed towards development of [[Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007|SharePoint portals]]. Its designer-oriented counterpart [[Microsoft Expression Web]] is targeted for general web development. However, neither application has been included in Office 2007.

[[Speech recognition]] and [[handwriting recognition]] are now part of Windows Vista. Speech and ink components have been removed from Office 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletquestions.com/microsoft-office/34696-no-speech-recognition-office-2007-a.html No speech recognition in Office 2007?]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.more.net/archives/mo-bused/2007-March/009369.html Handwriting Recognition in Office 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Handwriting and speech recognition work with Office 2007 only on Windows Vista or [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]]. However, XP users can use an earlier version of Office to use speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Office Online. [http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA102243561033.aspx What happened to speech recognition?]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Forrester Research]], as of May 2010, Microsoft Office 2007 is used in 81% of enterprises it surveyed (its sample comprising 115 North American and European enterprise and SMB decision makers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/forrester-google-still-a-distant-office-competitor/6168 Forrester: Google still a distant Office competitor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The first beta of Microsoft Office 2007, referred to as ''Beta-1'' in emails sent to a limited number of testers, was released on November 16, 2005. The Beta-1 &lt;!-- do not remove hyphen from &quot;Beta-1&quot;; this is how it was written in the email sent out to testers --&gt;Technical Refresh was released to testers on March 13, 2006. The Technical Refresh fixed issues in installing with Windows Vista build 5308.

Microsoft revealed the Ribbon UI on March 9, 2006 at [[CeBIT]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jensenh/archive/2006/03/09/547281.aspx | title=Picture This: A New Look For Office | last=Harris | first=Jensen | work=An Office User Interface Blog | publisher=Microsoft | date=March 9, 2006 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Office 2007 Beta 2 was announced by [[Bill Gates]] at [[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference|WinHEC]] 2006, and was initially released to the public at no cost from Microsoft's web site. However, because of an unprecedented number of downloads, a fee of $1.50 was introduced for each product downloaded after August 2, 2006. The beta was updated on September 14, 2006 in Beta 2 Technical Refresh (Beta2TR). It included an updated user interface, better accessibility support, improvements in the robustness of the platform, and greater functionality.

The beta versions continued to function in a reduced functionality mode after February 1, 2007. If users downloaded the Technical Refresh to update Beta 2, then users could use its full functionality until March 31, 2007 for client products and May 15, 2007 for server products. The Beta program ended on November 8, 2006, when Microsoft declared the product &quot;[[Release to Manufacturing|Released to Manufacturing]]&quot; (RTM) and started manufacturing the final product. After RTM, the availability of the beta download ended.

Office 2007 was released to volume licensing customers on November 30, 2006, and to the general public on January 30, 2007.

==New features==
===User interface===
The new user interface (UI), officially known as ''Fluent User Interface'',&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/2007office/docs/2007OfficeUIFS.doc |title=Microsoft Office Fluent User Interface |accessdate=2007-02-05 |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/developer/how_fluent_are_you_with_office_2007.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535|title=How 'Fluent' Are You in Office 2007?|2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been implemented in the core Microsoft Office applications: [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Access|Access]], and in the item inspector used to create or edit individual items in [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]]. These applications have been selected for the UI overhaul because they center around document authoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/09/30/475687.aspx|title=What programs get the new Office UI?|accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the applications in the suite will also be changed to the new UI in subsequent versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/office2007_beta2.asp|title=Office 2007 Beta 2 UI Review|accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The default font used in this edition is [[Calibri]]. Original prototypes of the new user interface were revealed at [[MIX (Microsoft)|MIX]] 2008 in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istartedsomething.com/20080308/office-2007-interface-prototypes/ Office 2007 interface prototypes - istartedsomething]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office button====
[[File:Office2007toolbar.png|thumb|135px|right|Office Button in Microsoft PowerPoint]]
The Office 2007 button, located on the top-left of the window, replaces the File menu and provides access to functionality common across all Office applications, including opening, saving, printing, and sharing a file. It can also close the application. Users can also choose color schemes for the interface. A notable [[Assistive technology|accessibility]] improvement is that the Office button follows [[Fitt's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/08/22/711808.aspx Giving You Fitts: Jensen Harris' blog ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ribbon {{Anchor|The_Ribbon}}====
{{Main|Ribbon (computing)}}
The ''[[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]]'', a panel that houses a fixed arrangement of command buttons and icons, organizes commands as a set of ''[[Tab (GUI)|tabs]]'', each grouping relevant commands. The Ribbon is present in Microsoft Word 2007, Excel 2007, PowerPoint 2007, Access 2007 and some Outlook 2007 windows. The Ribbon is not user customizable in Office 2007. Each application has a different set of tabs which expose the functionality that application offers. For example, while Excel has a tab for the graphing capabilities, Word does not; instead it has tabs to control the formatting of a text document. Within each tab, various related options may be grouped together. The ''Ribbon'' is designed to make the features of the application more discoverable and accessible with fewer mouse clicks&lt;ref name=&quot;Office UI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/ui/overview.mspx|title=The New Microsoft Office User Interface Overview|accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as compared to the menu-based UI used prior to Office 2007. However, many users feel that the existing menus should have been left alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cro.alienpants.com/index.php/2007/03/14/word-2007-the-feature-i-hate-most/|title=Word 2007 the feature i hate most(blog)|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/groupAnswers?viewQuestionAndAnswers=&amp;gid=64574&amp;discussionID=15602762|title=Word 2007 Lawyers should just say no|accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online survey reports the ribbon menu has decreased productivity by an average of 20% for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exceluser.com/explore/surveys/ribbon/ribbon-survey-results.htm|title=Ribbon survey results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving the mouse scroll wheel while on any of the tabs on the ribbon cyclesâthrough the tabs. The Ribbon can be minimized by double clicking the active section's title, such as the Home text in the picture below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA100898951033.aspx|title=Microsoft: Use the Ribbon|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without third party add-ins, it is not possible to remove the Ribbon, modify it, or replace it with menus with the normal Office 2007 functions. There are third party add-ins which can be purchased that can bring menus and toolbars to Office 2007 as well as add-ins which allow users to customize the Ribbon commands. Add-ins that restore the ability to use a standard Windows menus and toolbars interface include Classic Menu for Office,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.addintools.com Classic Menu for Office&lt;/ref&gt; ToolbarToggle,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/27578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cw&quot;&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9017851/Hands_on_Show_Office_2007_who_s_the_boss&lt;/ref&gt; and Ubitmenu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,84834-order,4/description.html|title=Editorial Review of UBitMenu|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=2011-10-26|author=Rick Broida}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others like RibbonCustomizer enable the customization of the Ribbon interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;cw&quot;/&gt; Office 2010 does allow user customization of the ribbon out of the box.
{{wide image|Office2007ribbon.png|1800px''[[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]]'' in Microsoft PowerPoint 2007.}}

====Contextual Tabs====
Some tabs, called ''Contextual Tabs'', appear only when certain objects are selected. Contextual Tabs expose functionality specific only to the object with focus. For example, selecting a picture brings up the ''Pictures'' tab, which presents options for dealing with the picture. Similarly, focusing on a table exposes table-related options in a specific tab. Contextual Tabs remain hidden except when an applicable object is selected.

====Live Preview====
Microsoft Office 2007 also introduces a feature called &quot;Live Preview&quot;, which temporarily applies formatting on the focused text or object when any formatting button is moused-over. The temporary formatting is removed when the mouse pointer is moved from the button. This allows users to have a preview of how the option would affect the appearance of the object, without actually applying it.

====Mini Toolbar====

The new &quot;Mini Toolbar&quot; is a type of context menu that is automatically shown (by default) when text is selected. The purpose of this feature is to provide easy access to the most-used formatting commands without requiring a right-mouse-button click, as was necessary in older versions of the software. Because the Mini Toolbar is automatically displayed, it remains semi-transparent until the mouse pointer is situated on the control in order to allow an almost-unobstructed view of what is beneath it. It also appears above the right-click menu when a user right-clicks on a selection of words. The Mini Toolbar is currently not customizable, but can be turned off.

====Quick Access Toolbar====
The ''Quick Access toolbar'', which sits in the title bar, serves as a repository of most used functions, regardless of which application is being used, such as save, undo/redo and print. The ''Quick Access toolbar'' is customizable, although this feature is limited compared to toolbars in previous Office versions. Any command available in the entire Office application can be added to the ''Quick Access toolbar'', including commands not available in the Ribbon and [[macro (computer science)|macro]]s. Keyboard shortcuts for any of the commands on the toolbar are also fully customizable, similar to previous Office versions.

====Other UI features====
* ''Super-tooltips'', or screentips, that can house formatted text and even images, are used to provide detailed descriptions of what most buttons do.
* A zoom slider present in the bottom-right corner, allowing for dynamic and rapid magnification of documents.
* The status bar is fully customizable. Users can right click the status bar and add or remove what they want the status bar to display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jensenh/archive/2006/01/05/509645.aspx Status Bar Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

===SmartArt===
SmartArt, found under the Insert tab in the ribbon in PowerPoint, Word, Excel, and Outlook, is a new group of editable and formatted diagrams. There are 115 preset SmartArt graphics layout templates in categories such as list, process, cycle, and hierarchy. When an instance of a SmartArt is inserted, a ''Text Pane'' appears next to it to guide the user through entering text in the hierarchical levels. Each SmartArt graphic, based on its design, maps the text outline, automatically resized for best fit, onto the graphic. There are a number of &quot;quick styles&quot; for each graphic that apply largely different 3D effects to the graphic, and the graphic's shapes and text can be formatted through shape styles and [[WordArt]] styles. In addition, SmartArt graphics change their colors, fonts, and effects to match the document's theme.

===File formats===
====Office Open XML====
{{Main|Microsoft Office 2007 filename extensions}}
Microsoft Office 2007 introduced a new file format, called [[Office Open XML]], as the default file format. Such files are saved using an extra X letter in their extension (.docx/xlsx/pptx/etc.). However, it can still save documents in the old format which is compatible with previous versions. Alternatively, Microsoft has made available a free add-on known as the ''Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack'' that lets Office 2000, XP, and 2003 open, edit, and save documents created under the newer 2007 format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en | title=Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Office Open XML is based on [[XML]] and uses the [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] file container. According to Microsoft, documents created in this format are up to 75% smaller than the same documents saved with previous Microsoft Office file formats, owing to the ZIP data compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/developers/filefaq.mspx|title=File formats|accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Files containing macros are saved with an extra M letter in their extension instead (.docm/xlsm/pptm/etc.).

====PDF====
Initially, Microsoft promised to support exporting to [[Portable Document Format|Portable Document Format (PDF)]] in Office 2007. However, due to legal objections from [[Adobe Systems]], Office 2007 originally did not offer PDF support out of the box, but rather as a separate free download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2006/06/02/613702.aspx|title=Legal issues around PDF support|accessdate=2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/brian_jones/archive/2006/06/03/616022.aspx|title=Follow-up on PDF legal issues|accessdate=2006-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041&amp;displaylang=en SaveasPDFandXPS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, starting with Service Pack 2, Office allows users to natively export PDF files.&lt;ref name=&quot;'sp2'&quot;&gt;{{cite web

====XPS====
Office 2007 documents can also be exported as [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] documents.  This is part of service pack 2 and prior to that, was available as a free plug-in in a separate download.&lt;ref name=&quot;'sp2'&quot;/&gt;

====OpenDocument====
{{Main|OpenDocument software#Third party support: Two ODF plug-ins for Microsoft Office|l1=OpenDocument software}}

Microsoft backs an open-source effort to support [[OpenDocument]] in Office 2007, as well as earlier versions (up to Office 2000), through a converter add-in for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and also a [[command line interface|command-line]] utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter|title=OpenDocument to Office Open XML conversion|accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the project supports conversion between ODF and Office Open XML file formats for all three applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=169337|title=OpenXML/ODF Translator Add-in for Office Downloads|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ODF Alliance]] this support falls short and substantial improvements are still needed for interoperability in real-world situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odfalliance.org/blog/index.php/site/microsofts_odf_support_falls_short/ |title=Microsoftâs ODF Support Falls Short |accessdate=2009-05-22 |date=2009-05-19 |work=Open Document Alliance |publisher=[[ODF Alliance]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=18317 |title=In Office SP2, Microsoft manages to reduce interoperability |accessdate=2009-05-23 |last=Allison |first=Jeremy |date=2009-05-19 |work=ZDNet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Third-party plugins able to read, edit and save to the ISO-standard Open Document Format (ODF) are available as a separate download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/software/star/odf_plugin/specs.jsp|title=Sun ODF Plugin 1.1 for Microsoft Office: Tech Specs|publisher=[[Sun Microsystems]]|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/92193|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070711183610/http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/92193|archivedate=2007-07-11|title=Sun's OpenDocument filter for MS Office is finished.|publisher=[[Heise Online]]|accessdate=2007-07-06|date=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Office 2007 Service Pack 2 adds native support for the [[OpenDocument]] Format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=32228 | title=Office 2007 won't support ISO's OOXML | first=David | last=Worthington | work=[[SD Times]] | date=May 21, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ODF Alliance]] has released test results on ODF support of Office 2007 SP2,&lt;ref name=&quot;odfalliance&quot;&gt;[http://www.odfalliance.org/resources/fact-sheet-Microsoft-ODF-support.pdf MS Office 2007 Service Pack 2 With Support for ODF: How Well Does It Work?], OpenDocument Format (ODF) Alliance â www.odfalliance.org&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that Office ODF support, both SP2 and other add-ons, have &quot;serious shortcomings that, left unaddressed, would break the open standards based interoperability that the marketplace, especially governments, is demanding&quot;. Particularly, SP2 has no support for encrypted ODF files and has limited interoperability with other ODF spreadsheet implementations.

The ISO/IEC 26300 OpenDocument standard specifies [[encryption|encryption of files]], which is based on [[sha1]], [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], and RFC 2898.
Microsoft Office 2007 SP2 does not support reading and writing encrypted (password protected) ODF files.&lt;ref name=&quot;odfalliance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |coauthors=Stephen Peront (site) |title=OASIS ODF 1.1 &gt; Specification Outline &gt; ''17'' Packages &gt; ''17.3'' Encryption |work=Document Interop Initiative |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |at=Rightmost frame: Implementation Notes List |date=2009-12-14 |url=http://www.documentinteropinitiative.org/implnotes/oasisodf1.1/P1-0017.0003.aspx |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fragmentodf/&gt; Users are presented with a message: âcannot use password protection using the ODF format.â&lt;ref name=&quot;odfalliance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fragmentodf&quot;&gt;[http://homembit.com/2009/05/microsoft-now-attempt-to-fragment-odf.html Microsoft now attempt to fragment ODF | void life(void)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISO/IEC 26300 OpenDocument standard has no spreadsheet formula language included (or referenced) in the standard specification. Office 2007 SP2 uses the spreadsheet formula language specified in the ISO/IEC 29500 [[Office Open XML]] [[open standard]] when creating ODF documents. According to the ODF Alliance report &quot;ODF spreadsheets created in Excel 2007 SP2 do not in fact conform to ODF 1.1 because Excel 2007 incorrectly encodes formulas with cell addresses. Section 8.3.1 of ODF 1.1 says that addresses in formulas &quot;start with a &quot;[&quot; and end with a &quot;]&quot;.&quot; In Excel 2007 cell addresses were not enclosed with the necessary [[Bracket#Box brackets or square brackets|square brackets]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;odfalliance&quot;/&gt; The ISO/IEC 26300 specification states that the semantics and the syntax is dependant on the used namespace which is implementation dependent leaving the syntax implementation defined as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1/Subcommittee 34 |title=Information technology â Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0 |work=International Standard |id=ISO/IEC 26300:2006 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |place=Switzerland |date=2006-12-01 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43485 |accessdate=2010-01-10 |authorlink=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft stated that they consider adding support for an official ODF formula language ([[OpenFormula]]), once a future version of the ISO/IEC 26300 standard specification includes one.&lt;ref name=&quot;dmahugh_1-2-1&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/dmahugh/archive/2009/05/09/1-2-1.aspx 1 + 2 = 1? - Doug Mahugh - Site Home - MSDN Blogs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's ODF spreadsheet support in SP2 is not fully inter-operable with other implementations of OpenDocument, such as the IBM Symphony, which use the non-standardized OpenOffice.org 2.x formula language, and OpenOffice.org 3.x, which uses a draft of OpenFormula.&lt;ref name=&quot;antic1&quot;&gt;[http://www.robweir.com/blog/2009/05/update-on-odf-spreadsheet.html Update on ODF Spreadsheet Interoperability]&lt;/ref&gt; The company had previously reportedly stated that &quot;where ODF 1.1 is ambiguous or incomplete, the Office implementation can be guided by current practice in OpenOffice.org, mainly, and other implementations including KOffice and AbiWord. Peter Amstein and the Microsoft Office team are reluctant to make liberal use of extension mechanisms, even though provided in ODF 1.1. They want to avoid all appearance of an embrace-extend attempt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mwork&quot;&gt;[http://orcmid.com/blog/2008/08/microsoft-odf-interoperability-workshop.asp Orcmid's Lair: Microsoft ODF Interoperability Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[EU]] investigated Microsoft Office OpenDocument Format support to see if it provided consumers greater choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2257119220080522 | title=EU says to study Microsoft's open-source step | agency=Reuters | first=Huw | last=Jones | first2=Ingrid | last2=Melander | date=May 22, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metadata===
In Office 2007, Microsoft introduced the ''Document Inspector'', an integral [[metadata removal tool]] which strips Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents of information such as author name and comments and other &quot;metadata&quot;.

===User assistance system===
In Microsoft Office 2007, the [[Office Assistant]]s have been eliminated in favour of a new online help system. One of its features is the extensive use of Super Tooltips, which explain in about one paragraph what each function performs. Some of them also use diagrams or pictures. These appear and disappear like normal tooltips, and replace normal tooltips in many areas. The Help content also directly integrates searching and viewing [[Office Online]] articles.

===Collaboration features===
====SharePoint====
Microsoft Office 2007 includes features geared towards collaboration and data sharing. As such, Microsoft Office 2007 features server components for applications such as Excel, which work in conjunction with [[SharePoint|SharePoint Services]], to provide a collaboration platform. SharePoint works with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, which is used to host a SharePoint site, and uses [[Internet Information Server|IIS]] and [[ASP.NET|ASP.NET 2.0]]. Excel server exposes Excel Services, which allows any worksheet to be created, edited and maintained via web browsers. It features ''Excel Web Access'', the client-side component which is used to render the worksheet on a browser, ''Excel Calculation Service'' which is the server side component which populates the worksheet with data and perform calculations, and ''Excel Web Services'' that extends Excel functionalities into individual web services. SharePoint can also be used to host Word documents for [[collaborative editing]], by sharing a document. SharePoint can also be used to hold PowerPoint slides in a ''Slide Library'', from which the slides can be used as a formatting template. It will also notify users of a slide automatically in case the source slide is modified. Also by using SharePoint, PowerPoint can manage shared review of presentations. Any SharePoint hosted document can be accessed from the application which created the document or from other applications such as a browser or Microsoft Office Outlook.

====Groove====

Microsoft Office 2007 also includes ''Groove'', which brings collaborative features to a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm. ''Groove'' can host documents, including presentations, workbooks and others, created in Microsoft Office 2007 application in a shared workspace, which can then be used in collaborative editing of documents. ''Groove'' can also be used in managing workspace sessions, including access control of the workspace. To collaborate on one or more documents, a ''Workspace'' has to be created, and then those who are to work on it have to be invited. Any file shared on the workspace are automatically shared among all participants. The application also provides real-time messaging, including one-to-one as well as group messaging, and presence features, as well as monitoring workspace activities with alerts, which are raised when pre-defined set of activities are detected. Groove also provides features for conflict resolution for conflicting edits. Schedules for a collaboration can also be decided by using a built-in shared calendar, which can also be used to keep track of the progress of a project. However, the calendar is not compatible with Microsoft Outlook.

===Themes and Quick Styles===
Microsoft Office 2007 places more emphasis on Document Themes and Quick Styles. The Document Theme defines the colors, fonts and graphic effects for a document. Almost everything that can be inserted into a document is automatically styled to match the overall document theme creating a consistent document design. The new Office Theme file format (.THMX) is shared between Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook email messages. Similar themes are also available for data reports in Access and Project or shapes in Visio.

Quick Styles are galleries with a range of styles based on the current theme. There are quick styles galleries for text, tables, charts, SmartArt, WordArt and more. The style range goes from simple/light to more graphical/darker.

==Application-specific changes==
===Microsoft Office Word===
{{Main|Microsoft Word}}
[[File:MS Word 2007.png|thumb|right|Microsoft Office Word 2007]]
[[File:Word 2007 screenshot Edward tbp.jpg|thumb|Word 2007 introduced many new image editing abilities that change the shape, borders and colours of an image.]]
* New style sheets (quick styles) and ability to switch easily among them.
* Default Font now 'Calibri' not 'Times New Roman', as featured in previous Office editions.
* Word count listed by default in the status bar. The word count dynamically updates as you type.
* New ''contextual spell checker'', signified by a wavy blue underline analogous to the traditional wavy red underline for misspellings and wavy green underline for grammar errors, sometimes catches incorrect usage of correctly spelled words, such as in &quot;I think we will ''loose'' this battle&quot;.
* ''Translation tool tip'' option available for English (U.S.), French (France), and Spanish (International Sort). When selected, hovering the mouse cursor over a word will display its translation in the particular language. Non-English versions have different sets of languages. Other languages can be added by using a separate multilingual pack.
* Automated generation of citations and bibliographies according to defined style rules, including APA, Chicago, and MLA. Changing style updates all references automatically. Connect to web services to access online reference databases.
* Rearchitected native [[Microsoft Equation Editor|mathematical equation]] support with [[TeX]]-like linear input/edit language or GUI interface. Also supports the Unicode Plain Text Encoding of Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |title=Unicode Nearly Plain-Text Encoding of Mathematics |publisher=Unicode, Inc. |format=PDF |date=April 4, 2006 |url=http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn28/UTN28-PlainTextMath.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preset gallery of cover pages with fields for Author, Title, Date, Abstract, etc. Cover pages follow the theme of the document (found under the Page Layout tab).
* Document comparison engine updated to support moves, differences in tables, and also easy to follow tri-pane view of original document, new document, and differences.
* Full screen reading layout that shows two pages at a time with maximal screen usage, plus a few critical tools for reviewing.
* ''Building Blocks'', which lets one save frequently used content, so that they are easily accessible for further use. Building blocks can have data mapped controls in them to allow for form building or structured document authoring.
* The ability to save multiple versions of a document (which had existed since Word 97) has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What happened to versioning? |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/HA102193321033.aspx?pid=CH100626291033 |accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microsoft Office Outlook===
[[File:Outlook 07.png|thumb|right|Microsoft Office Outlook 2007]]
{{Main|Microsoft Outlook}}
* As a major change in Outlook 2007, Exchange 5.5 support has been dropped. Like [[Novell Evolution|Evolution]], [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Entourage|Entourage]], Outlook now works only with Exchange 2000 and above.
* Outlook now indexes&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer World Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9000690&amp;pageNumber=1|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014193821/http://computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9000690&amp;pageNumber=1|archivedate=2007-10-14|title=Computer World Review|accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (using the [[Windows Search]] APIs) the e-mails, contacts, tasks, calendar entries, [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feeds and other items, to speed up searches. As such, it features word-wheeled search, which displays results as characters are being typed in.
* Search folders, which are saved searches, have been updated to include RSS feeds as well. Search folders can be created with a specific search criteria, specifying the subject, type and other attributes of the information being searched. When a search folder is opened, all matching items for the search are automatically retrieved and grouped up.
* Outlook now supports text-messages and [[SMS]]s, when used in conjunction with Exchange Server 2007 Unified Messaging.
* Outlook includes a reader for RSS feeds, which used the Windows Common Feeds Store. RSS subscription URLs can be shared via e-mails. RSS feed updates can also be pushed to a mobile device.
* Outlook can now support multiple calendars being worked with, simultaneously. It also includes a side-by-side view for calendars, where each calendar is displayed in a different tab, and allows easy comparison of them. Outlook also supports web calendars. Calendars can be shared with other users.
* Calendar view shows which tasks are due.
* Flagged e-mails and notes can also be converted to ''Task'' items.
* Outlook includes a ''To Do Bar'', which integrates the calendar, appointments and tasks items, in a concise view.
* Online or offline editing of all Microsoft Office 2007 documents via a SharePoint site. All edits are automatically synchronized.
* Contacts can be shared among users, via e-mail, Exchange Server or a SharePoint site.
* Attachment preview allows users to view Office e-mail attachments in the reading pane rather than having to open another program.
* HTML in e-mails is now rendered using the Microsoft Word rendering engine which [[Microsoft Outlook#HTML rendering|disallows]] several HTML tags like ''object'', ''script'', ''iframe'' etc. along with several CSS properties.

Microsoft Office Outlook can also include an optional Business Contact Manager (included on a separate installation disc in Office 2007 Small Business and above) which allows management of business contacts and their sales and marketing activities. Phone calls, e-mails, appointments, notes and other business metrics can be managed for each contact. It can also keep a track of billable time for each contact on the Outlook Calendar. Based on these data, a consolidated report view can be generated by Microsoft Office Outlook with Business Contact Manager. The data can be further analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel. This data can also be shared using SharePoint Services.

===Microsoft Office Excel===
[[File:Microsoft Office Excel 2007.png|thumb|right|Microsoft Office Excel 2007]]
[[File:databar.PNG|thumb|right|Color Scales, Icon Sets, and Data Bars in Excel 2007]]
{{Main|Microsoft Excel}}
* Support up to 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns (XFD) in a single worksheet, with 32,767 characters in a single cell (17,179,869,184 cells in a worksheet, 562,932,773,552,128 characters in a worksheet)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* ''Conditional Formatting'' introduces support for three new features â ''Color Scales'', ''Icon Sets'' and ''Data Bars''
** ''Color Scales'', which automatically color the background of a group of cells with different colors according to the values.
** ''Icon sets'', which precede the text in a cell with an icon that represent some aspect of the value of the cell with respect to other values in a group of cells, can also be applied. Icons can be conditionally applied to show up only when certain criteria are met, such as a cross showing up on an invalid value, where the condition for invalidity can be specified by the user.
** ''Data Bars'' show as a gradient bar in the background of a cell the contribution of the cell value in the group.
* Column titles can optionally show options to control the layout of the column.
* Multithreaded calculation of formulae, to speed up large calculations, especially on multi-core/multi-processor systems.
* ''User Defined Functions'' (UDF), which are custom functions written to supplement Excel's set of built-in functions, supports the increased number of cells and columns. UDFs now can also be multithreaded. Server side UDFs are based on the [[.NET Framework|.NET Managed]] code.
* Importing data from external sources, such as a database, has been upgraded. Data can also be imported from formatted tables and reports, which do not have a regular grid structure.
* ''Formula Autocomplete'', automatically suggests function names, arguments and named ranges, and automatically completing them if desired, based on the characters entered. Formulae can refer to a table as well.
* ''CUBE functions'' which allow importing data, including set aggregated data, from data analysis services, such as SQL Server Analysis Services.
* ''Page Layout'' view, to author spreadsheets in a way that mirrors the formatting that will be applied when printed.
* ''PivotTables'', which are used to create analysis reports out of sets of data, can now support hierarchical data by displaying a row in the table with a &quot;+&quot; icon, which, when clicked, shows more rows regarding it, which can also be hierarchical. PivotTables can also be sorted and filtered independently, and conditional formatting used to highlight trends in the data.
* ''Filters'', now includes a Quick filter option allowing the selection of multiple items from a drop down list of items in the column. The option to filter based on color has been added to the choices available.
* Excel features a new charting engine, which supports advanced formatting, including 3D rendering, transparencies and shadows. Chart layouts can also be customized to highlight various trends in the data.

==Server components==
===SharePoint Server 2007===
{{Main|Microsoft Office SharePoint Server}}
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 allows sharing and collaborative editing of Office 2007 documents. It allows central storage of documents and management of Office documents, throughout the enterprise. These documents can be accessed either by the applications which created them, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, or a web browser. Documents can also be managed through pre-defined policies that let users create and publish shared content, through a SharePoint site.

SharePoint Server allows searching of all Office documents which are being managed by it, centrally, thereby making data more accessible. It also provides access control for documents. Specialized server components can plug into the SharePoint Server to extend the functionality of the server, such as ''Excel Services'' exposing data analysis services for Excel services. Data from other data sources can also be merged with Office data.

SharePoint also lets users personalize the SharePoint sites, filtering content they are interested in. SharePoint documents can also be locally cached by clients for offline editing; the changes are later merged.

===Forms Server 2007===
{{Main|Microsoft Office Forms Server}}
Microsoft Office Forms Server 2007 allows InfoPath forms to be accessed and filled out using any browser, including mobile phone browsers. Forms Server 2007 also supports using a database or other data source as the back-end for the form. Additionally, it allows centralized deployment and management of forms. Forms Server 2007 hosted forms also support data validation and conditional formatting, as does their InfoPath counterpart. It also supports advanced controls like ''Repeating section'' and ''Repeating table''. However, some InfoPath controls cannot be used if it has to be hosted on a Forms server.

===Groove Server 2007===
{{Main|Microsoft Office Groove Server}}
Microsoft Office Groove Server 2007 is for centrally managing all deployments of [[Microsoft Office Groove]] 2007 in the enterprise. It enables using [[Active Directory]] for Groove user accounts, and create Groove ''Domains'', with individual policy settings. It allows Groove workspaces to be hosted at the server, and the files in the workspaces made available for collaborative editing via the Groove client. It also includes the ''Groove Server Data Bridge'' component to allow communication between data stored at both Groove clients and servers and external applications.

===Project Server 2007===
{{Main|Microsoft Office Project Server}}
Microsoft Office Project Server 2007 allows one to centrally manage and coordinate projects. It allows budget and resource tracking, and activity plan management. The project data and reports can also be further analyzed using ''Cube Building Service''. The project management data can be accessed from a browser as well.

===Project Portfolio Server 2007===
{{Main|Microsoft Office Project Portfolio Server}}
Microsoft Office Project Portfolio Server 2007 allows creation of a project portfolio, including workflows, hosted centrally, so that the information is available throughout the enterprise, even from a browser. It also aids in centralized data aggregation regarding the project planning and execution, and in visualizing and analyzing the data to optimize the project plan. It can also support multiple portfolios per project, to track different aspects of it. It also includes reporting tools to create consolidated reports out of the project data.

===PerformancePoint Server 2007===
{{Main|Microsoft Office PerformancePoint Server}}
Microsoft PerformancePoint Server allows users to monitor, analyze, and plan their business as well as drive alignment, accountability, and actionable insight across the entire organization. It includes features for scorecards, dashboards, reporting, analytics, budgeting and forecasting, among others.

==Removed features==
The following Office 2003 features have been removed in Office 2007:
* Fully customizable [[toolbar]]s and menus for all of its applications &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/andrewkantor/2006-11-22-ie7-office2007_x.htm Microsoft takes a step backward with IE7, Office 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Quick Access Toolbar and the Ribbon have limited customizability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pschmid.net/blog/2006/10/18/68 Customizing Office 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Office 2010 reintroduced ribbon UI customizability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee523661.aspx User interface differences in Office 2010 from earlier versions of Microsoft Office]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Office Assistant]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/what-happened-to-the-office-assistant-HA010047975.aspx What happened to the Office Assistant?]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Speech recognition (included as part of [[Windows Vista]] and later) &lt;ref&gt;[http://atcubed.blogspot.com/2008/03/getting-speech-recognition-back-into-ms.html Getting Speech Recognition Back into MS Office 2007 on Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.in.gov/octe/bme/curriculum/docs/SpeechRemovedFromOffice2007.pdf Speech Recognition Removed from Office 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Handwriting recognition and ink features (included as part of [[Windows Vista]] and later) &lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.techarena.in/ms-office-support/853159.htm How can i set up handwriting recognition in Office 2007? ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlbarksdale.com/2006/09/upgrading-digitools-to-windows-vista.html Upgrading Digitools to Windows Vista and Office 2007 and what it may mean for speech and handwriting instruction]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ability to [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstream]] [[service pack]]s into the original setup files (administrative installation images) &lt;ref name=&quot;MigrationReference&quot;&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc178954(office.12).aspx Changes in the 2007 Office system]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Office Web Components]] &lt;ref name=&quot;MigrationReference&quot;/&gt;

* Choice of local installation source allowing users to choose whether to keep a locally cached copy of installation source files or remove it. Setup files are now cached locally without user preference and cannot be removed. They are recreated by Office 2007 if removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/924616 Description of the Local Install Source feature in 2007 Office programs]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several deployment-related utility [[Resource Kit|resource kit]] tools. Some primary deployment tools ship with Office 2007 itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc303401(office.12).aspx 2007 Office Resource Kit]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Office FileSearch object and File Search functionality from File menu &lt;ref name=&quot;MigrationReference&quot;/&gt;

==Criticism==
===Ribbons===
Even though the ribbon can be hidden, ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' wrote that the new &quot;ribbon&quot; interface crowds the Office work area, especially for notebook users.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, Michael. &quot;Office Beta: Good Looks, Tricky Formats&quot; ''PC World'' (August 2006), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Others have called its large icons distracting.&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, Edward. &quot;MS Office Edges Closer&quot;, ''PC Magazine,'' Vol. 25, Issue 12 (July, 2006) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the GUI-type interface of the ribbon contrasts sharply with the older menus that were organized according to the typical functions undertaken in paper-based offices: for instance, the old &quot;File&quot; menu dealt with opening, (re-)naming, saving, and printing a file, and the old &quot;Edit&quot; menu dealt with making changes to the content of the file. As a result, users who were more familiar with the logic of the old menus would feel some frustration with the new, more visually oriented ribbon. ''PC World'' has stated that upgrading to Office 2007 presents dangers to certain data, such as templates, macros, and mail messages.&lt;ref&gt;Luhn, Robert. &quot;Get Ready to Work With Office 2007's New Formats&quot; ''PC World,'' Vol. 25, Issue 4 (April 2007) p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The ribbon cannot be moved from the top to the side of the page, as floating toolbars could be.

Some users with experience using previous versions of Microsoft Office have complained about having to find features in the Ribbon. Others state that having learnt to use the new interface, it has improved the speed with which &quot;professional-looking&quot; documents can be created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redmondmag.com/features/article.asp?editorialsid=2346 Word 2007: Not Exactly a Must-Have]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has released a series of small programs,&lt;ref name=&quot;searchcommands&quot;&gt;[http://www.officelabs.com/projects/searchcommands/Pages/default.aspx Microsoft Office Labs Search Commands]&lt;/ref&gt; help sheets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/training/HA102295841033.aspx Guides to the Ribbon: Use Office 2003 menus to learn the Office 2007 user interface - Training - Microsoft Office]&lt;/ref&gt; videos&lt;ref&gt;[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA101679481033.aspx The Microsoft Office Fluent user interface video]&lt;/ref&gt; and add-ins&lt;ref name=&quot;getstartedaddin&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=f587370c-fdae-4ede-b528-ac58031a5dff Microsoft Download Center: Word 2007 Add-in: Get Started Tab for Word 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; to help users learn the new interface more quickly.

====Patenting controversy====
{{further|[[Ribbon (computing)#Controversy]]}}
Microsoft contractor [[Mike Gunderloy]] left Microsoft partially over his disagreement with the company's &quot;sweeping [[land grab]]&quot; including its attempt to patent the Ribbon interface. He says &quot;Microsoft itself represents a grave threat to the future of software development through its increasing inclination to stifle competition through legal shenanigans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Office Open XML ===
The new XML-based document file format in Microsoft Office 2007 is incompatible with previous versions of Microsoft Office unless an add-on is installed for the older version.&lt;ref name=&quot;compatibilitypack&quot;&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/924074 Microsoft KB 924074], &quot;''How to open and save Word 2007, Excel 2007, and PowerPoint 2007 files in earlier versions of Office programs''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Microsoft Word 2007 equation editor, which uses [[MathML]], is also incompatible with that of Microsoft Word 2003 and previous versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;science-stance-on-docx&quot; /&gt; Upon converting Microsoft Word 2007 .docx files to .doc files, equations are rendered as graphics.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} On June 6, 2007, Inera Inc. revealed that ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' refused to accept manuscripts prepared in Microsoft Word 2007 .docx format; subsequently Inera Inc. informed Microsoft that Microsoft Word 2007's file format impairs usability for scholarly publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inera.com/word2007docx.shtml Inera Inc. - Word 2007 DOCX File Format]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|04|25}} ''Nature'' still does not support Office Open XML format;&lt;ref name=&quot;science-stance-on-docx&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  |quote = Acceptable formats for the manuscript are Microsoft Word (preferred), PostScript (PS, EPS or PRN), PDF, WordPerfect, Rich Text Format (RTF), TeX and plain text (TXT). If using Word 2007, please create the document in Compatibility Mode (i.e. as a Word 97-2003 document; saved as .doc, not .docx).
}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Science'' however, accepts this format but discourages its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/contribinfo/prep/docx.xhtml
  |title = Users of Word 2007/DOCX
  |work = Information for Authors
  |publisher = [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
  |accessdate = 2011-04-25
  |quote  = Science can now accept manuscripts prepared in Word 2007 and its .docx format, both at submission and revision. However, we strongly discourage the use of the Word 2007 equation editor. Instead please use Mathtype or Word's legacy equation editor, which can be obtained through the &quot;Insert&quot; ribbon and the &quot;Object menu&quot; on the &quot;text&quot; panel.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bibliographies ===
The new Word 2007 features for bibliographies only support a small number of fixed citation styles. Using XSLT, new styles can be added. Some extra styles, such as the standard [[Association for Computing Machinery]] publication format, are made freely available by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
