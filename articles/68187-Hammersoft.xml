'''Futbol Club Barcelona''' ({{IPA-ca|fubËbÉÉ« ËkÉ«ub bÉrsÉËÉ«onÉ|-|Futbol Club Barcelona - name.ogg}}, {{lang-en|Football Club Barcelona}}), also known as '''Barcelona''' and familiarly as '''BarÃ§a''',&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced {{IPA-ca|Ëbar.sÉ|}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional [[Football team|football club]], based in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

Founded in 1899 by a group of [[Switzerland|Swiss]], [[England|English]] and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] footballers led by [[Joan Gamper]], the club has become a symbol of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] culture and [[Catalanism]], hence the motto ''&quot;MÃ©s que un club&quot;'' (English: More than a club). The official BarÃ§a anthem is the &quot;[[Cant del BarÃ§a]]&quot; written by Jaume Picas and [[Josep Maria EspinÃ s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/historia/simbols/himne.html|title= FC Barcelona Hymn| publisher=FC Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other football clubs, the [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|supporters]] own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's [[Deloitte Football Money League|second richest football club]] in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of â¬398 million. The club holds a long-standing rivalry with [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and matches between the two teams are referred to as &quot;[[El ClÃ¡sico]]&quot;.

They are the current [[La Liga|Spanish]] and [[UEFA Champions League|European]] football champions, and [[Football records in Spain|have won the most domestic trophies]] in [[Football in Spain|Spanish football]], having won 21 [[La Liga]], 25 [[Copa del Rey]], 10 [[Supercopa de EspaÃ±a]], 3 [[Copa Eva Duarte]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The 1953&quot;&gt;The [[Copa Eva Duarte]] was only recognized and organized with that name by the RFEF from 1947 until 1953, and therefore Barcelona's &quot;Copa de Oro Argentina&quot; win of 1945 is not included in this count, i.e. only the 1948, 1952 and 1953 trophies are.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 [[Copa de la Liga]] trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In [[List of confederation and inter-confederation club competition winners|international club football]] Barcelona have won four [[UEFA Champions League]], a record four [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], four [[UEFA Super Cup]] and one [[FIFA Club World Cup]] trophies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football Europe: FC Barcelona&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/footballeurope/club=50080/domestic.html|title=Football Europe: FC Barcelona|publisher=[[Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also won a record three [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] trophies, considered the predecessor to the [[UEFA Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;Considered a major title by FIFA (see FIFA.com F.C. Barcelona's profile at http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=44217/) but generally not an official title, as the competition was not organized by [[UEFA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only European club to have played continental football every season since 1955, and one of the only three clubs to have never been relegated from [[La Liga]], along with [[Athletic Bilbao]] and [[Real Madrid]]. In 2009, Barcelona became the first club in Spain to win [[Treble (association football)|the treble]] consisting of [[2008â09 La Liga|La Liga]], [[2008â09 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], and the [[2008â09 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. That same year, it also became the first football club ever to win six out of six competitions in a single year, thus completing [[The Sextuple|the sextuple]], comprising the aforementioned treble and the [[2009 Supercopa de EspaÃ±a|Spanish Super Cup]], [[2009 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] and [[2009 FIFA Club World Cup|FIFA Club World Cup]].

==History==
{{Main|History of FC Barcelona}}

===Birth of FC Barcelona (1899â1922)===
{{Quote box|'''Sports Notice:''' Our friend and companion Hans Gamper... former Swiss [football] champion, being keen on organising some football games in the city asks anyone who feels enthusiastic enough about the sport to present themselves at the office of this newspaper any Tuesday or Friday evening between the hours of 9 and 11pm.|Gamper's advertisement in ''Los Deportes''&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil p. 89&quot;/&gt;|align=right|width=350px}}

On 22 October 1899, [[Joan Gamper|Hans Kamper]] placed an advertisement in ''Los Deportes'' declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio SolÃ© on 29 November. Eleven players attendedâ[[Walter Wild]] (the first director of the club), LluÃ­s d'OssÃ³, [[Bartomeu Terradas]], Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsonsâand '''Foot-Ball Club Barcelona''' was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil p. 89&quot;&gt;Ball, Phil p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the [[Catalan football championship|Campionat de Catalunya]] and the [[Copa del Rey]]. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the [[Catalan football championship|Copa Macaya]], and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1â2 to [[Athletic Bilbao|Bizcaya]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancuphist.html |title=Spain â List of Cup Finals |author=Carnicero, JosÃ© Vicente Tejedor |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gamper became club president in 1908, the club in financial difficulty after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring BarÃ§a acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_1.html |title=History part I|publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the [[Camp de la IndÃºstria]], a larger stadium with a seating capacity of 8,000 people. From 1910 to 1914 Barcelona participated in the [[Pyrenees Cup]], which consisted of the best teams of [[Languedoc]], [[Midi]], [[Aquitaine]] (Southern France), the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], and Catalonia. At that time it was considered the finest competition open for participation.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Bill; Murray, William J. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/pyrenees.html |title=Coupe des PyrenÃ©es â Copa de los Pirineos |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=19 June 2001|accessdate=12 June 2010|author= Ferrer, Carles Lozano}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, the club changed its official language from [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] to [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, supporting the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, RamÃ³n. p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamper launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922 the club had over 20,000 members and was able to finance a new stadium. The club to moved to the new [[Camp de Les Corts|Les Corts]], inaugurated the same year.&lt;ref name=Arnaud103/&gt; Les Corts had an initial capacity of 22,000, which was later expanded to 60,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_2.html |title=History part II |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Greenwell]] was recruited as the first full-time [[Manager (association football)|manager]], and the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper era, FC Barcelona won eleven Campionat de Catalunya, six Copas del Rey, and four Pyrenees Cups.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona1&quot;/&gt;

===Rivera, Republic and Civil War (1923â1957)===
[[File:Barcelona bombing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Black-and-white photo of the city from high above. Smoke from a bomb can be seen|The aerial bombardment of Barcelona in 1938]]
On 14 June 1925, the crowd in the stadium jeered the national anthem in a spontaneous protest against [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship. The ground was closed for six months as a reprisal, and Gamper was forced to relinquish the club presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Shubert, Adrian. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with the club's transition to professionalism; in 1926 the directors of Barcelona publicly declared Barcelona a professional side for the first time.&lt;ref name=Arnaud103&gt;Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The club's 1928 victory in the [[Copa del Rey|Spanish Cup]] was celebrated with a poem titled &quot;Oda a [[Franz Platko|Platko]]&quot;, written by a member of the [[Generation of '27]], poet Rafael Alberti, who was inspired by the &quot;heroic performance&quot; of the Barcelona keeper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football, European Integration, National Identity: The Case of FC Barcelona|author=Roy, JoaquÃ­n|year=2001|publisher=European Community Studies Association (paper)|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona1&quot;/&gt;

Although they continued to have players of the standing of [[Josep EscolÃ ]], the club entered a period of decline in which political conflict overshadowed sport throughout society.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jimmy. pp. 111â112.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;/&gt; success at a national level (with the exception of a [[Mediterranean League|disputed title in 1937]]) evaded them. A month after the [[Spanish Civil War]] began in 1936, several players from Barcelona and [[Athletic Bilbao]] enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August, [[Josep Sunyol]], the club president and representative of a pro-independence political party, was murdered by [[Falangist]] soldiers near [[Guadarrama]].&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, RamÃ³n. p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed the martyrdom  of ''barcelonisme'', the murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 116â117.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1937, the squad went on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. That tour secured the club financially, but also resulted in half the team seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] in Mexico and France. On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment, resulting in over 3,000 deaths; one of the bombs hit the club's offices.&lt;ref&gt;Raguer, Hilari. pp. 223â225.&lt;/ref&gt; Catalonia came under occupation a few months later. As a symbol of 'undisciplined' [[Catalanism]], the club, down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;Raguer, Hilari. pp. 232â233.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Civil War, the [[Senyera|Catalan flag]] was banned and football clubs were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to ''Club de FÃºtbol Barcelona'' and to remove the Catalan flag from its club shield.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona2&quot;/&gt;

In 1943, Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of [[Copa del GeneralÃ­simo]]. Their first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3â0. Before the second leg, Barcelona's players had a changing room visit from [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s director of state security. He &quot;reminded&quot; them that they were only playing due to the &quot;generosity of the regime&quot;. Real Madrid dominated the match, winning 11â1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=70557.html|title=BarÃ§aâMuch more than just a Club|date=10 December 1998|accessdate=1 May 2011|publisher=[[FIFA]]|last=Aguilar|first=Paco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficult political situation, CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with [[Josep Samitier]] as managers and players like [[CÃ©sar RodrÃ­guez Alvarez|CÃ©sar]], [[Antoni Ramallets|Ramallets]], and [[Juan Zambudio Velasco|Velasco]], they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added to this total in 1948 and again in 1949. They also won the first [[Latin Cup|Copa Latina]] that year. In June 1950, Barcelona signed [[Ladislao Kubala]], who was to be an influential figure at the club.

On a rainy Sunday in 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2â1 win against [[Racing Santander|Santander]] on foot, refusing to catch any trams and surprising the [[Francoist]] authorities. A tram strike was taking place in [[Barcelona]], which received the support of [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|blaugrana fans]]. Events such as this made the club represent much more than just Catalonia; many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrand, Alain; McCarthy, Scott. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzig, Richard. p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Managers [[Ferdinand DauÄÃ­k]] and [[LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kubala]] led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del GeneralÃ­simo (now the Copa del Rey), the [[Copa Latina]], the [[Supercopa de EspaÃ±a|Copa Eva Duarte]], and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del GeneralÃ­simo again.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona2&quot;/&gt;

===Club de FÃºtbol Barcelona (1957â1978)===
[[File:Camp Nou des de l'helicÃ²pter.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Barcelona stadium seen from above. It is a large and asymmetrically shaped dome.|The club's stadium, [[Camp Nou]], was constructed with financial backing from the club's [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|supporters]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With [[Helenio Herrera]] as manager, a young [[Luis SuÃ¡rez Miramontes|Luis SuÃ¡rez]], the [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1960, and two influential [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] recommended by Kubala, [[SÃ¡ndor Kocsis]] and [[ZoltÃ¡n Czibor]], the team won another national [[double (association football)|double]] in 1959 and a La Liga and [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] double in 1960. In 1961 they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in [[European Cup 1960â61|European Cup]] competition, but lost 3â2 to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/ec1.html |title=European Champions' Cup |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |first=Karel |last=Stokkermans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html |title=European Competitions 1960â61 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=11 August 2010 |first=James M. |last=Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_3.html |title=History part III |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The building of the [[Camp Nou]], completed in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona3&quot;/&gt; On the positive side, the decade saw the emergence of [[Josep Maria FustÃ©]] and [[Carles Rexach]], and the club won the Copa del GeneralÃ­simo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. BarÃ§a restored some of its former pride by beating Real Madrid 1â0 in the 1968 Copa del GeneralÃ­simo final at the [[Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium|BernabÃ©u]], in front of Franco, with former [[Second Spanish Republic|republican]] pilot [[Salvador Artigas]] as manager. The end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974 saw the club changing its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverting the crest to its original design, again including the original letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |title=The Crest |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1973â74 season saw the arrival of [[Johan Cruyff]], who was bought for a world record Â£920,000 from [[Ajax Amsterdam|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;MacWilliam, Rab; MacDonald, Tom. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Already an established player in Holland, Cruyff quickly won over the BarÃ§a fans when he told the European press he chose BarÃ§a over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Franco. He further endeared himself when he chose the Catalan name [[Jordi Cruyff|''Jordi'']], after the local saint, for his son.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 83â85.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to players of quality like [[Juan Manuel Asensi]], [[Carles Rexach]], and [[Hugo Sotil]], he helped the club win the La Liga title in 1973â74 for the first time since 1960,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;/&gt; defeating Real Madrid 5â0 at the BernabÃ©u along the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfp.es/?tabid=113&amp;Controltype=tres&amp;t=073&amp;idDivision=1 |title=La Liga season 1973â74 |publisher=[[Liga de FÃºtbol Profesional]] (LFP) |date= |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was crowned [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971). Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time (the first player ever to do so) in 1974 while he was still with Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/europa-poy.html|date=11 December 2009|author=Moore, Rob; Stokkermans, Karel |title=European Footballer of the Year (&quot;Ballon d'Or&quot;) |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF) |accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NÃºÃ±ez and the stabilisation years (1978â2000)===
[[File:UEFA Champions Cup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]], which Barcelona won in 1992.]]
Beginning with [[Josep LluÃ­s NÃºÃ±ez]] in 1978, the president of FC Barcelona has been elected by the club members. This decision was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. NÃºÃ±ez's main objective was to develop BarÃ§a into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. On recommendation from Cruyff, NÃºÃ±ez inaugurated [[La Masia]] as Barcelona's youth academy on 20 October 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;sport1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/20100818/masia-como-laboratorio/840127.shtml |title=La Masia, como un laboratorio |publisher=SPORT.es |accessdate=19 August 2010 |language=Spanish |author=Perarnau, MartÃ­ |date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His presidency was to last for 22 years and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as NÃºÃ±ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting players such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[RomÃ¡rio]] and [[Ronaldo]] go rather than meeting their demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |title=History part IV |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1979, the club won its first [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] by beating [[Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf]] 4â3 in Basel in a final that was watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans. In June 1982 Maradona was signed for a then-world record fee of Â£5 million from [[Club AtlÃ©tico Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, Stephen; Goddard, John A. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following season, under manager [[CÃ©sar Luis Menotti|Menotti]], Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with BarÃ§a was short-lived; he soon left for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. At the start of the 1984â85 season [[Terry Venables]] was hired as manager, and he won La Liga with notable displays by German midfielder [[Bernd Schuster]]. The next season Venables took the team to their second [[European Cup 1985â86|European Cup]] final, only to lose on penalties to [[FC Steaua BucureÅti|Steaua BucureÅti]] during a dramatic evening in Seville.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;/&gt;

After the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], English top scorer [[Gary Lineker]] was signed along with goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]], but the team could not achieve success as Schuster was excluded from the team. Venables was fired at the beginning of the 1987â88 season and replaced with [[Luis AragonÃ©s]]. The players rebelled against president NÃºÃ±ez in an event that became known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1â0 victory at the Copa del Rey final against [[Real Sociedad]] finished out the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Johan Cruijff 1982.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photo of Johan Cruyff|upright|[[Johan Cruyff]] won four consecutive La Liga titles as manager of Barcelona.]]

In 1988, [[Johan Cruyff]] returned to the club as manager and he assembled the so-called ''Dream Team''. He used a mix of Spanish players like [[Josep Guardiola]], [[JosÃ© Mari Bakero]], and [[Txiki Begiristain]] while signing international stars such as [[Ronald Koeman]], [[Michael Laudrup]], RomÃ¡rio, and [[Hristo Stoichkov]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 106â107.&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] in both the 1989 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1988â89|Cup Winners' Cup]] final and the 1992 [[European Cup 1991â92|European Cup]] final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the [[European Super Cup]] in 1992, and three [[Supercopa de EspaÃ±a]]. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager, until being overtaken by [[Pep Guardiola]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/88/spain/2011/08/18/2625001/pep-guardiola-enters-barcelona-history-books-with-record|title=Pep Guardiola enters Barcelona history books with record 11th title as coach|publisher=Goal.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the club's longest consecutive serving manager, serving 8 years.&lt;ref name=honours&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/palmares/palmares.html |title=Honours |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruyff's fortune  changed in his final two seasons, when he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president NÃºÃ±ez, resulting in his departure.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;/&gt;

Cruyff was briefly replaced by [[Bobby Robson]], who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996â97. He recruited Ronaldo from [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1995â96|Cup Winners Cup]], and the Supercopa de EspaÃ±a. Despite his success Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for [[Louis van Gaal]] to become available.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_5.html |title=History part V |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Maradona, Ronaldo only stayed a short time as he left for [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]]. However, new heroes such as [[LuÃ­s Figo]], [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Luis Enrique MartÃ­nez GarcÃ­a|Luis Enrique]], and [[Rivaldo]] emerged and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999 the club celebrated its 'centenari', winning the Primera DivisiÃ³n title. Rivaldo became the fourth BarÃ§a player to be awarded [[European Footballer of the Year]]. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and NÃºÃ±ez resigning in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona5&quot;/&gt;

===Exit NÃºÃ±ez, enter Laporta (2000â2008)===
The departures of NÃºÃ±ez and van Gaal were nothing compared to that of [[LuÃ­s Figo]]. As well as club vice-captain, Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. BarÃ§a fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, he was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; President NÃºÃ±ez was replaced by [[Joan Gaspart]] in 2000, and the three years he was in charge, saw the club decline and managers came and went; van Gaal served a second term. Gaspart did not inspire confidence off the field either and in 2003, he and van Gaal resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 109â110.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the club bounced back with the combination of a new young president, [[Joan Laporta]], and a young new manager, former [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] player [[Frank Rijkaard]]. On the field, an influx of international players combined with home-grown Spanish players led to the club's return to success. BarÃ§a won La Liga and the Supercopa de EspaÃ±a in 2004â05, and the team's midfielder, [[Ronaldinho]], won the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4486166.stm |title=Ronaldinho wins world award again |publisher=BBC News |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2005â06 season, Barcelona repeated their league and Supercup successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/real-madrid-0-barcelona-3-bernabeu-forced-to-pay-homage-as-ronaldinho-soars-above-the-galacticos-516202.html |title=Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 3: Bernabeu forced to pay homage as Ronaldinho soars above the galacticos |work=The Independent |date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=McCurdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Champions League, BarÃ§a beat English club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 2â1 in the final.

===The Guardiola Era (2008â)===
[[File:The six BarÃ§a cups .jpg|thumb|The sextuple, which Barcelona won in 2009.]]
The [[2007â08 FC Barcelona season|2007â08 season]] was unsuccessful, and as BarÃ§a failed to emulate the success of previous years, [[FC Barcelona B|BarÃ§a B]] youth manager [[Josep Guardiola]] took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/noticies/destacades/n080508104104.html|title=Rijkaard until 30 June; Guardiola to take over|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=8 May 2009|publisher=FC Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josep Guardiola brought with him the now famous [[tiki-taka]] style of play which he had been taught during his time in the Barcelona youth teams. In the process Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco, and started building the Barcelona team around Xavi, Iniesta and Messi.

BarÃ§a beat [[Athletic Bilbao]] 4â1 in the [[2009 Copa del Rey Final]], winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time. A historic 2â6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became La Liga champions for the 2008â09 season. BarÃ§a finished the season by beating the previous year's Champions League winners [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 2â0 at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] in [[Rome]] to win their third Champions League title and completed the first ever [[Treble (association football)|treble]] won by a Spanish side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=646187&amp;sec=europe&amp;root=europe&amp;&amp;cc=5739|title=One title closer to the treble|date=14 May 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|first=Eduardo|last=Alvarez|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8060878.stm|title=Barcelona 2â0 Man Utd|date=27 May 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2009/05/pep-guardiola-barcelona/|title=Pep Guardiola's love affair with BarÃ§a continues|date=19 May 2009|publisher=Thesportreview.com|accessdate=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team went on to win the [[2009 Supercopa de EspaÃ±a]] against Athletic Bilbao&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Messi leads Barcelona to Spanish Supercup win|publisher=CNN Sports Illustrated.

===''El ClÃ¡sico''===
{{Main|El ClÃ¡sico}}
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between BarÃ§a and Real Madrid is known as ''El ClÃ¡sico''. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: [[Catalonia]] and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between [[Catalan people|Catalans]] and the [[Castilians]], seen by one author as a re-enactment of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghemawat, Pankaj. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the dictatorships of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Primo de Rivera]] and especially of [[Francisco Franco]] (1939â1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish ([[Spanish language|Castilian]]) itself, were officially banned.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner-Liebau, DÃ©sirÃ©e. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Phil Ball |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/apr/21/championsleague.sport |title=The ancient rivalry of Barcelona and Real Madrid|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media |date= 21 April 2002|accessdate=13 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, BarÃ§a became 'More than a club' (''MÃ©s que un club'') for the Catalans. According to [[Manuel VÃ¡zquez MontalbÃ¡n]], the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining BarÃ§a. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, RamÃ³n. p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive [[centralism]] and the fascist regime at management level and beyond ([[Santiago BernabÃ©u Yeste|Santiago Bernabeu]], the former club president for whom the [[Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium|Merengues]] stadium is named, fought with [[Spanish State|''los nacionales'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1697027,00.html|title=Barcelona vs. Real Madrid: More Than a Game|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|last=Abend|first=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/mar/26/newsstory.sport13|title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football by Phil Ball (London: WSC Books, 2001)|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|last=Lowe|first=Sid}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Spanish Civil War, members of both clubs such as [[Josep Sunyol]] and [[Rafael SÃ¡nchez Guerra]] suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.

===''El derbi BarcelonÃ­''===
{{Main|El derbi BarcelonÃ­}}
BarÃ§a's local rival has always been [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]]. ''Blanc-i-blaus'', being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of BarÃ§a's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil. pp. 86-87&quot;/&gt; The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Shubert, Arthur. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original ground was in the affluent district of [[Estadi de SarriÃ |SarriÃ ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1901/04/09/pagina-2/33398307/pdf.html |title=EdiciÃ³n del martes, 09 abril 1901, pÃ¡gina 2 â Hemeroteca â Lavanguardia.es |language=Spanish|publisher=Hemeroteca Lavanguardia|date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdespanyol.cat/principal.php?modulo=estatico&amp;idcontenido=8&amp;idmenu=2&amp;idsubmenu=22&amp;nombremodulo=dates&amp;idlinkchk=21 |title=History of Espanyol|publisher=RCD Espanyol |date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, especially during the Franco regime, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to BarÃ§a's revolutionary spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.europa.eu/index.php?id=18&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=41&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=697&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=232&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpage%5D=1&amp;cHash=2becc765c6|title=European football cultures and their integration: the 'short' Twentieth Century|date=March 2002|accessdate=1 July 2009|publisher=Iss.Europa.eu|last=Missiroli|first=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil. pp. 86-87&quot;&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 86â87.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish civil war, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the ''derbi'' has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil. pp. 86-87&quot;/&gt;

Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly [[El derbi barcelones#Head to Head|dominant]]. In the league table, Espanyol have only managed to end above BarÃ§a on three occasions in almost 70 years and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by BarÃ§a in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6â0 in 1951. Espanyol achieved a 2â1 win against BarÃ§a during the 2008â09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning [[2008-09 FC Barcelona season|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/temporada_08-09/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada24/Barcelona_Espanyol/partit.html |title=Matchday 24|publisher=FC Barcelona|date= |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finances and ownership==
In 2010, ''[[Forbes]]'' evaluated Barcelona's worth to be around â¬752 million (USD $1 billion), ranking them fourth after Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Arsenal, based on figures from the 2008â09 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/21/soccer-value-teams-business-sports-soccer-10-intro.html |title=The Business Of Soccer |publisher=Forbes |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/34/soccer-10_Soccer-Team-Valuations_Rank.html |title=Soccer Team Valuations |publisher=Forbes |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deloitte]], Barcelona had a recorded revenue of â¬366 million in the same period, ranking second to Real Madrid, who generated â¬401 million in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/d039400401a17210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm |title=Real Madrid becomes the first sports team in the world to generate â¬400m in revenues as it tops Deloitte Football Money League |publisher=Deloitte |date= |accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, and [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], Barcelona is organised as a registered association. Unlike a [[limited company]], it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Marc p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of Barcelona, called ''socis'', form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on the economics of sport|first=Wladimir|last=Andreff|first2=Stefan|last2=SzymaÅski|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2006|

An audit by Deloitte in July 2010 showed that Barcelona had a net debt of â¬442 million, currently 58% of net worth as evaluated by ''Forbes''. The new management of Barcelona, which had ordered the audit, cited &quot;structural problems&quot; as the cause of the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFJOE66Q0H720100727 |title=Barcelona audit uncovers big 2009/10 loss |publisher=Reuters |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; News had emerged that the club had recorded a loss of approximately â¬79 million over the course of the year, despite having defended their La Liga title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rosell announces record Barcelona loss, lawsuit against Laporta |first=Duncan |last=Shaw |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/news/article_1591876.php/Rosell-announces-record-Barcelona-loss-lawsuit-against-Laporta |work=Monsters and Critics |date=10 October 2010 |accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xavi]] presently holds the team record for number of total games played (599) as well as the record number of La Liga appearances (397), surpassing the previous record holder [[Migueli]] (391).&lt;ref name=records&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/historia/records/rec_individuals.html |title=FC Barcelona Records (Team &amp; Individual Records) | publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crest and shirt==
[[File:Barcelonacrest.jpg|thumb|right|alt=diamond shaped crest surrounded by laurels and topped with a crown and a bat|The first crest worn by Barcelona]]
Since its foundation the club has played with a crest. The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Bat (heraldry)#The bat in official heraldry|bat of King James]], and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.&lt;ref name=crest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html|title=The crest|accessdate=30 July 2010|publisher=FC Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910 the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest. The winner was [[Carles Comamala]], who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.&lt;ref name=crest/&gt;

The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, [[Arthur Witty]], claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby|Merchant Taylor's School]] team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's [[French First Republic|First Republic]]. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, [[FC Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 90â91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, Barcelona has never worn corporate advertisements on their shirt. On 14 July 2006, the club announced a five year agreement with [[UNICEF]], which includes having the UNICEF logo on their shirts. The agreement has the club donate â¬1.5&amp;nbsp;million per year to UNICEF (0.7 percent of its ordinary income, equal to the UN International Aid Target, [[cf.]] [[Official development assistance|ODA]]) via the FC Barcelona Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/Fundacio/english/nacions_unides/convenis/unicef/continguts/carta_laporta.html|title=Open letter from Joan Laporta|accessdate=21 February 2010|year=2010|publisher=FC Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FC Barcelona Foundation is an entity set up in 1994 on the suggestion of then-chairman of the Economical-Statutory Committee, Jaime Gil-Aluja. The idea was to set up a foundation that could attract financial sponsorships to support a non-profit sport company.&lt;ref&gt;Desbordes, Michel p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a company could become one of 25 &quot;Honorary members&quot; by contributing between Â£40,000â60,000 (Â£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|40000|2004|r=-2}}}}â{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|60000|2004|r=-2}}}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} per year. There are also 48 associate memberships available for an annual fee of Â£14,000 (Â£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|14000|2004|r=-2}}}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} and an unlimited number of &quot;patronages&quot; for the cost of Â£4,000 per year (Â£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|4000|2004|r=-2}}}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} It is unclear whether the honorary members have any formal say in club policy, but according to the author Anthony King, it is &quot;unlikely that Honorary Membership would not involve at least some informal influence over the club&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;King, Anthony pp. 123â24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcelona will end their refusal of corporate sponsorship in the 2011â2012 season, having signed a five-year â¬150m deal with the [[Qatar Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/dec/10/barcelona-shirt-sponsor-qatar-foundation Barcelona agree â¬150m shirt sponsor deal with Qatar Foundation]&quot;.

==Stadiums==
{{Main|Camp de la IndÃºstria|Camp de Les Corts|Camp Nou}}
[[File:Chelsea on Tour - Barcelona 311006.jpg|right|thumb|alt=an elevated view of the stadium at night|An elevated view of a full Camp Nou]]
Barcelona initially played in the [[Camp de la IndÃºstria]]. The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/catala/noticies/club/temporada08-09/03/n090314107593.html|publisher=FC Barcelona|title=Cent anys del camp de la IndÃºstria|accessdate=11 September 2010|date=14 March 2009|author=Santacana, Carles|language=Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, BarÃ§a was able to build the larger [[Camp de Les Corts]], which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/CampNou/intro_historica.html|title=Brief history of Camp Nou |publisher=FC Barcelona |date= |accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of in June 1950 of [[LÃ¡szlÃ³ Kubala]], who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farred, Grant. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaude, Michael. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The club began to make plans for a new stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;/&gt;  The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 BarÃ§a fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Camp nou mÃ¨s que un club.JPG|right|thumb|The words &quot;MÃ©s que un club&quot; are painted in yellow on the blue seats of the stadium|One of the stands displaying Barcelona's motto, ''&quot;MÃ©s que un club&quot;'', meaning 'More than a club']]
In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] supporter [[Santiago BernabÃ©u Yeste|Santiago BernabÃ©u]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 20â21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 121â22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Bill; Murray, William J.. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the 1992 Summer Games two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, John. pp. 81â2.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a current capacity of 96,366 making it [[List of European stadiums by capacity|the largest stadium]] in Europe.

==Current squad==
{{Main|List of FC Barcelona players}}
{{For|a list of all former and current FC Barcelona players with a Wikipedia article|Category:FC Barcelona footballers}}
Spanish teams are limited to three players without [[European Union|EU]] citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the [[ACP countries]]âcountries in Africa, the [[Caribbean]], and the [[Oceania|Pacific]] that are signatories to the [[Cotonou Agreement]]âare not counted against non-EU quotas due to the [[Kolpak ruling]].

&lt;!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 â Do not add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club.
 â Do not add clubnumber until it is official.
 â This is Wikipedia, not a football gazette. Any unconfirmed and unsourced signing will be
 â removed on sight.
 â Thanks in advance.
 â Also, please list ONLY players who are fully featured with the first team squad (see link below)
