==Biography==
He graduated in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Advertising and Publicity for the School of Arts and Communication, [[University of SÃ£o Paulo]] (ECA-USP), with the work of the Agency House: The Mirror of Venus. He began his professional career in 1983 as advertising. The following year, the USP FM Radio, became speaker.

In 1985 he began working on [[TV Bandeirantes]] in SÃ£o Paulo, as an announcer and presenter. In June 1986, invited by [[Rede Globo]] in SÃ£o Paulo, moved to the station, where he accumulated a presenter with the editor of an edition of the local television news, SPTV.
In 1988 he also became host of the [[FantÃ¡stico]]. The following year he moved to Rio de Janeiro. Jornal da Globo presented between 1989 and 1992 next to FÃ¡tima Bernardes, the Journal today (of which he was editor in chief between 1994 and 1996) and, since April 1996, the [[Jornal Nacional]], a newspaper that shows on [[Rede Globo]] with his wife , journalist FÃ¡tima Bernardes, whose leadership took over in April 1998.

Bonner and FÃ¡tima are parents of triplets Beatriz, Laura and Vinicius, and live in Rio de Janeiro.
Recently, William's launched the National Journal: How to Do, released in tribute to 40 years of JN, in that it shows the scenes of preparing editions of television news. Although signed only by him, the book also brings FÃ¡tima Bernardes on the cover, along with Bonner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
