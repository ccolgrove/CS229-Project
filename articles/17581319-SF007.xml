'''inSSIDer''' is a [[Wi-Fi]] [[network scanner]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].  It received a 2008 [[Infoworld Bossie Awards|Infoworld Bossie Award]] for &quot;Best of open source software in networking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://akamai.infoworld.com/about/bossies/bossies_pr08.pdf IDGâs InfoWorld Names the Winners of the Best of Open Source Software for 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
inSSIDer began as a replacement for the aging [[NetStumbler]], which had not been actively developed for several years. In addition, MetaGeek heard complaints that NetStumbler did not work with modern 64-bit operating systems or even [[Windows Vista]].  It was then decided to build an open-source Wi-Fi network scanner designed for the current generation of Windows operating systems that surpassed the capability and overall quality of NetStumbler, which had been the standard Windows Wi-Fi scanner for several years.

==Development==
This project was inspired by [[Charles Putney]] on The Code Project. Norman Rasmussen modified it to use the Managed Wi-Fi C# wrapper for the Native Wi-Fi API.

==Features==
* Works with internal Wi-Fi radio
* Wi-Fi network information ([[SSID]], [[MAC address|MAC]], Access point vendor, data rate, signal strength, security, etc.)
* Graph signal strength over time
* Shows how Wifi networks overlap
* Open source (Apache License, Version 2.0)
* [[GPS]] Support
* Export to Netstumbler(*.ns1) files
* [[KML]] Logging

==Version 2.0==
Version 2.0 is a complete re-write of inSSIDer. Beta 1 was released September 8, 2010.

===New Features in 2.0===
* A new more stable codebase
* A news tab to replace the ad
* More stable GPX and KML logging
* New Time Graph
** Stale access points fade out over time
* Graphs are now in tabs
** Separate graphs for 2.4 and 5&amp;nbsp;GHz channels
* A filtering system that allows you to only show networks that meet certain criteria
** Great for hunting down hotspots
* A GPS status tab
** Shows detailed GPS data(like location, speed, altitude, etc.)
** Also shows signal levels of satellites in view(up to 12)
* Fullscreen mode
* Mini mode
** Mini mode is designed for ''extremely'' small screens  that may otherwise feel cramped with the full interface
** All points of data are in tabs
** Default reduced number of columns visible in data grid
** 5&amp;nbsp;GHz channel view is broken into 2 graphs for lower(33-64) and upper(100-165) channels
** Switching between full and mini mode preserves scan data and scan state
*** You can be scanning in Full mode and switch to mini to keep scanning without interruption
* Better paring of 802.11n data
** Shows actual extended data rate
** Channel graphs show 40&amp;nbsp;MHz secondary channel, if any

==System requirements==
===Windows===
* Windows XP SP2, Vista, or Windows 7 (32- or 64-bit)
* Microsoft .Net framework 2.0 or higher
** inSSIDer 2.0 requires .Net 3.5 or higher
* 1024 x 600 [[screen resolution]] minimum recommended
** If using lower than 1024 x 600 (like 800 x 480), mini mode is recommended
