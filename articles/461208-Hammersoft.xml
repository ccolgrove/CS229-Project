'''Xanthi''' ({{lang-el|ÎÎ¬Î½Î¸Î·}}, ''XÃ¡nthi'', {{IPA-el|ËksanÎ¸i|}}); is a city in [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], northeastern [[Greece]]. It is the capital of the [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi regional unit]] of the [[modern regions of Greece|region]] of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]].

==Name==
Xanthi is known as &quot;Ä°skeÃ§e&quot; in Turkish and &quot;Ð¡ÐºÐµÑÐ°&quot; (Skecha) in Bulgarian.

==History==
Known references to Xanthi (ÎÎ¬Î½Î¸Î·), or Xanthia (ÎÎ¬Î½Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î±), date back to 879 AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xanthi.ilsp.gr/thraki/history/his.asp?perioxhid=B0257 : the bishop of Xantheia is reported as taking part in the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Fourth Council of Constantinople]]&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a small village and experienced all the tumultuous periods of the history of [[Thrace]], such as raids, disasters, ethnic conflicts, civil wars. The population of the region of Xanthi had dwindled down to almost nothing and almost everything had been destroyed. This was the situation when the Ottomans conquered the region in 1361. For this reason, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought settlers from the depths of [[Asia Minor]], which is how [[Genisea]] (ÎÎµÎ½Î¹ÏÎ­Î±) was created, while Oreo (Î©ÏÎ±Î¯Î¿) and Xanthi remained mainly Greek and Christian centres.

===Genisea Era===
By 1715, Xanthi, as well as [[Genisea]], became renowned for its [[tobacco]] quality. Many foreign sightseers traveled throughout the region and described both the life and struggles of the locals. Tobacco commerce throughout [[Europe]] led Xanthi into a course of prosperity. In March and April 1829 two [[earthquake]]s literally leveled the city, however played a decisive role in the further developments. The city's re-building immediately got underway. In 1870, the city of [[Genisea]] was burned down and thus all of the agencies and services were transferred to Xanthi which, at that time, had a population of about 10,000 inhabitants. In 1891, the railroad line was established near the city, while further economic development led to the founding of schools and associations.

===Balkan Wars===
Following the [[First Balkan War]], [[Bulgaria]] took the city of Xanthi in 1912, but after a period of eight months it was taken by the [[Greece|Greek]] army. Shortly thereafter, as part of the accords concluding the [[Balkan Wars]], Xanthi and [[Western Thrace]] were ceded to [[Bulgaria]] (where it also called Ð¡ÐºÐµÑÐ° ''Skecha''), and remained a part of the latter until the end of [[World War I]]. Following the Bulgarian defeat in this war, Western [[Thrace]] (ÎÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ® ÎÏÎ¬ÎºÎ·), and thus Xanthi, became a part of [[Greece]] in 1919â1920. It was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] in the period 1941â1944 during [[World War II]]. During this time, in March 1943, its entire Jewish population was rounded up by the Bulgarians and transferred to the Germans for deportation to [[Treblinka]], where they were murdered.

=== Modern Era ===
Nowadays Xanthi is a modern city, rich in history, traditions and customs, and with many attractions for the visitors (including the surrounding areas). It is worth visiting the city during the Carnival ({{lang-el|ÎÎ±ÏÎ½Î±Î²Î¬Î»Î¹}}) (either February or March as dates change) and during the Old Town Festival (ÎÎ¹Î¿ÏÏÎ­Ï Î Î±Î»Î¹Î¬Ï Î ÏÎ»Î·Ï) (beginning of September). Also, one should not miss the Xanthi Bazaar (Î Î±Î¶Î¬ÏÎ¹) every Saturday. Xanthi is known as &quot;The city of the thousand colours&quot;.

The municipality Xanthi was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 2 former municipalities, that became municipal units:&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
