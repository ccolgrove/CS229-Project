'''Mohamed Mustafa ElBaradei''' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ­ÙØ¯ ÙØµØ·ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¨Ø±Ø§Ø¯Ø¹Ù}}, ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|Muá¸¥ammad Muá¹£á¹­afÄ al-BarÄdÊ¿Ä«}},'' {{IPA-arz|mÃ¦ËÄ§Ã¦mmÃ¦d mos&lt;!--no pharyngealized [s]--&gt;ËtË¤ÉfÉ (Êe)lbÃ¦ËÉ¾Ã¦dÊi}}; born June 17, 1942) is an Egyptian law scholar and diplomat. He was the [[Director General]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), an inter-governmental organisation under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], from December 1997 to November 2009. ElBaradei and the IAEA were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2005. ElBaradei was also an important figure in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] which ousted the Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]].

== Family and personal life ==
ElBaradei was born and raised in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. He was one of five children of Mostafa ElBaradei, an [[Attorney at law|attorney]] who headed the Egyptian [[Bar Association]] and often found himself at odds with the regime of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. ElBaradei's father was also a supporter of [[democratic]] rights in Egypt, supporting a [[Freedom of the press|free press]] and an [[Independence of the judiciary|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref name=NB_ME&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-Ei-La/ElBaradei-Mohamed.html |title=Mohamed ElBaradei |publisher=Notable Biographies |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradei is married to Aida El-Kachef, an [[Early childhood education|early-childhood teacher]].  They have two children: a daughter, Laila, who is a lawyer living in [[London]]; and a son, Mostafa, who is an [[Information technology management|IT manager]] living in Cairo.

== Early career ==

ElBaradei earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in law from the [[University of Cairo]] in 1962, a master's degree in [[international law]] at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] in [[Geneva]], and a [[J.S.D.]]&lt;ref name=thesis_entry_at_NYU_library_catalog&gt;

His diplomatic career began in 1964 in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Ministry of External Affairs]], where he served in the Permanent Missions of Egypt to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York]] and in [[Geneva]], in charge of political, legal, and arms-control issues. From 1974 to 1978, he was a special assistant to the [[Egyptian Foreign Minister|foreign minister]]. In 1980, he became a senior [[fellow]] in charge of the International Law Program at the [[United Nations Institute for Training and Research]]. From 1981 to 1987, he was also an [[adjunct professor]] of international law at the [[New York University]] School of Law.

In 1984, ElBaradei became a senior staff member of the IAEA [[IAEA#Secretariat|Secretariat]], serving as the agency's legal adviser (1984 to 1993) and Assistant Director General for External Relations (1993 to 1997).

ElBaradei is currently a member of both the [[International Law Association]] and the [[American Society of International Law]].

== Public career as IAEA Director General ==

ElBaradei began to serve as Director General of the IAEA, which is based in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]], on December 1, 1997, succeeding [[Hans Blix]] of [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=BarReapp&gt;{{cite web|author=Austria |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2005/dg_reappointment.html |title=IAEA Board Reappoints Director General Mohamed ElBaradei |publisher=Iaea.org |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Austria |url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2009/dgappointment.html |title=Board Meeting on Director General Appointment |publisher=IAEA |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected for two more four-year terms in 2001 and in 2005. His third and last term ended in November 2009. ElBaradei's tenure has been marked by high-profile, [[Nuclear proliferation|non-proliferation]] issues, which include the [[Nuclear proliferation#Scope of safeguards|inspections]] in [[Iraq]] preceding the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|March 2003 invasion]] and tensions over the [[nuclear program of Iran]].

===First term as Director General===

After being appointed by the IAEA [[IAEA#General Conference|General Conference]] in 1997, ElBaradei said in his speech that, âfor international organizations to enjoy the confidence and support of their members, they have to be responsive to [members'] needs; show concrete achievements; conduct their activities in a cost-effective manner; and respect a process of equitable representation, transparency, and open dialogue.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[IAEA]]
|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a couple of months before ElBaradei took office, the [[Additional Protocol|Model Additional Protocol]] was adopted,  creating a new environment for IAEA verification by giving it greater authority to look for undeclared nuclear activities. When in office, Elbaradei launched a program to establish âintegrated safeguardsâ combining the IAEAâs comprehensive [[Nuclear proliferation#Scope of safeguards|safeguard agreements]] with the newly adopted Additional Protocol. In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: âOne of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence. I would, therefore, urge all states with outstanding-safeguards agreements to conclude them, and I would also urge all states to accelerate their consideration of the Model Additional Protocol and enter into consultations with the Agency at the earliest possible opportunity. We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [will] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol.â Elbaradei repeated this call through his years as the Director General of the IAEA. In November 2009, 93 countries had Additional Protocols in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradeiâs first term ended in November 2001, just two months after the [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attacks of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]]. These attacks made clear that more needed to be done to protect [[nuclear material]] and installations from theft or a terrorist attack. Consequently, ElBaradei established a nuclear security program to combat the risk of nuclear terrorism by assisting member states to strengthen the protection of their nuclear and radioactive material and installations, the [http://www-ns.iaea.org/security/nsf.asp Nuclear Security Fund].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Second term as Director General===

One of the major issues during ElBaradeiâs second term as the director general of the IAEA was the agencyâs inspections in Iraq. ElBaradei disputed the U.S. rationale for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] from the time of the 2002 [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], when he, along with [[Hans Blix]], led a team of UN weapons inspectors in Iraq. ElBaradei told the [[UN Security Council]] in March 2003 that documents purporting to show that Iraq had tried to acquire [[uranium]] from [[Niger]] were not authentic.

ElBaradei described the U.S. invasion of Iraq as &quot;a glaring example of how, in many cases, the use of force exacerbates the problem rather than [solves] it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reuit071022 /&gt; ElBaradei further stated that &quot;we learned from Iraq that an inspection takes time, that we should be patient, that an inspection can, in fact, work,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/03/21/iraq.weapons/ |title=Iraq war wasn't justified, U.N. weapons experts say |publisher=CNN |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had &quot;been validated&quot; in concluding that Saddam Hussein had not revived his [[nuclear weapon]]s program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17060-2004Nov1.html |title=U.N.

In a 2004 op-ed piece on the dangers of nuclear proliferation, in the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] (February 12, 2004), ElBaradei stated that &quot;[w]e must abandon the unworkable notion that it is morally reprehensible for some countries to pursue weapons of mass destruction, yet morally acceptable for others to rely on them for security -- and indeed to continue to refine their capacities and postulate plans for their use.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;saving&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2004/ebNYT20040212.html|title=Saving Ourselves from Self Destruction|last=ElBaradei|first=Mohamed|date=2004-12-02|publisher=[[IAEA]]|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say &quot;If the world does not change course, we risk self-destruction.&quot;

===Third and final term as Director General===

The United States initially voiced opposition to his election to a third four-year term in 2005.&lt;ref name=VOA050427&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2005-04/2005-04-27-voa51.cfm?CFID=147267394&amp;CFTOKEN=36357258&amp;jsessionid=6630c6fe1d2b054bd9925dd1957764a173c2 ''Voice of America'': IAEA Postpones Decision on ElBaradei's Third Term]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2005 interview with the staff of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], [[Chief of staff (politics)|the chief of staff]] to former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]], charged former [[Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security]] [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] with an underhanded campaign to unseat ElBaradei.&lt;ref name=ACT050708 /&gt; âMr. Bolton overstepped his bounds in his moves and gyrations to try to keep [ElBaradei] from being reappointed as [IAEA] head,â Wilkerson said. The [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] reported in December 2004 that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] had intercepted dozens of ElBaradeiâs phone calls with Iranian diplomats and was scrutinizing them for evidence [that] they could use to force him out.&lt;ref name=ACT050708 /&gt; IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky said the agency worked on &quot;the assumption that one or more entities may be listening to our conversations.&quot; &quot;It's not how we would prefer to work, but it is the reality. At the end of the day, we have nothing to hide,&quot; he said.  Iran responded to the ''Washington Post'' reports by accusing the U.S. of violating international law in intercepting the communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4093567.stm |title=ElBaradei 'has nothing to hide' |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-12-13 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States was the only country to oppose ElBaradei's reappointment and eventually failed to win enough support from other countries to oust ElBaradei. On June 9, 2005, after a meeting between [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] and ElBaradei, the United States dropped its objections. Among countries that supported Elbaradei were [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Germany]], and [[France]]. China praised his leadership and objectivity,&lt;ref name=VOA050427 /&gt; and supported him for doing &quot;substantial fruitful work, which has maintained the agency's role and credit in international non-proliferation and promoted the development of peaceful use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. His work has been universally recognized in the international community. China appreciates Mr. El Baradei's work and supports his reelection as the agency's director general.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china-botschaft.de/det/fyrth/t175367.htm |title=Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Liu Jianchao's Press Conference on 16 December 2004 |publisher=China-botschaft.de |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Germany, and some developing countries, have made clear their support for ElBaradei as well.&lt;ref name=ACT050708&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2005_07-08/ElBaradei |title=ElBaradei Set to Win Third Term |publisher=Arms Control Today |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia issued a strong statement in favor of re-electing him as soon as possible.

ElBaradei was unanimously re-appointed by the IAEA board on June 13, 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;USagrees&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4075496.stm|title=US agrees to back UN nuclear head |date=9 June 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on no fourth term===

In 2008, ElBaradei said that he would not be seeking a fourth term as director general.&lt;ref name=IHT080910&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/09/10/africa/OUKWD-UK-NUCLEAR-IAEA-ELBARADEI.php |title=IAEA chief ElBaradei will not seek fourth term |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he said, in an IAEA document,that he was &quot;not available for a further term&quot; in office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-09/2008-09-10-voa37.cfm ''Voice of America'': IAEA Chief ElBaradei Will Not Seek Another Term]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first five rounds of voting, the IAEA [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] was split in its decision regarding the next director general. ElBaradei said, &quot;I just hope that the agency has a candidate acceptable to all--north, south, east, west--because that is what is needed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idINLR30012520090327 |title=5-Vote impasse reopens race to head UN atom watchdog |publisher=Reuters |date= 2009-03-27|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several rounds of voting, on July 3, 2009, Mr. [[Yukiya Amano]], Japanese ambassador to the IAEA, was elected as the next IAEA director general.

===ElBaradei and U.S. Relations===

Mohamed ElBaradei, leader of the National Coalition for Change, has been a major voice for democratic change in Egypt since 2009 and was a significant leader during the recent protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Nesera|first=Andre|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Former-Egyptian-Diplomat-ElBaradei-Face-of-Opposition-to-President-Mubarak-115126994.html|newspaper=Voice of America|date=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has a rocky history with the U.S. government and supports some policies that do not support current U.S. foreign policy towards stability in the Middle East.  ElBaradei was the Director General of the IAEA from 1997â2009.  During his three terms, he repeatedly downplayed claims of possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program, which undermined U.S. efforts to press Iran over its safeguards violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pleming|first=Sue|title=Rice swipes at IAEA, urges bold action on Iran|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/09/19/us-iran-usa-rice-idUSN1822732020070919|newspaper=Rueters|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to a July 3, 2003 article in Time Magazine, ElBaradei also maintained that Iraq's nuclear program had not restarted before the 2003 Iraq War, contradicting claims by the Bush Administration.  He told the German news magazine [[Der Spiegel]] on July 12, 2010 that he wanted to open the Gaza Strip â Egypt border and accused Israel of being the biggest threat to the Middle East because of their nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Follach|first=Erich|title=Interview with Mohammed ElBaradei|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,705991,00.html|newspaper=Der Spiegel|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradei has called for international criminal investigation of former Bush regime officials for their roles in fomenting the [[Legality of the Iraq War|war on Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/former-iaea-head-suggests-iraq-war-crime-probe-of-bush-administration-1.357684?localLinksEnabled=false &quot;Former IAEA head suggests Iraq war crime probe of Bush administration.&quot;] ''AP'', 22 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in addressing the nuclear program of Iran===

{{Main|Nuclear program of Iran}}

In his last speech to the IAEA Board of Governors in June 2009, ElBaradei stated that âthe agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran.&quot; He regretted, however, that &quot;Iran has not implemented any of the measures called for by the Security Council and by the Agency's Board of Governors.â ElBaradei also said that he was encouraged âby the new initiative of the United States to engage the Islamic Republic of Iran in direct dialogue, without preconditions and on the basis of mutual respectâ and expressed hope âthat Iran will respond to the US initiative with an equal gesture of goodwill and trust building.â This gesture âcould include implementing again the agency's design-information requirements and applying the provisions of the additional protocol.â

The IAEA Board of Governors and UN Security Council have commended ElBaradei for &quot;professional and impartial efforts&quot; to resolve all outstanding issues with Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2006/gov2006-14.pdf |title=International Atomic Energy Agency: Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran (2006-14) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Focus/IaeaIran/unsc_res1747-2007.pdf |title=International Atomic Energy Agency: UN Security Council: Resolution 1747 (2007) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM) has also reiterated &quot;its full confidence in the impartiality and professionalism of the Secretariat of the IAEA.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.xinhuanet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-09/12/content_6706557.htm |title='&amp;#39;XinhuaNet'&amp;#39;: Non-aligned nations voice support deal between IAEA, Iran |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2007-09-12 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.sg/geneva/pdf/bog.pdf |title=Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Report Of The IAEA Director-General to the Board of Governors GOV/2008/15 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Statements to the media ====

In an interview with [[CNN]] in May 2007, ElBaradei gave one of his sternest warnings against using military action against Iran, a state signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Referring to &quot;the extreme people who have extreme views&quot; he said that &quot;you do not want to give additional argument to some of the 'new crazies' who want to say let us go and bomb Iran.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Transcripts/2007/cnn281007.html|title=Transcript of Interview with IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei |date=28 October 2007|publisher=CNN Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']] columnist [[Roger Cohen]] interviewed ElBaradei in April 2009. ElBaradei is quoted as saying, â[[Israel]] would be utterly crazy to attack Iran.&quot; He states that an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities would &quot;turn the region into a ball of fire and put Iran on a crash course for nuclear weapons with the support of the whole [[Muslim world]].â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/opinion/13iht-edcohen.html?ref=opinion Realpolitik for Iran]&lt;/ref&gt; ElBaradei believes that the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|nuclear non-proliferation regime]] has &quot;lost its legitimacy in the eyes of [[Arab people|Arab]] [[public opinion]] because of the perceived [[double standard]]&quot; in relation to [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear-weapons' program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-38051120090216 |title=Israel seen undermining disarmament ElBaradei |publisher=Reuters |date= 2009-02-16|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with French newspaper, ''[[Le Monde]]'', ElBaradei said that he wants &quot;to get people away from the idea that Iran will be a threat from tomorrow and that we are faced right now with the issue of whether Iran should be bombed or allowed to have the bomb.  We are not at all in that situation. Iraq is a glaring example of how, in many cases, the use of force exacerbates the problem rather than [solves] it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Reuit071022&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2214711120071022|title=Iran seen to need 3-8 yrs to produce bomb|last=Boyle|first=Jon|date=October 22, 2007|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published on July 12, 2010, in the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', ElBaradei said &quot;I do not believe that the Iranians are actually producing nuclear weapons. .  .  .[I]n general, the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran is overestimated; some even play it up intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,705991-2,00.html ''Der Spiegel'': Interview with Mohamed ElBaradei, 12 July 2010]. Accessed 15 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reactions to Elbaradei's role in addressing the nuclear program of Iran ====

Former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] has indirectly criticized ElBaradei for &quot;muddying the message&quot; to Iran and has also said that &quot;the IAEA is not in the business of diplomacy. The IAEA is a technical agency that has a board of governors of which the United States is a member.&quot; In response to Rice's comments, a senior official from the agency said that &quot;the IAEA is only doing now what the U.N.

Former [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]] and current [[president of Israel]], [[Shimon Peres]], has said that &quot;there are holes in the (IAEA) apparatus for deterring a culture of nuclear weapons, as in the case with Iran, but the agency certainly has done much in the prevention of nuclear weapons from reaching dangerous hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?apage=2&amp;cid=1127746241964&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull ''Jerusalem Post'': IAEA, ElBaradei share Nobel Peace Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; In a different reaction, former [[Deputy leaders of Israel#Deputy Prime Minister|Israeli Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Shaul Mofaz]] has called for ElBaradei to be [[impeached]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sack&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7085213.stm|title=Israel minister: Sack ElBaradei |date=8 November 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Minister]] [[Bernard Kouchner]], warned about the potential dangers of a nuclear Iran. He stated that &quot;we have to prepare for the worst, and the worst is war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6997935.stm France warning of war with Iran]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Kouchner, ElBaredei characterized talk of attacking Iran as &quot;hype&quot;, and dismissed the notion of a possible attack on Iran. He referred to the war in Iraq, where &quot;70,000 innocent civilians have lost their lives on the suspicion that a country has nuclear weapons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5il3-0Mz_npSl3XR-KFiB5rR59Whg IAEA boss warns against Iran attack] UK Press Google, accessed September 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He further added &quot;I do not believe at this stage that we are facing a clear and present danger that requires [that] we go beyond diplomacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7000131.stm ElBaradei concerned over Iran row], [[BBC News]], Sep. 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran points out that ElBaradei has highlighted the lack of evidence that Iran is after a nuclear bomb&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=56533&amp;sectionid=351020104 ''PressTV'': ElBaradei: Iran not after bomb]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlanticfreepress.com/news/1/4085-threats-of-war-against-iran-continue-to-escalate.html ''Atlantic Free Press'': Threats of War Against Iran Continue to Escalate]&lt;/ref&gt; and has stated that Iran is meeting its obligations to allow inspectors into its nuclear sites. Iran further states that the IAEA chief has consistently verified non-diversion in Iran's nuclear program and has said that his investigations show no military aspect in Iran's program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=86223&amp;sectionid=3510302 ''PressTV'': Soltaniyeh: Nothing new in ElBaradei's report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/archives/news/world/20071028-iran-nuclear-iaea-elbaradei-un.php ''France24'': ElBaradei: 'No evidence Iran is making nuclear weapons']&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Tehran Times]]'' political desk, ElBaradei has reaffirmed in December 2008 that Iran's nuclear activities are &quot;legal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=184534 ''Tehran Times'': ElBaradei says Iranâs nuclear program is legal: report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=798560 ''Mehr News'': ElBaradei says Iranâs nuclear program is legal: report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Kaveh L Afrasiabi]], the author of ''After Khomeini: New Directions in Iran's Foreign Policy'', said that ElBaradei has been downplaying Iran's cooperation for some time, a statement which is raising the ire of Tehran. Afrasiabi further says that ElBaradei has given himself &quot;the license to speculate on the timeline when Iran could convert its peaceful nuclear work into weaponization,&quot; which is irresponsible and inconsistent with his statements on other states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/KC04Ak01.html ''Asia Times'': IAEA 'mismanagement' raises Tehran's ire]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAM has also reiterated &quot;its full confidence in the impartiality and professionalism of the Secretariat of the IAEA.&quot; &quot;[The] NAM recognizes the IAEA as the sole competent authority for verification and expresses its full confidence in the professionalism and impartiality of the IAEA. In this regard, [the] NAM strongly believes that all issues on safeguards and verification, including those of Iran, should be resolved only by the agency, within its framework, and be based on technical and legal grounds,&quot; the NAM said in another statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.xinhuanet.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/2008/08062312151001.htm South African Government: Notes following briefing by Deputy Minister Aziz Pahad on current international issues, Union Building, Pretoria - Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multinational control of the nuclear fuel cycle===

In an op-ed that he wrote for the [[The Economist|''Economist'']] in 2003, ElBaradei outlined his idea for the future of the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. His suggestion was to âlimit the processing of weapon-usable material in civilian nuclear programs, as well as the production of new material, by agreeing to restrict these operations exclusively to facilities under multinational control.â Also, ânuclear-energy systems should be deployed that, by design, avoid the use of materials that may be applied directly to making nuclear weapons.â He concluded by saying that âconsiderable advantages would be gained from international co-operation in these stages of the nuclear-fuel cycle. These initiatives would not simply add more non-proliferation controls, to limit access to weapon-usable nuclear material; they would also provide access to the benefits of nuclear technology for more people in more countries.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Non-nuclear-weapon states have been reluctant to embrace these proposals due to a perception that the commercial or strategic interests of nuclear-weapon states motivate the proposals, a perception that the proposals produce a dependency on a limited number of nuclear fuel suppliers, and a concern that the proposal restricts their unalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.&lt;ref name=ASIL&gt;[http://www.asil.org/insights080630.cfm American Society of International Law: The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons: Taking Stock after the May 2008 Preparatory Committee Meeting ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical cooperation and cancer control===

ElBaradeiâs work does not only concentrate on nuclear verification.  Another very important aspect is development through nuclear technology. In 2004, ElBaradei sponsored a comprehensive global initiativeâthe [[Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy]] (PACT)--to fight cancer.  In one of his statements, Elbaradei said: âA silent crisis in cancer treatment persists in developing countries and is intensifying every year. At least 50 to 60 percent of cancer victims can benefit from radiotherapy, but most developing countries do not have enough radiotherapy machines or sufficient numbers of specialized doctors and other health professionals.â In the first year of operation, PACT provided cancer-treatment capacity in seven member states, using the IAEA's share of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to the 2008 General Conference, ElBaradei said that âdevelopment activities remain central to our work. Our resources have long been insufficient to keep pace with requests for support, and we have increasingly made use of partnerships with other organizations, regional collaborations and country-to-country support. I again emphasise that technical cooperation is not a bargaining chip, part of a political 'balance' between the development and safeguards activities of the agency.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==International Crisis Group==

ElBaradei served on the Board of Trustees of the [[International Crisis Group]], a non-governmental organization that enjoys an annual budget of over $15 million and is bankrolled by the Carnegie, the Ford Foundation, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as George Sorosâ Open Society Institute. Soros himself serves as a member of the organizationâs Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/about/board.aspx Crisis Group's Board of Trustees - International Crisis Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ElBaredei during Friday of Anger.png|thumb|Mohammed ElBaradei during ''Friday of Anger'']]
While speaking at the [[Harvard]] [[Kennedy School of Government]] on  April 27, 2010, ElBaradei joked that he is &quot;looking for a job&quot; and is seeking to be an &quot;agent of change and an advocate for democracy&quot; within Egyptian politics. He also made clear that his wife is not very enthusiastic about any potential run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.harvard.edu/Multimedia-Center/All-Videos/Nonproliferation-Arms-Control-Challenges-Opportunities2 |title=Nonproliferation &amp; Arms Control : Challenges &amp; Opportunities |publisher=Harvard University Institute of Politics |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On  January 27, 2011, ElBaradei returned to Egypt amid ongoing [[2011 Egyptian protests|turmoil]], with the largest mass protests in 30 years, which had begun two days earlier, on  January 25, 2011. ElBaradei declared himself ready to lead a transitional government if that was the will of the nation, saying that, &quot;If [people] want me to lead the transition, I will not let them down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott |first=Mark |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/27/133275390/el-baradei-back-in-egypt-says-its-time-for-a-new-government |title=ElBaradei Back In Egypt; Says It's Time For A New Government |publisher=NPR |date=2011-01-27 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, &quot;when he joined protesters Friday after noon prayers, police fired water cannons at him and his supporters. They used batons to beat some of ElBaradei's supporters, who surrounded him to protect him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AP |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/28/violent-clashes-police-break-cairo/ |title=Five People Killed During Protests in Egypt |publisher=FoxNews.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On  January 28, 2011, ElBaradei was reported to have been placed under house arrest in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-28/egypt-s-muslim-botherhood-says-police-detain-senior-leaders-after-protests.html Mubarak Faces His Biggest Challenge Amid Nationwide Protests]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next day, when he was interviewed by [[Al Jazeera]], he said that he was unaware of any such arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/201112974149942894.html Thousands in Cairo defy curfew]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, ElBaradei arrived in [[Tahrir Square]] to join thousands of other protesters against the Mubarak regime and spoke directly to the people, stating that they &quot;have taken back [their] rights&quot; and that they cannot go back. A number of Egyptian political movements have called on ElBaradei to form a transitional government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12320200 ElBaradei's speech on Tahrir Square]&lt;/ref&gt; ElBaradei has also stated that &quot;the people [of Egypt] want the regime to fall.&quot; In response to the appointment of [[Omar Suleiman]] as the new vice president of Egypt, ElBaradei stated that it was a &quot;hopeless, desperate attempt by Mubarak to stay in power. I think [that] it is loud and clear...that Mubarak has to leave today.&quot; Additionally, ElBaradei restated his position that, when Egypt does become a democratic nation, &quot;there is no reason to believe that a democracy in Egypt would not lead to a better relationship with the US based on respect and equity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2011/01/30/gps.elbaradei.intv.cnn?iref=allsearch |title=Video - Breaking News Videos from |publisher=CNN.com |date=2010-07-16 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardian reported that ElBaradei has been mandated by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and four other opposition groups to negotiate an interim &quot;national salvation government.&quot; However, BBC reports that the Muslim Brotherhood, the largest opposition party banned by Mubarak's regime,  has not consented to the choice of ElBaradei as the representative of the opposition. &quot;The people have not appointed Mohamed ElBaradei to become a spokesman of them. The Muslim Brotherhood is much stronger than Mohamed ElBaradei as a person. And we do not agree [that he should represent] this movement. The movement is represented by itself, and it will [appoint] a committee. . .to [delegate its representatives].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kevin Connolly |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12320959 |title=Egypt protesters step up pressure on Hosni Mubarak |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His appointment is controversial largely because of the long periods that he has spent outside the country. His appointment is seen as a recognition of the importance of various Western nations' support of the revolts.

=== Possible presidential candidacy ===

{{Main|Egyptian presidential election, 2012|National Association for Change}}

ElBaradei's name has been circulated by opposition groups since 2009 as a possible candidate to succeed President [[Hosni Mubarak]] in Egypt's highest executive position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egyptian opposition wants ElBaradei to run for president |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=204908 |newspaper=[[Tehran Times]] |date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=El Baradei to run for president of Egypt? |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009%5C10%5C07%5Cstory_7-10-2009_pg4_7 |newspaper=[[Daily Times (Palistan)|Daily Times]] |date=October 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arab League chief refuses to rule out Egypt presidential bid |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/291035,arab-league-chief-refuses-to-rule-out-egypt-presidential-bid.html |newspaper=[[Earth Times]] |date=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradei did not make any clear statements regarding his intentions to run for the office; however, he has demanded that certain conditions be met to ensure fair elections accompanied by changes to the constitution that will allow more freedom for independent candidates before he would actually consider running for the presidency. Several opposition groups have endorsed him, considering him a neutral figure who could transition the country to greater [[democracy]].

On  February 24, 2010, ElBaradei met with several opposition leaders and notable intellectuals at his home in [[Cairo]]. The meeting was concluded with an announcement for the formation of a new non-party-political movement called the &quot;[[National Association for Change]].&quot; The movement aims for general reforms in the political scene and mainly [http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/Constitution/chp_five/part_one.aspx article 76 of the Egyptian constitution], which places restrictions on free presidential elections, especially when it comes to independent candidates. The banned political group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was represented at the meeting by one of its key figures; however, its stand in accepting a non-member of its group as a representative is still unclear. It is also unknown whether [[Amr Moussa]], the head of the [[Arab League]] who met with ElBaradei a day earlier, will be part of the new movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElBaradei to form 'national association for change'&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8534365.stm ElBaradei to form 'national association for change']&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 2011 it was announced that Elbaradei intended to run for the presidential elections, this intention was later clearly stated in a live interview by ElBaradei to the ON TV channel March 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2011/march/7/barad3i_president.aspx |title=Ø§ÙØ¨Ø±Ø§Ø¯Ø¹Ù ÙØ¹ÙÙ ØªØ±Ø´Ø­Ù ÙÙØ±Ø¦Ø§Ø³Ø© |publisher=Masrawy.com |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

During his tenure as Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, ElBaradei has been recognized with many awards for his efforts to ensure that nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes.

=== 2005 Nobel Peace Prize ===

On October 7, 2005, ElBaradei and the [[IAEA]] were announced as joint recipients of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their &quot;efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy, for peaceful purposes, is used in the safest possible way.&quot; ElBaradei donated all of his winnings to building [[orphanage]]s in [[Cairo]]. The IAEA's winnings are being spent to train scientists from developing countries to use nuclear techniques in combating cancer and malnutrition. ElBaradei is the fourth Egyptian to receive the Nobel Prize, following [[Anwar Sadat]] (1978 in Peace), [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1988 in Literature), and [[Ahmed Zewail]] (1999 in Chemistry).

In [http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/Statements/2005/ebsp2005n020.html his Nobel lecture], ElBaradei said that the changing landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may be defined by the emergence of an extensive black market in nuclear material and equipment, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and sensitive nuclear technology, and the stagnation in [[nuclear disarmament]]. To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material out of the hands of extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts.&lt;ref name=NP2005&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2005/elbaradei-lecture-en.html The Nobel Foundation: Mohamed ElBaradei, The Nobel Peace Prize 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience and no role in our security.

[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] said that he was delighted that the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to the UN nuclear watchdog and its head, ElBaradei. &quot;The secretary general congratulates him and the entire staff of the agency, past and present, on their contributions to global peace,&quot; a spokesman for Annan said.&lt;ref name=PeoplesDailyNobel&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200510/08/eng20051008_213260.html ''Peoples Daily'': Int'l community hails IAEA, ElBaradei's winning of Nobel Peace Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;
