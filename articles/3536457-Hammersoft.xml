{{nihongo|'''Kyoko Ina'''|ä¼å¥ æ­å­|Ina KyÅko|born October 11, 1972}} is a [[Japanese-American]] [[figure skater]]. With partner [[John Zimmerman (figure skater)|John Zimmerman]], she is a three-time (2000â2002) [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national champion]] and [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympian]]. With partner [[Jason Dungjen]], she was a two-time (1997 &amp; 1998) U.S. Champion and a 1994 &amp; 1998 Olympian.

== Life and career ==
Ina was born in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], but raised in New York. She started skating at the age of 4, at the rink at [[Rockefeller Center]]. Ina skated singles and pairs for Japan in the Junior ranks, but eventually decided to compete solely for the United States.

Her first American partnership was with [[Jason Dungjen]] from 1991 to 1998, under the coaching of Peter Burrows and Marylynn Gelderman in [[Monsey, New York]]. They excelled as a pair and placed 4th in the [[1998 Winter Olympics]]. Their partnership ended following that season. 

She teamed up with [[John Zimmerman (figure skater)|John Zimmerman]] then formed a skating partnership, and they trained under [[Tamara Moskvina]] and Igor Moskvin in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], [[New Jersey]]. They are able to capitalize on their height difference and perform various difficult lifts.

They won 3 U.S. Championships and competed at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. They won the bronze medal at the [[2002 World Figure Skating Championships]].

Ina had not yet turned professional when, on July 18, 2002, the [[USADA]] chose to perform an out-of-competition [[Doping (sport)|doping test]] on her. The agent came to her home for an unscheduled test at 10:30 at night. Ina stated that she could not produce the [[urine sample]] because she had already prepared to go to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E4DC1F3CF935A15753C1A9649C8B63&lt;/ref&gt; Ina was led to believe by the agent that the test could be rescheduled for the following day,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-me-doping11dec11,1,2812494.story?page=3&lt;/ref&gt; but she was later charged with refusing to take a doping test. She was suspended by the USADA because of this and faced fines. Despite what had been reported, Ina never faced suspension from the [[International Skating Union]] because the refused test was a national out of competition test.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.isu.org/news/inadoping.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ina's case was further complicated because it was not clear at the time if she had or had not officially retired from competition at the time of the attempted test.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=906&lt;/ref&gt; Ina eventually filed a case with the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], but later withdrew it.  In the end, Ina accepted a two-year sanction from the USADA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=906&lt;/ref&gt;

Ina and Zimmerman skated with the [[Stars on Ice]] tour for many years.

In 2010, Ina is competing in the [[Battle of the Blades (season 2)|second season]] of the Canadian reality competition ''[[Battle of the Blades]]'' partnered with retired [[NHL]] player [[Kelly Chase]].  The program pairs former hockey players with professional figure skaters in a pairs figure skating competition.
