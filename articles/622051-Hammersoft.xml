''&quot;But I was very worried about taking it on because I'm not Jewish. I'm a Liverpool Irish Catholic and this role was such a responsibility because it involved a huge and emotive part of the history of the Jewish race.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt; Collins studied at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in London. Before turning to acting, she worked as a teacher until 1962. She made her stage debut at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in ''A Gazelle in Park Lane'' in 1962 and her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in ''[[Passion Flower Hotel]]'' in 1965, and many stage roles followed. Her first film was ''Secrets of a Windmill Girl'' (1966).

Collins played Samantha Briggs in the 1967 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Faceless Ones]]'' and was offered the chance to continue in the series as a new companion for the Doctor, but declined the invitation.  

Other early TV credits include the UK's first medical soap ''[[Emergency - Ward 10]]'' (1960), and the pilot episode and first series of ''[[The Liver Birds]]'', both in 1969.  

Collins first became well known for her role as the maid [[Sarah Moffat|Sarah]] in the 1970s [[ITV]] drama series ''[[Upstairs, Downstairs]]''.
