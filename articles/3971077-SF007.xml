'''OpenOffice.org Draw''' is a [[vector graphics editor]] and is part of the [[OpenOffice.org]] [[office suite]]. It features &quot;connectors&quot; between shapes, which are available in a range of line styles and facilitate building drawings such as [[flowchart]]. It also includes many features found in [[desktop publishing]] software. 

OpenOffice.org users can also install the [[Open Clip Art Library]], which adds an extensive gallery of flags, logos, icons and banners for general presentation and drawing projects. In particular, [[Linux distribution]]s [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]] have provided ready-to-use ''openclipart'' packages for easy download and install from their online software repositories.

Released under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public Licence]], Draw is [[free software]].

== SVG support status ==
Currently OpenOffice.org supports exporting to [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] format officially, though with some limitations to be resolved&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.openoffice.org/svg/svg.htm graphics: openoffice.org : graphics : chart project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. The SVG import filter&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/SVG_Import_Filter SVG Import Filter - OpenOffice.org Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, however, is still under  development and requires the [[Java Runtime Environment]] to be installed.

It is anticipated that as SVG and SVG filters evolve, users will be able to use Draw to edit the large scale collection of SVG samples from Open Clip Art Library.
