'''Alhambra''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ã¦|l|Ë|h|Ã¦|m|b|r|É}} or {{IPAc-en|ÉË|l|Ë|h|ÉË|m|b|r|É}}; {{IPA-es|aËlambÉ¾a|lang}}) is a [[city]] ([[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] on July 11, 1903) located in the western [[San Gabriel Valley]] region of [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States, which is approximately eight miles from the [[Downtown Los Angeles]] civic center. As of the 2010 census, the population was 83,089, down from 85,804 at the 2000 census. The city's [[ZIP code]]s are 91801 and 91803 (plus 91802 for P.O. boxes).

== History ==
Alhambra is named after [[Washington Irving]]'s book ''[[Tales of the Alhambra]]'', not after the [[Alhambra]] palace itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofalhambra.org/ City of Alhambra&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alhambra was founded as a [[suburb]] of Los Angeles in 1903.  Alhambra existed as an [[unincorporated area]] during the mid-19th century. The first school in Alhambra was [[Ramona Convent Secondary School]] built on hillside property donated by the prominent James de Barth Shorb family. Thirteen years before the city was incorporated, several prominent [[San Gabriel Valley]] families interested in the [[Catholic education]] of their daughters established the school in 1890.  The city's first public high school, [[Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California)|Alhambra High School]], was established in 1898, five years before the city's incorporation. The Alhambra Fire Department was established in 1906.  On July 11, 1903, the City of Alhambra was incorporated.  

Alhambra was originally promoted as a &quot;city of homes,&quot; and many of Alhambra's homes have historical significance. They include styles such as Craftsman, Bungalow, Spanish Mediterranean, Spanish Colonial, Italian Beaux-Arts, and Arts &amp; Crafts. Several residential areas have been designated as Historic Neighborhoods by the city, including the Bean Tract (formerly owned by early resident Jacob Bean), the Midwick Tract (site of the former Midwick Country Club), the Airport Tract (formerly the landing pad for Alhambra Airport), and the Emery Park area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofalhambra.org/community/residential_living/ResidentialLiving_Index1.html City of Alhambra:Residential living]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a large number of condominiums, rental apartments, and mixed-use residential/commercial buildings, especially in the Downtown area.
[[Image:Alhambra-Gar-Main-1890.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Downtown Alhambra, Garfield and Main, 1890]]

The main business district of Alhambra â at the intersection of Main &amp; Garfield â has been a center of commerce since 1895. By the 1950s, it had taken on an upscale look  and was &quot;the&quot; place to go in the San Gabriel Valley.  While unfortunately, many of the classic historical buildings have been torn down over the years, the rebuilding of Main Street has led to numerous dining, retail and entertainment establishments. Alhambra has experienced waves of new immigrants, beginning with Italians in the 1950s, Mexicans in the 1960s, and Chinese in the 1980s. As a result, a very active Chinese business district has developed on [[Valley Boulevard]], including Chinese supermarkets, restaurants, shops, banks, realtors, and medical offices.  The Valley Boulevard  Corridor has become a national hub for many Asian-owned bank headquarters, although there are other nationally-recognized retailers.

The historic Garfield Theatre, on Valley Blvd and Garfield Avenue 1925-2001, was formerly a Vaudeville venue and is rumored to have hosted the [[Gumm Sisters]], featuring a very young [[Judy Garland]].  Faded from its original glory, for its last few years it was purchased and ran Chinese-language films, but in 2001 went out of business. Subsequently, developers have remodeled the dilapidated building turning it into a vibrant commercial center with many Chinese stores and eateries.

In 2003, actress [[Lana Clarkson]] was shot to death in the Alhambra home of record producer [[Phil Spector]]. Spector lived in Alhambra's largest and most notable residence, the Pyrenees Castle, built in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/mar/17/musicnews.usa The Guardian, March 17, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Spector was convicted of second-degree murder in connection with her death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/04/13/people-spector-idUSN1334647020090413 Reuters, April 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Public transportation in Alhambra is provided by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (Metro) as well as the [[List of small Southern California transit agencies#Alhambra Community Transit|Alhambra Community Transit]].

The California High-Speed Rail Authority is considering proposals to a build high-speed rail system through Alhambra along the I=10, San Bernardino Freeway, corridor from the east city limits to west city limits. In late July 2010, the Authority told the city the options under consideration include building tracks down the center of the freeway and parallel to the freeway along Ramona Road. As proposed, there would be a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} deck set on top of {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} posts placed every {{convert|100|ft|m}}. The proposal is part of the high-speed rail network currently planned for California. It is part of the line between Los Angeles Union Station and San Diego, through the Inland Empire. Residents and city leaders voiced opposition to the plan to route the high-speed trains through the city in public meetings.
