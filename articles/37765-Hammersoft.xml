The university is organized into five undergraduate colleges, seven professional schools, and five professional Health Science schools. Fourteen [[Nobel Prize]] laureates have been affiliated with the university as faculty, researchers, or alumni. Among the current faculty members, 43 have been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], 21 to the [[National Academy of Engineering]], 34 to the [[Institute of Medicine]], and 108 to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA Research Facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovcr.ucla.edu/uploads/file/UCLA%20Research%20Fact%20Sheet%202009.pdf |title=UCLA Research Facts|publisher=Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research |year=2006â2007 |accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLA student-athletes compete intercollegiately as the [[UCLA Bruins|Bruins]]. As a member of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]], the Bruins have won 125 national championships, including 107 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] team championships as of May 2011, more than any other university.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA Rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/combined.pdf |title=NCAA |accessdate=2009-11-14|work=NCAA }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA Champions Made Here&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uclabruins.com/trads/no-1-combined-program.html |title=UCLA Champions Made Here |accessdate=2009-11-14|work=UCLA Official Athletic Site }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA was also ranked the number one most economically diverse university among &quot;elite schools&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Diversity Rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools |title=US News and World Report |accessdate=2011-06-04|work=US News and World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, UCLA has one of the greatest [[Olympic Games]] traditions of any university. UCLA students have won 214 Olympic medals - 106 gold, 54 silver and 54 bronze. The Bruins have had at least one competitor in every Olympics since 1920 with one exception (1924), and UCLA has won a gold medal in every Olympics since 1932 with the exception of 1980 (boycott).&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA Bruins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uclabruins.com/ot/olympic-medalists.html |title=UCLA Bruins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the University of California, Los Angeles}}

In March 1881, after heavy lobbying by Los Angeles residents, the [[California State Legislature]] authorized the creation of a southern branch of the [[California State Normal School]] (which later became [[San Jose State University]]) in [[downtown Los Angeles]] to train teachers for the growing population of [[Southern California]]. The State [[Normal School]] at Los Angeles opened on August 29, 1882, on what is now the site of the Central Library of the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] system. The new facility included an [[elementary school]] where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children. That elementary school is related to the present day version, UCLA Lab School. In 1887, the school became known as the Los Angeles State Normal School.&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeley&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/UCHistory/general_history/campuses/ucla/overview.html |title=(UC) Los Angeles: Historical Overview |accessdate=2006-06-20 |author=Hamilton, Andrew |date=2004-06-18 |work=University of California History, Digital Archives (from Berkeley) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UCLA-old-statenormal-campus.jpg|thumb|left|The Los Angeles branch of [[California State Normal School]], in 1881.]]

In 1914, the school moved to a new campus on [[Vermont Avenue]] (now the site of [[Los Angeles City College]]) in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. In 1917, UC Regent Edward A. Dickson, the only regent representing the Southland at the time, and Ernest Carroll Moore, Director of the Normal School, began working together to lobby the State Legislature to enable the school to become the second [[University of California]] campus, after [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. They met resistance from Berkeley alumni, Northern California members of the state legislature, and Benjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California from 1899 to 1919, who were all vigorously opposed to the idea of a southern campus.
David Prescott Barrows, the new President of the University of California, did not share Wheeler's objections. On May 23, 1919, the Southern Californians' efforts were rewarded when Governor [[William Stephens|William D. Stephens]] signed Assembly Bill 626 into law, which turned the campus into the [[Southern Branch of the University of California]] and added its general undergraduate program, the College of Letters and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm |title=UCLA University Archives |accessdate=2006-06-20 |date=2007-01-20 |work=UCLA Library |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060615035434/http://www.library.ucla.edu/libraries/special/scweb/archives.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Branch campus opened on September 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 Letters and Science students and 1,250 students in the Teachers College, under Moore's continued direction.

[[Image:UCLA-vermontcampus-1922.jpg|thumb|right|University of California, Southern Branch's Vermont Campus, 1922.]]

Under University of California President [[William Wallace Campbell]], enrollment at the Southern Branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 25&amp;nbsp;[[acre]] Vermont Avenue location. The Regents conducted a search for a new location and announced their selection of the so-called &quot;Beverly Site&quot;âjust west of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]âon March 21, 1925 edging out the panoramic hills of the still-empty Palos Verdes Peninsula.  After the athletic teams entered the Pacific Coast conference in 1926, the Southern Branch student council adopted the nickname &quot;Bruins,&quot; a name offered by the student council at Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulwaf.com/Daily-Bruin-History/03_Birth.html |title=The Daily Bruin Is Born |accessdate=2006-07-03 |author=Garrigues, George |year=2001 |work=Loud Bark and Curious Eyes, A History of the UCLA Daily Bruin, 1919â1955 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060528022042/http://ulwaf.com/Daily-Bruin-History/03_Birth.html |archivedate = May 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, the Regents renamed the campus the &quot;University of California at Los Angeles&quot; (the word &quot;at&quot; was officially replaced by a [[comma]] in 1958, in line with other UC campuses) and the state broke ground in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers [[Janss Investment Company|Edwin and Harold Janss]], for whom the Janss Steps are named.&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeley&quot; /&gt;

The original four buildings were the College Library, [[Royce Hall]], the Physics-Biology Building, and the Chemistry Building (now [[Powell Library]], Royce Hall, the Humanities Building, and Haines Hall, respectively), arrayed around a quadrangular courtyard on the 400&amp;nbsp;acre (1.6&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) campus. The first undergraduate classes on the new campus were held in 1929 with 5,500 students. In 1933, after further lobbying by alumni, faculty, administration and community leaders, UCLA was permitted to award the [[master's degree]], and in 1936, the [[doctorate]], against continued resistance from Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uclalumni.net/AlumniStories/ImpactReport/History.cfm |title=Alumni &amp; UCLA History |accessdate=2006-06-20 |author=UCLA Alumni |year=2007 |work=UCLA Alumni Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Uclapowellsnow1932.JPG|thumb|left|The University Library, now known as the [[Powell Library]], was covered in snow on January 15, 1932|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 17 March 2009}}]] --&gt;

===Maturity as a university===
The campus received its first chancellor in 1951, thereby establishing itself as an autonomous entity within the UC system. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped to spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university in its own right and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him later on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, 'University of California.' And I said, 'Is this Berkeley?' She said, 'No.' I said, 'Well, who have I gotten to?' 'UCLA.' I said, 'Why didn't you say UCLA?' 'Oh,' she said, 'we're instructed to say University of California.' So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, 'Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, &quot;UCLA.&quot;' And they said, 'You know they won't like it at Berkeley.' And I said, 'Well, let's just see. There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission.'&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/1999/991109caught.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060901112349/http://www.today.ucla.edu/1999/991109caught.html |archivedate=2006-09-01 |title=Caught on Tape: Voices from UCLA's Past |accessdate=2008-01-25 |author=Ko, Amy |year=1999 |work=UCLA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, the university completed Campaign UCLA, which collected over [[United States dollar|$]]3.05 billion and is the second most successful fundraising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/2009-04-16/tough-times-u-pushes-forward-fundraising-efforts |title=In tough times, 'U' pushes forward with fundraising efforts |accessdate=2009-11-15 |author=Kyle Swanson |year=2009 |work=The Michigan Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/na/32-billion-michigan-difference-total-announced |title=$3.2 billion Michigan Difference total announced |accessdate=2009-11-15 |author=Lindy Stevens |year=2009 |work=The Michigan Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, UCLA raised over $456 million, ranking the institution among the top 10 universities in the United States in total fundraising for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=6819 |title=UCLA Raises More Than $3 Billion&amp;nbsp;...

==Campus==
[[Image:UCLA arial.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of UCLA campus]]
When UCLA opened its new campus in 1929, it had four buildings. Today, the campus includes 163 buildings across 419&amp;nbsp;acres (1.7&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) in the western part of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], north of the [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] shopping district and just south of [[Sunset Boulevard]]. The campus is close but not adjacent to the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?latlongtype=internal&amp;addtohistory=&amp;latitude=%2fujp23Q4CoQyaX7fYDsWRA%3d%3d&amp;longitude=8%2fGfpeQs3DIJqAXMypI90g%3d%3d&amp;name=UNIVERSITY%20of%20California&amp;country=US&amp;address=405%20Hilgard%20Ave&amp;city=Los%20Angeles&amp;state=CA&amp;zipcode=90095&amp;phone=310%2d825%2d4321&amp;spurl=0&amp;&amp;q=UCLA&amp;qc=Colleges%20%26%20Universities |title=Map of UNIVERSITY of California |accessdate=2007-05-29 |date=Current |work=Mapquest }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles. It is located in the residential area of [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] and bordered by [[Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], and [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood]]. The campus is informally divided into North Campus and South Campus, which are both on the eastern half of the university's land. North Campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more old-fashioned in appearance and clad in imported Italian brick. North Campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined Dickson Court. South Campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, psychology, mathematical sciences, all health-related fields, and the [[UCLA Medical Center]].

[[Image:Janss Steps, UCLA.jpg|thumb|Janss Steps]]

Ackerman Union, the [[John Wooden]] Center, the [[Arthur Ashe]] Health and Wellness Center, the Student Activities Center, Kerckhoff Hall, the J.D. Morgan Center, the James West Alumni Center, and [[Pauley Pavilion]] stand at the center of the campus. [[Bruin Walk]], a heavily traveled pathway from housing to the main campus, bisects the campus.

===Architecture===
The first campus buildings were designed by the local firm Allison &amp; Allison. The [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style on campus until the 1950s, when architect [[Welton Becket]] was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. Becket greatly streamlined the
general appearance of the campus, adding several rows of [[Minimalism|minimalist]], slabâshaped brick buildings to the southern half of the campus, the largest of these being the [[UCLA Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/cd/cm/?id=weltonbecketandassociates-losangeles-ca-usa |title=Welton Becket and Associates |accessdate=2007-05-29 |year=2007 |work=Emporis Buildings }}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects such as [[A. Quincy Jones]], [[William Pereira]] and [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]] designed many subsequent structures on the campus during the mid-20th century. More
recent additions include buildings designed by architects [[I.M. Pei]], [[Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates]], [[Richard Meier]], [[Cesar Pelli]], and [[Rafael Vinoly]]. In order to accommodate UCLA's rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. This continuous construction gives UCLA the on-campus nickname of &quot;Under Construction Like Always.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/041012closeup_senseofplace.html |title=A 'sense of place' from the old and new |accessdate=2007-05-29 |author=Lee, Cynthia |date=2004-10-12 |work=UCLA Today |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070128014442/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/041012closeup_senseofplace.html |archivedate = January 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RHall.JPG|thumb|left|[[Royce Hall]], one of the original four buildings of the campus, has become the symbol of UCLA, taking inspiration from [[Italy|Italian]] [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]], in [[Milan]]]]

The tallest building on campus is named after [[Ralph Bunche]], an African-American alumnus, who received the 1950 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for negotiating an armistice agreement between the Jews and Arabs in Israel. A bust of him, on the entrance to Bunche Hall, overlooks the [[Franklin D. Murphy]] Sculpture Garden. He was the first individual of non-European background and the first UCLA alumnus to be honored with the Prize.

A mile from campus, the UCLA Hannah Carter Japanese Garden is located in the community of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel-Air]]. The garden was designed by landscape architect Nagao Sakurai of Tokyo and garden designer Kazuo Nakamura of Kyoto in 1959. After the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, UCLA Professor of Art and Campus Architect Koichi Kawana took on the task of its reconstruction.

=== Filming ===
With a location near [[Hollywood]] and a world-famous film and television school, the UCLA campus has attracted filming for decades. Much of the 1985 film ''[[Gotcha! (1985 film)|Gotcha!]]'' was shot at UCLA, as well as [[John Singleton]]'s ''[[Higher Learning]]'' (1995). ''[[Legally Blonde]]' (2001)', &quot;[[Old School]]&quot; (2003), &quot;[[The Nutty Professor]]&quot; (1995), ''[[Erin Brockovich]]'' (2000), &quot;[[How High]]&quot; (2001), and ''[[American Pie 2]]'' were all mainly shot at the university campus or locale. In January 2009, the [[Bollywood]] movie [[My Name is Khan]] was shot at UCLA. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] , the book [[Sweet L.A.

In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA instated a policy on filming and professional photography at the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adminvc.ucla.edu/appm/public/app_0863_0.html |title=UCLA Policy 863: Filming and Photography on Campus |accessdate=2007-05-21 |date=2004-01-23 |author=Morabito, Sam |work=UCLA Administrative Policies &amp; Procedures Manual |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060901090414/http://www.adminvc.ucla.edu/appm/public/app_0863_0.html |archivedate = September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;UCLA is located in Los Angeles, the same place as the American motion picture industry,&quot; said UCLA visiting professor of film and television Jonathan Kuntz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/faculty/facftv/index.cfm?action=showbio&amp;alias=jkuntz&amp;pagetype=blank |title=Jonathan Kuntz â Visiting Associate Professor |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;So we're convenient for (almost) all of the movie companies, TV production companies, commercial companies and so on. We're right where the action is.&quot;

=== Transportation and parking ===
The campus maintains 24,000 [[parking]] spaces and operates an award-winning sustainable transportation program,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/sustainability/documents/update_la.pdf |title=UCLA Transportation: An Overview |accessdate=2010-08-09 |author=Fortier, Renee A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sustain.ucla.edu/news/article.asp?parentid=840 |title =UCLA's Sustainble Transportation Efforts |accessdate=2010-08-09 |author=UCLA Sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metro.net/news/simple_pr/ucla-first-major-university-l-county-go-metro-metr/ |title=UCLA First Major University in L.A.

===UCLA Healthcare===
[[Image:Medcenter.jpg|thumb|left|UCLA Medical Plaza is near the main entrance to the campus]]
The [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|David Geffen School of Medicine]], along with the [[UCLA School of Nursing|School of Nursing]], [[UCLA School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], and [[UCLA School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], comprise the professional schools of health science. In 2005, UCLA announced its five-year plan to establish the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine; the state of California is rare in its public funding of research with new embryonic [[stem cell]] lines. The [[California Nanosystems Institute|California NanoSystems Institute]] is another project that was created out of a partnership with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] to pioneer innovations in the field of [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;construction&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsi.ucla.edu/staticpages/about-us |title=About CNSI |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2006 |work=California NanoSystems Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] is a part of a larger healthcare system, UCLA Healthcare, which also operates a hospital in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] and seven primary care clinics throughout [[Los Angeles County]]. In addition, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine uses two [[Los Angeles County]] public hospitals as teaching hospitalsâ[[Harbor-UCLA Medical Center]] and [[Olive View-UCLA Medical Center]]âas well as the largest private nonprofit hospital on the West Coast, [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]].
In 1981, the UCLA Medical Center made history when an assistant professor named Michael Gottlieb first diagnosed an unknown affliction later to be called [[AIDS]]. UCLA medical researchers also pioneered the use of PET scanning to study brain function. The signaling cascade of [[nitric oxide]], one of the most important molecules in cardiopulmonary physiology was discovered in part by the medical school's Professor of Pharmacology Louis J. Ignarro. For this, he was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology along with two other researchers â Robert F. Furchgott of the SUNY Health Science Center and Ferid Murad of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.

In the 2007 edition of ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', UCLA Medical Center was ranked best in the West, as well as one of the top 3 hospitals in the [[United States]] alongside [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Cleveland Clinic]], [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], and [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. In 15 of the 16 medical specialty areas examined, UCLA Medical Center ranked in the top 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/honorroll.htm |title=Best Hospitals 2006 |accessdate=2006-12-02 |year=2007 |work=U.S.News &amp; World Report |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061111013706/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/honorroll.htm |archivedate = November 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library system===
[[Image:Powell Library.JPG|thumb|right|Powell Library, located across the quad from Royce Hall.]]
{{Main|University of California, Los Angeles, library system}}
UCLA's library system has over eight million books and 70,000 serials spread over twelve libraries and eleven other archives, reading rooms, and research centers. It is the nation's 14th largest library in number of volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/professionalresources/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm |title=The Nation's Largest Libraries |accessdate=2010-07-04 |year=2010 |work=American Library Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first library, University library (presently Powell), was founded in 1884. In 1910, Elizabeth Fargo became the university's first librarian. [[Lawrence Clark Powell|Lawrence Powell]] became librarian in 1944, and began a series of system overhauls and modifications, and in 1959, he was named Dean of the School of Library Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ucla.edu/special/scweb/lcpintro.htm |title=A Tribute to Lawrence Clark Powell |accessdate=2006-12-13 |year=2006 |work=UCLA Library |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051217020308/http://www.library.ucla.edu/special/scweb/lcpintro.htm |archivedate = December 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; More libraries were added as previous ones filled. Page Ackerman became University Librarian in 1973, and was the nation's first female librarian of a system as large as UCLA's. She oversaw the first coordinations between other UC schools, and formed a new administrative network that is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/page.asp?RelNum=6884 |title=Obituary: Page Ackerman, Former UCLA University Librarian |accessdate=2006-12-13 |author=Setzer, Dawn |date=2006-03-09 |work=UCLA News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since her retirement, the system has seen steady growth and improvement under various Librarians. The present University Librarian is Gary E. Strong, who has been in office since September 1, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.library.ucla.edu/about/ul.cfm |title=University Librarian Gary E.

3,220 transfer students entered UCLA in Fall 2008, 90 percent from community colleges. Over the past 15 years over 45,000 transfer students have entered UCLA. One-third of baccalaureate degrees are awarded to students who entered UCLA as transfer students. One of the major current debates is over the decreasing admission of [[African-Americans]] and [[Latinos]], especially since the passage of [[Proposition 209]], prohibiting racial, sexual, or ethnic discrimination at public institutions, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Leonhardt |title=The New Affirmative Action |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/magazine/30affirmative-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=magazine | publisher= The New York Times Magazine |date=2007-09-30 |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the 4,700 students in the Fall 2006 class, 96 were African American, and 20 of those were recruited athletes. This is the lowest number of African Americans to enter into a class at UCLA in more than 30 years, and it
comes at a time when the other schools in the UC system are seeing an increase. In response to this issue, UCLA decided to shift to a more holistic admissions process, similar to that of UC Berkeley, starting Fall 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Scott |last=Smallwood |title=UCLA Adopts 'Holistic' Model in Admissions to Stem Decline in Minority Enrollment |url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/1061/ucla-adopts-holistic-model-in-admissions-to-stem-decline-in-minority-enrollment |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher= |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2007-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary data show that the overall number of underrepresented student applicants at UCLA â Native Americans, African Americans, and Chicanos/Latinos â increased from 10,097 in fall 2006 (22.2% of 2006 applicants) to 11,414 for fall 2007 (23.6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;news7664&quot;/&gt; 35% of admitted students receive federal [[Pell grant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc_ecodiv_brief.php | newspaper=[[US News and World Report]]| accessdate= 2007-08-10 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2005, the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|David Geffen School of Medicine]] admitted 4.5% of its applicants, the [[UCLA School of Law|School of Law]] admitted 16.1%, and the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|Anderson School of Management]] admitted 30.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drglance_1315_brief.php |title=America's Best Colleges |accessdate=2006-06-25 |year=2007 |work=U.S.News &amp; World Report }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) Guide to Dental Schools, 44th Ed., the [[UCLA School of Dentistry]] had more than 1,465 applicants for 88 seats in the entering class of 2006. The average [[Dental Admissions Test]] (DAT) scores for admitted students in the entering class of 2007 were 22 on the academic portion (3rd highest average in the nation after Harvard and Columbia) and 20 on the perceptual aptitude portion of the exam (3rd highest average after Harvard and University of Washington). In 1949 The Regents of the University of California authorized the School of Nursing as one of the professional schools of the UCLA Center for the Health Sciences. The Graduate School of Nursing is ranked by US News and World Report as one of the top graduate nursing programs in the country,

==Economic impact==
[[Image:UCLA hoodie.jpg|thumb|right|A [[hoodie]] from the UCLA store]]
The University has a significant impact in the Los Angeles Economy. It is the fourth largest employer in the county, after Los Angeles County, LAUSD and the Federal Government, and the seventh largest in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laalmanac.com/employment/em21e.htm Largest Employers in Los Angeles County].

===Trademarks and licensing===
The UCLA trademark also sells as an overseas clothing and accessories brand. This trend arises from the school's athletic and academic reputation, and popular images of the [[Southern California]] lifestyle. High demand for UCLA apparel has inspired the licensing of its trademark to UCLA brand stores throughout East Asia. Since 1980, 15 UCLA stores have opened in [[South Korea]], and 43 are currently open in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.uclastore.com.cn/StoreList.asp |title=UCLA Store List |accessdate=2006-12-26 |work=UCLAstore.com.cn |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080220073734/http://www.uclastore.com.cn/StoreList.asp |archivedate = February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also stores in [[Mexico]], [[Singapore]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stores&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Menaka |last=Fernando |title=UCLA name, L.A. lifestyle marketable overseas |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/index.php/article/2005/04/ucla-name-la-lifestyle-marketa |work=The Daily Bruin |publisher=UCLA |date=2005-04-05 |accessdate=2005-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA makes $400,000 in royalties every year through its international licensing program.&lt;ref name=&quot;stores&quot; /&gt;

The school's sports teams are called the [[UCLA Bruins|Bruins]], with colors [[True Blue (color)|True Blue]] and gold. The Bruins participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] as part of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]]. Two notable sports facilities serve as home venues for UCLA sports. The Bruin men's [[American football|football]] team plays home games at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]]; the team won a national title in 1954. The men's and women's [[basketball]] and men's and women's [[volleyball]] teams, and the [[gymnastics]] team (women's) play at [[Pauley Pavilion]] on campus. The school also sponsors men's and women's [[Cross country running|cross country]], men's and women's [[soccer]], women's [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], men's and women's [[golf]], men's and women's [[tennis]], and men's and women's [[water polo]], and women's [[softball]].

The Bruin mascots are Joe and Josephine Bruin, and the [[fight songs]] are ''[[Sons of Westwood]]'' and ''[[Mighty Bruins]]''. The alma mater is ''[[Hail to the Hills of Westwood]]''.

When [[Henry Russell Sanders|Henry &quot;Red&quot; Sanders]] came to UCLA to coach [[American football|football]] in 1949, the uniforms were redesigned. Sanders added a gold loop on the shouldersâthe UCLA Stripe. The navy blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He dubbed the baby blue uniform &quot;Powder Keg Blue,&quot; a powder blue with an explosive kick. This would also differentiate UCLA from its older brother, [[UC Berkeley]] (and all other UC teams, as all UC campuses' official colors are blue and gold).
UCLA is competitive in all major Division I-A sports and has won 124 national championships, including 107 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] championships, more than any other university.UCLA's softball program is outstanding&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/genrel/ucla-100-champs.html |title=Bruins lead the nation with 106 NCAA team championships and 124 total national championships |accessdate=2008-05-31 |year=2008 |work=UCLA Bruins }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's Softball won the 106th National Championship, on June 8, 2010. Among these championships, some of the more notable victories are in [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|men's basketball]].

Under legendary coach [[John Wooden]], UCLA men's basketball teams won 10 NCAA championships, including a [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Champions, runners-up and locations|record seven consecutive]], in 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1975, and an 11th was added under then-coach Jim Harrick in 1995 (through 2008, the most consecutive by any other team is [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Champions, runners-up and locations|two]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA&quot; /&gt; From 1971 to 1974, UCLA men's basketball won an unprecedented 88 consecutive games.
UCLA has also shown dominance in [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship|men's volleyball]], with 19 national championships. All 19 teams were led by current coach [[Al Scates]], which ties him with [[John McDonnell (coach)|John McDonnell]] of the [[University of Arkansas]] as NCAA leader for national championships in a single sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA&quot; /&gt;

UCLA has medaled in every [[Olympic Games]] they have participated in. In the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens games]], UCLA sent 56 athletes, more than any other university, who won 19 medals.

Former UCLA [[basketball]] player and current [[Utah Jazz]] player [[Earl Watson]] commented, &quot;Eleven national championships, the best coach (Wooden) to coach the game says a lot. I take offense to those who act like UCLA is just another school compared with [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]]. Duke is a great school in the east, but UCLA is worldwide.&quot;

===USC rivalry===
{{Main|UCLA-USC rivalry}}

UCLA shares a traditional sports rivalry with the nearby [[University of Southern California]]. In football, UCLA has one national champion team and 16 conference titles, compared to USC's 11 national championships and 37 conference championships. Under [[John Wooden]], UCLA became a dominating power in men's basketball, and has won 11 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA championships]], against USC's none.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/genrel/ucla-100-champs.html |title=National Championships |accessdate=2007-05-22 |year=2007 |work=UCLA Bruins }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schools share a rivalry in many other sports. In volleyball, UCLA won 19 [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship]]s against USC's four.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA&quot; /&gt; UCLA also dominates the all-time series vs. USC in men's volleyball (86â34).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/m-volley/auto_pdf/2010-mg-section2.pdf |title=2010MVBGuide2.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women's volleyball UCLA leads the all-time series against USC as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/w-volley/auto_pdf/2007-mg-section-04.pdf|title=2007 UCLA WOMENâS VOLLEYBALL MEDIA GUIDE - THE PACIFIC-10 CONFERENCE - Opponents |page=51 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the popular sport of soccer UCLA leads USC in the all-time series 13â3â0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ucla/sports/m-soccer/auto_pdf/09-msoccer-mg-opponents.pdf |title=UCLA Record vs. Opponents|page=42 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lexus Gauntlet]] is the name given to the official competition between the two schools in 18 varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexusgauntlet.collegesports.com/index-south.html |title=Lexus Gauntlet | work=CollegeSports |accessdate=2007-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rivalry even extends to the [[Olympic Games]], where UCLA athletes have won 213 medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uclabruins.cstv.com/ot/olympic-medalists.html |title=UCLA's Olympic Medal Winners |accessdate=2007-05-22 |year=2004 |work=UCLA Bruins }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/usc/genrel/auto_pdf/uscolympians.pdf |title=USC OLYMPIANS: 1904â2004 |accessdate=2007-05-22 |year=2004 |work=Fans Only (CSTV) |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin is unclear, but the rivalry most likely started when football [[List of College Football Hall of Fame inductees (coaches)|Hall of Fame coach]] Red Sanders led UCLA to dominance in the 1950s. USC, long before established as the reigning power, diverted its attention from then-rival [[University of Notre Dame]], and the rivalry began.

Presently, [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]] has the most NCAA championships, winning a combined 107 team championships in men's and women's sports, with Stanford coming in second with 101, followed by USC with 92.&lt;ref&gt;http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/combined.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[Image:View of West Los Angeles to Downtown from Getty Center.jpg|thumb|View of [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|West Los Angeles]] from the [[Getty Center]]. [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] and UCLA are in the middle ground.]]
Students have access to a variety of activities when not attending class. The campus' location in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] makes excursions to local museums, theaters, or other entertainment venues relatively quick and easy. UCLA offers classical [[orchestra]]s, [[intramural sports]], and over 800 student organizations. UCLA is also home to more than 60 national and local Greek-letter organizations, which collectively constitute the largest membership-based and multi-faceted community on campus. Fraternity and sorority members represent 13% of the student population. [[Phrateres]], a non-exclusive club for women was founded here in 1924 by the Dean of Women, Helen Matthewson Laughlin. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in schools across North America. The student government at UCLA is the Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA), governed by a student majority board of directors. It is the umbrella organization that includes the two branches of UCLA's student government, the Graduate Students Association (GSA) and the Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC), the UCLA Store, the Student Union, Restaurants, Trademark &amp; Licensing, and Student Media (including the ''UCLA Daily Bruin''). The Student Alumni Association (SAA), a branch under the UCLA Alumni Association but entirely student run, is responsible for maintaining and putting on UCLA's oldest and greatest traditions, such as Blue and Gold Week, Senior Send-off, [[UCLA Spring Sing|Spring Sing]], and Dinners for 12 Strangers amongst many. UCLA also operates a waterfront facility known as the [http://marinaaquaticcenter.org/index.htm UCLA Marina Aquatic Center] in [[Marina del Rey]]. Students and staff participate in dinghy sailing, surfing, windsurfing, rowing, and kayaking.

The UCLA community was shocked in 2009 when a student was stabbed multiple times, including in the neck, during a chemistry lab class.  Lab classes were canceled the next day and counselors were available for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/10/ucla.stabbing/index.html |title=Police recover knife after UCLA stabbing |publisher=CNN.com |date=2009-10-10 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=5:59 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33236949/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Aides rushed to help UCLA stabbing victim - Crime &amp; courts- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLA has an active a cappella student population, with a variety of student organizations across campus.  The university is often regarded as the pioneer in the West Coast collegiate contemporary a cappella tradition with its first group, [[Awaken A Cappella]], founded in 1992.  The all-male group on campus, Bruin Harmony, has enjoyed a successful career since its inception in 2006, portraying a collegiate a cappella group in the 2010 film, [[The Social Network]].  Other groups on campus include The Scattertones, Signature, Random Voices, Medleys, Deviant Voices, and Cadenza.

===Traditions===
The university has many traditions and annual events involving students, community, or the city. The school hosts events that usually require participation from more than just the student body, and competitions can occasionally involve celebrity judges and performers.

Unicamp, founded in 1934, is UCLA's official charity. It is a week-long summer camp for under-served children from the [[greater Los Angeles area]], with UCLA volunteer counselors. Because Unicamp is a non-profit organization, student volunteers from UCLA also fundraise money throughout the year to allow these children to attend summer camp.&lt;ref&gt;UCLA UniCamp www.unicamp.org&lt;/ref&gt;

To introduce new students to clubs and activities, UCLA begins the fall quarter with Welcome Week activities (renamed True Bruin Welcome in 2009). The week includes the newly-added Day of Service for all first-years, the Enormous Activities Fair, the Sports Fair, and other events. At the end of move-in and the beginning of Welcome Week, UCLA holds Bruin Bash. Hosted by the USAC Campus Events Commission and USAC Cultural Affairs Commission, Bruin Bash includes a concert, dance, and movie. Past performers include [[Thrice]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] in 2005, [[Xzibit]] and [[Rooney]] in 2006, [[T.I.]] in 2007, [[The Cool Kids]], [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], [[Hellogoodbye]] in 2008, [[LMFAO (group)|LMFAO]] and [[Clipse]] in 2009, [[Ying Yang Twins]], [[Travis McCoy]] and [[The Cataracs]] in 2010. Bruin Bash was created as a replacement for Black Sunday, a large-scale day of partying including all fraternities, in North Westwood Village, where the majority of off-campus students reside adjacent to campus.

Dance Marathon is an annual event put on by the student group, the Pediatric AIDS Coalition, held in Ackerman Grand Ballroom at UCLA, where thousands of students raise money and dance to support the [[Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation]], Project Kindle, and One Heartland. Dancers are required to fundraise a minimum amount of $208 before the event, which is a 26 hour [[dance marathon]]. Dancers are not allowed to sit (except to use the restroom) during the marathon. In 2010, Dance Marathon of UCLA raised a record-breaking $407,000. Since 2002, the Marathon has raised over $2,100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bruindancemarathon.org/about-newsite.html |title=What's DM? |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Bruin Dance Marathon |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070525182557/http://bruindancemarathon.org/about-newsite.html |archivedate = May 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLA students also participate in &quot;Midnight Yell&quot; during finals week, a tradition where every night at midnight (starting on Sunday of finals week), students go outside and yell as loudly as possible for one minute, giving everyone a chance to take a short break from studying and release some nervous energy. Students who live in on-campus housing are not allowed to participate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Image:Bruin Theatre, Westwood, Los Angeles, CA , at night.jpg|thumb|Bruin Theater, [[Westwood Village]]]]
The quarterly [[Underwear run|Undie Run]] takes place during the Wednesday evening of Finals Week, when students run through the campus in their underwear or in skimpy costumes. The run first began in Fall of 2001 when a student, Eric Whitehead, wearing what he described as &quot;really short shorts&quot; walked around singing a song and playing a guitar to protest the Police restrictions on the Midnight Yell.&lt;ref name=&quot;tradition&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/6/13/undie-run-tradition-faces-grow/ |title=Undie Run tradition faces growing pains |accessdate=2007-06-13 |author=Staines, Xandi |date=2005-06-13 |work=The Daily Bruin }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the increasing safety hazards and Police and Administration involvement, a student committee, in order to satisfy concerns but keep the event, changed the route. It was changed to a run through campus to the fountain in front of Powell Library. Now it ends with students cavorting in the fountains outside Powell Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;undie&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2005/12/12/undie-run-safety-at-issue/ |title=Undie Run safety at issue |accessdate=2007-05-21 |author=Rushovich, Colin |date=2005-12-12 |work=The Daily Bruin }}&lt;/ref&gt; As attendance increased, committees in charge of organizing the event deemed it necessary to employ the [[University of California Police Department|UC Police]] during the event, to ward off vandalism and dangerous activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;undie&quot; /&gt; In 2007, the route was changed again to begin at Strathmore and Gayley Avenues instead of Landfair and Gayley Avenues. Tired of the UCLA administration meddling in student-initiated spontaneous traditions, students have begun celebrating finals week in new ways. One way is the &quot;Undie Ride,&quot; where students run a predetermined route in their underwear on Tuesday night of finals week. In the summer of 2009, the administration canceled all future undie run events, citing safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kivowitz |first=Elizabeth |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-ends-student-undie-run-due-97231.aspx |title=UCLA ends student Undie Run due to safety concerns / UCLA Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.ucla.edu |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Undie Run concept has since spread to other college campuses around the United States, including the [[University of Texas at Austin]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Syracuse University]].)

[[Image:John Wooden Center.jpg|thumb|John Wooden Recreation Center on the campus of UCLA.]]
The Alumni Association sponsors several events, usually large extravaganzas involving huge amounts of coordination. An example of this is the 60-year old [[UCLA Spring Sing|Spring Sing]], organized by the Student Alumni Association (SAA). Spring Sing is UCLA's oldest traditionâit is an annual gala of student talent, which is held at the Los Angeles Tennis Center on campus. In 2009 the event was held in UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.  The committee bestows the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award each year to a major contributor to the music industry. Past recipients have included [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[James Taylor]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Quincy Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uclalumni.net/CalendarEvents/springsing/Gershwin/winners.cfm |title=Gershwin Award Winners |accessdate=2007-05-21 |year=2007 |work=Alumni Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lionel Richie]], and in 2009, [[Julie Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/electronicplay.aspx?fid=24831&amp;id=E0C5478 |title=Lional Richie accepts the Gershwin Award |publisher=Newsroom.ucla.edu |date=2008-05-02 |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dinner for 12 Strangers, a common tradition among universities, is a gathering of students, alumni, administration and faculty to network around different interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/040121voices_mind.html |title=Dinner with 12 strangers is a feast for friends |accessdate=2007-05-21 |author=Valentine, Jane |date=2004-01-21 |work=UCLA Today |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060901103028/http://www.today.ucla.edu/2004/040121voices_mind.html |archivedate = September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week before the USC rivalry football game, there is a &quot;Beat 'SC Bonfire and Rally.&quot; The bonfire did not take place in 2006 due to fire hazard issues. Nonetheless, UCLA won the football game, upsetting the #2 ranked Trojans. This led many to believe that dispelling of the tradition led to the victory.

The USAC Cultural Affairs Commission hosts the [[JazzReggae Festival @ UCLA|Jazz Reggae Festival]], a two-day concert on [[Memorial Day]] weekend that attracts more than 20,000 attendees.  The JazzReggae Festival is the largest, entirely student produced and run event of its kind on the West Coast. A staff of 30 UCLA undergraduates consistently proves that todayâs youth can create something as distinguished and professional as JazzReggae Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jazzreggaefest.com/pages/about/ |title=JazzReggae Fest 2011 |publisher=Jazzreggaefest.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student government===
[[Image:Kerk.jpg|thumb|Kerckhoff Hall houses the offices of student government and the ''[[Daily Bruin]]''.]]
The Associated Students UCLA (ASUCLA) is the official entity encompassing student government and student-led enterprises at UCLA. ASUCLA has four major components: the Undergraduate Students Association, the Graduate Students Association, Student Media, and services &amp; enterprises. However, in common practice, the term ASUCLA is often more narrowly used to refer to the services and enterprises component. This includes the Student Store, Bookstore, Food Services, Student Union, etc. These commercial enterprises serving the UCLA campus community generate approximately $90,000,000 in annual revenues, making it financially the largest student government operation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.guidestar.org/ReportNonProfit.aspx?ein=95-1777979&amp;name=associated-students-ucla# |title=ASSOCIATED STUDENTS UCLA [95-1777979&amp;#93; GuideStar Report |publisher=.guidestar.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonprofit corporation, the financial goal of ASUCLA is not to maximize return or &quot;profit&quot; but to provide quality services and programs to the campus community at reasonable prices. ASUCLA is governed by a student-majority Board of Directors. The Undergraduate Students Association and Graduate Students Association each appoint three members plus one alternate. In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The &quot;services and enterprises&quot; portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 professional career staff and 2,000 student employees. The board meets monthly and is responsible for setting the priority goals for the year, providing direction to the executive director, and evaluating his or her annual performance.

The Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 11,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;USAC&quot; is an acronym for Undergraduate Students Association Council, the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://students.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=Students.asucla.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The student body currently has two major political slates, Students First! (established in 1981) and Bruins United (established in 2006). 

USAC's thirteen student officers and commissioners are elected by members of the Undergraduate Students Association at an annual election held during Spring Quarter. In addition to its thirteen elected members, USAC includes appointed representatives of the Administration, the Alumni, and the Faculty, as well as two ex-officio members, the ASUCLA Executive Director and a student Finance Committee Chairperson who is appointed by the USA President and approved by USAC. All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the thirteen elected student members have a vote.

The thirteen elected positions include: USAC President, Internal Vice President, External Vice President, General Representative (3), Academic Affairs Commissioner, Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Facilities Commissioner, Campus Events Commissioner, Student Welfare Commissioner, Community Service Commissioner, and Financial Supports Commissioner. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usac.ucla.edu  | title=usac.ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USAC President appoints more than seventy undergraduates to administrative committees and the Academic Affairs Commissioner Appoints approximately 25 undergraduates to Academic Senate Committees. Students have an opportunity to serve on the ASUCLA Board of Directors and the Communications Board, as well as on other significant committees. Through their participation on these campus-wide committees, UCLA undergraduates have had input into the decision making process at a high level.

USAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities and provide an opportunity for students to participate in. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the Campus Events Commission, including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers. Two to three thousand UCLA undergraduates participate annually in the more than twenty voluntary outreach programs run by the Community Service Commission. A large corps of undergraduate volunteers also participate in programs run by the Student Welfare Commission, such as AIDS Awareness, Substance Abuse Awareness, Blood Drives and CPR/First Aid Training.

Student Media UCLA is the home of UCLA's student-run media, including the campus newspaper, magazines, and radio and television stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentmedia.ucla.edu/mediacenter/section.asp ]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media publications===
Most student media publications distributed on-campus are governed by the ASUCLA Communications Board. The ''[[Daily Bruin]]'' is UCLA's most prominent student publication. Founded in 1919 under the name ''Cub Californian'', it has since then developed into [[Los Angeles]]' third-most circulated newspaper.

Most undergraduate students are housed in 14 complexes on the western side of campus, referred to by students as &quot;The Hill.&quot; Students can live in halls, plazas, suites, or university apartments, which vary in pricing and privacy. Housing plans also offer students access to dining facilities, which have been ranked by the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' as some of the best in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princetonreview.com/schoollist.aspx?type=r&amp;id=683&amp;RDN=1 |title=The Best 371 Colleges: Quality of Life â Campus Food |accessdate=2010-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dining halls are located in De Neve, Rieber, Covel, and Hedrick Halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;din&quot;&gt;http://www.dining.ucla.edu/housing_site/dining/ResidentialRestaurantsMap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Residential cafes include Bruin Cafe, Rendezvous, and Cafe 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;din&quot;/&gt; Cafe 1919's location formerly housed a cafe known as Puzzles.&lt;ref name=&quot;din&quot;/&gt; UCLA currently offers three years guaranteed housing to its incoming freshman, and one year to incoming transfer students.
