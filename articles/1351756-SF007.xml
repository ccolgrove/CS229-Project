'''Avast!''' is an [[antivirus]] [[computer program]] developed by '''AVAST Software a.s.''' (formerly known as '''ALWIL Software a.s.'''), a company based in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. It was first released in [[1988]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avast.com/en-eu/history|title=Avast! history and origins|accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although back then it was just a tool to remove the Vienna malware. In 1995 Ondrej VlÄek wrote the first anti-virus software for Windows 95 while he was still busy finishing his university studies.

Avast! is based on a central scanning engine that is certified by ICSA Labs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icsalabs.org/icsa/product.php?tid=dfgdf$gdhkkjk-kkkk|title=ICSA Labs Certification|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and West Coast Lab's Checkmark process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoastlabs.com/checkmark/productList/index.cfm?advanced=false&amp;searchString=avast|title=West Coast Labs Checkmark&amp;nbsp;â Antivirus Certification|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates anti-[[spyware]] technology, also certified by West Coast Lab's Checkmark process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westcoastlabs.com/checkmark/productList/index.cfm?advanced=false&amp;searchString=avast|title=West Coast Labs Checkmark&amp;nbsp;â Anti-spyware Certification|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anti-[[rootkit]] and self-protection capabilities. It is a multiple recipient of the ''[[Virus Bulletin]]'' VB100 Award for its detection of 100% of &quot;in-the-wild&quot; viruses,&lt;ref name=&quot;footnote4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/index|title=Virus Bulletin VB100 Awards|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a past winner of the Secure Computing Readers' Trust Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;footnote5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineus.com/2006-Awards/section/132|title=Secure Computing Readers Trust Awards|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Avast'' is derived from &quot;'''A'''nti-'''V'''irus â '''A'''dvanced '''S'''e'''t'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avast.com/pr-avast-software-is-the-new-company-name|title=Avast Software is the new company name|accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its trademarked name is styled in all lower-case and includes an exclamation mark, and a slogan 'be free'.

Avast! Free Antivirus is the [[freeware]] version of the Avast! antivirus software available to [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] users, while Avast!
