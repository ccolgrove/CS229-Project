'''Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records''' encompasses the key events in the history of technology in [[Russia]], starting from the [[Early East Slavs]] and up to the modern [[Russian Federation]].

The entries in this timeline are mass products, technologies and single objects, mostly falling into the two categories:
*Indigenous inventions, either having worldwide importance (like [[arc welding]], [[assault rifle]], [[satellite]]) or more local significance (like [[onion dome]], [[khokhloma]], [[ushanka]]);
*Products and objects with unique superlative characteristics and records associated with them (like ''[[Tsar Cannon]]'', ''[[AK-47]]'', ''[[Arktika class icebreaker]]'').

This timeline includes products and technologies introduced by any citizens and peoples of Russia and her predecessor states, regardless of ethnicity, and including inventions of naturalized immigrant citizens.

Certain innovations, achieved by a multinational cooperation, also may be included into this timeline, in case Russian side played a major role in such projects. The inventions made abroad by Russian [[Ã©migrÃ©s]] are not reflected here, but may be found on the [[list of Russian inventors]].

For the plain list of Russian inventions, see the [[:Category:Russian inventions]].

'''[[Baked milk]] / [[Ryazhenka]]'''
*'''Baked milk''' is made by [[simmering]] milk on low heat for eight hours or longer. The product has a light brown color, a specific taste and the ability to be stored safely at room temperature for up to forty hours, much longer than most other milk beverages. It has been produced since the ancient times, typically using a [[Russian oven]], and  nowadays it is produced on an industrial scale. Of especial popularity in Russia is soured or fermented baked milk, traditionally known as '''ryazhenka'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Randall Mack, Asele Surina. ''Food Culture In Russia And Central Asia''.

'''[[Banya (sauna)|Banya]]'''
*'''Banya''' is a traditional Russian wet [[steam bath]], where the bathing is performed inside special rooms or standalone wooden houses, with steam being produced by splashing water upon heated rocks. Historically, banya developed simultaneously with its closest relative, the [[Finnish sauna]], however modern saunas converted to dry steam, while banyas continue to use wet steam. Banya temperatures may exceed 110Â°C, and people often hit themselves or others with bunches of dried branches and leaves from [[white birch]], [[oak]] or [[eucalyptus]] in order to improve the [[circulation (physiology)|circulation]]. It is customary to cool off in the breeze outdoors or splash around in cold water or in a lake or river. In the winter, people may roll in the snow or jump into the ice holes. After two or three sessions of sweat and cooling off, the ritual ends with drinking beverages or tea, playing games or relaxing in good company in an antechamber to the steam room. Banya provides a strong positive effect on health, reliefs a number of diseases and strengthens the [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;Aaland, Mikkel (1998).

[[File:Blin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cooking of Russian [[blini]].]]
'''[[Blini]]'''
*'''Blini''' are thin [[pancake]]s made with [[yeast]]. ''Blin'' comes from [[Slavic languages|Old Slavic]] ''mlin'', that means &quot;to mill&quot;. Russian blini are made with yeasted [[Batter (cooking)|batter]], which is left to rise and then diluted with cold or boiling water or [[milk]]. Blini may have originated in the time of the Slavic unity, and they had a somewhat ritual significance for the early Slavs in pre-[[Christian]] times, since they were a symbol of the [[sun]] due to their round form. Blini were traditionally prepared at the end of the winter to honor the rebirth of the new sun (Butter Week, or [[Maslenitsa]]). This tradition was adopted by [[Orthodox church]] and is carried on to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sras.org/maslenitsa_blin Maslenitsa, Blin!] Article about and recipe for bliny and description of a related holiday.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Gusli]]'''
*'''Gusli''' is the oldest Slavic and Russian multi-string plucked instrument. Preserved instruments discovered by archaeologists have between 5 and 9 strings with one example having 12 strings. Gusli may have derived from a [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] form of the [[Cithara|Greek kythare]] and have a number of relative instruments, like Finnish [[kantele]]. The first mention of gusli dates back to 591AD to a treatise by the [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Theophylact Simocatta]] which describes the instrument being used by [[Slavs]] from the area of the later [[Kievan Rus']]. The gusli are thought to have been the instrument used by the legendary [[Boyan (bard)|Boyan]] (a singer of tales) and other heroes of [[Russian mythology]]. In the later times gusli were widely used by the wandering [[Skomorokh]] musicians and entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://altay-bulgaria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=171%3A2008-11-16-16-54-54&amp;catid=68%3Amusic&amp;Itemid=1 The history of gusli.] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russia-Suzdal-MWAPL-House of Poor Peasant-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A typical Russian [[izba]].]]
'''[[Izba]]'''
*An '''izba''' is a traditional Russian countryside dwelling, a type of [[log house]], suited to the colder climate of North-Eastern Europe and Siberia. Traditional, old-style izba construction involved the use of simple tools, such as ropes, axes, knives, and spades. Nails were not generally used, as metal was relatively expensive, and neither were saws a common construction tool. Both interior and exterior were of split tree trunks, the gap between was usually filled with river clay. From the 15th century on, the central element of the interior of izba was [[Russian oven]]. Outside izbas were often embellished by various special architectural features, for example the rich wood carving decorations on windows. Such decorative elements and the use of the Russian oven are still commonly found in many modern Russian countryside houses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangelove.net/~kieser/Russia/villagestructures.html Traditional Russian Village Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kosovorotkamuzh.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Men's [[kosovorotka]].]]
'''[[Kosovorotka]]'''
*A '''kosovorotka''' is a  [[Russia]]n skewed-collared [[shirt]], long sleeved and reaching down to the mid-thigh, a traditional top garment from the ancient times. The name derived from ''koso'' (askew), and ''vorot'' (collar), since the collar of this shirt appears skewed when it is left unbuttoned. The collar and sleeves of kosovorotka were often decorated with a traditional Slavic ornament. It was worn by peasants and townsmen of various social categories into the early 20th century, until being displaced by less elaborate clothing. The garment is also known as a ''tolstovka'', or the Tolstoy-shirt, because the writer Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] customarily wore one in his later years. Now kosovorotkas appear mostly as souvenirs and as scenic garments of Russian [[folk art]] ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linorusso.ru/catalog.php?parent_id=12 Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ðµ ÑÑÐ±Ð°ÑÐ¸ / Russian shirts] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lapti.png|thumb|right|160px|[[Lapti]].]]
'''[[Lapti]]'''
*'''Lapti''' is an East Slavic variant of [[bast shoes]]. A kind of baskets fit to the shape of a foot, lapti were woven primarily from [[bast (biology)|bast]] of the [[Tilia|linden]] tree  or from [[birch]] [[bark]]. They were easy to manufacture, but not very durable. In Russia, lapti were worn until 1920s, or 1930s, as a cheap replacement for leather shoes, just like [[Clog (shoe)|clog]]s in the [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://slavyans.narod.ru/dress/lapti.html Lapti] at the ''Slavyanskaya Sloboda'' Slavic ethnography site {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Shchi]]'''
*'''Shchi''' is a Russian [[soup]] with [[cabbage]] as the primary ingredient, which makes it possible for the prepared dish to be stored safely for rather a long time without losing its taste qualities. Generally it is made with either fresh cabbage or [[sauerkraut]] and other winter vegetables, although [[meat]] can be added. Shchi made with sauerkraut has a [[sour]] taste and is called '''sour shchi'''. A summer [[sorrel soup]], also popular in pre-[[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolutionary]] and today's Russia, is known as '''green shchi'''. Usually [[smetana cream]] is added into shchi before serving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedem.ru/voyaj/cuisine/shi/ Soup in the Russian cuisine. Shchi] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]]'''
*'''Smetana''' is thick, yellowish-white and slightly sour-tasting cream which contains about 40 % milk fat. It is made by curdling pasteurized cream. In Russian cooking, it is used virtually in everything from appetizers and main courses to desserts. It is somewhat close to a [[crÃ¨me fraÃ®che]] (28%), but much heavier and thicker with usually 36% to 42 % milkfat or even higher, and more sour in taste. Smetana is ideal to be used in dishes requiring a long cooking time in the oven, since it will not curdle when cooked or added to hot dishes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlc.fi/~marianna/gourmet/i_milk.htm Nordic Recipe Archive - Cooking ingredients - Milk products]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great duchess kokoshnik.jpg|thumb|160px|A Russian girl wearing [[kokoshnik]] and [[sarafan]].]]
'''[[Kokoshnik]]'''
*The '''kokoshnik''' is a traditional Russian women's head-dress. It is patterned to match the style of the [[sarafan]] and can be pointed or round. It is tied at the back of the head with long thick ribbons in a large bow. The forehead is sometimes decorated with pearls or other jewelry. The word ''kokoshnik'' appeared in the 16th century, however the earliest head dress pieces of the similar type were found in the 10th-12th cc. burials in [[Veliky Novgorod]]. It was worn by girls and women on special occasions until the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], and   subsequently was introduced into the Western [[fashion]] by Russian [[Ã©migrÃ©]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larussie.narod.ru/odezhda/od06_01.htm Primeval Rus': Women's head dress and jewellery] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''989 [[Kvass]] / [[Okroshka]]'''
*'''Kvass''' or '''kvas''', sometimes called in English a '''bread drink''', is a [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] beverage made from black [[rye]] or rye [[bread]] (which contributes to its light or dark colour). By the content of [[alcohol]] resulted from fermentation, it is classified as non-alcoholic: up to 1.2% of alcohol, which is so low that it is considered acceptable for consumption by children. While the early low-alcoholic prototypes of kvass were known in some ancient civilizations, its modern, almost non-alcoholic form originated in the [[Eastern Europe]]. Kvass was first mentioned in the Russian [[Primary Chronicle]], which tells how Prince [[Vladimir the Great]] gave kvass to the people among other beverages, while celebrating the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']]. Kvass is also known as a main ingredient in '''[[okroshka]]''', a Russian cold soup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvas.ru/history.htm The history of kvas] at kvas.ru site {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;primarychronicle&quot;&gt;[http://www.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=4869 Primary Cronicle] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''989 [[Dome#Russian domes|Multidomed church]]'''
*The '''multidomed church''' is a typical form of Russian church architecture, which distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches, built just after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']], were multi-domed, which led some historians to speculate how Russian pre-Christian pagan temples might have looked like. Namely, these early churches were 13-domed wooden [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (989) and 25-domed stone [[Desyatinnaya Church]] in [[Kiev]] (989-996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in the [[Russian architecture]], for example 13 domes symbolize [[Christ]] with 12 [[Apostles]], while 25 domes mean the same with additional 12 Prophets of [[Old Testament]]. Multiple domes of Russian churches were often made of wood and were comparatively smaller than the [[Byzantine]] domes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangelove.net/~kieser/Russia/churches.html Russian Church Design] by Lisa Kies.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypalace.org/europe/slavic/east_slavic/russia/articles/domes.shtml About Russian Domes and Cupolas] at Sky Palace world architecture site.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''997 [[Kissel]]'''
*'''Kissel''' or '''kisel''' is a dessert that consists of sweetened juice, typically that of berries, thickened with [[arrowroot]], [[cornstarch]] or [[potato starch]], with [[red wine]] or [[dried fruit]]s added sometimes. The dessert can be served either hot or cold, and if made using less thickening starch it can be drunk, which is common in Russia. Kissel was mentioned for the first time in the [[Primary Chronicle]], where it forms part of the story of how a bisieged Russian city was saved from nomadic [[Pechenegs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;primarychronicle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://supercook.ru/zz265-02.html Kissels] at supercook.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Birch bark document]]'''
*A '''birch bark document''' is a document written on pieces of [[birch bark]]. This form of writing material was developed independently by several ancient cultures. In Rus' the usage of the specially prepared birch bark as a cheap replacement for [[pergament]] or [[paper]] became widespread  soon after the [[Christianization of Rus'|Christianization]] of the country. The earliest Russian birch bark documents (likely written in the first quarter of the 11th century) have been found in [[Veliky Novgorod]]. In the total, more than 1000 such documents have been discovered, most of them in Novgorod and the rest in other ancient cities in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. Many birch bark documents were written by quite common people, not only by clergy or nobility. This fact led some historians to suggest that before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']] the level of [[literacy]] in the country might have been considerably higher than in [[Western Europe]] of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gramoty.ru/ Online library of 956 Russian birch bark documents and modern translations] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Koch (boat)|Koch]]''' / '''[[Icebreaker]]'''
[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|180px|thumb|right|A 17th century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]]]
*The '''koch''' was an ancient form of [[icebreaker]], being a special type of small one or two mast wooden [[sailing ship]]s, used for voyages in the ice conditions of the [[Arctic]] seas and [[Siberia]]n rivers. Koch was developed by the [[Russia]]n [[Pomors]] since the 11th century, when they started settling on the [[White Sea]] shores. Koch's hull was protected by a belt of ice-floe resistant flush skin-planking (made of [[oak]] or [[larch]]) along the variable water-line, and had a false keel for on-ice [[portage]]. If a koch became squeezed by the ice-fields, its rounded bodylines below the water-line would allow for the ship to be pushed up out of the water and onto the ice with no damage. In the 19th century similar protective features were adopted to modern [[icebreaker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ris.npolar.no/documents/Seminars/Lyr/Marchenko_N.pdf Navigation in ice conditions.

[[File:Russ instr gudok.gif|thumb|left|200px|Ancient Russian [[Gudok]].]]
'''[[Gudok]]'''
*The '''gudok''' is  an ancient [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] [[string instruments|string]] [[musical instrument]], played with a [[bow (music)|bow]]. It usually had three strings, two of them tuned in [[unison]] and played as a drone, the third tuned a [[perfect fifth|fifth]] higher. All three strings were in the same plane at the bridge, so that a bow could make them all sound simultaneously. Sometimes the gudok also had several [[sympathetic strings]] (up to eight) under the [[sounding board]]. These made the gudok's sound warm and rich. It was also possible to play the gudok while standing or dancing, which made it popular among [[skomorokh]]s. The name ''gudok'' comes from the 17th century, however the same type of instrument existed from 11th to 16th century, but was called ''smyk''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soros.novgorod.ru/projects/Toolkit/rmi/4.htm String instruments] at the site ''Russian musical instruments''. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Medovukha]]'''
*'''Medovukha''' is an Old Slavic [[honey]]-based alcoholic beverage very similar to [[mead]], but much cheaper and faster in making. Since the old times Slavs exported the [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] mead as a luxury product to Europe in huge quantities. Fermentation occurs naturally over 15 to 50 years, originally rendering the product very expensive and only accessible to the [[nobility]]. However, in the 11th century East Slavs found that fermentation occurred much faster when the honey mixture was heated, enabling medovukha to become a folk drink in the territory of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']]. In the 14th century, the invention of [[distillation]] made it possible to create a prototype of the modern medovukha, however [[vodka]] was invented at the same time and gradually surpassed medovukha in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kedem.ru/enoteka/200090619-medovuha/ Medovukha] at the site Culinary Edem {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Russian fist fighting''' is an ancient [[Russians|Russian]] [[combat sport]], basically similar to modern [[boxing]], but featuring some indigenous techniques and often fought in collective events called ''Stenka na Stenku'' (&quot;Wall against Wall&quot;). It has existed since the times of [[Kievan Rus']], first mentioned in the [[Primary Chronicle]] under year 1048. The government and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] often tried to prohibit the fights, however the fist fighting remained popular until the 19th century, while in the 20th century some of the old techniques were adopted for the modern [[Russian martial arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;primarychronicle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rustrana.ru/article.php?nid=3006 Russian fist fighting] at the site Russian Civilization {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pernath and Shestopiors DRG.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Pernach]] (left) and two [[shestopyor]]s.]]
'''[[Pernach]]'''
*The '''pernach''' was a type [[flanged mace]] developed since the 12th century in the region of [[Kievan Rus']] and later widely used throughout [[Europe]]. The name comes from the Russian word ''Ð¿ÐµÑÐ¾'' (''pero'') meaning [[feather]], reflecting the form of pernach that resembled an [[arrow]] with [[Fletching|feathering]]. The most popular variety of pernach had six [[flange]]s and was called ''shestopyor'' (from Russian ''shest' '' and ''pero'', that is ''six-feathered''). Pernach was the first form of the flanged mace to found wide usage. It was perfectly suited to destroy the [[plate armour]] and [[plate mail]]. In the later times it was often used as a symbol of power by the military leaders in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://otlichnik.tripod.com/medmace3.html Medieval flanged maces] by Shawn M.

'''[[Shashka]]'''
*The '''shashka''' is a special kind of [[sabre]], a very sharp, single-edged, single-handed, and [[Hilt|guardless]] [[sword]]. In appearance, the shashka is midway between a full sabre and a straight sword. It has a slightly curved blade, and could be effective for both slashing and thrusting. Originally shashka was developed in the 12th century by [[Circassians]] in the [[Northern Caucasus]], whose lands were integrated into the [[Russian Empire]] in the 18th century. By that time shashka was adopted as their main cold weapon by Russian [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adigeya.com/History/ItemTree.asp?id=21 The culture and customs of Adygs] at the site www.adigeya.com {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1149 [[Bear spear]]'''
*The '''bear spear''' or '''rogatina''' was a medieval type of [[spear]] used in [[bear hunting]] and also against other large animals, like [[wisent]]s and [[war horse]]s. The sharpened head of a bear spear was enlarged and usually had a form of a [[bay leaf]]. Right under the head there was a short crosspiece that helped fixing the spear in the body of an animal. Often it was placed against the ground on its rear point, which makes it easier to hold the weight of attacking beast. The Russian chronicles first mention rogatina as a military weapon under the year 1149, and as a hunting weapon under the year 1255.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÐ¸ÑÐ¿Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð² Ð.

'''[[Sokha]]'''
*The '''sokha''' is a light wooden [[plough]] which could be pulled by one horse. Its origin was in the north [[Russia]], most likely in the [[Novgorod Republic]], where it was used at least since the 13th century. A characteristic feature of sokha construction is the bifurcated plowing tip (ÑÐ°ÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ°), so that a sokha has two plowshares, later made of metal, which cut the soil. Sokha is an evolution of a [[scratch-plough]] by an addition of a [[spade]]-like detail which turns the cut soil over (in regular ploughs the curved [[mouldboard]] both cuts and turns the soil).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliotekar.ru/rusNovgorod/86.htm The study of the history of ancient ploughs of the Novgorod land] by V.

It is unclear when pelmeni entered the cuisines of [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|indigenous Siberian people]] and when they first appeared in [[Russian cuisine]], but likely it was during the [[Mongol conquests]] and [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol-Tatar invasion of Rus']] in the 13th century, when [[Mongol-Tatars]] took the basic idea from the [[China|Chinese]] [[dumpling]]s and transferred it into [[Siberia]] and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sras.org/pelmeni_history Pelmeni.

*A '''zvonnitsa''' is a large rectangular structure containing multiple [[arch]]s or [[beam (structure)|beam]]s that carry [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, where [[bell ringer]]s stand on its basement level and perform the ringing using long ropes, like playing on a kind of giant [[musical instrument]]. It was an alternative to [[bell tower]] in the medieval architecture of [[Russia]] and some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries. Zvonnitsa appeared in Russia in the 14th century and was widely used until the 17th century. Sometimes it was mounted right atop the [[church (building)|church]] building, resulting in the special type of church called ''pod zvonom'' (&quot;under ringing&quot;) or ''izhe pod kolokoly'' (&quot;under bells&quot;). The most famous example of such kind of a church is the Church of [[John Climacus|St. Ivan of the Ladder]] adjacent to [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oval.ru/enc/27444.html Zvonnitsa] in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hramy.ru/rare/podzvon.htm Churches Under Bells] at the site hramy.ru (Churches of Russia) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1376 [[Sarafan]]'''
*The '''sarafan''' is a long, shapeless [[jumper dress]] of [[pinafore]] type, a part of the traditional [[Russia]]n folk costume by women and girls. Sarafans could be of single piece construction with thin shoulder straps over which a [[corset]] is sometimes worn, giving the shape of the body of a smaller [[triangle]] over a larger one. It comes in different styles such as the simpler black, flower- or check-patterned versions formerly used for everyday wear, or the elaborate brocade versions formerly reserved for special occasions. Chronicles first mention it under the year 1376, and since that time it was worn well until the 20th century. It is now worn as [[folk]] costume for performing Russian folk songs and [[folk dancing]]. Plain sarafans are still designed and worn today as a summer-time light dress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerotranslate.com/russian-culture/what-is-a-traditional-russian-sarafan.html What Is a Traditional Russian Sarafan?] at aerotranslate.com {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linorusso.ru/article.php?parent_id=8 Russian sarafan] at linorusso.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Bardiche]]'''
*The '''bardiche''' was a long poleaxe, that is a type of weapon combining the features of [[axe]] and [[polearm]], known primarily in the [[Eastern Europe]] where it was used instead of [[halberd]]. Occasionally the weapons of such form were made in [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and [[Early Middle Ages]], but the regular and massive usage of bardiches started in the early 15th century Russia. Likely, it was developed from the [[Scandinavia]]n [[broad axe]], but in Scandinavia it appeared only in the late 15th century. In the 16th century bardiche became a weapon associated with [[streltsy]], Russian guardsmen armed with [[firearms]], who used bardiches to rest handguns upon when firing.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÐ¸ÑÐ¿Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð² Ð.

The higher hat indicated the higher status. In average, it was one [[ell]] in height, having the form of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] with more broad upper part, [[velvet]] or  [[brocade]] top and the main body made of [[fox]], [[marten]] or [[sable]] fur.

*The '''gulyay-gorod''' (literally &quot;wandering town&quot;) was a mobile fortification made from large wall-sized prefabricated shields set on [[wagon]]s or [[sled]]s, a development of the [[wagon fort]] concept. The usage of installable shields instead of permanently armoured wagons was cheaper and allowed more possible configurations to be assembled. Such mobile structures were used mostly in the open [[steppe]], where few natural shelters could be found. The wide-scale usage of gulyay-gorod started during the [[Russo-Kazan Wars]], and later it was often used by the [[Ukrainian Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;V.F.Shperk, &quot;The History of Fortification&quot; (Ð.

'''[[Ukha]]'''
*'''Ukha''' is a Russian soup, made with [[broth]] and fish like [[salmon]] or [[cod]], [[root vegetables]], parsley root, [[leek]], [[potato]], bay leaf, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[dill]], green [[parsley]] and spiced with black pepper, cinnamon and cloves. Fishes like [[perch]], [[tench]]es, [[sheatfish]] and [[burbot]]s were used to add flavour to the soup. ''Ukha'' as a name in the [[Russian cuisine]] for fish broth was established only in the late 17th to early 18th centuries. In earlier times this name was first given to thick meat broths, and then later chicken. Beginning from the 15th century, fish was more and more often used to prepare ukha, thus creating a dish that had a distinctive taste among soups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulinarnie-recepty.ru/uha/ Ukha] at kulinarnie-recepty.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Russian oven]]'''
[[File:Belarus-SMFAL-Stove.jpg|thumb|180px|Typical [[Russian oven]] in a peasant [[izba]].]]
*The '''Russian oven''' or '''Russian stove''' is a unique type of [[oven]]/[[furnace]] that first appeared in the early 15th century. The Russian oven is usually placed in the centre of the [[izba]], a traditional Russian dwelling, and plays an immense role in the traditional [[Russian culture]] and way of life. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating and is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed. In winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm. As well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during the [[Great Patriotic War]] some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens. The porridge or the pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in the Russian oven can be called &quot;languor&quot; - holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature. Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian oven include [[baked milk]], [[pearl barley]], [[mushroom]]s cooked in [[Smetana (dairy product)|sour cream]], or even a simple potato.&lt;ref&gt;[http://n-t.ru/nj/nz/1988/0107.htm Russian oven in the 20th century] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pechka.su/ Russian oven] at pechka.su {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c. 1430 [[Vodka#Russia|Russian vodka]]'''
*'''Russian vodka''' is perhaps the world's most famous national brand of [[vodka]], that is a [[distillation|distilled]] [[liquor]], composed solely of [[water]] and [[ethanol]] with possible traces of impurities and flavorings. Vodka is one of the world's most popular liquors. It is made by [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of [[rye]], [[wheat]], [[potato]]es, grapes, or [[sugar beet]] [[molasses]]. Alcoholic content usually ranges between 35 to 50 percent by [[volume]]. The standard Russian vodka is 40 percent alcohol by volume (80 [[alcoholic proof|proof]]). Exact origins of vodka cannot be traced definitively, but almost certainly vodka as a beverage comes from 14th-15th century [[Eastern Europe]]. Russia often is named the birthplace of vodka. The [[distillation apparatus]] was known in [[Moscow]] from the late 14th century and was used to produce [[Distilled beverage|spirit]], the precursor of vodka. According to Russian food historian [[William Pokhlyobkin]], the first original recipe of Russian vodka was produced around 1430 by a monk called [[Isidore (inventor)|Isidore]] from [[Chudov Monastery]] inside the [[Moscow Kremlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pohlebkin_history&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Pokhlebkin|Pokhlebkin V.

'''[[Kokoshnik (architecture)]]'''
*The '''kokoshnik''' is a semicircular or keel-like exterior decorative element in the traditional [[Russian architecture]], a type of [[corbel]] [[blind arch]]. The name was inspired by the [[Kokoshnik|traditional Russian women's head-dress]]. Kokoshniks were used in the Russian church architecture from the 16th century, while in the 17th century their popularity reached its highest point. Kokoshniks were placed on walls, at the basement of [[tented roof]]s or [[tholobate]]s, or over the window frames, or in rows above the [[vault (architecture)|vaults]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article062648.html Kokoshnik (architecture)] in the [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1510s [[Tented roof|Tented roof masonry]]'''
*The '''tented roof masonry''' was a technique widely used in the [[Russian architecture]] in the 16th-17th centuries. Before that time [[tented roof]]s ([[cone (geometry)|conical]], or actually [[polygonal]] roofs) were made of wood and used in the wooden churches. These hipped roofs are thought to have originated in the Russian North, as they prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. Wooden tents also were used to cover [[tower]]s in [[kremlin]]s, or even applied in some common buildings, like it was in the [[Western Europe]], but the thin, pointed, nearly conical roofs of the similar shape made of [[brick]] or [[stone]] became a unique form in the Russian church architecture. Some scholars, however, argue that hipped roofs have something in common with European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[spire]]s, and even tend to call this style 'Russian Gothic'. The Ascension church of [[Kolomenskoye]], built in 1532 to commemorate the birth of the first Russian [[Tsar]] [[Ivan IV]], often is considered the first tented roof church, but the recent studies show that the earliest use of the stone tented roof was in the Trinity Church in [[Alexandrov (town)|Alexandrov]], built in 1510s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''Russian abacus''' or '''schety''' (literally &quot;counts&quot;) is a [[decimal]] type of [[abacus]] that has a single slanted deck in a unique vertical layout, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four beads, for quarter-ruble fractions, that is usually near the user). It was developed in Russia since the late 16th century, at the time when abacus already was falling out of use in the [[Western Europe]]. However, the decimality of the Russian abacus (explained by [[Russian ruble]]'s being the world's first [[decimal currency]]) and its simplicity (compared to the previous European and Asian versions) led to the wide usage of this device in Russia well until the advent of [[electronic calculator]]s in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ergosolo.ru/reviews/history/schety/ Russian Abacus] at ergosolo.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1552 [[Battery-tower]]'''
*The '''battery-tower''' is a late type of [[siege tower]], carrying [[artillery]] inside it, a development of the [[gulyay-gorod]] concept. The first such tower was built by the Russian [[military engineer]] [[Ivan Vyrodkov]] during the [[siege of Kazan]] in 1552 (a part of the [[Russo-Kazan Wars]]), and could hold ten large-calibre cannons and 50 lighter cannons. Later battery-towers were often used by the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Cossacks]].&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Fortresses, 1480â1682'', [[Osprey Publishing]], ISBN 1-84176-916-9&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Saint Basil's Cathedral''' is perhaps the most famous [[Russian Orthodox]] cathedral, a symbol of [[Moscow]] and [[Russia]]. It was designed by [[Postnik Yakovlev]] on the order of [[Ivan IV of Russia]] and built on the Moscow's [[Red Square]] in 1555â1561, to commemorate the [[Siege of Kazan (1552)|capture of Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan]]. The unique feature of the Saint Basil's Cathedral is the fact that it is a complex of multiple temples put together. The original building, known as &quot;Trinity Cathedral&quot;, contained eight side churches covered with [[onion dome]]s and  arranged around the ninth, central [[tented roof]] church of [[Intercession of saints|Intercession]]; the tenth church was erected in 1588 over the grave of venerated local [[Foolishness for Christ|Fool]] [[Basil Fool for Christ|Vasily (Basil)]]. In the 16th and the 17th centuries the cathedral, perceived as the earthly symbol of the [[Heaven#In Orthodox Christianity|Heavenly City]], was popularly known as the &quot;[[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]&quot; and served as an [[allegory]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] in the annual [[Palm Sunday]] parade attended by the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] and the [[Tsar]]. Its striking design, shaped as a flame of a bonfire rising into the sky, has no analogues in the world architecture, and only few times it was attempted to be reproduced in the [[Russian architecture]], most notably in the St. Peter's and Paul Cathedral in [[Petergof]] and in the [[Church of the Savior on Blood]] in [[St. Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Landmarks of Russian Architecture: A Photographic Survey | author=[[William Craft Brumfield|Brumfield, William Craft]] | publisher=Routledge | year=1997 | isbn=978-90-5699-537-9 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TNfoyvTB04sC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Brunov, N.

'''1566 ''[[Great Abatis Line]]'' '''
*The '''Great Abatis Line''', or '''Bolshaya Zasechnaya Cherta''' in Russian, was the largest fortification line of [[abatis]] type, built by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Its purpose was to protect Russia from the raids of [[nomad]]s of the [[Eastern Europe]]an steppes, such as the [[Crimean Tatars]]. As a fortification construction stretching for hundreds kilometers, the Great Abatis Line is analogous to the [[Great Wall of China]] and the Roman [[Limes]]. Most of its length consisted of [[abatis]], which is the barrier built from the felled trees arranged as a barricade. It was also fortified by ditches and earth mounds, palisades, watch towers and natural features like lakes and swamps. Stone and wooden [[kremlin]]s of the towns were also included in the Great Abatis Line, as well as the smaller forts called [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]s. The Great Abatis Line was built south of [[Moscow]] between the [[Bryansk]] woods and [[Meschera]] swamps starting from the 12th century, and was officially completed in 1566, exceeding 1000&amp;nbsp;km in length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/044/168.htm Abatis Lines] with maps at cultinfo.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with a new carriage, the 2 ton cannonballs surrounding the cannon were added in 1835 and are larger than the diameter of its barrel; in fact, it was originally designed to fire 800&amp;nbsp;kg stone [[grapeshot]]. The cannon is decorated with [[relief]]s, including one depicting [[Tsar]] [[Feodor I of Russia|Tsar Feodor]] on a horse, hence the name of the cannon, though now the word ''Tsar'' is associated more with the supreme size of the weapon.

It first appeared in the second half of the 17th century, at least from 1659, in today's [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]] and was named after the large trade settlement Khokhloma. The handicraft owes its origin to the [[Old Believers]], who, fleeing from persecutions of officials, took refuge in local woods and taught some of the [[icon painting]] techniques to the local craftsmen, such as the usage of a goldish color without applying real [[gold]]. Nowadays khokhloma is one of the symbols of Russia, and apart from its usage in making tableware, furniture and [[souvenir]]s, it can be found in the wider context, for example in paintings on Russian [[airliner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuartking.co.uk/index.php/khokhloma-ware-folk-art-for-the-masses/ Khokhloma Ware: Folk art for the masses] by [[Stuart King]]&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''Tula gingerbread''' is a type of printed [[gingerbread]] from the city of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], the most known kind of Russian gingerbreads. Usually the Tula gingerbread looks like a rectangular tile or a flat figure. Modern Tula gingerbreads usually contain [[jam]] or [[condensed milk]], while in the old times they were made with [[honey]]. The first mention of the Tula gingerbread is in Tula Ñensus book of 1685.&lt;ref&gt;[http://russia.worlds.ru/articles/russia_article_1642.shtml Tula gingerbread] at russia.worlds.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''balalaika''' is a [[stringed instrument]] with a characteristic [[triangle|triangular]] body and 3 strings (or sometimes 6, in 3 courses), perhaps the most known national Russian musical instrument. The balalaika family of instruments includes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest, the prima balalaika, sekunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika. The earliest mention of balalaika is found in a 1688 document, and initially it was an instrument of [[skomorokh]]s (sort of Russian free-lance musical jesters). In 1880s the modern standard balalika was developed by [[Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev|Vasily Andreev]], who also started a tradition of balalaika orchestras, which finally led to the popularity of the instrument in many countries outside Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skaz1.com/balalaika.html  Balalaika] by Dmitry Belinskiy, from the newspaper ''Krymskaya Pravda''. {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Table-glass]]'''
*The '''table-glass''' or '''granyonyi stakan''' (literally ''faceted glass'') is a type of [[drinkware]] made from especially hard and thick [[glass]] and having a faceted form. Granyonyi stakan has certain advantages over the other drinkware, since due to its form and hardness it is more difficult to break. It is arguably handier in usage on moving trains or rolling ships, where it is less prone to decline and fall, or slip from hands, and less likely to be broken when hitting the floor. A legend says that the first known Russian faceted glass was given as a present to [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] from a glass-maker called [[Yefim Smolin]], living in [[Vladimir Oblast]]. He boasted to Tsar that his glass couldn't be broken. Tsar Peter liked the present, however, after drinking some alcoholic beverage from it, he threw the glass on the ground and managed to break it. Still Peter didn't punish the glass-maker, and the production of such glasses continued, while the Russian tradition of breaking [[drinkware]] on certain occasions originated from that episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hronograf.narod.ru/10/stakan.htm The Day of Granenyi Stakan] at hronograf.narod.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''yacht club''' is a sports [[club]] specifically related to [[sailing]] and [[yachting]]. The oldest yacht club in the world, according to the date of establishment, is [[Neva Yacht Club]], founded by the Russian [[Tsar]] [[Peter the Great]] in 1718 in [[St. Petersburg]] (likely, the idea had been deviced as early as 1716, when the First Neva Shipyard started building civilian vessels). Though, since it was not a purely voluntary association of members, but an organisation founded by Tsar's decree, the Neva Yacht Club's being the world's oldest is challenged by the [[Royal Cork Yacht Club]] in [[Ireland]], founded in 1720. Both clubs have gone through periods of dormancy and undergone various name changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ycaol.com/internat.htm World's oldest yacht clubs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804016491Oldest History of yacht clubs in Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1725 [[Rebar]]'''
*A '''rebar''' or '''reinforcing bar''' is a common metal bar (typically made of [[steel]]), used in [[reinforced concrete]] and reinforced [[masonry]] structures. Rebars were known in construction well before the era of the modern [[reinforced concrete]], since some 150 years before its invention rebars were used to form the carcass of the [[Leaning Tower of Nevyansk]] in [[Russia]], which was built on the orders of the [[industrialist]] [[Akinfiy Demidov]] between 1725-1732. The purpose of such construction is one of the many mysteries of the tower. The [[cast iron]] used for rebars was of very high quality, and there is no [[corrosion]] on them up to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevyansk&quot;&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2002/42/102260.html The office of the first Russian oligarch] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1732 [[Cast iron]] [[cupola]] / [[Lightning rod]] '''
*The '''cast iron cupola''' was a type of [[cupola]] based on the [[cast iron]] rather than made from [[stone]] or [[brick]], like it was in the ancient or medieval domes. The first application of this technology is found in the mysterious [[Leaning Tower of Nevyansk]], completed in 1732. The tower's [[tented roof]] had a [[cast iron]] carcass and outer shell. The second time, this technique was applied only some 100 years later, during the reconstruction of the [[Mainz Cathedral]] in [[Germany]] in 1826, while the third time it was used in the [[dome]] of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[St. Petersburg]], built in 1840s. The very top of the tower was crowned with a [[gilding|gild]]ed metallic [[sphere]] with spikes. Since it was [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] through the [[rebar]]s of the tower carcass, it acted like a '''lightning rod'''. Thus, the Russian builders de facto created the first lightning rod in the Western world some 25&amp;nbsp;years before [[Benjamin Franklin]], however it is not known whether that was made intentionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevyansk&quot;/&gt;

'''1733 ''[[Peter and Paul Cathedral]]'' '''
*The '''Peter and Paul Cathedral''' is a [[Russian Orthodox]] cathedral located in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It is the first and oldest landmark in St. Petersburg, built between 1712 and 1733 inside the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]]. Both the cathedral and the fortress were originally built under [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and designed by [[Domenico Trezzini]]. The cathedral is the burial place of all [[Russian Emperor]]s from [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], with the exception of [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The cathedral's bell tower is the world's [[List of tallest Orthodox churches|tallest Orthodox bell tower]]. Since the belfry is not standalone, but an integral part of the main building, the cathedral is sometimes considered the highest Orthodox Church in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://walkspb.ru/zd/petrop_sobor.html Peter and Paul Cathedral] at walkspb.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''Tsar Bell''' , also known as the '''Tsarsky Kolokol''' or '''Royal Bell''', is a huge [[bell (instrument)|bell]] on display on the grounds of the [[Moscow Kremlin]]. The bell was commissioned by [[Empress Anna]], niece of [[Peter the Great]]. Currently it is the [[List of heaviest bells|largest and heaviest bell]] in the world, weighing 216 [[ton]]s, with a height of 6.14&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]] (20.1&amp;nbsp;ft) and diameter of 6.6&amp;nbsp;m (21.6&amp;nbsp;ft). It was [[foundry|founded]] from [[bronze]] by masters [[Ivan Motorin]] and his son Mikhail in 1733&amp;ndash;1735. The bell, however, was never rung because of a fire in 1737, when a huge slab (11.5 tons) cracked off while it was still in the casting pit. In 1836, the bell was placed on a stone [[pedestal]] next to the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]]. For a time, the bell served as a [[chapel]], with the broken area forming the door. According to the legend, on [[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]] the Tsar Bell will be miraculously repaired and lifted up to heaven, where it will ring the [[blagovest]] (call to prayer).&lt;ref name=&quot;portnov&quot;/&gt;

*The '''Amber Room''' in the [[Catherine Palace]] of [[Tsarskoye Selo]] near [[Saint Petersburg]] is a complete chamber decoration of [[amber]] panels backed with [[gold]] leaf and [[mirror]]s. It was dubbed the ''[[Eighth Wonder of the World]]'' due to its singular beauty and the large quantity of a rare material (amber is rather hard to carve). Due to its unique history it was also called ''World's Greatest Lost Treasure''. Several generations of German and Russian craftsmen worked on this masterpiece, prompted by several generations of monarchs. Construction began in 1701 to 1709 in [[Prussia]]. In 1716 the ''Amber Cabinet'' was given by Prussian king [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm I]] to his then ally, [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia]]. Then it was expanded by Russian craftsmen, and by 1770, when the work was finished, the Room covered more than 55 square meters and contained over six tons of amber. It was [[looted art|looted]] during [[World War II]] by [[Nazi Germany]], brought to [[KÃ¶nigsberg]] and lost in the chaos at the end of the war. In 1979-2003 Russian craftsmen again reconstructed the Amber Room in the Catherine Palace, while the location of the original one is still a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Amber-Room-Worlds-Greatest-Treasure/dp/0802714242 The Amber Room: The Fate of the World's Greatest Lost Treasure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec-dejavu.ru/a/Amber_room.html Amber Cabinet of the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo] by L.V.

*'''Fire fighting foam''' is a [[foam]] used for fire suppression. Its role is to cool the fire and to coat the fuel, preventing its contact with oxygen, resulting in suppression of the [[combustion]]. Fire fighting foam was invented by the Russian engineer and chemist [[Aleksandr Loran]] in 1902. He was a teacher in a school in [[Baku]], which was the main center of the Russian [[oil industry]] at that time. Impressed by the terrible and hardly extinguishable oil fires that he had seen there, Loran tried to find such a liquid substance that could deal effectively with the problem, and so he invented his fighting foam foam.&lt;ref name=&quot;loran&quot;&gt;[http://p-lab.org/publ/7-1-0-15 Loran and the fire extinguisher] at p-lab.org {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1952 [[Carbon nanotubes]]'''
*A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal ''Carbon'' described the interesting and often misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to [[Sumio Iijima]] of [[NEC]] in 1991. In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet ''Journal of Physical Chemistry''. This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the [[Cold War]]. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;carbon&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Who should be given the credit for the discovery of carbon nanotubes?|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2006.03.019|first=Marc|last=Monthioux|journal=Carbon|volume=44|year=2006|url=http://www.cemes.fr/fichpdf/GuestEditorial.pdf |format=PDF|page=1621|last2=Kuznetsov|first2=V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ð Ð°Ð´ÑÑÐºÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ|first=Ð.

===Early 1990s===
'''1991 [[Thermoplan]]'''
*The '''thermoplan''' is a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]]-shaped [[airship]] of [[Hybrid airship|hybrid]] type, cyrrently under development in [[Russia]]. The key feature of thermoplan is its two section structure. The main section of the airship is filled with [[helium]], while the other section is filled with air that can be heated or cooled by the engines. This design greatly improves the maneuverability, alongside with the [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] shape which helps resist the powerful winds up to 20 metre per second. The projet was started in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, with the first working prototype tested in 1991. That was rather small airship, and the giant thermoplan wasn't built at that time due to the problems caused by the economy crisis of 1990s. In the late first decade of the 21st century the project was revived under the name ''Locomoskyner'' by the Russian company ''Locomosky'' in [[Ulyanovsk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locomosky.ru/en/ The official site of the ''Locomosky'' company]&lt;/ref&gt;
