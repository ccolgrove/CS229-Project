 | publisher   = [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a cartoon character created in 1934 at [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and licensed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Donald is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Pekin duck|white duck]] with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a [[sailor suit]] with a cap and a black or red bow tie. Donald is most famous for his [[Donald Duck talk|semi-intelligible speech]] and his explosive temper. Along with his friend [[Mickey Mouse]], Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in [[TV Guide|TV Guide's]] list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2002-07-30/entertainment/cartoon.characters.list_1_ren-and-stimpy-tv-guide-space-ghost?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ TV Guide's 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time]. [[CNN]]. 2002-06-30, retrieved 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character&lt;ref&gt;The statistic is based on Donald's [http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000719/ filmography page] from the [[Internet Movie Database]] which list about 178 theatrical films compared to Mickey Mouse's 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the fourth most published comic book character in the world after [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicvine.com/characters/ List of Superheroes &amp; Villains in the Comic Book Universe] at Comic Vine&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in [[Animated cartoon|animated cartoons]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]'' (1934), but it was his second appearance in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s he appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of which were recognized at the [[Academy Award|Academy Awards]]. Donald was regularly part of an [[ensemble cast]] with Mickey and [[Goofy]], and was given his own series of films in 1937, starting with ''[[Don Donald]]''. These films introduced Donald's girlfriend [[Daisy Duck]] and sometimes featured his three nephews [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. After the 1956 film ''Chips Ahoy'', Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His most recent theatrical appearance was 1999's ''[[Fantasia 2000]]''. Donald has also appeared in direct-to-video features such as ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999) and ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers|The Three Musketeers]]'' (2004) as well as television programs such as ''[[DuckTales]]'' (1987â1990), ''[[Quack Pack]]'' (1996), and ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006âpresent).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb|ch0000719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond animation Donald is primarily known for his [[Donald Duck in comics|appearances in comics]], both in newspaper strips and comic books. Donald was most famously drawn by [[Al Taliaferro]], [[Carl Barks]], and [[Don Rosa]]. Barks in particular is credited for greatly expanding the &quot;[[duck universe]],&quot; the world in which Donald lives, and creating many additional characters such as Donald's maternal uncle [[Scrooge McDuck]]. Today Donald is a very popular character in Europe, particularly in [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] countries where his weekly magazine has remained the most popular comics publication for over 50 years. Disney comics' fandom is sometimes humorously referred to as &quot;[[Donaldism]],&quot; a term which originated in Norway.

==Characterization==
[[File:Donald Duck - The Spirit of '43 (cropped version).jpg|thumb|right|''Donald Duck'' film series title screen]]
===Personality===
Donald's dominant personality trait is his short temper and, in contrast, his positive look on life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care in the world, until something comes and spoils his day.
His anger is a great cause of suffering in the duck's life, and he has on multiple occasions got in over his head and lost competitions because of it. There are times when he fights to keep his temper, and he has succeeded a few times, but he always returns to his well known, aggressive self at the end of the day.

Donald's aggressive nature is a double-edged sword however, and while it at times is a hindrance and even a handicap for him, it has also helped him in times of need. When faced against a threat of some kind, Donald may get frightened and even intimidated (mostly by Pete), but rather than getting scared, he gets mad and has taken up fights with [[ghost]]s, [[shark]]s, [[mountain goat]]s and even the [[natural phenomenon|forces of nature]]. And, more often than not, Donald has come out on top.

Donald can at times be a bit of a bully and a tease, especially against [[Huey, Dewey and Louie|his nephews]] and [[Chip 'n Dale]]. As animator [[Fred Spencer]] once wrote:

{{quote|The Duck gets a big kick out of imposing on other people or annoying them, but he immediately loses his temper when the tables are turned. In other words, he can dish it out, but he can't take it.&lt;ref&gt;The Chronological Donald Volume One&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, there is seldom any malice in Donald's pranks. He is never out to hurt anyone, and if he ever goes too far in his pranks he is always very regretful. In [[Truant Officer Donald]], for example, when he is tricked into believing he accidentally killed Huey, Dewey and Louie, he shows great remorse, blaming himself and willingly takes a kick handed out by one of the âangelâ nephews. That is, of course, until he realizes he has been played a sap and directly loses his temper.

Donald has also been shown to be a bit of a show-off. He likes to brag, especially when he is very skilled at something. This has a tendency to get him into trouble, however, as he also tends to get in over his head.

Still, Donald has proven that he is a [[Jack of all trades, master of none|Jack of all Trades]] and is, amongst other things, a good fisher and hockey player.

Among his personality traits is his stubbornness and commitment. Even though Donald at times can be lazy, and he has stated many times that his favorite place is in the [[hammock]], once he has committed to something he goes in for it 100%, sometimes going to extreme measures to reach his goal.

===Phrases===
Donald has a few memorable phrases that he occasionally comes out with in given situations. &quot;What's the Big Idea!?&quot; is a common one, which Donald usually says when stumbling across other characters in the midst of planning some sort of retaliation or prank, and sometimes when certain things do not go as planned or do not work properly. &quot;Aw Phooey!&quot; is another memorable saying Donald makes, usually after giving up on a particular action or event. Another popular phrase Donald says, in particular to Daisy, is, &quot;Hiya, toots!&quot;. &quot;Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy&quot; is yet another common phrase Donald uses, usually when he's very excited about something.

===Health===
A [[running gag]] in the Donald Duck comics is about his physical condition. Usually, some character close to Donald believes that because of his laziness, Donald needs to do some exercise, which annoys Donald. But, in spite of his apparent lazy condition, Donald proves that he is physically strong, as evidenced in one of his shorts, ''Sea Scouts'', where Donald travels in a boat with his nephews, but a shark attacks the boat and Donald, after several misadventures, finally defeats the shark with a single punch.

===Rivalry with Mickey Mouse===
Throughout his career, Donald has shown that he's jealous of Mickey and wants his job as Disney's greatest star. This is very similar to the [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]] rivalry. In most Disney theatrical cartoons, Mickey and Donald are shown as partners and have little to no rivalry. However by the time ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' aired on television (after Bugs vs. Daffy cartoons such as [[Rabbit Fire]]), it was shown that Donald always wanted the spotlight. One animated short that rivaled the famous [[Mickey Mouse March]] song was showing Huey, Dewey, and Louie as [[Boy Scout]]s and Donald as their [[Scoutmaster]] at a cliff near a remote [[forest]] and Donald leads them in a song mirroring the Mouseketeers theme &quot;D-O-N-A-L-D D-U-C-K-! Donald Duck!&quot; The rivalry would cause Donald some problems, in a 1988 [[Mickey's 60th Birthday|TV special]], where Mickey is cursed by a sorcerer to become unnoticed, the world believes Mickey to be kidnapped. Donald Duck is then arrested for the [[kidnapping]] of Mickey, as he is considered to be the chief suspect, due to their rivalry. However, Donald did later get the charges dismissed, due to lack of evidence. [[Walt Disney]], in his ''Wonderful World of Color'', would sometimes make reference to the rivalry. Walt, one time, had presented Donald with a gigantic [[birthday cake]] and commented how it was &quot;even bigger than Mickey's&quot;, which pleased Donald. The clip was rebroadcast in November 1984 during a [[Donald Duck's 50th Birthday|TV special]] honoring Donald's 50th birthday, with [[Dick Van Dyke]] substituting for Walt.

The rivalry between Mickey and Donald has also been shown in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. It was shown that Donald wanted to be the Club's founder and wanted to change the name from ''House of Mouse'' to ''House of Duck''. However, in later episodes, Donald accepted that Mickey was the founder and worked with Mickey as a partner to make the club profitable.

Mickey Mouse has failed to realize how much Donald does not like him at times, and always counts him as one of his best friends. Despite the rivalry, Donald seems to be an honest friend of Mickey's, and will be faithful to him in tough situations, such as working with Mickey and Goofy as a team akin to [[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers|The Three Musketeers]]. In the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games, Donald is quite loyal to Mickey, even briefly leaving [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] to follow King Mickey's orders.

The rivalry between Mickey and Donald is not unlike that of Warner Bros. characters [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]], and many animation fans have commented on the parallels present among the four characters. However, the main difference is that Bugs is aware of the fact that Daffy does not always like him, and takes advantage of it by playing tricks on the duck. In [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]] Donald and Daffy have a dueling banjos contest with Pianos.

===Nemesis===
Donald has enemies, as worse than Mickey Mouse: [[Chip and Dale]], [[Humphrey the Bear]], [[Spike The Bee]], [[Mickey Mouse universe#Louie the Mountain Lion|Mountain Lion Louie]], [[Bootle Beetle]], [[Witch Hazel (Disney)|Witch Hazel]] (in ''Trick and Treat''), [[Aracuan Bird]] and [[Baby Shelby]] (in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'').

In the comics, are the [[Beagle Boys]], [[Magica De Spell]] and [[Mr. Jones (comics)|Mr. Jones]].

In the videogame ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'', he saves Daisy from [[Merlock (Disney)|Merlock]].

===Early appearances===
{{details|Donald Duck filmography}}
[[Image:Donald duck debut.PNG|thumb|right|Donald Duck as he first appeared in ''The Wise Little Hen'']]

According to [[Adeytola]] in his introduction to ''The Chronological Donald - Volume 1'', Donald was created by [[Walt Disney]] when he heard Clarence Nash doing his &quot;duck&quot; voice while reciting &quot;[[Mary had a little lamb]]&quot;. [[Mickey Mouse]] had lost some of his edge since becoming a role model for children and Disney wanted a character that could portray some of the more negative character traits he could no longer bestow on Mickey.

Donald Duck first appeared in the [[1934 in film|1934]] cartoon ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]'' which was part of the ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' series of theatrical cartoon shorts. The film's release date of June 9 is officially recognized by the Walt Disney Company as Donald's birthday&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When is Donald Duck's birthday? When did he debut? |work=Guest Services |publisher=Disney |url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faqs#history_archives9 |accessdate=2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a couple in-universe contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' (1944) Donald's birthday is [[Friday the 13th]], a reference to his seemingly congenital bad luck. In ''Donald's Happy Birthday'' (1949) Donald's birthday is March 13 which was a Friday in 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald's appearance in the cartoon, as created by [[animator]] [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]], is similar to his modern lookâthe feather and beak colors are the same, as is the blue sailor shirt and hatâbut his features are more elongated, his body plumper, and his feet smaller. Donald's personality is not developed either; in the short, he only fills the role of the unhelpful friend from the original story.

[[Burt Gillett]], [[film director|director]] of ''The Wise Little Hen'',{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} brought Donald back in his [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon, ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' on August 11, 1934. Donald is one of a number of characters who are giving performances in a benefit for Mickey's Orphans. Donald's act is to recite the poems ''[[Mary had a little lamb|Mary Had a Little Lamb]]'' and ''[[Little Boy Blue]]'', but every time he tries, the mischievous orphans heckle him, leading the duck to fly into a squawking fit of anger. This explosive personality would remain with Donald for decades to come.

Donald continued to be a hit with audiences. The character began appearing regularly in most Mickey Mouse cartoons. Cartoons from this period, such as the 1935 cartoon ''[[The Band Concert]]''âin which Donald repeatedly disrupts the Mickey Mouse Orchestra's rendition of ''[[The William Tell Overture]]'' by playing ''[[Turkey in the Straw]]''âare regularly hailed by critics as exemplary films and classics of animation. Animator [[Ben Sharpsteen]] also minted the classic ''Mickey, Donald, and Goofy'' comedy in 1935, with the cartoon ''Mickey's Service Station''.

In 1936, Donald was redesigned to be a bit fuller, rounder, and cuter. He also began starring in solo cartoons, the first of which was the January 9, 1937 Ben Sharpsteen cartoon, ''[[Don Donald]]''. This short also introduced a love interest of Donald's, ''Donna Duck'', who evolved into [[Daisy Duck]].&lt;ref&gt;Although the Walt Disney Company claimed Donna Duck to be the same character as Donald's long-time love interest [[Daisy Duck]], this is not so in Karp/Taliaferro comics (1951), where she is a separate character, appearing together with Daisy in a couple of daily newspaper strips. Early illustrations of Daisy also show a clear distinction between the two, Donna having a Mexican accent, contrary to Daisy.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald's nephews, [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]], would make their first animated appearance a year later in the April 15, 1938 film, ''[[Donald's Nephews]]'', directed by [[Jack King (animator)|Jack King]] (they had been earlier introduced in the Donald Duck [[comic strip]] by [[Al Taliaferro]], see below). By 1938, at most, polls showed that Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/cartoon.cgi?film=15&amp;m=r |title=Free Cartoon Reviews of Fantasia Feature Length Theatrical Animated Film |publisher=Bcdb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney could, however, help Mickey regain popularity by redesigning him, giving him his most appealing design as production for the ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' segment &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; began in 1938.

After his early appearances, he went on to become part of the famed trio Mickey, Donald, and Goofy. He appeared in many of the cartoons, including ''Moving Day''.

===Wartime Donald===
[[File:Ducknazi.jpg|thumb|left|Donald worked in a Nazi factory in ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1943)]]Several of Donald's shorts during the war were [[propaganda film|propaganda films]], most notably ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'', released on January 1, 1943. In it, Donald plays a worker in an artillery factory in &quot;Nutzi Land&quot; ([[Nazi Germany]]). He struggles with long working hours, very small food rations, and having to [[Nazi salute|salute]] every time he sees a picture of the [[FÃ¼hrer]] ([[Adolf Hitler]]). These pictures appear in many places, such as on the assembly line in which he is screwing in the detonators of various sizes of shells. In the end he becomes little more than a small part in a faceless machine with no choice but to obey until he falls, suffering a nervous breakdown. Then Donald wakes up to find that his experience was in fact a dream. At the end of the short Donald looks to the [[Statue of Liberty]] and the [[United States|American]] flag with renewed appreciation. ''Der Fuehrer's Face'' won the 1942 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film]]. ''Der Fuehrer's Face'' was also the first of two animated short films to be set during the War to win an Oscar, the other being [[Tom and Jerry]]'s short film, ''[[The Yankee Doodle Mouse]]''.

Other notable shorts from this period include the Army shorts, seven films that follow Donald's life in the [[United States Army|US Army]] from his drafting to his life in basic training under sergeant [[Pete (Disney character)|Pete]] to his first actual mission as a [[commando]] having to sabotage a [[Japan]]ese air base. Titles in the series include:

* ''[[Donald Gets Drafted]]'' (May 1, 1942)
* ''[[The Vanishing Private]]'' (September 25, 1942)
* ''[[Sky Trooper]]'' (November 8, 1942)
* ''[[Fall Out Fall In]]'' (April 23, 1943)
* ''[[The Old Army Game]]'' (November 5, 1943)
* ''[[Commando Duck]]'' (June 2, 1944)

''[[Donald Gets Drafted]]'' also featured Donald having a physical examination before joining the army. According to it Donald has flat feet and is unable to distinguish between the colors green and blue, which is a type of [[color blindness]]. Also in this cartoon sergeant Pete comments on Donald's lack of discipline.

[[File:Donald duck on mustang.JPG|thumb|right|Donald on the nose of a [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]]]Thanks to these films, Donald graced the nose artwork of virtually every type of [[World War II|WWII]] [[Allied]] combat aircraft, from the [[L-4 Grasshopper]] to the [[B-29 Superfortress]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Donald also appears as a mascotâsuch as in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] [[309th Fighter Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 309th Fighter Squadron | publisher = 31st Fighter Group | url = http://www.31stfightergroup.com/31stReference/history/309th.html | accessdate = 2007-08-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070823135236/http://www.31stfightergroup.com/31stReference/history/309th.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary]], which showed Donald as a fierce-looking pirate ready to defend the American coast from invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Noble | first = Dennis L. | authorlink = Dennis L. | title = The Corsair Fleet | work = The Beach Patrol and Corsair Fleet | publisher = Coast Guard | date = 2001-06 | url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/BeachPatrolCorsairFleet.pdf| format=PDF | accessdate = 2007-08-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald also appeared as a mascot emblem for: [[415th Fighter Squadron]]; [[438th Fighter Squadron]]; [[479th Bombardment Squadron]]; [[531st Bombardment Squadron]]. He also appears as the mascot for the [[United States Air Force]]  [[319 Aircraft Maintenance Unit]] at Luke Air Force Base. He is seen wearing an old style pilots uniform with a board with a nail in it in one hand and a lightning bolt in the other hand.    

During World War II, Disney cartoons were not allowed to be imported into [[Occupied Europe]] owing to their propagandistic content. Since this cost Disney a lot of money, he decided to create a new audience for his films in [[South America]]. He decided to make a trip through various Latin American countries with his assistants, and use their experiences and impressions to create two feature length animation films. The first was ''[[Saludos Amigos]]'', which consisted of four short segments, two of them with Donald Duck. In the first, he meets his parrot pal [[Jose Carioca]]. The second film was ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'', in which he meets his rooster friend [[Panchito Pistoles|Panchito]].

===Post-war animation===
Many of Donald's films made after the war recast the duck as the brunt of some other character's pestering. Donald is repeatedly attacked, harassed, and ridiculed by his nephews, by the [[chipmunk]]s [[Chip 'n Dale]], or by other characters such as [[Humphrey the Bear]], [[Spike the Bee]], [[Bootle Beetle]], the [[Aracuan Bird]], [[Louie the Mountain Lion]], or a colony of ants. In effect, the Disney artists had reversed the classic [[screwball comedy film|screwball]] scenario perfected by [[Walter Lantz]] and others in which the main character is the ''instigator'' of these harassing behaviors, rather than the butt of them.

The post-war Donald also starred in [[educational film]]s, such as ''[[Donald in Mathmagic Land]]'' and ''[[How to Have an Accident at Work]]'' (both 1959), and made cameos in various Disney projects, such as ''[[The Reluctant Dragon]]'' (1941) and the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]'' [[television]] show (1959). For this latter show, Donald's uncle [[Ludwig von Drake]] was created in 1961.

Clarence Nash voiced Donald for the last time in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' (1983), making Donald the only character in the film to be voiced by his original actor. Since Nash's death in 1985, Donald's voice has been provided by [[Tony Anselmo]], who was mentored by Nash. Anselmo's voice is heard for the first time in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit?]]''. In this movie, Donald has a piano duel scene with the [[Warner Brothers]] duck [[Daffy Duck]] voiced by [[Mel Blanc]] and wins the duel with a [[cartoon]] [[cannon]]. Many fans call this confrontation between the 2 ducks as one of the greatest duels in animation history.

Donald has since appeared in a lot of different television shows and (short) animated movies. He played roles in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' and ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' and made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[A Goofy Movie]].''NOTE:During a Darkwing Duck episode a star is scorned and everyone thinks Darkwing is Donald. He later dresses up like Donald to sneak in with Goslyn dressed as Huey

Donald had a rather small part in the animated television series ''[[DuckTales]]''. There, Donald joins the Navy, and leaves his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie with their [[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]], who then has to take care of them. Donald's role in the overall series was fairly limited, as he only ended up appearing in a handful of episodes. Some of the stories in the series were loosely based on the comics by [[Carl Barks]].

Donald made some cameo appearances in ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', before getting his own television show ''[[Quack Pack]]''. This series featured a modernized Duck family. Donald was no longer wearing his sailor suit and hat, but a Hawaiian shirt. Huey, Dewey, and Louie now are teenagers, with distinct clothing, voices, and personalities. Daisy Duck has lost her pink dress and bow and has a new hairdo. Oddly enough, no other family members, besides Ludwig von Drake, appear in ''Quack Pack'', and all other Duckburg citizens are humans, and not dogs.

He made a comeback as the star of the &quot;Noah's Ark&quot; segment of ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', as first mate to Noah. Donald musters the animals to the Ark and attempts to control them. He tragically believes that Daisy has been lost, while she believes the same of him, but they are reunited at the end. All this to [[Edward Elgar]]'s ''[[Pomp and Circumstance]]'' Marches 1â4.

In an alternate opening for the 2005 Disney film ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'', Donald would have made a cameo appearance as &quot;Ducky Lucky&quot;. This scene can be found on the ''Chicken Little'' DVD.
[[Image:Donald Duck in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.png|thumb|right|Donald in ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]''.]]
Donald also played an important role in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and ''[[House of Mouse]]''. In the latter show, he is the co-owner of Mickey's night club. He is in the TV show ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' as well.

==Donald in comics==
{{Main|Donald Duck in comics}}
While Donald's cartoons enjoy vast popularity in the [[United States]] and around the world, his weekly and monthly comic books enjoy their greatest popularity in many [[Europe]]an countries, especially [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]], but also [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Greece]]. Most of them are produced and published by the Italian branch of the [[Walt Disney Company]] in Italy and by [[Egmont (media group)|Egmont]] in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. In Germany, the comics are published by Ehapa which has since become part of the Egmont empire. Donald-comics are also being produced in The Netherlands and France. Donald also has been appeared in Japanese comics published by [[Kodansha]] and [[Tokyopop]].

According to the [[INDUCKS]], which is a database about Disney comics worldwide, American, Italian and Danish stories have been reprinted in the following countries. In most of them, publications still continue: [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Argentina]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Colombia]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]] ([[Faroe Islands]]), [[Egypt]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guyana]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

===Early development===
Though a 1931 Disney publication called ''[[Mickey Mouse Annual]]'' mentioned a character named Donald Duck, the character's first appearance in [[comic strip|comic-strip]] format was a newspaper cartoon that was based on the short ''The Wise Little Hen'' and published in 1934. For the next few years, Donald made a few more appearances in Disney-themed strips, and by 1936, he had grown to be one of the most popular characters in the ''[[Silly Symphonies (comic strip)|Silly Symphonies]]'' comic strip. [[Ted Osborne]] was the primary writer of these strips, with [[Al Taliaferro]] as his artist. Osborne and Taliaferro also introduced several members of Donald's supporting cast, including his nephews, [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].

In 1937, an Italian publisher named [[Mondadori]] created the first Donald Duck story intended specifically for [[comic book]]s. The eighteen-page story, written by [[Federico Pedrocchi]], is the first to feature Donald as an adventurer rather than simply a comedic character. [[Fleetway]] in [[England]] also began publishing comic-book stories featuring the duck.

===Developments under Taliaferro===
A daily ''Donald Duck'' comic strip drawn by Taliaferro and written by [[Bob Karp]] began running in the [[United States]] on February 2, 1938; the Sunday strip began the following year. Taliaferro and Karp created an even larger cast of characters for Donald's world. He got a new [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] named [[Bolivar (dog)|Bolivar]], and [[Duck family (Disney)|his family]] grew to include cousin [[Gus Goose]] and grandmother [[Elvira Coot]]. Donald's new rival girlfriends were [[Donna Duck|Donna]] and [[Daisy Duck]]. Taliaferro also gave Donald his very own automobile, a 1934 [[Belchfire Runabout]], in a 1938 story.

===Developments under Barks===
[[Image:CarlBarksFinland.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carl Barks]] (1994)]]

In 1942, [[Western Publishing]] began creating original comic-book stories about Donald and other Disney characters. Bob Karp worked on the earliest of these, a story called &quot;[[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]]&quot;. The new publisher meant new illustrators, however: [[Carl Barks]] and [[Jack Hannah]]. Barks would later repeat the [[treasure hunt|treasure-hunting]] theme in many more stories.

Barks soon took over the major development of the comic-book version of the duck as both writer and illustrator. Under his pen, the comic version of Donald diverged even further from his animated counterpart, becoming more adventurous, less temperamental, and more eloquent. [[Pete (Disney character)|Pete]] was the only other major character from the ''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip to feature in Barks' new [[Donald Duck universe]].

Barks placed Donald in the city of [[Duckburg]], which he populated with a host of supporting players, including [[Neighbour Jones]] (1944), Uncle [[Scrooge McDuck]] (1947), [[Gladstone Gander]] (1948), [[the Beagle Boys]] (1951), [[Gyro Gearloose]] (1952), [[April, May and June]] (1953), [[Flintheart Glomgold]] (1956), [[Magica de Spell]] (1961), and [[John D. Rockerduck]] (1961). Many of Taliaferro's characters made the move to Barks' world as well, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Barks placed Donald in both domestic and adventure scenarios, and Uncle Scrooge became one of his favorite characters to pair up with Donald. Scrooge's popularity grew, and by 1952, the character had a comic book of his own. At this point, Barks concentrated his major efforts on the Scrooge stories, and Donald's appearances became more focused on comedy or he was recast as Scrooge's reluctant helper, following his rich uncle around the globe.

===Further developments===
Dozens of writers continued to utilize Donald in their stories around the world.

For example the Disney Studio artists, who made comics directly for the European market. Two of them, [[Dick Kinney]] (1917â1985) and [[Al Hubbard (comic book artist)|Al Hubbard]] (1915â1984) created Donald's cousin [[Fethry Duck]].

The American artists Vic Lockman and [[Tony Strobl]] (1915â1991), who were working directly for the American comic books, created [[Duck family (Disney)#Moby Duck|Moby Duck]]. Strobl was one of the most productive Disney artists of all time, and drew many stories which Barks wrote and sketched after his retirement. In the 1990s and early 2000s, these scripts were re-drawn in a style closer to Barks' own by Dutch artist [[Daan Jippes]].

Italian publisher Mondadori created many of the stories that were published throughout Europe. They also introduced numerous new characters who are today well known in Europe. One example is Donald Duck's alter-ego, a [[superhero]] called [[Paperinik]] in [[Italian language|Italian]], created in 1969 by Guido Martina (1906â1991) and [[Giovan Battista Carpi]] (1927â1999).

[[Giorgio Cavazzano]] and Carlo Chendi created ''Umperio Bogarto'', a detective whose name is an obvious parody on [[Humphrey Bogart]]. They also created [[O.K Quack]], an extraterrestrial Duck who landed on earth in a spaceship in the shape of a coin. He however lost his spaceship, and befriended Scrooge, and now is allowed to search through his moneybin time after time, looking for his ship.

[[Romano Scarpa]] (1927â2005), who was a very important and influential Italian Disney artist, created [[Brigitta McBridge]], a female Duck who is madly in love with Scrooge. Her affections are never answered by him, though, but she keeps trying. Scarpa also came up with [[Dickie Duck]], the granddaughter of [[Glittering Goldie]] (Scrooge's possible love-interest from his days in the Klondike) and [[Kildare Coot]], a nephew of [[Duck family (Disney)#Grandma Duck|Grandma Duck]].

Italian artist [[Corrado Mastantuono]] created Bum Bum Ghigno, a cynical, grumpy and not too good looking Duck who teams up with Donald and Gyro a lot.

The American artist [[William van Horn]] also introduced a new character: [[Rumpus McFowl]], an old and rather corpulent Duck with a giant appetite and laziness, who is first said to be a cousin of Scrooge. Only later, Scrooge reveals to his nephews Rumpus is actually his half-brother. Later, Rumpus also finds out.

Working for the Danish editor Egmont, artist [[Daniel Branca]] (1951â2005) and script-writers Paul Halas and Charlie Martin created Sonny Seagull, an orphan who befriends Huey, Dewey and Louie, and his rival, Mr. Phelps.

The most productive Duck-artist today is [[Vicar (comics)|Victor Arriagada Rios]], who is better known under the name Vicar. He has his own studio where he and his assistants draw the stories sent in by Egmont. With writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-PÃ¥hlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro's time-machine. She stayed, and is still seen in occasional modern stories.

The best-known and most popular Duck-artist of this time is American [[Don Rosa]]. He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone. He later worked briefly for the Dutch editors, but moved to work directly for Egmont soon afterwards. His stories contain many direct references to stories by Carl Barks, and he also wrote and illustrated a [[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck|12-part series of stories about the life of Scrooge McDuck]], which won him two [[Eisner]] awards.

Other important artists who have worked with Donald are [[Freddy Milton]] and [[Daan Jippes]], who made 18 ten-pagers which experts claim were very difficult to separate from Barks' own work from the late 1940s.

Japanese artist [[Shiro Amano]] worked with Donald on the graphic novel ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' based on the Disney-[[SquareEnix]] videogame.

==Donald Duck outside the United States==
Donald Duck has a slightly different character abroad.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}{{how|date=December 2011}}&lt;!--Citation needed from RS that explicitly compares Donald in the USA to Donald abroad--&gt;

===Nordic Countries===
{{Ref improve section|date=January 2010}}
Donald Duck (''Kalle Anka'' in Sweden, ''Anders And'' in Denmark, ''AndrÃ©s Ãnd'' in Iceland, ''Donald Duck'' in Norway and ''Aku Ankka'' in Finland) is a very popular character in Nordic countries. In the mid-1930s, [[Robert S. Hartman]], a German who served as a representative of Walt Disney, visited Sweden to supervise the merchandise distribution of Sagokonst (The Art of Fables). Hartman found a studio called L'AteljÃ© DekoratÃ¶r, which produced illustrated cards that were published by Sagokonst. Since the Disney characters on the cards appeared to be exactly 'on-model', Hartman asked the studio to create a local version of the English-language ''[[Mickey Mouse Weekly]]''. In 1937 L'AteljÃ© DekoratÃ¶r began publishing ''[[Musse Pigg Tidningen]]'' (''Mickey Mouse Magazine''), which had high production values and spanned 23 issues; most of the magazine's content came from local producers, while some material consisted of reprints from ''Mickey Mouse Weekly''. The comic anthology ended in 1938. Hartman helped Disney establish offices in all Nordic countries before he left Disney in 1941. Donald became the most popular of the Disney characters in Scandinavia, and Scandinavians recognise him better than Mickey Mouse.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Kalle Anka &amp; Co'', Donald's first dedicated Swedish anthology, started in September 1948. In 2001 the Finnish Post Office issued a stamp set to commemorate the 50th year anniversary of Donald's presence in Finland. By 2005 around one out of every four Norwegians read the Norwegian edition ''Donald Duck &amp; Co.'' per week, translating to around 1.3 million regular readers. During the same year, every week 434,000 Swedes read ''Kalle Anka &amp; Co''. By 2005 in Finland the Donald Duck anthology ''Aku Ankka'' sold 270,000 copies per issue. Tim Pilcher and Brad Books, authors of ''The Essential Guide to World Comics'', described the Donald anthologies as &quot;the Scandinavian equivalent of the UK's ''[[The Beano|Beano]]'' or ''[[The Dandy|Dandy]]'', a comic that generations have grown up with, from grandparents to grandchildren.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential244&quot;&gt;Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. (Foreword: Dave Gibbons). ''The Essential Guide to World Comics''. ''[[Collins and Brown]]''. 2005. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hannu Raittila, an author, says that Finnish people recognize an aspect of themselves in Donald; Raittila cites that Donald attempts to retrieve himself from &quot;all manner of unexpected and unreasonable scrapes using only his wits and the slim resources he can put his hands on, all of which meshes nicely with the popular image of Finland as driftwood in the crosscurrents of world politics.&quot; Finnish voters placing &quot;protest votes&quot; typically write &quot;Donald Duck&quot; as the candidate.&lt;ref&gt;KallionpÃ¤Ã¤, Katri. &quot;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Donald+Duck+holds+his+own+in+the+north/1135226493131 Donald Duck holds his own in the north].&quot; ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]''. March 7, 2007. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1978, within Finland there was debate over the morality of Donald Duck. Matti Holopainen jokingly criticized Donald for living with Daisy while not being married to her, for not wearing trousers, and for, in the words of the ''[[Library Journal]]'', being &quot;too [[bourgeois]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://larko.wordpress.com/2006/05/25/the-truth-about-donald-ducks-pants/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/disney/films/finland.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers from Finland from the same time period supported Donald, referring to him as a &quot;genuine proletarian...forced to sell his labor at slave rates to make a living&quot;. The ''Library Journal'' stated that it had been revealed that, since 1950, Donald had secretly been married to Daisy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Donald Duck, Yogi Bear, &amp; Riding Hood under fire&quot;.

An annual Christmas special in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden is ''[[From All of Us to All of You]]'', in Norway and Sweden with a title of ''Donald Duck and His Friends Celebrate Christmas''. Segments include ''[[The Story of Ferdinand#Film|Ferdinand the Bull]]'', a short with Chip 'n' Dale, a segment from ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', a sneak preview of a coming Disney movie and concludes with Jiminy Cricket performing &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;. To many people watching this special is a tradition as important as having a Christmas tree.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Germany===
Donald Duck is very popular in Germany, where Donald themed comics sell an average of 250,000 copies each week, mostly published in the kidsâ weekly ''Micky Maus'' and the monthly ''Donald Duck Special'' (for adults).&lt;ref name=bernofsky/&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' called Donald Duck &quot;The Jerry Lewis of Germany&quot;, a reference to American star [[Jerry Lewis]]'s popularity in France.&lt;ref name=bernofsky&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203771904574181722075062290.html &quot;Why Donald Duck Is the Jerry Lewis of Germany&quot;], Susan Bernofsky, ''Wall Street Journal'', May 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Donald's dialogue in German comics tends to be more sophisticated and philosophical, he &quot;quotes from German literature, speaks in grammatically complex sentences and is prone to philosophical musings, while the stories often take a more political tone than their American counterparts&quot;,&lt;ref name=bernofsky/&gt; features especially associated with [[Erika Fuchs]]'s popular German translations of the comics created by ''The Good Duck Artist'' [[Carl Barks]]. Christian Pfeiler â former president of D.O.N.A.L.D., a German acronym which stands for &quot;German Organization for Non-commercial Followers of Pure Donaldism&quot; â says Donald is popular in Germany because &quot;almost everyone can identify with him. He has strengths and weaknesses, he lacks polish but is also very cultured and well-read.&quot;&lt;ref name=bernofsky/&gt; It is through this [[everyman]] persona that Donald is able to voice philosophical truths about German society that appeal to both children and adults.&lt;ref name=bernofsky/&gt; Donald's writers and illustrators [[Carl Barks]], [[Don Rosa]] and [[Ub Iwerks]] are well known in Germany, and have their own [[fan club]]s.

==Disney theme parks==

Donald Duck has played a major role in many Disney theme parks over the years. He has actually been seen in more attractions and shows at the parks than Mickey Mouse has. He has appeared over the years in such attractions as [[Mickey Mouse Revue]], [[Mickey's PhilharMagic]], [[Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years]], [[Gran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros]] and the updated version of [[it's a small world|'''&quot;it's a small world&quot;''']]. He also is seen in the parks as a meet-and-greet character.

One long-ago-scrapped idea was also to have a bumper boat ride themed to Donald Duck.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}{{clear}}

==Beyond Disney==
[[File:Donald Duck in Grauman's Chinese Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|Donald's footprints at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood. The prints were made during the celebration of Donald's [[Donald Duck's 50th Birthday|50th birthday]].]]
* Donald is the only popular film and television cartoon character to appear as a [[mascot]] for a major American university: a licensing agreement between Disney and the [[University of Oregon]] allows the school's sports teams to use Donald's image as its &quot;[[The Oregon Duck|Fighting Duck]]&quot; mascot. In 1984, Donald Duck was named an honorary alumnus of the University of Oregon during his 50th birthday celebration. During a visit to the [[Eugene Airport]], 3,000 to 4,000 fans gathered for the presentation of an academic cap and gown to Donald. Thousands of area residents signed a congratulatory scroll for Donald, and that document is now part of Disney's corporate archives.

* In the 1940s, Donald was adopted as an unofficial mascot by Brazilian sports club [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] after Argentinean cartoonist Lorenzo Mollas, who was working in Brazil at the time, drew him with the club's soccer uniform. Mollas chose Donald because he complains and fights for his rights, like the club's managers at those years, and also because, being a duck, he does not lose his elegance while moving in the water (an allusion to [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]). He was eventually replaced so that the club would not have to pay royalties to Disney (Botafogo's current official mascot is &quot;Manequinho&quot;, representing the [[Manneken Pis]] statue in front of the club's head office), but has since retained the status of unofficial mascot.

* Donald's name and image are used on numerous commercial products, one example being Donald Duck brand [[orange juice]], introduced by [[Citrus World]] in 1940.

* Donald Duck was temporarily listed as a &quot;hired&quot; employee in the database of the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] as late as 1978. Given a $99,999 salary â more than double the $47,500 take federal civil servants were legally limited to be paid at the time â the name was unchallenged by a computer intended to catch government payroll fraud. Picked as one of thirty fictitious names by the Government Accounting Office, the use of it was a test to see if the payroll system of the HUD could be manipulated to defraud the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=DeMaris|coauthors=Cowger, Nancy &amp; Slonim, Scott|title=Donald Ducks Computer|journal=ABA Journal|year=1979|month=January|volume=65|page=28|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4pTI2jZBm1EC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=ABA+Journal+January+1979&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jIiiTcuzFpSbtweg0dyDAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ABA%20Journal%20January%201979&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Donald Duck's head and neck, wearing a radio headset and wrapped in earphone wires with an expression of pain on his face and with crossed crutches below, was the nose art on Lieutenant [[Ted W. Lawson]]'s [[B-25 Mitchell]] bomber, the [[Ruptured Duck]], on the famous [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo in 1942 .

* In the 1950s, an early ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad Magazine]]'' parody of [[Mickey Mouse]] (called &quot;Mickey Rodent&quot;, written by &quot;Walt Dizzy&quot;) featured &quot;Darnold Duck&quot;, whose quacky voice had to be &quot;translated&quot; for the readers, and who was shamed into finally wearing pants.

* Although Donald's military service has most been recognized as him in the US Army from his wartime cartoons (and to a lesser extent having Donald in the [[US Navy]] from Duck Tales), Walt Disney had authorized Donald to be used as a mascot for the [[US Coast Guard]]. The Coast Guard image shows a fierce-looking Donald Duck dressed in a pirate's outfit, appearing vigilant against any potential threats to the coastal regions in the United States. This image is still often used on many Coast Guard bases and [[Coast Guard cutter]]s today.

* Donald Duck is referred to in the song &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; by [[The Kinks]]: &quot;We are the Village Green Preservation Society/ God save Donald Duck, vaudeville and variety...&quot; The reference is ironical, as the singer is lamenting the disappearance of perceived traditional English cultural artifacts.

* Donald Duck makes a cameo appearance in the [[cartoon]] sequence in ''[[200 Motels]]'' (1971).

* In [[Sweden]], a comic book artist named [[Charlie Christensen]] got into a legal dispute with Disney when his creation [[Arne Anka]] looked similar to Donald Duck (albeit Arne is a pessimistic drunkard). However Charlie made a mockery of the legal action, and staged a fake death for his character, who then had plastic surgery performed and reappeared as Arne X with a more crow-like beak. He later purchased a strap-on duck beak from a novelty gift shop, pointing out that &quot;If Disney are planning to give me any legal action all I have to do is remove my fake beak.&quot;

* In 1991, the Disney Corporation sued the [[Israelis|Israeli]] caricaturist [[Dudu Geva]] for [[copyright infringement]], claiming his character &quot;Donald Dach&quot; in the story &quot;Moby Duck&quot; was a ripoff of Donald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Becher | first = Nir | title = The Duck | work = Haaretz | url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=710399&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;title='The%20Duck' | accessdate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Courts found in their favor and forced Geva to pay for the legal expenses and remove his book from the shelves. More mildly, the character [[Howard The Duck]]'s original design was modified to include pants allegedly due to pressure from Disney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=4pTI2jZBm1EC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=ABA+Journal+January+1979&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jIiiTcuzFpSbtweg0dyDAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ABA%20Journal%20January%201979&amp;f=false] - Berry, D.; Cowger, N. &amp; Slonim, S.

* Donald's fame has led Disney to license the character for a number of video games, such as the ''Kingdom Hearts'' series, where Donald is the court magician of Disney Castle. He accompanies Goofy and a young boy named [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] on a quest to find King Mickey Mouse, defeat the Heartless and Nobodies, and put an end to the evil [[Xehanort]] and [[Organization XIII]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=1351&lt;/ref&gt; He is voiced by [[Tony Anselmo]] in the English version and [[KÅichi Yamadera]] in the Japanese version.
