The '''1902 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[1902 college football season]]. In their second year under head coach [[Fielding H. Yost]], Michigan finished the season undefeated with an 11&amp;ndash;0 record, outscored their opponents by a combined score of 644 to 12, and became known as the second of Yost's famed &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; teams. With a conference record of 5â0, Michigan won the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Nine Conference]] championship. The 1902 Michigan Wolverines have also been recognized as [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national champions]] by the Billingsley Report, [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], Houlgate System, National Championship Foundation and [[Parke H. Davis]].

[[File:Fielding Yost (1902).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Fielding H. Yost]] compiled a 22â0 record in his first two years as Michigan's coach.]]
The 1902 Michigan football team won Michigan's second consecutive western football championship. Although there was no mechanism in place at the time for the selection of a national champion, the 1902 Wolveirnes have been recognized as the [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national championship]] team by the Billingsley Report, [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], Houlgate System, National Championship Foundation and [[Parke H. Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;full list&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009FBS.pdf  | title=Official 2009 NCAA Division I Football Records Book | pages=76â81 | publisher=The National Collegiate Athletic Association | date=2009-08 | location=Indianapolis, IN | accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished the season undefeated and untied, having prevailed in all eleven of their games by a combined score of 644 to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1902 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1902fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1902 squad was the second of five consecutive high-scoring teams that came to be known as Coach Yost's &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; teams.&lt;ref name=AD&gt;{{cite book|author=Allison Danzig|title=The History of American Football|year=1956|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|chapter=10: An Era of Yost, Stagg, and Thorpe|page=153=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1901 to 1905, Yost's teams compiled a record of 55&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 2,821 to 42.&lt;ref name=AD/&gt;

Team captain and quarterback [[Boss Weeks]] wrote a review of the 1902 season for the 1903 yearbook, the ''Michiganensian.'' Weeks opened his review as follows: &quot;The story of the football season of 1902 is easily told. Champions of the West, with no one to dispute it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Michiganensian|year=1903|page=130|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;q1=michiganensian;rgn=full%20text;view=toc;idno=AAG4364.1903.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same publication, Fielding Yost published a 15-point essay entitled, &quot;Why Michigan Is Great.&quot; Some of Yost's points included the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;First. Speed. Both as a team and in the individual players, Michigan was speedy. ...&lt;br&gt;Second. Knowledge of the Game. All of the Michigan players were well versed in the fundamental principles of the game in every department. ... &lt;br&gt;Third. Endurance. the men are of wonderful endurance.  This is much due to their fine training ...&lt;br&gt;Fourth.  Spirit. Among the players there is the finest of fellow-feeling. The men's love of the game had helped give them the proper spirit. They have the desire to win -- the spirit of fighters.&lt;br&gt;Fifth. Team Work. Michigan's team work has been wonderful. ... &lt;br&gt;Seventh. Weight. Michigan had a well-balanced team. The average was 182 pounds very equally distributed. But one man weighed over 200 pounds (Carter) and but one less than 170 pounds (Weeks at quarterback).&lt;br&gt;Eighth. Style of Attack. Michigan varied her onslaughts very much, depending largely upon the style of defense used by the team opposing it. Every man on the team was used to carry the ball, thus distributing the work.&lt;br&gt;Ninth. Generalship. Captain Weeks deserves great credit for Michigan's success. As a leader of forces and strategist I believe he has no equal on the gridiron today. ...&lt;br&gt;Tenth. Punting. In Sweeley, Michigan has one of the greatest kickers in the country. Never has he had a kick blocked in his four years' play at Michigan. ...&lt;br&gt;Twelfth. Defense. Michigan's defensive playing has been wonderful. No team was able to cross Michigan's goal on straight football in the last two years ... &lt;br&gt;Fifteenth. Met All Teams. Michigan's schedule was far harder than that usually arranged for a team. She played five state universities and all the strong Western teams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1903 Michiganensian, pp. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popularity of football on campus==
With the success of Yost's football team, football enjoyed a surge of popularity on Michigan's campus in 1902. Even the student literary magazine, ''The Inlander'', which usually filled its pages with poems, short stories, and essays by students, gave its entire December 1902 issue to a celebration of the football team. The special issue featured a photograph of Yost on the cover and included all manner of facts and figures on the popular team.&lt;ref name=IFI&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Issue|newspaper=The Inlander|date=December 1902|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xd3hAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noting the popularity of the sport with Michigan's female students, ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' in November 1902 wrote about the spectators in attendance at Michigan's home game against Minnesota:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;But the dominant note of the gathering was the girl. She was there in every type and style, in every section of the stands and on every row. There was the college girl and the town girl, sweater girl and gown girl. And whatever type of girl she was elsewhere, she was always the Michigan girl.&quot;&lt;ref name=MinnDFP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michigan 48, Case 6===
In its second game of the 1902, Michigan played the Case Scientific School (later [[Case Western Reserve University]]) of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]].  The October 4 game was the fifth meeting between the schools.  Although Michigan scored eight touchdowns and easily defeated Case by a score of 48 to 6, the big story of the game was a 30-yard touchdown run by Case's left halfback, Davidson.&lt;ref name=CaseMA/&gt; Michigan had not allowed any points to be scored in the first 12 games under Fielding Yost. The headline in the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' referred not to Michigan's victory but instead read, &quot;MICHIGAN'S GOAL LINE CROSSED.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan goal line crossed |newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 5, 1902|page=10|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749548912.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+5,+1902&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=10&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+GOAL+LINE+CROSSED}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Michigan Alumnus'' wrote that the touchdown by Case &quot;caused consternation among coach, team, and students&quot; as &quot;it had been their fondest hope that the goal line should remain uncrossed another year.&quot;&lt;ref name=CaseMA&gt;{{cite news|title=The Case Game|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=November 1902|page=62|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KRviAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan 119, Michigan Agricultural 0===
[[File:Albert Herrnstein.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Albert E. Herrnstein]] led all Michigan scorers with 27 touchdowns, including seven against [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan Agricultural College]].]]
Michigan played a mid-week game against [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan Agricultural College]] (now known as [[Michigan State University]]) on Wednesday, October 8, 1902, four days after the win against Case. Michigan attained its highest point total of the year, defeating the Aggies by a score of 119-0. The Wolverines scored 71 points in the first half of 20 minutes and 48 in the second half of 18 minutes.&lt;ref name=MACDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan made 119 points: Almost equaled phenomenal score against Buffalo simply rushed ball over the Aggie's line at Will made touchdown oftener than once in two minutes |newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 9, 1902|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749571512.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+9,+1902&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=11&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+MADE+119+POINTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Michigan Alumnus'' called it &quot;the greatest fusillade of touchdowns ever known to the football world,&quot; excluding Michigan's 128â0 win over Buffalo in 1901.&lt;ref name=MACMA&gt;{{cite news|title=The M.A.C.

Willie Heston and Everett Sweeley did not play in the game, and the ''Detroit Free Press'' noted: &quot;The opinion is quite general that if Heston and Sweeley had been in the game the Buffalo record would have been beaten, but, as it was, Michigan was simply fagged out running down the field for touchdowns.&quot;&lt;ref name=MACDFP/&gt;

The game was played in two halves of 20 minutes and 18 minutes. Demonstrating the understatement of the &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; name given to the team, the Wolverines scored 119 points in 38 minutes of play, an average of 3.1 points per minute. After the game, ''The Newark Advocate'' wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Michigan has undoubtedly the fastest scoring team in the world, and the Ann Arbor boys play Yosts' 'hurry up' formations like clock work. It requires a fast team to take the ball, line up and score 119 points, even if they have no opponents in two 20 minute halves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wednesday's Football Results|newspaper=The Newark Advocate|date=October 9, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Lawrence was the star of the game for Michigan. In his first game after Fielding Yost moved him to the fullback position, Lawrence scored four touchdowns and kicked nine goals after touchdown, accounting for 29 of Michigan's 60 points.

===Michigan 23, Notre Dame 0===
[[File:Curtis Redden.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Curtis Redden]], ejected from the Notre Dame game, was killed in action during [[World War I]] 16 years later.]]
After four home games to open the season, Michigan played [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] at a neutral site in [[Toledo, Ohio]] on October 18, 2010. The game was played on a slippery white clay field at Armory Park following a night of rain. Michigan had been heavily favored to win, and betting on the game was 2 to 1 that Notre Dame would not score.&lt;ref name=NDDFP/&gt; Though favored to run up a high score, Michigan scored only one touchdown and led 5-0 at the end of the first half. The ''Detroit Free Press'' wrote that the game was &quot;the toughest proposition that the Wolverines have had, either this season or last year.&quot;&lt;ref name=NDDFP/&gt; 

Michigan tackle Joe Maddock was the leading scorer with three touchdowns. The game also marked the debut of right end [[Everett Sweeley]], who punted several times for a distance of 60 yards. On the opening kickoff, Sweeley returned the ball with a punt to Notre Dame's 43-yard line.&lt;ref name=NDDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Notre Dame fought hard: But Michigan ran up 23 points on Hoosters; Salmon came near scoring for the losing side; Toughest proposition for Wolverines in two years |newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 19, 1902|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749558642.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+19,+1902&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=7&amp;desc=NOTRE+DAME+FOUGHT+HARD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although Notre Dame did not score on Michigan, its captain, [[Louis J. Salmon]], demonstrated why he had earned &quot;the reputation of being the hardest line bucker in the west.&quot;&lt;ref name=NDDFP/&gt; On one drive, Salmon took the ball to the Michigan 43-yard line in two attempts. After Notre Dame reached Michigan's 20-yard line, &quot;Salmon went at it in the most vicious and determined manner to score. He took the ball eight times in succession but was finally held for downs on the 5-yard line.&quot;&lt;ref name=NDDFP/&gt;

In the  second half, Michigan's running game wore down the Notre Dame defense. Michigan scored three touchdown in the second half, and Notre Dame did not move into Michigan territory. Michigan end [[Curtis Redden]] was ejected from the game after an altercation with Lonnegan of Notre Dame, though Redden claimed Lonnegan had been the instigator.&lt;ref name=NDDFP/&gt;  After the game, Yost said, &quot;I am satisfied. The score is just about what I though it would be after I had taken a look at the field.&quot;&lt;ref name=NDDFP/&gt;

The game was played in halves of 25 minutes. Hinkey of Yale was the umpire, and Jackson of Lake Forest was the referee. Michigan's starting lineup was Redden (left end), Cole (left tackle), McGugin (left guard), Gregory (center), Carter (right guard), Maddock (right tackle), Sweeley (right end), Graver (quarterback), Heston (left halfback), Herrnstein (right halfback) and Jones (fullback).

[[File:Willie Heston (bentley image).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Willie Heston]] returned to &quot;his 1901 form&quot; against Ohio State, scoring two touchdowns, including a 70-yard run.]]
In the sixth game of the season, Michigan defeated [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] 86-0 in Ann Arbor on October 25, 1902. The game was played in front of a crowd of 6,000 (including 2,000 from Columbus), &quot;the largest crowd ever gathered at Ferry Field.&quot; Michigan scored 45 points in the first half and 41 points in the second half.

On offense, the ''Detroit Free Press'' wrote that the Wolverines &quot;simply ran the Ohio team off their feet.&quot;&lt;ref name=OhioDFP/&gt; Willie Heston reportedly returned to &quot;his 1901 form,&quot; scoring the game's first points with a 20-yard end run after three minutes of play.&lt;ref name=OhioDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan crowding record: Passed 400 Mark in game with Ohio State University; made fifteen touchdowns, for total score of 86; Yost's men played all around Perry Hal's proteges |newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=October 26, 1902|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749568582.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+26,+1902&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=8&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+CROWDING+RECORD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston scored his second touchdown on a 70-yard run. Albert Herrnstein was credited by the ''Free Press'' with the most consistent play for Michigan and with &quot;the star play of the day by cutting inside of end and running 35 yards for a touchdown.&quot;&lt;ref name=OhioDFP/&gt;  The ''Free Press'' noted that, despite the coaching of former Yale fullback [[Perry Hale]], the Ohio State players lacked &quot;the first rudiments of tackling&quot; and &quot;failed to hold a man when they got their arms around him.&quot;&lt;ref name=OhioDFP/&gt;

Michigan's defense was credited with playing a strong game as &quot;Ohio State never got near enough to Michigan's goal line to see what the cross-bars looked like.&quot;&lt;ref name=OhioDFP/&gt; Ohio State's longest gain was a 15-yard run around Michigan's right end for a 15-yard gain in the second half.

===Michigan 6, Wisconsin 0===
[[File:Joe Maddock.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Joe Maddock (coach)|Joe Maddock]] scored the only touchdown against Wisconsin and later became the head football coach at [[Utah Utes football|Utah]].]]
In the seventh game of the season, Michigan faced its toughest opponent, the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin Badgers]]. The game matched the two western teams that had finished the 1901 season with undefeated records and was played at Marshall Field in Chicago in front of a crowd estimated variously at between 20,000 and 22,000, the largest number ever to watch a college football game in the west.&lt;ref name=HAC&gt;{{cite news|title=Hall and Campus|newspaper=The Inlander|date=November 2000|page=49|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xd3hAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game began at 2:40 p.m., and Michigan scored the game's only points at the end of a 65-yard drive seven minutes into the first half.  Willie Heston had the longest run (20 yards) on the drive, and Joe Maddock scored the touchdown on a run through the tackle from the two-yard line.&lt;ref name=WiscDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan's one score enough: Gave Her Victory Over Wisconsin and Bright Hope of Championship' Superb defense of Badgers denied two other promised touchdowns' Only Points Made Were Made in First Seven Minutes, in Opening Onward Rush|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|page=1|date=November 2, 1902|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749536592.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+2,+1902&amp;author=A+Staff+Correspondent&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=MICHIGAN'S+ONE+SCORE+ENOUGH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the close score, Wisconsin only once had the ball in Michigan's territory. The ''Michigan Alumnus'' wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The play was in Wisconsin's territory practically the whole time. They never got within striking distance of Michigan's goal, while Michigan was held at one time with the ball less than a yard from Wisconsin's goal line, at another time was held inside the 15-yard line, and still again lost the ball on a fumble on the 7-yard line.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Detroit Free Press'' opened its coverage of the game as follows: &quot;In what is conceded to be the greatest football game ever played on a western gridiron, Michigan decisively defeated Wisconsin on Marshall field this afternoon and undoubtedly won at the same time the championship of the west, though a later game must be won before that honor can be claimed.&quot;&lt;ref name=WiscDFP/&gt; Four times Michigan moved the ball deep into Wisconsin territory, and all four times Michigan's field goal attempts by Lawrence and Sweeley were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=WiscDFP/&gt;

A score of men were injured, but no one were killed. The immense crowd about the gridiron took advantage of the confusion to break down the wire fence surrounding it, and hundreds swarmed onto the field. The few police were powerless to force them out, but the scrubs from both teams lined up against the crowd and shoved them away from the side lines so the game could be played.&quot;&lt;ref name=WiscDFP/&gt;  The game was resumed after a 15-minute delay.

The inadequate seating capacity of Marshall Field was blamed for the accident. The bleacher was designed to hold 400 but was crowded beyond its capacity. The facilities were insufficient for the crowd that showed for the game, and there were reports of spectators offering $20 for a ticket.&lt;ref name=WiscDFP/&gt;

The game was played in equal halves of 35 minutes.&lt;ref name=WiscDFP/&gt;  Michigan's starting lineup was Redden (left end), Palmer (left tackle), McGugin (left guard), Gregory (center), Carter (right guard), Maddock (right tackle), Sweeley (right end), Weeks (quarterback), Heston (left halfback), Herrnstein (right halfback) and Jones (fullback).

Approximately 2,000 students accompanied the team to Chicago,&lt;ref name=HAC/&gt; and an account from Chicago was relayed to Ann Arbor's Athens theater which was &quot;packed with students and citizens.&quot;&lt;ref name=JOY/&gt; When the final score was announced, the crowd of 1,500 voices sung, &quot;Oh! What have we done?  Oh!  What have we done? We have put Wisconsin on the bum. That's what we have done.&quot;&lt;ref name=JOY&gt;{{cite news|title=Victory Brought Joy to Ann Arbor|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 2, 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Michigan team returned to Ann Arbor late in the evening, they were met by a big delegation that marched behind the bus singing.&quot;&lt;ref name=JOY/&gt;

The ''Detroit Free Press'' wrote after the game that &quot;Yost's smile can be seen all the way from Minneapolis.&quot;&lt;ref name=IowaDFP/&gt;

Michigan scored 65 points in the first half, and its offense dominated the game. The ''Michigan Alumnus'' reported:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[T]he versatility of Michigan's play so disconcerted the Iowa team within the first ten minutes that she seemed wholly bewildered. Delayed passes, fake kicks, double passes, end runs, line-bucks off tackle and into the line followed each other like kaleidoscopic transitions. Gains were made at every point and in every conceivable manner.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Detroit Free Press'' also noted the innovative nature of Michigan's offensive game plan:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Michigan to-day mixed up her plays so completely that Iowa was completely bewildered. Delayed passes, double passes, ends skirting ends, halves dodging in between end and tackle after their opponents had been boxed out and in, tackles and full back hitting the line like trip hammers made the giant Hawkeyes look like a weak scrub team.&quot;&lt;ref name=IowaDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan again made century: Seventeen Touchdowns and Field Goal, 107 Points, Against Iowa; Used speed and tricks on visitors, and, scored almost at Will; Ann Arborites Now Lack But Thirteen Points of Number Made During Last Season|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 9, 1902|page=1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1749559772.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+9,+1902&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+AGAIN+MADE+CENTURY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's blocking (then known as interference): &quot;If you can tell me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done.&quot;&lt;ref name=IowaDFP/&gt; Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa.

In the first eight games of the season, Michigan had scored 537 points (67.1 points per game), more than the 506 points Michigan's 1901 team had scored in the entire regular season.

The game was played in halves of 35 and 30 minutes.

===Michigan 21, Chicago 0===
[[File:Paul Jones (1902).jpg|thumb|right|175px|Michigan fullback [[Paul J. Jones]] later served 42 years as a federal judge in Cleveland.]]
Michigan returned to Marshall Field in Chicago to play [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]]'s [[Chicago Maroons football|Chicago Maroons]] on November 15, 1902. Michigan won the game 21â0 in front of a crowd of 14,000. The game began at 2:15 p.m. Before the game started, the Michigan fans in attendance released toy red balloons marked &quot;Chicago&quot; into the &quot;somewhat murky and frosty atmosphere.&quot; One Michigan fan, described as &quot;a long-haired collegian wearing a yellow and blue streamer, told a reporter, &quot;That is the way we will toss Chicago up in the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=ChiDFP/&gt;

Everett Sweeley gave Michigan a 5â0 lead with a field goal from a difficult angle at the 25-yard line. Later in the first half, Heston took the ball on a delayed pass and ran 71 yards for a touchdown.&lt;ref name=ChiDFP/&gt; Michigan led 10â0 at halftime. In the second half, Sweeley extended Michigan's lead to 15-0 with a field goal from the 17-yard line. With approximately 10 minutes remaining in the game, left tackle William Palmer ran for a touchdown, and Sweeley converted the goal from touchdown to give Michigan its final total of 21 points.&lt;ref name=ChiDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan must beat Gophers: Downed Chicago, 21 to 0, Outplaying Stagg's Men in All Lines; Minnesota at same time put Wisconsin in class with Midway outfit; Winners of Yesterday Must Now Settle Western Championship in Their Contest Here; Chicago's defense was a stron one Yost, however, proved equal to Stagg in craft |newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 16, 1902|page=1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1758469122.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+16,+1902&amp;author=&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+MUST+BEAT+GOPHERS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was the second match between the two legendary coaches, Yost and Stagg. Michigan had defeated Chicago 22â0 in 1901. Despite the successive defeats, Stagg was credited with developing a &quot;magnificent defense to hold Yost's 'hurry up' offense to 21 points in 70 minutes of play.&quot;&lt;ref name=ChiDFP/&gt;

The game was played in halves of 35 minutes. [[Joseph Beacham]] of Cornell was the referee, and [[Raymond Starbuck]] of Cornell the umpire. Michigan's starting lineup was Redden (left end), Palmer (left tackle), McGugin (left guard), Gregory (center), Carter (right guard), Maddock (right tackle), Sweeley (right end), Weeks (quarterback), Heston (left halfback), Herrnstein (right halfback) and Jones (fullback).

===Michigan 63, Oberlin 0===
[[File:Boss Weeks.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Quarterback [[Boss Weeks]] (''pictured'') called a conservative game against Oberlin with Minnesota coach [[Henry L. Williams]] in the stands scouting the Wolverines]]
Michigan defeated Oberlin 63â0 in the ninth game of the season. Michigan scored 28 points in the first half and 33 in the second. The speed of Michigan's &quot;hurry up&quot; offense was demonstrated by a three-play drive in which Herb Graver returned a kickoff 60 yards and Willie Heston ran the remaining 40 yards for a touchdown.&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP/&gt; 

Early in the second half, Herb Graver fumbled the ball at Michigan's 10-yard line, and the ball was recovered by Oberlin. On a fake field goal, Oberlin took the ball to the four-yard line but was unable to advance the ball further and missed a field goal attempt.&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP/&gt;  Michigan's Herrnstein and Sweeley were both taken out of the game with injuries to their knees.

With Minnesota's head coach [[Henry L. Williams]] and five of his players attending the game to scout the Wolverines, Michigan's quarterback Boss Weeks did not open up the great variety of Michigan's plays and &quot;did not pull much down out of his sleeve for their edification.&quot;&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP/&gt; Only once did Michigan run one of its renowned trick plays, a double pass to Everett Sweeley that was good for 15 yards.&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP/&gt;

After the game, the umpire, Allen of Chicago, was asked what he thought of the Michigan team and responded: &quot;Why, it goes without saying that Michigan is a wonder. It is the greatest team I ever saw, and I have watched a lot of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP/&gt;

The game was a benchmark game in which Michigan could be compared to the best teams in the east. Cornell had defeated Oberlin 57â0 earlier in the year, and the ''Detroit Free Press'' suggested that Michigan's victory by a greater margin &quot;may give the easterners an eye-opener.&quot;&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP/&gt;

With the popularity of the &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; tradition at Michigan, the ''Detroit Free Press'' reported: &quot;The score is one of particularly gratification to Michigan's enhusiasts as it makes Yost's whirlwinds secure a record that never was equalled before, and probably never will be again. Michigan started out the season with as tough a schedule apparently as any team in the west, and if anybody had made a break that this aggregation would be a 'point to the minute' team the man who made the assertion would have been the guy of the town. Yet now, having played 540 minutes, this scoring machine has piled up 621 points, and even if Michigan is shut out by Minnesota in seventy minutes of play the Wolverines will have obtained an average that is the greatest feat in gridiron history.&quot;&lt;ref name=OberlinDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan and Yale happy:

The game was played in halves of 30 minutes. Michigan's starting lineup was Redden (left end), Cole (left tackle), McGugin (left guard), Gregory (center), Carter (right guard), Maddock (right tackle), Sweeley (right end), Weeks (quarterback), Heston (left halfback), Herrnstein (right halfback) and Jones (fullback).

===Michigan 23, Minnesota 6===
[[File:Fielding Yost-1902.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Yost (on the sideline at right) coaching Michigan against Minnesota]]
In the final game of the 1902 season, Michigan defeated [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football under Henry L. Williams#1902 season|Minnesota]] 23â6 on [[Thanksgiving Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Team is best in West: Football Championship Won by Ann Arbor Defeating Minnesota 23 to 6; Visitors score by Fluke; Fighting Game Marked by Brilliant Plays and Many Flaws--Graver Hero of the Victors|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=November 28, 1902|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/408797741.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+28,+1902&amp;author=A+STAFF+CORRESPONDENT&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+(1872-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=4&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+TEAM+IS+BEST+IN+WEST.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game got under way at 2:15 p.m. on a brisk afternoon in Ann Arbor. Michigan took the opening kickoff and sustained a 90-yard, seven-minute drive ending with a touchdown by Joe Maddock and a goal after touchdown by Everett Sweeley. The ''Detroit Free Press'' reported that, during the opening drive, &quot;the Minnesota line was hurled back, again and again, like that of a minor college eleven.&quot;&lt;ref name=MinnDFP&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan victorious over sturdy Minnesota: The Eyes of enthusiasts the Country Over Were on Ann Arbor--A Great Contest Stubbornly Fought and Gallantly Won--Splendid Crowd Out to See the Struggle--Complete Story of Michigan's Glory|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 28, 1902|page=1|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1758442372.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+28,+1902&amp;author=A+Staff+Correspondent&amp;pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=MICHIGAN+VICTORIOUS+OVER+STURDY+MINNESOTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan's second touchdown came on an end run by Heston from the 35-yard line, with Sweeley again kicking the goal to give Michigan a 12â0 lead at halftime. At halftime, [[South Bend, Indiana]] resident [[Louis Elbel]] conducted the [[Michigan Marching Band History#New leadership: The early 1900s|Michigan band]] as it played a song Elbel had composed four years earlier which was then known as &quot;The Champions of the West&quot; (now known as &quot;[[The Victors]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=MinnDFP/&gt;

In the second half, the Golden Gophers scored after Boss Weeks missed the catch on a punt. The ball contacted Weeks and bounded past him. Flynn of Minnesota recovered the ball and ran for a touchdown, only the second touchdown scored against Michigan since Fielding Yost took over as head coach in 1901. Michigan's leading scorer, Albert Herrnstein, was pulled from the game in the second half due to an injury. The ''Detroit Free Press'' described Herrnstein's removal from his final game for Michigan as follows: &quot;He had been laid out a number of times, but refused to quit the game until he was unable to stand. Then, crying, he was dragged off the field by trainer [[Keene Fitzpatrick]].&quot;&lt;ref name=MinnDFP/&gt; On its next drive, Michigan was stopped at Minnesota's 25-yard line, and Sweeley kicked a field goal for five points to give the Wolverines a 17â6 lead. Sweeley's field goal was converted from a difficult angle, and its success &quot;set the rooters wild.&quot;&lt;ref name=MinnDFP/&gt;  Later in the game, Heston scored the game's final touchdown on a run from the 35-yard line, as he hurdled over a Minnesota tackler.  Sweeley added the goal after touchdown to give Michigan the win at 23â6. With the win, Michigan completed its second consecutive [[perfect season]] under Fielding Yost.

The game was played in equal halves of 35 minutes. Michigan's starting lineup was Redden (left end), Cole (left tackle), McGugin (left guard), Gregory (center), Carter (right guard), Maddock (right tackle), Sweeley (right end), Weeks (quarterback), Heston (left halfback), Herrnstein (right halfback) and Graver (fullback).&lt;ref name=MinnDFP/&gt;

===1902 players who became coaches===
[[File:Dan McGugin.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Guard [[Dan McGugin]] later gained fame as [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]'s coach.]]
Fielding Yost earned a reputation as an innovator of the sport. His &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; teams at Michigan compiled an overall record of 43-0-1 from 1901 to 1905 and outscored their opponents 2,326 to 40. The unprecedented performance of these teams created a demand for Yost's players, known as the &quot;Yost-men&quot;, to serve as head coaches at other schools. Ten of the 14 lettermen on Yost's 1902 team became college football head coaches. [[Dan McGugin]], who played left guard for the 1902 team, was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] for his accomplishments as head coach at [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] from 1904 to 1934.&lt;ref name=DMG&gt;{{cite web|title=Dan McGugin Hall of Fame profile|publisher=College Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famer_selected.php?id=10068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And end/tackle [[William C. &quot;King&quot; Cole]] led the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska Cornhuskers]] to two [[Missouri Valley Conference]] championships.&lt;ref name=WCC&gt;{{cite web|title=Nebraska Head Coach, 1907-10|publisher=huskers.com|url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=8&amp;SPID=22&amp;DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=920501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1902 Michigan players who went on to head coaching positions are:
