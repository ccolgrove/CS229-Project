'''QuickTime Alternative''' is a [[codec]] package for [[Microsoft Windows]] for playing [[QuickTime]] media, normally only playable by the official QuickTime software distribution from [[Apple Inc.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt1&quot; /&gt;

==Comparison==
QuickTime Alternative consists of codec libraries extracted from the official distribution, including the official QuickTime plugin required for playing QuickTime files (.MOV, .QT and others) in web browsers such as [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]], and also includes [[Media Player Classic]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The main functional differences between the official QuickTime distribution and QuickTime Alternative from an end-user standpoint are in feature set, size, and consumption of system resources. QuickTime Alternative is a smaller package and lacks the full complement of software included in Apple QuickTime, including QuickTime Player, PictureViewer, and any [[QuickTime#QuickTime Pro|QuickTime Pro]] features. In addition, QuickTime Alternative does not run background processes such as the optional QuickTime Tray Icon from the official distribution.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

'''QT Lite''' is a stripped-down version of QuickTime Alternative that contains only the base components, and does not install [[Media Player Classic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt1&quot; /&gt; It used to be maintained concurrently with QuickTime Alternative.

==History==
{{Expand list|date=July 2010}}
*On March 10, 2006, QuickTime Alternative 1.56 was released, which is the last version based on Apple QuickTime 6.0, and therefore the last version to support [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt5&quot; /&gt;.

*On September 14, 2007, QuickTime Alternative 1.90 was released, which removes QuickTime Pro functionality and DirectShow filters, both of which were included in prior versions. Based on Apple QuickTime 7.2,&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt3&quot; /&gt; QuickTime Alternative 1.95 is the first version that doesn't support [[Windows 2000]]&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt4&quot; /&gt; or CPUs without [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]]&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt4&quot; /&gt;.
*On December 15, 2007, QuickTime Alternative 2.20 was released and it was based on Apple QuickTime 7.3.1.70. From this version upwards support for CPUs without SSE is restored back again&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt6&quot; /&gt;.
*On September 3rd, 2009, QuickTime Alternative 3.2.2 was released. Based on Apple QuickTime 7.6.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt1&quot; /&gt;
*On July 15, 2010, both Quicktime Alternative and [[Real Alternative]] were removed from their main distribution website, and on July 25, 2010 QT Lite and Real Alternative Lite followed suit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The maintainer of these software packages, CodecGuru, refuses to discuss the reason for the removal, saying &quot;that discussion is not wanted here.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} CodecGuru also actively deletes or edits any posts on the Codec Guide forum that mention the two codec packs and their removal. Repeated posting about the topic results in users being banned from the forum. CodecGuru stated in a forum post that &quot;There are no links on the site anymore to stimulate the use and development of open-source alternatives, such as [[VLC media player|VLC]] and [[ffdshow]], instead of the use of proprietary software.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;qtalt7&quot; /&gt;
*On August 16th, 2010 QT Lite 4.0.0 was released. Based on Apple QuickTime 7.6.7.&lt;ref name=&quot;qtlite1&quot; /&gt;
*On December 18th, 2010 QT Lite 4.1.0 was released. Based on Apple QuickTime 7.6.9
