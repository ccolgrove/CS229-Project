'''OpenSolaris Desktop''', formerly '''Java Desktop System''' ('''JDS'''),&lt;ref&gt;http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+jds/&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[desktop environment]] now developed by [[Oracle Corporation]] (after its acquisition of [[Sun Microsystems]]) available for [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and formerly [[Linux]].

OSD aims to provide a system familiar to the average computer user with a full suite of office productivity software such as an [[office suite]], a [[web browser]], [[email]], calendaring, and instant messaging.

Despite being formerly known as the Java Desktop System, it is not actually written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]; it is built from [[GNOME]] and other common free software projects. The name reflected Sun's promotion of the product as an outlet for corporate users to deploy software written for the Java platform.

==Versions==
Sun first bundled a preview release of GNOME 1.4 on a separate CD for Solaris 8.

JDS version 2 included:

*[[Java platform|Java]]
*[[GNOME]] (using the Blueprint theme)
*[[StarOffice]]
*[[Mozilla]]
*[[Novell Evolution|Evolution]]
*[[MP3]] and CD player
*[[Java Media Framework]]'s Java Media Player
*[[Gaim]] multi-service instant messaging
*[[RealPlayer]]

JDS Release 2 was available for Solaris and for the [[SuSE]]-based Linux distribution.

JDS Release 3 was released in 2005. It was included with Solaris 10 â upon installation of Solaris, one has the choice of using either the [[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]] or JDS. It was based on GNOME 2.6 and available only for the Solaris 10 platform. 

OpenSolaris Desktop 01 (released October 28, 2005) was based on GNOME 2.10 and OpenSolaris Desktop 02 (released December 23, 2005) is based on GNOME 2.12.

OpenSolaris Desktop is now tied to the OpenSolaris operating system, and does not have its own release schedule. The latest version was released with the release of OpenSolaris 2009.6, and was based on Gnome 2.24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensolaris.com/learn/features/desktop/|title=OpenSolaris Desktop - features|work=Oracle|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2010-07-17|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rHlt3RMM|archivedate=2010-07-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included Firefox 3.1, OpenOffice 3 and Sun VirtualBox.
