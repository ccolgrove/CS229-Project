'''Cullen Darome Jenkins''' (born January 20, 1981) is an [[American football]] [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He was signed by the [[Green Bay Packers]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2003. He played [[college football]] at [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]].

He is the younger brother of former [[Carolina Panthers]] and [[New York Jets]] [[defensive tackle]] [[Kris Jenkins]].

==Early years==
Both he and his brother [[Kris Jenkins]] played at [[Belleville High School (Michigan)|Belleville High School]] under Bob LaPointe.

==College career==
Jenkins played college football at [[Central Michigan University]], where he recorded 40 tackles, seven tackles for a loss, 4Â½ sacks, and two passes defensed during his senior year.

==Professional career==
===Green Bay Packers===
====2004â2006====
Cullen Jenkins was originally signed by Green Bay as a rookie free agent after the '03 draft. One year later, after an impressive NFL Europe season and strong training camp, landed a spot on the Packers' roster. From 2004 to November 2006, Jenkins was the backup for [[Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila]], and took over the starting role the final month of the 2006 season. As the starter for the last month of games, he recorded a career-high 6Â½ sacks that year, including his first three-sack game vs. Detroit on December 17, 2006.

====2007â2008====
On February 26, 2007, Jenkins signed a four year, $16 million contract extension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2780628 &quot;Defensive lineman Jenkins extended by Packers&quot;], [[Associated Press]], February 26, 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins batted down nine passes in 2007, the most by a Packers defensive lineman since the team began recording the statistic in 1980.

In the 2008 season, the Packers decided to start Jenkins instead of Gbaja-Biamila for the second season in a row. He could only play four games though, before he suffered a torn pectoral muscle against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 28, 2008. Two days later, he was placed on injured reserve.

====2009â2010====
In the 2009 season Jenkins returned as a starting defensive end because the Packers had switched from a 4-3 to a 3-4 defense.  Jenkins had two productive seasons with effective play against both the pass and the run.  In the 2010 season Jenkins missed 5 games with a calf injury, but returned by the end of the season to win Super Bowl XLV with the Packers.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
The [[Philadelphia Eagles]] signed Jenkins to a five-year, $25 million contract on July 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt; In week one of the regular season, against the St. Louis Rams, Jenkins recorded two tackles and one sack.[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6819083/cullen-jenkins-philadelphia-eagles-agree-5-year-25m-deal-source-says?campaign=rss&amp;source=NFLHeadlines]&lt;/ref&gt;
