'''Bottled water''' is [[drinking water]] (e.g., [[Water well|well water]], [[distilled water]], or [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring water]]) packaged in [[Plastic bottle|plastic]] or [[Glass bottle|glass]] [[water bottles]]. Bottled water may be [[Carbonated water|carbonated]] (&quot;fizzy&quot;) or not. Sizes range from small single serving [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles to large [[carboy]]s for [[water cooler]]s.

==Global sales==
The global bottled water sales have increased dramatically over the past several decades, reaching a valuation of around $60 billion and a volume of more than {{convert|115000000|m3|USgal}} in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;King, Mike. [http://www.pr-inside.com/bottled-water-global-industry-guide-r688919.htm Bottled Water - Global Industry Guide], PR-inside.com, July 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. sales reached around 34 billion liters in 2008, a slight drop from 2007 levels &lt;ref&gt;Data from the Beverage Marketing Corporation, 2008, and [http://www.bottledandsold.org/ ''Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water'' (by Peter H. Gleick), Island Press, DC, published 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

The global rate of consumption more than quadrupled between 1990 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Ling. [http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5475 Bottled Water Consumption Jumps], Worldwatch Institute. November 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Spring water and purified tap water are currently the leading global sellers. By one estimate, approximately 50 billion bottles of water are consumed per annum in the U.S. and around 200 billion bottles globally.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Fountain On Every Corner&quot;, ''New York Times''. [http://www.aquatina.net/findafountain.html Find A Fountain], May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==
Bottled water is often stored as part of an [[emergency kit]] in case of [[natural disaster]].  Commonly, [[disaster management]] experts recommend storing {{convert|1|USgal|L|adj=on}} of water per person, per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Criticism of bottled water==
{{npov section|date=October 2011}}
===Environmental effects===
[[Image:Sparkling-bottled-water.jpg|thumb|240 px|right|New [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PETE]] bottled water]]

Bottled water has come under criticism in recent years for the environmental impacts of groundwater extraction, the energy and environmental costs of the plastic packaging and transportation costs, and concerns about water quality and the validity of some marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;Maley, Dennis, [http://www.thebradentontimes.com/news/2011/02/13/opinion/are_you_smarter_than_a_first_grader_not_if_you_re_buying_bottled_water/ ''Are You Smarter Than a First Grader? Not if You're Buying Bottled Water''], The Bradenton Times, February 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of bottled water concerns the packaging. Bottled water commonly is packaged in [[Polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), which requires a significant amount of energy to produce.&lt;ref&gt;P H Gleick and H S Cooley. 2009. &quot;Energy implications of bottled water.&quot; Environ. Res. Lett. Vol. 4 (2009). doi:10.1088/1748-9326/4/1/014009.&lt;/ref&gt; While PET is recyclable, only a fraction of plastic bottles made from PET are actually recycled{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}. For example, in the United States, according to a NAPCOR study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napcor.com/PET/pet_reports.html Recycling Rate Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; water bottles account for 50% of all the PET bottles and containers collected by curbside recycling, and the recycling rate for water bottles is 23.4%, an increase over the 2006 rate of 20.1%. European recycling rates tend to be somewhat higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bottledandsold.org/ ''Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water'' (by Peter H. Gleick), Island Press, DC, published 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, plastic used to create bottles uses an estimated 15 million barrels of oil annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Health effects===

In the United States, bottled water and tap water are regulated by different federal agencies: the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates bottled water and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulates the quality of [[tap water]]. Under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] the EPA has set maximum contaminant levels for approximately 90 contaminants that might be found in drinking water and 15 secondary maximum contaminant levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/safewater/contaminants/index.html |title=Drinking Water Contaminants &amp;#124; Drinking Water Contaminants &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, enforcement and monitoring of water quality is uneven and irregular for both tap water and bottled water. While tap water contamination incidents must be reported promptly to the public, the same is not true for bottled water, and while contamination of bottled water does occur, many instances have never received public notice until recently (see, for example, the list of more than 100 bottled water recalls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacinst.org/topics/water_and_sustainability/bottled_water/bottled_water_recalls_summary_table.pdf | title=Bottled Water Recalls | date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1950s, tap water is often treated with fluoride to prevent tooth decay. Since bottled water processed with distillation or reverse osmosis lacks [[fluoride]] [[ions]] which are present in some natural ground water, it is possible that the drinking of [[distilled water]] may increase the risk of tooth decay due to a lack of this element now added to many water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael. [http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/DentalHealth/tb/1756 Bottled Water Cited as Contributing to Cavity Comeback], MedPage Today, September 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The efficacy and safety of fluoride taken internally remain controversial, however, and some express concerns about adding it to water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/fetchArticle.action;jsessionid=F0787068E7DA57D46BBBF7D712A3209F?articleURI=info%3Adoi/10.1289/ehp.1003171. Serum Fluoride Level and Children's Intelligence Quotient in Two Villages in China.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1999 NRDC study, in which roughly 22 percent of brands were tested, at least one sample of bottled drinking water contained chemical contaminants at levels above strict state health limits. Some of the contaminants found in the study could pose health risks if consumed over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/qbw.asp NRDC: Drinking Water FAQ], March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRDC report conceded that &quot;most waters contained no detectable bacteria, however, and the levels of synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals of concern for which [they] were tested were either below detection limits or well below all applicable standards.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nrdc&quot;&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/bw/bwinx.asp Bottled Water: Pure Drink or Pure Hype?], Natural Resources Defense Council, March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a report by the Drinking Water Research Foundation found that of all samples tested by NRDC, &quot;federal FDA or EPA limits were allegedly exceeded only four times, twice for total [[Coliform bacteria|coliforms]] and twice for fluorides.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwrf.info/nrdc_bottled_water.htm#IV DWRF Analysis of the February, 1999 Natural Resources Defense Council Report on Bottled Water]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, Drinking Water Research Foundation, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, conducted by the Goethe University at Frankfurt found that a high percentage of the bottled water contained in plastic containers was polluted with estrogenic chemicals. Although some of the bottled water contained in glass were found polluted with chemicals as well, the researchers believe some of the contamination of water in the plastic containers may have come from the plastic containers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2009/03/27/Estrogenic-chemicals-in-bottled-water/UPI-85521238211685/?feature=global_water Bottled water in plastic containers contaminated from plastic containers]&lt;/ref&gt; Leaching of chemicals into the water is related to the plastic bottles being exposed to either cold and high temperatures.

===Bottled water vs carbonated beverages===
Bottled noncarbonated drinking water competes in the marketplace with carbonated beverages (including carbonated water) sold in individual plastic bottles.&lt;ref&gt;Hamermesh, Daniel. [http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/ban-water-bottles-to-reduce-pollution-come-on/ Ban Water Bottles to Reduce Pollution? Come On!], Freakonomics Blog, NYTimes.com, January 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of water often is considered a healthier substitute for sodas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/diet-nutrition/healthy-foods/a-guide-to-the-best-and-worst-drinks-8-06/cutting-down-on-liquid-calories-a-guide/0608_cutting-down-liquid-calories.htm Cutting down on liquid calories: A visual guide], ''Consumer Reports'', August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Container Recycling Institute, sales of flavored, noncarbonated drinks are expected to surpass soda sales by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Gitlitz, Jennifer and Pat Franklin. &quot;Water, Water Everywhere: The growth of non-carbonated beverages in the United States&quot;, Container Recycling Institute, February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have introduced new carbonated drinks that are fortified with vitamins and minerals, [[Diet Coke Plus]] and Tava, marketed as &quot;sparkling beverages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Andrew.

===Bottled water versus tap water===

In the United States, bottled water costs range between $0.25 and $2 per bottle, while tap water costs less than a penny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a2gov.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/public_services_water_a2h2o_FAQs_2007_12_12.pdf Bottled Water Issues Summary], Worldwatch Institute, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, according to a NRDC study, U.S. consumers paid between 240 and 10,000 times more per unit volume for bottled water than for tap water.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrdc&quot;/&gt; Typically 90 percent or more of the cost paid by bottled water consumers goes to things other than the water itself-such as bottling, packaging, shipping, marketing, retailing, other expenses, and profit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/Water/Drinking/bw/chap2.asp], NRDC, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, tap water may contain added [[fluoride]], which helps prevent tooth decay and cavities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalumandier&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lalumandier, J.A., &amp; Ayers, L.W. | title = Fluoride and bacterial content of bottled water vs tap water | journal = Archives of Family Medicine | volume = 9 | pages = 246â250 | year = 2000 | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | url = http://courses.washington.edu | doi=10.1001/archfami.9.3.246 | pmid=10728111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most bottled water manufacturers in the United States either add fluoride to their product or provide a fluoridated bottled water product.

Bottled water may have reduced amounts of copper, lead, and other metal contaminants since it does not run through the plumbing pipes where tap water is exposed to metal corrosion, however, this varies by the household and plumbing system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petraccia&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petraccia, L., Liberati, G., Masciullo S.G., Grassi, M. &amp; Fraioli, A. | title = Water, mineral waters and health | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 377â385 | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2005.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study comparing 57 bottled water samples and tap water samples, all of the tap water samples had a bacterial content under 3 CFUs/mL([[colony-forming unit]]) and the bottled water samples' bacterial content ranged from 0.01-4900 CFUs/mL. Most of the water bottle samples were under 1 CFU/mL, although there were 15 water bottle samples containing 6-4900 CFUs/mL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lalumandier&quot;/&gt; In another study comparing 25 different bottled waters, most of the samples exceeded the contaminant level set by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agencyâ|U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ]] (EPA) for mercury, thallium, and thorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ikem, A., Odueyungbo, S., Egiebor, N.O., &amp; Nyavor, K. | title = Chemical quality of bottled waters from three cities in eastern Alabama | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 285 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 165â175 | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2009-11-01 | doi = 10.1016/S0048-9697(01)00915-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In much of the developed world [[chlorine]] often is added as a disinfectant to water. If the water contains organic matter, this may produce other byproducts in the water such as [[trihalomethanes]] and [[haloacetic acids]], resulting in off-smell or taste. The level of residual chlorine found at around 0.0002&amp;nbsp;g per litre, which is too small to cause any health problems directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petraccia&quot;/&gt; The chlorine concentration recommended by [[World Health Organization]] is between 0.0005 and 0.0002 g/L.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, &quot;How to measure

The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Sierra Club]], and [[World Wildlife Fund]] have urged their supporters to consume less bottled water. Anti-bottled-water-campaigns and organizations, such as [[Corporate Accountability International]], typically argue that bottled water is no better than tap water, and emphasize the detrimental environmental side-effects of disposable plastic bottles.

The [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' demonstrated, in a 2003 episode, that in a controlled setting, those diners could not discern between bottled water and water from a garden hose behind the restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;''Bottled Water''. Penn Jillette, Teller. Bullshit!. Showtime. 2003-03-07. No. 7, season 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Church of Christ, United Church of Canada, National Council of Churches, National Coalition of American Nuns, and Presbyterians for Restoring Creation are among some of the religious organizations that have raised questions about whether or not the &quot;privatization&quot; of water is ethical. They regard the industrial purchase and repackaging at a much higher resale price of a basic resource as an unethical trend.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson, Tom. [http://www.seattlepi.com/local/312412_botwaterweb.html Thirst for bottled water may hurt environment], ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent documentary ''[[Tapped (Film)|Tapped]]'' argues against the bottled water industry, asserting that tap water is healthier, more environmentally sustainable, and more ecologically sound  than bottled water. The film focuses on the bottled water industry in the United States. The film has received largely positive reviews, and has spawned college campus groups such as [[Beyond the Bottle]].

==Bottled water in the marketplace==
The Beverage Marketing Corporation defines the bottled water market segment as &quot;retail PET, retail bulk, home and office delivery, vending, domestic sparkling and imports&quot;, but excluding &quot;flavored and enhanced water.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BMC&quot;/&gt;
The Plastics Symbol no. 7 is a recent concern worldwide on discovery that large numbers of no.7 plastics are made with Polycarbonate plastic which, experimentally were found to leach [[bisphenol A]]. This chemical is a known hormonal disruptor causing miscarriages and birth defects, according to a study conducted by Case Western Reserve scientists. âSynthetic xenoestrogens,â one of which is Bisphenol A or BPA âare linked to breast cancer and uterine cancer in women, decreased testosterone levels in men, and are particularly devastating to babies and young children. BPA has even been linked to insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes.â Responsible baby bottle industries are producing BPA-free bottles that are clearly marked.

=== Purified water vending machines ===
[[File:E8661-Pattaya-water-vending-machines.jpg|85px|thumb|Bottle-less drinking water vending machine in [[Pattaya]], Thailand. Customers bring their containers]]
A number of companies worldwide have [[vending machine]]s that dispense purified water into customer's own containers. All dispensers filter the location's tap water.  In North America, these machines are typically located outside of supermarkets.

Of all the water vending companies, Glacier Water is by far the largest.  Since its inception in 1983, Glacier Water has experienced significant growth in machine placements and has created an extensive network of approximately 17,000 water vending machines (year 2010) located throughout the United States and Canada.

===Water devices and containers available ===

Many plumbers install final purification devices into the homes and businesses of customers. Several methods of treatment are offered, ranging from carbon filtration to reverse osmosis and the degree of filtration ranges from making the tap water more palatable to removal of specific minerals and contaminants. Counter-top filtration systems also are sold in grocery and department stores that make tap water more palatable.

Similar in principle to traditional [[canteen]]s that have been used for generations, [[stainless steel]] containers for carrying one's personal water supply (drawn from the home or public supply) now are being marketed, however, they are built to resemble contemporary water bottles. Whether that is intended symbolically or as an attempt to fit so many products designed for soda cans or plastic bottles, is uncertain. Similar to glass, stainless steel has been proven as a safe container for water or food for generations because they do not leach any contaminants into its contents.

Reverse osmosis water purification systems can remove up to 90% or more of certain inorganic chemicals.  These inorganic chemicals include: fluoride, sulfate, nitrate, iron, copper, lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, silver and zinc. Reverse osmosis can even remove some microbiological contaminants, including Giardia cysts.  However unless equipped with an activated charcoal post-filter, reverse osmosis by itself does not remove dissolved gases and organic chemicals such as radon and trihalomethanes,(http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/water/az9419.pdf).

=== Bottled water service ===
[[Image:Watercooler Wikinews.jpg|thumb|85px|An office [[water cooler]] with a reusable {{convert|5|USgal|L|adj=on}} bottle]]
It is not uncommon for business or individuals to subscribe to a bottled water service. These services deliver water either monthly or weekly, sometimes even daily. Traditionally, water in glass bottles (jugs) was provided to electric coolers in areas of businesses without plumbing. Plastic containers have replaced those glass jugs, however, dispensers at businesses now may stand alongside of existing water taps or fountains.

== Bottled water by region==
===Australia===
The [[Australasian Bottled Water Institute]] is a regional member of the International Council of Bottled Water Associations. The bottled water industry in Australia is worth approximately $400 million per year,&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

An upmarket restaurant in [[Sydney]] has stopped selling bottled water and started using a machine costing A$5000 to filter, chill and carbonate tap water to get the same quality water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/restaurants-and-bars/5-for-a-glass-of-tap-water-as-owner-cries-pour-20110620-1gc1c.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bottled water ban in Bundanoon====
In 2009, the New South Wales town of [[Bundanoon]] voted to become the first town in the world to outlaw bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/09/2620882.htm Banning the bottle puts Bundy on the map]&lt;/ref&gt; Its citizens voluntarily chose to ban bottled water in response to a bottling company's desire to sell water from the town's local aquifer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/world/asia/16iht-water.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=bundanoon&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Small Australian Town Stands Up for the Tap | first=Meraiah | last=Foley | date=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initiative was proposed by local businessman Huw Kingston and carried out by the grassroots organization name ''Bundy On Tap'' (the name is a pun which refers to [[Bundaberg Rum|Bundaberg]], an Australian brand of rum which is sometimes served as a [[rum and coke|pre-mixed]] [[draught beer|draught]]). In a community meeting of 356 of the town's 2,500 residents, all but one voted in favor of the ban,&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDC133FF934A25754C0A96F9C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=BUNDANOON JOURNAL; Ban on Bottled Water, Apparently a First, Puts a Small Town on a Big Stage | first=Meraiah | last=Foley | date=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibiting the selling or dispensing of bottled water within the town precinct.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.bundyontap.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Bundanoon's six stores have removed bottled water from their stock. The town now offers public drinking fountains and filtered water dispensers where people can fill up reusable water bottles and canteens. The reusable empty bottles are sold in place of full bottles in the local stores. Bundanoon's bold stand against bottled water's damaging effects on the environment and on communities has thrust it into a global spotlight. Bundanoon has caught the attention of many other cities around the world who soon could have similar policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-bottled-water_N.htm |title=Bottled water leaves some cities with a bad taste |first=Judy |last=Keen |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |date=October 17, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to ban bottled water came partly from opposition to the proposed bottling plant, and partly from opposition to the environmental and health impacts. There is skepticism that singling out bottled water is necessarily the best option, as there is a worry that soda will be purchased more frequently in place of bottled water because of the convenience the disposable bottle offers.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

===European Union===

[[European Directive|Directive]] 2009/54/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0054:EN:NOT European Directive 2009/54/EC], June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; deals with the marketing and exploitation of natural mineral waters in the [[European Union]]. The two main types of bottled water recognized are mineral water and spring water.

Broadly speaking, &quot;mineral water&quot; is [[groundwater]] that has emerged from the ground and flowed over [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Treatment of mineral water is restricted to removal of unstable elements such as [[iron]] and [[sulfur]] compounds. Treatment for such minerals may extend only to [[filtration]] or [[decanting]] with [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]]. Free [[carbon dioxide]] may be removed only by physical methods, and the regulations for introduction (or reintroduction) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are strictly defined. Disinfection of natural mineral water is completely prohibited, including the addition of any element that is likely to change bacterial colony counts. If natural mineral water is [[effervescence (chemistry)|effervescent]], it must be labelled accordingly, depending on the origin of the carbon dioxide: naturally carbonated natural mineral water (no introduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); natural mineral water fortified with gas from the spring (reintroduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); carbonated natural mineral water (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; added following strict guidelines).

Directive 2001/83/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0083:EN:NOT Directive 2001/83/EC], November 6, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; deals with bottled water that is considered a &quot;medicinal product&quot; and is thus excluded from the scope of the other regulation.

===Lebanon===
Water is the chief natural resource of [[Lebanon]] where the porous fractured limestone of the mountains, both the [[Mount Lebanon]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon]] ranges, create an excellent aquifer that are replenished over spring and early summer by the melting snow&lt;ref&gt;http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/geology/geology-of-lebanon/&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lebanon has an advantageous position in the region as far as the amount of rainfall the country receives and water resources available where springs are abundant, due to the exceedingly âfractured geologic rocks,â and where streams amount to a length of 730 km&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries/lebanon/index.stm&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lebanon has one of the fastest growth rate of per capita consumption of bottled water&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2006/update51&lt;/ref&gt;.
