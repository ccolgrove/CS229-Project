==Men's basketball==
{{Main|Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball}}

The Ohio State men's basketball team has played in 10 NCAA [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Fours]], winning the championship in 1960, when they were led by [[Basketball Hall of Fame]]rs [[Jerry Lucas]], [[John Havlicek]], and [[Bob Knight]] off the bench. A Buckeye has been named first team [[All American]] 23 times, including five two-time All Americans and one three-time All American. Between 1960 and 1964 Ohio State won five consecutive Big Ten championships, an achievement that has yet to be matched.

In 2004, The Ohio State University fired men's basketball coach [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]] for recruiting violations and self-imposed a one year penalty, including a ban on post-season play and reduction of scholarships. In light of these University self-imposed penalties, the NCAA Division I Committee on infractions merely placed The Ohio State University on three years probation for the violations, and gave heavier penalties to Coach O'Brien and a former assistant coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = The Ohio State University and Former Men's Basketball Coaches Penalized for  Infractions | publisher = [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] | date = 2006-03-10 | url = http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2006/march/20060310_osu_infractions_rls.html | accessdate = 2006-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2011}} The lightness of this judgment was seen as encouragement for schools to be proactive in responding to violations. Nevertheless, O'Brien successfully sued Ohio State for improper termination. Thad Matta, the current coach of the Buckeyes, took over O'Brien's spot in 2004. Ohio State recruited such talents as [[Greg Oden]], and [[Mike Conley, Jr.]] to start the 2006-2007 year. The Buckeyes finished the season with a 27-3 record; won the Big Ten tournament, and earned a number 1 seed for the NCAA tournament. After a very close game with state rival Xavier, and a thrilling 20 point come from behind victory against the [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee Volunteers]], the Buckeyes managed to hold off [[Georgetown University|Georgetown Hoyas]] 67-60 to reach the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Championship Game]] for the first time since 1962, which they lost to defending NCAA champions [[University of Florida|Florida Gators]], 84-75. The Buckeyes ended the 2006-2007 season with a record of 35-4. In the 2009-2010 Season, the Buckeyes won the Big Ten Championship. In the 2010-2011 season the Buckeyes won the regular season Big Ten Championship, and the Big Ten Tournament Championship going 32-2 overall, and winning 20 straight home games, receiving honors of the #1 overall seed in the NCAA March Madness Tournament in the East Region. The Buckeyes were defeated by the [[University of Kentucky]] in the Sweet 16, 62-60.

==Women's basketball==
{{main|Ohio State Buckeyes women's basketball}}

Currently coached by Jim Foster, the [[Ohio State]] women's basketball team plays its home games in the [[Jerome Schottenstein Center]], which they moved into in 1998.  Prior to 1998, they played at [[St. John Arena]]. They have won 10 [[Big Ten]] titles, which is the most in the conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/fls/17300/pdf/wbb/guide/0708_p156to180.pdf?ATCLID=945094&amp;SPSID=89262&amp;SPID=10422&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17300|title= Big Ten Championship Teams|accessdate=2008-02-23 |pages= 172|format= PDF|work= History and Tradition|publisher= Ohio State Athletic Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have 14 appearances in the NCAA Tournament, the most recent being in 2007. In 1993 they lost to the [[Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball|Texas Tech Lady Raiders]] 84-82 for the National Title, while they captured the NIT title in 2001, beating the [[New Mexico Lobos]] 62-61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.womensnit.com/2001_postseason1.htm|title= 2001 Postseason WNIT|accessdate=2008-02-24 |work= www.womensnit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable alumni include former [[All-Americans]] [[Katie Smith]] and [[Jessica Davenport]].

==Golf==

Ohio State's two golf courses, the Scarlet and the Gray, were completed in 1938.  [[Scarlet Golf Course|The Scarlet]] was designed by architect [[Alister MacKenzie]], who designed the [[The Masters Tournament|Masters]] course at [[Augusta National]].  However, his original design was not implemented fully, and the greens were the only part of the course that truly resembled his designs.  Golf magazines annually rate the Scarlet Course as one of the top collegiate courses in the nation. The Scarlet recently underwent a $4.2 million renovation under the supervision of Jack Nicklaus.  Ohio State has won the [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]] in 1945 and 1979.  Five times, Buckeye men have won the NCAA golf individual championship: John Lorms in 1945, [[Tom Nieporte]] in 1951, Rick Jones in 1956, [[Jack Nicklaus]] in 1961 and Clark Burroughs in 1985.

==Baseball==
{{main|Ohio State Buckeyes baseball}}

Ohio State has played baseball since 1881,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/fls/17300/pdfs/OSUbaseballrecords.pdf|title=Records by Year|accessdate=2008-02-25 |format= PDF|work= History and Traditions|publisher= Ohio State Athletic Department |pages= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; winning a national championship in 1966 along with 14 Big Ten regular-season titles and eight Big Ten tournament titles.

Head coach Mary Jo Ruggieri led the team to 17 wins between 1977 and 1995, and Linda Lichter-Witter added seven more since 1996. Ohio State also has taken 61 individual honors in that span, including 11 by Karen and Sarah Josephson.

Some of the more notable Buckeye alumni include Don Perry, the first OSU All-American in the sport (Trampoline - 1954 - 4th place), brothers Seth and Noah Riskin - Co-national Champions (Parallel Bars - 1985 - 1st place), and Mike Racanelli - Ohio State's first Nissen winner in 1990. Racanelli also went on to win Gymnastic's first ''Ohio State Male Athlete of the Year'' Award that same year, given out annually to the athlete who displays the best performance in his sport (regardless of grade).

Following later in Racanelli's footsteps were other Nissen winners Kip Simons (1994), Blaine Wilson (1997) and Jamie Natalie (2001). Blaine Wilson (1995, 1996, 1997) and Jamie Natalie (2000, 2001) also went on to win ''Ohio State Male Athlete of the Year''. Raj Bhavsar was the only other Men's Gymnast to win ''Ohio State Athlete of the Year'' which he accomplished in 2002.

On the Olympic and World Championship stage, OSU Men's Gymnastics is well represented, by gymnasts and coaches. The Olympian list includes: Miles Avery (asst coach 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008), Peter Kormann (Athlete in 1976, Head Coach 1996, 2000), Raj Bhavsar (2004, 2008), Jamie Natalie (2000), Gil Pinto (1988), Kip Simons (1994) and Blaine Wilson (1996, 2000, 2004).

Two gymnasts who trained at the Ohio State facilities under coach Miles Avery, but were not NCAA Athletes due to eligibility rules, were [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]] - twin brothers from Wisconsin. Paul later went on to win the first ever Olympic Gold medal in the Men's Gymnastics All-Around competition for the United States.

In 2011, Senior co-captain, Brandon Wynn, won his second national championship on rings. Brandon Wynn, Ty Echard, Kris Done and Jeff Treleaven earned All-America honors.

==The Ohio State University Marching Band==
{{main|The Ohio State University Marching Band}}

The Ohio State University Marching Band (nicknamed &quot;The Best Damn Band In The Land&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Director Dr. Jon Woods claims, &quot;Supposedly at a pep rally one year, Woody Hayes stood up after the band played a song and said, 'That's the best damn band in the land!' That's all it took.  When Woody says something, it's law.&quot;&lt;br&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Rusty|title=From O-H-I-O to TBDBITL with the OSMB |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is currently under direction of Dr. Jon R. Woods. This all brass band has 225 members, and was first formed in 1878. The band has traditions including a [[Marching band#Field marching|field march]] that forms a &quot;Script Ohio&quot;, during which, a senior [[sousaphone]] player gets to &quot;dot the i&quot; in the word Ohio.

==School colors==
[[Image:Brutus in TX 2006.JPG|thumb|Brutus Buckeye]]
The Ohio State school colors of scarlet and gray were chosen by a committee of three students (Curtis C. Howard, Harwood R. Pool, and Alice Townshend) prior to the school's first graduation ceremony in 1878.  The committee's original recommendation was to be orange and black.  The committee soon discovered that Princeton already used the colors, however, and changed their recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Galbraith, &quot;Choosing the University Colors,&quot; The Ohio State University Monthly, Dec. 1914-Jan. 1915, pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason some references claim that Ohio State's original school colors were orange and black.  This claim is not quite accurate, in that the committee never filed the original report with that recommendation.
