:''See also: [[The Sporting News Most Valuable Player Award]] (discontinued 1946)''

This is a list of the [[Major League Baseball]] players chosen by [[The Sporting News]] (formerly ''TSN'', now ''SN'') since [[1936 in baseball|1936]] as recipients of the '''''TSN Player of the Year Award'''''. Until 1969, it was the only major award given to a single player from MLB, rather than to a player in each league. In 1969, ''[[Baseball Digest]]'' began its Player of the Year award for one player in all of MLB. In 1993, the first [[Best Major League Baseball Player ESPY Award]] was given. In 1998, the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA) began its own [[Players Choice Award#Awards for one player in all of Major League Baseball|Player of the Year]] award, for one player in all of MLB, as part of its Players Choice Awards. [[Baseball America Major League Player of the Year|''Baseball America'']] also began its Major League Player of the Year award in 1998.
