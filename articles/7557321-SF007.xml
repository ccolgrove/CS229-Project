'''Deluge''' is a [[free software]] [[cross-platform]] [[BitTorrent client]] [[graphical user interface]] written with [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[GTK+]]. The program uses [[libtorrent (Rasterbar)|libtorrent-rasterbar]] [[C++]] library for the torrent back-end (network communication) functionality through the project's official Python [[language binding|bindings]].

To help achieve this, most of its features are part of plugin modules which were written by various developers.

Starting with version 1.0, Deluge separated its [[daemon (computing)|daemon (server/core)]] from its interface, allowing users to remotely manage the application over the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.deluge-torrent.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=9875 |title=Deluge 1.0.0 - &quot;Sharks Are Bulletproof&quot; Released! |author=andar |date=September 28, 2008 |work=Deluge |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been one of the first clients to support [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]], introducing this feature with version 1.1.0 released on January 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldchangelog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svn.deluge-torrent.org/branches/1.1.0_RC/ChangeLog |title=Deluge 1.1.0_RC/ChangeLog |date=June 15, 2009 |work=Deluge |format=plain text |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portable==
A portable version for MS Windows is also offered that doesn't require installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/node/23566 |title=DelugePortable |author=sleepwalker.int |work=Deluge |publisher=PortableApps.com |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Deluge was started by two members of ubuntuforums.org, Zach Tibbitts and Alon Zakai, who previously hosted and maintained the project at [[Google Code]], but have now moved it to its own website.

In its first stages, Deluge was originally titled gTorrent, to reflect that it was targeted for the [[GNOME]] desktop environment. When the first version was released on September 25, 2006, it was renamed to Deluge due to an existing project named ''gtorrent'' on [[SourceForge]], in addition to the fact that it was finally coded to work not only on GNOME but on any platform which could support GTK+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linuxlookup.com/2006/sep/25/gtorrent_becomes_deluge_version_0_1_0_released |title=gTorrent becomes Deluge: Version 0.1.0 Released |author=Ty |date=September 26, 2006 |work=Deluge |publisher=Ubuntu Forums |accessdate=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 0.5.x release marked a complete rewrite from the 0.4.x code branch. The 0.5.x branch added support for encryption, [[peer exchange]], [[binary prefix]], and [[Universal Plug and Play|UPnP]].

Nearing the time of the 0.5.1 release, the two original developers effectively left the project, leaving Marcos &quot;markybob&quot; Pinto and Andrew &quot;andar&quot; Resch to continue Deluge's development.

Version 0.5.4.1 saw support for both [[Mac OS X]] (via [[MacPorts]]) and Windows being introduced.

Around this time, Deluge became notable for its resistance to [[Comcast#Network neutrality|Comcast's bandwidth throttling]] without a change in code, while clients like [[Vuze|Vuze (Azureus)]] and [[Î¼Torrent]] had to borrow the method implemented by Deluge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?pid=294272#p294141 |title=Re: Better encryption |author=amc1 |date=January 3, 2008 |publisher=uTorrent.com |page=4 |accessdate=December 10, 2010 |quote=If there's anyone out there willing to help - we (Azureus devs) worked with alus to see what Deluge was doing differently to avoid being throttled... we've made changes as well, but we don't have anyone to test with. So if there's anyone who belongs to one of the affected ISPs, and they're willing to spend a few minutes helping us test our changes, that'd be appreciated.}} &lt;!--This WAS stated by a developer of Vuze (Az) on a forum/IRC/something Archive a year ago, I finally dug up the exact quote. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

From version 1.1.1 through version 1.1.3, Windows installers were temporarily unavailable due to the Windows packager leaving the project.

Following 1.1.3, packages for all operating systems were no longer provided by the developers; instead, source [[Tar (file format)|tars]] and community provided packages were released.
