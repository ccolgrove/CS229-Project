'''Digital Universe''' is a free online information service founded in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Wikipedia-alternative-aims-to-be-PBS-of-the-Web/2100-1038_3-5999200.html|title=Wikipedia alternative aims to be 'PBS of the Web'|authorlink=Daniel Terdiman|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel|date=19 December 2005|work=CNET News|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to create a &quot;network of portals designed to provide high-quality information and services to the public&quot;. Subject matter experts are to be responsible for reviewing and approving content; contributors are to be both experts (researchers, scholars, educators) and the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dufoundation.org/press/press200605151.php &quot;Digital Universe Launches Experts Recruitment Program&quot;], Digital Universe Foundation press release, May 15, 2006, accessed May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was founded in 2005 by [[Joe Firmage]], CEO of [[ManyOne]], with [[Bernard Haisch]] as the president. It launched in early 2006. [[Larry Sanger]] was a director, and helped with the launch of the project's [[Encyclopedia of Earth]]. Sanger left in late 2006 to launch [[Citizendium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gDYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|title=Wikipedia's Future|last=Udell|first=Jon|date=9 January 2006|work=InfoWorld|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/jul/13/media.newmedia|title=This time, it'll be a Wikipedia written by experts|last=Moody|first=Glyn|date=13 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/life/stories/2007/04/26/1A_BLUN26.ART_ART_04-26-07_F1_IN6FBH8.html|title=Web encyclopedia won't include 'giving up'|last=Blundo|first=Joe|date=26 April 2007|work=Columbus Dispatch|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-6126469.html|title=Wikipedia co-founder plans 'expert' rival|last=Olsen|first=Stefanie|date=16 October 2006|work=CNET News|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Goals===
In December 2005, when the project was announced, the founders' goal was to create a worldwide network of researchers, scholars, and educators, to become &quot;the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] of the Web.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;/&gt;

While the public will be invited to contribute to some articles in the Digital Universe encyclopedia, they will be supervised by &quot;stewards&quot; whose role is to guarantee quality and accuracy of the articles. In addition, parts of the Digital Universe will be editable only by credentialed experts.

===Multi-tiered system===
The ''expert wiki'', is expected to be written and managed by experts.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanger-blog-du-2006&quot;&gt;[[Larry Sanger]], [http://www.dufoundation.org/blog/?p=8 &quot;The Digital Universe in 2006&quot;], Digital Universe Blog, January 20, 2006, accessed May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''public wiki'', will be editable by members of the educated public. However, according to Sanger, only registered users who have provided their [[real name]]s will be permitted to edit this wiki, unlike Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanger-blog-du-2006&quot;/&gt; According to Sanger, an article rating system will be used for articles in the public wiki.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger, [http://www.dufoundation.org/blog/?p=9 &quot;Correcting Some Misconceptions about the Digital Universe&quot;], Digital Universe Blog, January 19, 2006, accessed May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the 3-D graphical interface features will require the use of a [[Mozilla]]-based browser developed by [[ManyOne|ManyOne Networks]], which they say will be made available free of charge.

Some content will be available only to ManyOne subscribers.

===Content===
Around 2000 content pages existed as of August 2007. The Digital Universe claims the following featured portals: Earth, Energy, The Arctic, Texas Environment, U.S. Government, and [[Salton Sea]]. The Salton Sea portal for example contains the following pages: Hydrology, Biology, Limnology, Ecological Issues, Values, Geography, Alternatives, and Cultural History.

The Earth portal is working on an [[Encyclopedia of Earth]] (EoE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Earth Portal | publisher=Earthportal.net |date = January 1, 2006|author= Larry Sanger| url= http://www.earthportal.net/about/p/Author_Terms.pdf| accessdate=2006-09-21|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060710182507/http://www.earthportal.net/about/p/Author_Terms.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will focus on the [[natural environment]] and its interaction with society.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleveland&quot;&gt;Cutler Cleveland (Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of Earth), [http://news.com.com/5208-1038-0.html?forumID=1&amp;threadID=12490&amp;messageID=101336&amp;start=-1 &quot;More on the Wikipedia Alternative]&quot;, CNET [[News.com]], reader posting, January 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  It will differ from Wikipedia by limiting editing privileges to experts, by attributing all edits to their authors, by changes being published publicly only after approval and by using an expert-developed taxonomy for articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;cleveland&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;earth-faq&quot;/&gt;

EoE will use two parallel wikis, one &quot;Stewarded&quot;, one &quot;Public&quot;. The Stewarded wiki will be open only to &quot;recognized scientific authorities&quot; after their credentials have been reviewed.&lt;ref name=&quot;eoe-prospectus&quot;&gt;[http://stewards.manyone.net/hosted/portalpages/2707/eoe.html The Encyclopedia of Earth -- A Prospectus], accessed May 16, 2007 {{Wayback | url=http://stewards.manyone.net/hosted/portalpages/2707/eoe.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20071008220745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Wikipedia]], the EoE runs [[Mediawiki]] wiki software.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sanger, posting in response to [http://alex.halavais.net/?p=1341 &quot;Digital Universe and long odds&quot; by Alex Halavais], 2 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  EoE is to use the [[Creative Commons]] Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 for its license.&lt;ref name=&quot;earth-faq&quot;&gt;[http://www.earthportal.net/about/eoe/eoefaqs/ Frequently Asked Questions]&quot;, Earth Portal (dead link as of May 16, 2007; not available via archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; Over 400 articles had been written by experts by January 2006&lt;!--, but the project, coordinated by Cutler Cleveland, is waiting to produce 1,000 articles before formally launching the Earth Portal, planned for March 2006--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Art Jahnke,

In May 2006 it was reported that the EoE was due to be launched in June 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;laura-smith&quot;&gt;Laura Smith, [http://www.iwr.co.uk/information-world-review/news/2155649/digital-universe-gets-uk-uni &quot;Digital Universe gets UK uni stars&quot;], ''Information World Review News'', 9 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A July 2006 article reported that the launch would be in fall 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;merc-eoe-fall&quot;&gt;John Boundreau, [http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/15109345.htm &quot;Digital Universe Wants to Assemble 'Information You Can Trust' About Science on its Web Site&quot;], July 24, 2006, ''The Mercury News'', accessed July 24, 2006 (accessible via [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;p_theme=sj&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=headline(Universe)%20AND%20date(7/24/2006%20to%207/24/2006)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=7/24/2006%20to%207/24/2006)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=title&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Universe%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no paid archive] as of May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2007|alt=As of May 2007}}, the EoE's International Advisory Board included [[Robert Costanza]], [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]], [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] and [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/eoe/scholars International Advisory Board], Earth Portal, accessed May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Principals of the Digital Universe project include [[Joe Firmage]], [[USWeb]] founder; astrophysicist [[Bernard Haisch]], president of the Digital Universe Foundation, and [[Larry Sanger]].  On 14 March 2006, the Digital Universe Foundation announced that [[Lawrence Lessig]], Founder and Chairman of the [[Creative Commons]] Project, had joined the Digital Universe advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-14-2006/0004319554&amp;EDATE= &quot;Prof. Lawrence Lessig Appointment Underscores Digital Universe Commitment to Bring Together Renowned Experts Across Disciplines&quot;], March 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Sanger announced that he had taken a &quot;leave of absence&quot; from Digital Universe &quot;in order to set up a fully independent [[Citizendium]] Foundation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.purdue.edu/pipermail/citizendium-l/2006-September/000476.html Citizendium-l: Citizendium launch plan as of September 26], posting by Larry Sanger, September 27, 2006, to sanger-lists@citizendium.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In July 2006, the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' reported that &quot;Digital Universe, a non-profit based in [[Scotts Valley]], is part of a complicated three-organization structure. ManyOne Networks is the for-profit arm of the operation, backed with [[angel investor]]s and private investor funding that is developing the Digital Universe software. Its profits are funneled to the ManyOne Foundation, set up in Canada for tax purposes and to give the project a less U.S.-centric feel. Eventually, the foundation will acquire ManyOne Networks by buying out the investors at a fixed rate of return, Haisch said. The Digital Universe Foundation controls the content that is published online. It will issue grants to academics and researchers to produce work for the Web site. The plan is to create a self-sustainable organization through a mix of grants and revenue from premium services, such as high-resolution images and video and e-mail, with prices ranging from $7.95 to $49.95.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;merc-eoe-fall&quot;/&gt;

As of January 2006, US$10.5 million had been raised from investors and foundations for the Digital Universe project.&lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;&gt;Leslie Walker, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/18/AR2006011802251.html &quot;A Universe of Good Intentions, A World of Practical Hurdles&quot;], [[Washington Post]], January 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ManyOne Networks plans to offer premium services for $7.95 a month and to sell Internet access.&lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;/&gt; These revenues will be used in part to support the Digital Universe project. Firmage has stated that access to the basic Digital Universe content will always remain free and without advertisements.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodin&quot;&gt;Dan Goodin, [http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2006-03-05-digital-universe_x.htm?POE=TECISVA &quot;Website aims to build non-profit research storehouse&quot;], Associated Press, March 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The stewardship program and other Digital Universe activities are the responsibility of the non-profit Digital Universe Foundation, headquartered in [[Scotts Valley, California]].

==Reaction==
In January 2006, the pilot version of Digital Universe was launched. This contained approximately 50 portals.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodin&quot;/&gt;  Some visitors felt this version was confusing and difficult to navigate.&lt;ref name=&quot;walker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Langberg, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtmn/is_200601/ai_n16000849 &quot;Firmage's `Universe' needs tweaks&quot;], [[San Jose Mercury News|Mercury News]], January 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Barlow, an Assistant Professor at Kutztown University, wrote that &quot;the problem with this, from a horizontal point of view, is that important work that really should be part of the education of the individual is moved to the &quot;experts&quot; who provide the gatekeeping. A ''neterate'' person should know how to negotiate the web for accurate information without need of a guide; providing guides may only prevent people from being fully able to manage the Web for themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barlow|first=Aaron|title=Blogging America: the new public sphere|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cCdulTN1LwYC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=027599872X|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;
