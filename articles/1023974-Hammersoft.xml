'''Thomas Tomkins''' (1572 &amp;ndash; 9 June 1656) was an English composer of the late [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and early [[Stuart dynasty|Stuart]] period. In addition to being one of the prominent members of the [[English Madrigal School|English madrigal school]], he was a skilled composer of keyboard and [[consort of instruments|consort]] music, and the last member of the English [[virginalist]] school.

==Life==
Tomkins was born in [[St David's]] in [[Pembrokeshire]] in 1572. His father, also Thomas, who had moved there in 1565 from the family home of [[Lostwithiel]] in Cornwall,&lt;ref&gt;Boden 2005, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Lay clerk|vicar choral]] of [[St David's Cathedral]] and [[organ (music)|organist]] there. Three of Thomas junior's half-brothers, John, Giles and Robert, also became eminent musicians, but none quite attained the fame of Thomas. By 1594, but possibly as early as 1586, Thomas and his family had moved to [[Gloucester]], where his father was employed as a minor canon at the [[Gloucester Cathedral|cathedral]]. Thomas almost certainly studied under [[William Byrd]] for a time, for one of his songs&lt;ref&gt;''Too much I once lamented'' (1622)&lt;/ref&gt; bears the inscription: ''To my ancient, and much reverenced Master, William Byrd'', and it may have been at this period of his career, since Byrd leased property at Longney, near Gloucester. Although documentary proof is lacking, it is also possible that Byrd was instrumental in finding young Thomas a place as chorister in the [[Chapel Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Boden 2005, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, all former Chapel Royal choristers were required to be found a place at university, and Tomkins was affiliated to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] in 1607.

But already in 1596 he had been appointed organist and master of the choristers at [[Worcester Cathedral]]. The next year he married Alice Patrick, a widow nine years his senior, whose husband Nathaniel, who died in 1595, had been Tomkins' predecessor at Worcester. Thomas's only son, Nathaniel, was born in Worcester in 1599, where he was to spend the rest of his life and become a respected musician.

Tomkins was doubtless acquainted with [[Thomas Morley]], also a pupil of Byrd's, for his signed copy of Morley's publication ''Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke'' (1597) has been preserved, together with Thomas's many annotations;&lt;ref&gt;Magdalen College Library, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1601 Morley included one of Tomkins' madrigals in his important collection ''[[The Triumphs of Oriana]]''.

In 1612 Tomkins oversaw the construction in Worcester cathedral of a magnificent new organ by [[Thomas Dallam]], the foremost organ-builder of the day. He continued writing verse anthems, and his collection of 28 madrigals, the ''Songs of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts'' was finally published in 1622 with a dedicatory poem by his half-brother John Tomkins (circa 1587-1638), now organist of [[King's College, Cambridge]] (later of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and of the Chapel Royal), with whom Thomas maintained an intimate and loving relationship.

Probably by about 1603 Thomas was appointed a Gentleman Extraordinary of the Chapel Royal. This was an honorary post, but in 1621 he became a Gentleman Ordinary and organist under his friend and senior organist, [[Orlando Gibbons]]. The duties connected with this post included regular journeys between Worcester and London, which Tomkins performed until about 1639.&lt;ref&gt;Boden 2005 p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.thomastomkins.org.uk/page06_biography.htm#Tomkins]

On [[James I of England|James I's]] death in March 1625 Tomkins, with other Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal, was required to attend to both the music for James's [[funeral]] and that for the [[coronation]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. These monumental tasks proved too much for Gibbons, who died of a stroke in [[Canterbury]], where Charles was supposed to meet his future bride, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], placing an even greater strain on Tomkins. Because of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the coronation was luckily postponed until February 1626, giving Tomkins time to compose most of the eight anthems sung at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Boden 2005, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1628 Tomkins was named &quot;Composer of [the King's] Music in ordinary&quot; at an annual salary of Â£40, succeeding [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]] who died in March that year. But this prestigious post, the highest honour available to an English musician, was quickly revoked on the grounds that it had been promised to Ferrabosco's son. This shabby treatment was to be only the first of a series of adversities that overtook the composer for last fourteen years of his life. He continued, however, to perform his dual duties at Worcester and London until 1639.

Tomkins' devoted wife Alice died in 1642, the year [[English Civil War#The First English Civil War|civil war]] broke out. Worcester was one of the first casualties: the cathedral was desecrated, and Tomkins' organ badly damaged by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. The following year Tomkins' house near the cathedral suffered a direct hit by [[cannon]] shot, making it uninhabitable for a long period, and destroying most of his household goods and probably a number of his musical [[manuscript]]s. About this time Tomkins married his second wife Martha Browne, widow of a Worcester Cathedral [[lay clerk]]. 

Further conflict and a siege in 1646 caused untold damage to the city. With the choir disbanded and the cathedral closed, Tomkins turned his genius to the composition of some of his finest keyboard and consort music; in 1647, a belated ''tombeau'' or tribute to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and a further one to the memory of [[William Laud]], Archbishop of Canterbury, both beheaded in 1641, and both admired by Tomkins. Charles I was executed in 1649, and a few days later Tomkins, always a royalist, composed his superb ''Sad Pavan: for these distracted times''. His second wife Martha died around 1653, and deprived of his living, Tomkins, now 81, was in serious financial difficulties. In 1654 his son Nathaniel married Isabella Folliott, a wealthy widow, and Thomas went to live with them in [[Martin Hussingtree]], some four miles from Worcester. He expressed his gratitude by composing his ''Galliard, The Lady Folliot's'' in her honour. Two years later he died and was buried in the churchyard of Martin Hussingtree on 9 June 1656.

==Works==
Tomkins wrote [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s, keyboard music, [[consort of instruments|consort]] music, [[anthem]]s, and [[Service (music)|liturgical music]].  Stylistically he was extremely conservative, even anachronistic: he seems to have completely ignored the rising [[Baroque music|Baroque]] practice around him, with its Italian-inspired idioms, and he also avoided writing in most of the popular forms of the time, such as the [[lute song]], or [[Air (music)|ayre]]. His [[polyphony|polyphonic]] language, even in the fourth decade of the 17th century, was frankly that of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. Some of his madrigals are extremely expressive, with text-painting and [[chromaticism]] worthy of Italian madrigalists such as [[Luca Marenzio|Marenzio]] or [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]].

He was also a prolific composer of verse anthems, writing more than any other English composer of the 17th century except for [[William Child]].  These pieces were highly regarded at the time, and are well-represented in contemporary manuscript collections. Fortunately for the survival of his music, his son Nathaniel edited most of it and published a huge collection of it (titled ''Musica Deo sacra et ecclesiae Anglicanae; or Music dedicated to the Honor and Service of God, and to the Use of Cathedral and other Churches of England'') in 1668, after his death; much of it otherwise would have been lost during the Civil War.
