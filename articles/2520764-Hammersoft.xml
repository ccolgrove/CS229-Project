__NOTOC__
Beginning in April 2004, members of the [[Iraqi insurgency]] began taking foreign civilian [[hostage]]s in [[Iraq]]. Since then, they have [[kidnap]]ped more than 200 foreigners and thousands of [[Iraqis]]; among them, dozens of foreign hostages have been killed. [[Nepal]] (with 12) and the [[United States]] (with 11) rank the highest of hostages killed in Iraq. [[China]] ranks the highest (with 15) of hostages freed in Iraq followed by [[Pakistan]] (with 13) and [[Egypt]] (with 10).

There are many motives behind these kidnappings.  They include:
* influencing foreign governments with troops in Iraq
* influencing foreign companies with workers in Iraq
* [[ransom]] money
* discouraging travel to Iraq

In 2004, executions of captives were often filmed, and many were [[decapitation|beheaded]].  However, the number of the recorded killings decreased significantly. Many hostages remain missing with no clue as to their whereabouts. The [[United States Department of State]] [[Hostage Working Group]] was organized by the [[U.S. Embassy, Baghdad]], in the summer of 2004 to monitor foreign hostages in Iraq.

The following is a list of known civilian foreign hostages in Iraq.
