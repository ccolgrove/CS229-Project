The '''raised fist''' (also known as the '''clenched fist''') is a [[symbol]] of [[Social solidarity|solidarity]] and support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/02/22/every-movement-needs-a-symbol-enter-the-wisconsin-fist-of-solidarity/ Every Movement Needs a Symbol: Enter The Wisconsin Fist of Solidarity]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as a [[salute]] to express unity, strength, defiance, or [[Resistance movement|resistance]]. The salute dates back to ancient [[Assyria]] as a symbol of resistance in the face of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samgraysociety.org/sgray/fist.html The Samuel Gray Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Assyrian depictions of the goddess [[Ishtar]] show her raising a clenched fist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samgraysociety.org/sgray/fist.html&lt;/ref&gt; A raised fist was used as a [[logo]] by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L. Kornbluh, Solidarity, 1917; Rebel Voices: An IWW Anthology, Charles H. Kerr Publishing, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; in 1917. The graphic symbol was popularized in 1948 by [[Taller de GrÃ¡fica Popular]], a print shop in [[Mexico]] that used art to advance revolutionary social causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html Mexican posters on social and educational themes]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol has been picked up and incorporated around the world by various groups fighting [[oppression]].

The raised fist logo may represent unity or solidarity, generally with oppressed peoples. The '''black fist''', also known as the '''[[Black Power]] fist''' is a logo generally associated with [[black nationalism]] and sometimes [[socialism]]. Its most widely-known usage is by the [[Black Panther Party]] in the 1960s. A black fist logo was also adopted by the [[northern soul]] music [[subculture]]. The '''white fist''', also known as the '''Aryan fist''' or the '''[[White Supremacy|White Power]] fist''' is a logo generally associated with [[white nationalism]]. 

A white fist holding a red rose is used by the [[Socialist International]] and some socialist or [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] in [[Northern Ireland]] occasionally use a clenched fist on [[Northern Irish murals|murals]] depicting the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]. However, this is considered rare; the red hand is usually depicted with a flat palm.

==Salute==
The raised fist salute consists of raising one arm in the air with a clenched fist. Different movements sometimes use different terms to describe the raised fist salute: amongst communists and socialists, it is sometimes called the '''red salute''', whereas amongst [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|black rights activists]], especially in the [[United States of America]] it has been called the '''[[Black Power]] salute'''. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], it was sometimes known as the '''[[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] salute'''.
The traditional version of the salute, originally a symbol of the broader workers' movement, became associated with the parties of the [[Comintern]] during the 1920s and 1930s. Since the [[Trotskyist]]s were forced out of the Comintern, some Trotskyists have made a point of strictly raising the left fist in the tradition of the [[Left Opposition]]. Some anarchists also prefer the left fist to denote their [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] opposition to Marxism.

The clenched fist gesture is sometimes mistakenly thought to have originated in the [[Spanish Civil War]], where the Popular Front salute was at one time the standard salute of Republican forces. A letter from the Spanish Civil War stated: &quot;...the raised fist which greets you in Salud is not just a gestureâit means life and liberty being fought for and a greeting of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, Mary. Letter to Leo Hurwitz and Janey Dudley, 25 November 1938. Reprinted in Cary Nelson and Jefferson Hendricks, eds. &quot;Madrid 1937: Letters of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade from the Spanish Civil War,&quot; Routledge: 1996. Reprinted online [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/scw/letters.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], medal winners [[John Carlos]] and [[Tommie Smith]] [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|gave the raised fist salute]] during the [[United States|American]] [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] as a sign of black power, and as a protest on behalf of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. For this, they were banned from further Olympic activities. The event was one of the most overtly political statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2393575,00.html | publisher=[[The Sunday Times]] | last=Lewis | first=Richard | date=2006-10-08 | title=Caught in Time: Black Power salute, Mexico, 1968 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the history of the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Tommie Smith stated in his autobiography, &quot;Silent Gesture&quot;, that the salute was not a Black Power salute, but in fact a [[human rights]] salute.

A raised White fist is also a popular [[White Power]] symbol. The [[RotfrontkÃ¤mpferbund]] [[paramilitary]] organization of [[Communist Party of Germany]] used the salute before [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Korff, Gottfried: &quot;Symbolgeschichte als Sozialgeschichte? Zehn vorlÃ¤ufige Notizen zu den Bild- und Zeichensystemen sozialer Bewegungen in Deutschland&quot;, in: Warneken, Bernd JÃ¼rgen (Hg.): &quot;Massenmedium Strasse. Zur Kulturgeschichte der Demonstrationen.&quot; Frakfurt/Main 1991. S. 27-28. Cited in: Schulte-Rummel, Sven &quot;Die politische Symbolik der Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands in der Weimarer Republlik&quot; [http://www.hausarbeiten.de/faecher/vorschau/95026.html].
&quot;Im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Symbolen der Kommunisten beginnt die Geschichte der geballten Faust in der Ãra der Weimarer Republik. Sie war prÃ¤gendes Symbol bei StraÃenaufmÃ¤rschen, Spiegel der gewaltbereiten Demonstranten, die voller Frust Ã¼ber das System dem Staat die geballte Faust zeigten.&quot; Translation: &quot;Unlikely the most of other Communists symbols, the history of Raised fist started in the era of Weimar Republic. It was a definitive symbol of street marches, reflection of the marchers who were ready for violence, who were disappointed by the whole system of the state and showed their clenched fists to it.&quot;
