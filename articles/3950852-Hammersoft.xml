'''Winter Sports in Australia''' encompasses a great variety of activities across the [[continent of Australia]], including [[winter sports]] played in snow and ice. Climate varies considerably from the tropical North to temperate South in Australia, and sporting practices vary accordingly. Ice and snow sports like [[Skiing in Australia]] are conducted in the high country of the [[Australian Alps]] and [[Tasmanian Wilderness]]. Australia has relatively low mountain ranges, but a long history of participation in recreational skiing (since the 1860s) and the [[Winter Olympic Games]] (since 1936). Australians have won olympic gold in ice skating, skiing and snow-boarding events. Australia's generally flat geography and usually mild winter climate otherwise provide ideal conditions for international non-snow/ice winter sports and team games like [[Rugby Union Football]], [[Rugby League Football]] and [[Association Football]] (Soccer), which are all popular sports during the Australian winter and in which Australia has enjoyed considerable international success. [[Australian Rules Football]] is a home-grown winter football code with a wide following throughout Australia. Many other sports are also played or watched in Australia through the winter season.

====Alpine Skiing====
{{Main|Skiing in Australia}}

During the [[Southern Hemisphere]] winter, snow skiing and snow boarding takes place in the high country of the [[States and territories of Australia|states]] of  [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], and cross-country skiing is also possible in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

[[New South Wales]] is home to Australia's highest snow country, oldest skifields and largest resorts. The highest peak in New South Wales is [[Mount Kosciusko]], at 2200m. Victoria is the State with the greatest number of ski resorts in Australia. The highest peak in Victoria is [[Mount Bogong]] at 1986m.&lt;ref name=&quot;ga.gov.au&quot;&gt;http://www.ga.gov.au/education/geoscience-basics/landforms/highest-mountains.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; The most northerly ski fields in Australia are located in the [[Australian Capital Territory|A.C.T.]] - in the [[Brindabella Ranges]] which rise to the west of [[Canberra]], the capital city of Australia, and include the [[Namadgi National Park]] in the A.C.T. and [[Bimberi Nature Reserve]] and [[Brindabella National Park]] in [[New South Wales]]. The highest mountain in the ACT is [[Bimberi Peak]], which lies above the treeline at 1912 metres, at the northern edge of the [[Snowy Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ga.gov.au&quot;/&gt; The most southerly ski fields in Australia are located in [[Tasmania]], a mountainous island off the southern coast of Eastern Australia. Much of the State is subject to at least occasional winter snows. [[Mount Ossa (Tasmania)|Mount Ossa]] is the highest point on the island at 1614m but Tasmania has eight [[Highest mountains of Tasmania|mountains]] exceeding 1500m and 28 above 1,220m. Also notable is the Central Plateau, at an elevation of around 900m. The capital city of [[Hobart]] is built at the base of [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]], which at 1270m is snow capped in winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;abs.gov.au&quot;&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/876720A0621CD8E5CA25710E00756155?opendocument#&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skiing began in Australia at the [[goldrush]] town of [[Kiandra, New South Wales]] around 1861. The [[Kiandra snow shoe club]] founded around that time (now called the ''Kiandra Pioneer Ski Club (1861)'') remains the world's first identifiable and ceaseless Ski Club.&lt;ref name=&quot;members.ozemail.com.au&quot;&gt;http://members.ozemail.com.au/~sealark/skiing_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Club held separate ski races for both ladies and children as early as 1885. In 1908 the club held the first ever documented International and Intercontinental Downhill Skiing Carnival. Results- America 1st, Australia 2nd, England 3rd.&lt;ref&gt;The Melbourne Argus, 6 July 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Kosciuszko Chalet was built at [[Charlotte Pass]] in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charlottepass.com.au/chalet.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Australian ski tow was constructed near [[Mount Buffalo]], Victoria in 1936.   It was the construction of the vast [[Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme]] from 1949 that really opened up the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of [[Thredbo]], [[Perisher Ski Resort|Perisher]] and [[Guthega]] as leading Australian resorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;thredbo.com.au&quot;&gt;http://www.thredbo.com.au/about-thredbo/history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perisherblue.com.au&quot;&gt;http://www.perisherblue.com.au/winter/info/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australian skiers competed in the [[Winter Olympics]] for the first time in [[1952 Winter Olympics|Oslo 1952]] and have competed in all subsequent Games, winning medals at every Games since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;http://www.olympics.com.au/australian-team/aus-at-the-winter-olympics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Milne]] became the first non-European to win a ski race world cup in 1969 and Olympic medalists include [[Zali Steggall]], [[Alisa Camplin]] and [[Dale Begg-Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Australia]] has extensive skiable terrain during the southern hemisphere winter in the south eastern [[States and territories of Australia|states]] and [[Australian Capital Territory]], between elevations of around 1250m to 2200m. Elevation of the snowfields in Australia varies with latitude, however viable winter snows are generally found above 1500m: Thredbo, near [[mount Kosciuszko]], has Australia's highest lifted point at 2037m and its base elevation is 1365m. Kiandra, in the Northern Skifields, has an elevation of 1400m, while [[Mount Mawson]] near [[Hobart, Tasmania]] is at 1250m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A number of well serviced resorts have been developed, including: [[Thredbo]], [[Perisher Ski Resort|Perisher]], [[Charlotte Pass]] and [[Selwyn Snowfields]] in New South Wales; [[Mount Buller]], [[Falls Creek]], [[Mount Hotham]], [[Mount Baw Baw]] and [[Mount Buffalo]] in Victoria; as well as the small resorts of [[Ben Lomond, Tasmania|Ben Lomond]] and [[Mount Mawson]] in Tasmania.  [[Cross country skiing]] is popular in such national parks as [[Kosciuszko National Park]] and [[Alpine National Park]] and is also possible within [[Namadgi National Park]] and in the [[Tasmanian Wilderness]]. 

The [[Australian Alps]] are within driving range for weekend trips for residents of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Canberra]], while Tasmanian ski slopes are within day trip range for residents of the state.  

In 2004, a mogul course called &quot;Toppa's Dream&quot; was constructed on [[Blue Cow, New South Wales|Blue Cow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AlphaShortBumpy&quot;&gt;Alpha Magazine: &quot;The Short and Bumpy Road&quot; February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mount Buller]] World Aerials is an annual event, the first on the World Cup calendar. Aerial skiers practice extensively on water before trying jumps on snow, and Camplin practised jumps in a pond in [[Wandin, Victoria|Wandin]] (one hour's drive from Melbourne).&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsCamplin2&quot;&gt;[[Sports Illustrated]]: [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/news/2002/02/18/murphy_camplin/ She comes from the land Down Under: Aussie aerialist Camplin captures gold in dramatic fashion] 18 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kangaroo Hoppet]], a member of the [[Worldloppet Ski Federation]] series of cross-country skiing races, is an annual citizen race that attracts competitors from several countries. [[Ski jumping]] is currently non-existent in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;skijumpeast&quot;&gt;[http://www.skijumpeast.com/masters/imcr2005.htm 2005 International Masters Ski Jumping Championships] report. Retrieved 2 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only Australian [[Biathlon]] training course is located at [[Dinner Plain, Victoria]] near [[Mount Hotham]].

====Cross country and back country skiing====
[[File:Towards Kosciuszko from Kangaroo Ridge in winter.jpg|thumb|The  [[Main Range (Snowy Mountains)|Kosciuszko Main Range]].]]
[[File:CradleMountain.jpg|thumb|[[Cradle Mountain]] in Tasmania's UNESCO World Heritage Wilderness Area]]

The [[Main Range (Snowy Mountains)|Kosciuszko Main Range]] in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales offer some of the most challenging cross-country and back-country skiing in Australia, notably [[Watsons Crags]] and [[Mount Twynam]] on the steep Western Face of the Range.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozbc.net/nsw_crags.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ozbc.net/nsw_twynamwest.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mount Jagungal]] wilderness area provides some of the most isolated back-country ski terrain. High country huts, often a legacy of the era of cattle grazing in the mountains, provide emergency shelter in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosciuszkohuts.org.au/thehuts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dedicated Cross Country ski resorts are located at [[Lake Mountain]], [[Mount Stirling]] and [[Mount Saint Gwinear]] in Victoria and popular areas for back country skiing and ski touring in the [[Alpine National Park]], [[Yarra Ranges National Park]] and the [[Baw Baw National Park]] include: [[Mount Bogong]], [[Mount Feathertop]], [[Bogong High Plains]], [[Mount Howitt]], Mount Reynard and Snowy Plains. The [[Kangaroo Hoppet]] is a leg of the Worldloppet cross-country race series which is conducted  on the last Saturday of August each year, hosted by [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] in Victoria. The showpiece 42-kilometre race  attracts thousands of spectators and competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;smh.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/50-reasons-to-love-australian-snow-20090603-bv3f.html?page=-1 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=50 reasons to love Australian snow | first1=Robert | last1=Upe | first2=Jim | last2=Darby | first3=Russell | last3=Holt | first4=Susan | last4=Bredow | date=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross country skiing can be possible in the [[Brindabella Ranges]] which rise to the west of [[Canberra]], in the A.C.T, and include the [[Namadgi National Park]] and [[Bimberi Nature Reserve]]. [[Mount Franklin, Australian Capital Territory|Mount Franklin Chalet]], built in 1938, in the A.C.T. played a pioneering role in providing lifted ski runs in Australia, however the chalet was converted to a museum and subsequently destroyed by fire in 2003, so today only cross country skiing can be practised in the area (when conditions allow).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/act/content/2003/s826091.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Cross Country skiing is also practised at [[Mount Gingera]], elevation 1855m, a prominent snow covered peak above the city of Canberra.&lt;ref name=&quot;australia.com&quot;&gt;http://www.australia.com/destinations/icons/namadgi.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;INSTRUMENT NO. 111 OF 1999 ACT Legislation&lt;/ref&gt;

When conditions allow, Australia's rugged island State of Tasmania also offers cross country skiers some scenic terrain - notably in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] area around [[Cradle Mountain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;parks.tas.gov.au&quot;&gt;http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/index.aspx?base=391&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmania has 28 mountains above 1,220m and much of the island is subject to at least occasional winter snow.&lt;ref name=&quot;abs.gov.au&quot;/&gt; 

The Australian High Country is populated by unique flora and fauna including [[wombats]], [[Wallaby|wallabies]], [[echidnas]], and the [[Snow Gum]][http://www.smh.com.au/travel/50-reasons-to-love-australian-snow-20090603-bv3f.html?page=-1]. The Alpine regions are subject to environmental protection, which has limited the scope of commercial development of skiiable terrain,&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Kosciuszko National Park: Contemporary Management&quot;. New South Wales Department of Education and Training, Riverina Environmental Education Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; however Australia has extensive [[cross country skiing]] terrain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoppet.com.au/xc/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australia.com/destinations/icons/alps.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Snow boarding ====
[[File:Torah Bright.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Torah Bright]] of [[Cooma|Cooma, NSW]], the winner of the women's halfpipe snowboarding at the 2010 Winter Olympics.]]

The sport of [[snowboarding]] is also popular in the Australian skifields and Australia has been represented at the Olympics in this sport ever since it debuted at [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympics.com.au/sports/snowboard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Torah Bright]], of the [[Snowy Mountains]] town of [[Cooma]], New South Wales, won gold for Australia at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010 in the women's [[snowboard halfpipe]] event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympics.com.au/news/bright-lands-golden-run&lt;/ref&gt; Bright's gold medal - combined with the gold and silver skiing event medals - made 2010 Australia's most successful winter Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympics.com.au/news/australia-records-best-ever-winter-games&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ice sports ===
Many major Australian cities have indoor [[ice rink]]s, enabling participation in some winter sports regardless of the city's climate - for example, subtropical [[Brisbane]] is a major short track speed skating hub for Australia. Sydney hosted the 1991 short track speed skating World Championships (in which Australia won the men's relay event), and the 2001 [[Goodwill Games]], hosted in Brisbane, included figure skating. &lt;!-- http://www.goodwillgames.com/2001/2001_figure_skating.htm --&gt; The [[Duke Trophy]] hosted annually by the [[Australian Amateur Ice Racing Council]] encourages interstate competition in short track speed skating. 

Short-track speedskater [[Steven Bradbury]] won the 1,000&amp;nbsp;m event at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. He was the first Australian to win a Winter Olympic gold medal and was also part of the short track relay team that won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal (a bronze in 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/winterolympics2002/hi/english/skating/newsid_1826000/1826962.stm | work=BBC News | title=Australia salutes Bradbury | date=18 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curling facilities are limited in Australia. There are insufficient curling rocks in Sydney for a game,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun&quot;&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Curling/Worlds/2007/03/22/3805160-sun.html Who in the world is...Hugh Millikin]&lt;/ref&gt; while curling occurs on an unsuitable surface in Melbourne &lt;ref name=&quot;theage&quot;&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/02/28/1014704980916.html Forever skating on thin ice]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also played in Brisbane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qld&quot;&gt;[http://www.qldcurling.com/ Queensland Curling]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- to do: find a secondary source about curling in Brisbane --&gt;

Ice Hockey is played in many major cities in Australia, with the NHL affiliated [[Australian Ice Hockey League]].

=== Sliding sports ===
Australia lacks any bobsleigh tracks (used for bobsleigh, luge and skeleton), but there is a bobsleigh push track in the [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]] area in Melbourne.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsfactorAlstergren&quot;&gt;[http://www.ausport.gov.au/fulltext/2002/sportsf/s488161.asp The Sports Factor - interview with Will Alstergren]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia at the Winter Olympics===
{{main|Australia at the Winter Olympics|Australia at the Winter Paralympics}}
Australia first competed in the [[Winter Olympic Games]] in 1936 and has taken part in every Winter Olympics since 1952. It won its first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze, in 1994, and became the only southern hemisphere country to win Winter Olympic gold in 2002. Australia has competed in every Winter [[Paralympic Games]], and has won medals at every Winter Paralympics since 1992.

== Sports played in winter ==
[[File:Mcg football.jpg|thumb|left|A sold out [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] crowd during the [[Australian Rules Football]] (AFL) Grand Final Day of 2007.]]

Australia's mild winters mean that in most parts of Australia, regular outdoor sports can be played all year, and indeed more vigorous sports are more comfortably played in winter.  [[Australian rules football]] and [[rugby league]], the two most popular spectator sports in Australia, are played primarily in winter.  See [[Sport in Australia]].  

[[File:Australia national rugby league team (8 May 2009, Brisbane).jpg|200px|thumb|Australia's National Rugby League Team, Brisbane 2009.]]

Reports of [[rugby union]] being played in Australia date back to the 1820s, with local clubs established by the 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugby.com.au&quot;/&gt; The game has been especially popular as a winter sport in [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The [[Australian national rugby union team]] is called the Wallabies. Since the 1920s the Wallabies have worn green and gold jerseys.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugby.com.au&quot;/&gt; Despite having a relatively small player base, mainly in NSW and Queensland, the national side has twice won the [[Rugby World Cup]] &amp;ndash; in 1991 and 1999.  Australia hosted the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], which saw the Wallabies defeated by [[England national rugby union team|England]] in the final at [[Telstra Stadium]]. Other notable competitions include the annual [[Bledisloe Cup]] played against Australia's traditional rivals, the [[New Zealand All Blacks]] since 1931, and the [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri-Nations]] competition involving [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and New Zealand. Australia has produced a number of notable rugby players of national stature, including Sir [[Edward Dunlop]], [[Mark Ella]] (one of the first indigenous Australians to captain a national side) and the prolific try scorer [[David Campese]].

In 1908, [[rugby league]] was established in Australia by former [[rugby union]] players and supporters as a breakaway professional code. The new code gained and has maintained a wider following in Australia than rugby union, which remained amateur until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugby.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby.com.au/about_the_aru/history_of_the_aru/history_of_the_aru,183.html#Rugby%20first%20kicks%20off%20in%20Australia |title=History of the ARU |publisher=rugby.com.au |date=25 November 1949 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has traditionally been seen as a &quot;working man's sport&quot; with its roots in the working class communities of the northern English counties of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] translating to similar areas of [[Western Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]]. Rugby league is the most popular winter sport in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The elite club competition is the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, three teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The season culminates in the premiership deciding game, the NRL [[Grand Final]], traditionally one of Australia's most popular sporting events and one of the largest club championship matches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The New South Wales [[New South Wales rugby league team|Blues]] and Queensland [[Queensland rugby league team|Maroons]] play a representative series against each other every year, called the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] series, which is one of Australia's major sporting events. In addition, the [[Australian Kangaroos]] represent the country in international matches. Since its inception in 1954, the Australian team has dominated the [[Rugby League World Cup]], having won the competition nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/world_cup_2000/969083.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; RUGBY LEAGUE WORLD CUP 2000 &amp;#124; WORLD CUP 2000 &amp;#124; World Cup history: 1954-92 |publisher=BBC News |date=17 October 2000 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australian rules football]] (usually called &quot;Aussie rules&quot; or &quot;AFL&quot;) is a popular spectator sport and a participation sport in all Australian states and territories, though its core support lies in four of the six states; [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. The national competition, the [[Australian Football League]], evolved from a Victorian state competition.  The [[AFL Grand Final]] is traditionally played each year at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. [[Australian rules football culture]] has a strong set of rituals and traditions, many of which have crossed sporting boundaries in Australia.

[[Soccer]] is a high participation football code, with both boys and girls at junior level as well with men and women at senior level. A number of major international stars have played for the national team in recent years including [[Tim Cahill]], [[Mark Viduka]], [[Mark Schwarzer]] and [[Harry Kewell]]. Australia's national team, the [[Socceroos]], as of 2010 has competed at three [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The Australian Government sought to host the event, the world's most watched sporting event, in either [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] or [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] but the bid failed.

[[Polocrosse]] is an equine team sport that was developed in [[New South Wales]] before the [[Second World War]]. This sport is now played by men, women and juniors in many parts of the world.
