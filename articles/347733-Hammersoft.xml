'''The University of Newcastle''' ('''UoN''') is an [[Public university#Australia|Australian public university]] that was established in 1965. The University's main and largest campus is located in [[Callaghan, New South Wales|Callaghan]], a suburb of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in [[New South Wales]]. The University also has campuses in [[Ourimbah, New South Wales|Ourimbah]], [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales|Port Macquarie]], [[Singapore]] and [[Sydney CBD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/location|title=Locations|publisher=The University of Newcastle|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has enrolled approximately 15,256 full-time students and 15,080 part-time students (including more than 23,948 undergraduates). 

Historically, the [[University of Newcastle Medical School]] has implemented the [[Problem-based learning]] system for its undergraduate [[Bachelor of Medicine]] programme - a system later mandated for use by the [[Australian Medical Council]] throughout Australia. It was also the university that introduced [[Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test]] (UMAT) in the early 1990s. UMAT has since been accepted widely by different medical schools across Australian as an additional selection criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umat.acer.edu.au/documents/UVSExecutive%20Summary.pdf|title=UMAT: A Validity Study |publisher=Australian Council for Educational Research|accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Newcastle is a member of [[Innovative Research Universities Australia]] (IRU Australia).

== History ==
The origins of the University of Newcastle can be traced back to the establishment of the Newcastle University College at the Newcastle Technical College site on 3 December 1951.&lt;ref name=goa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivesoutside.records.nsw.gov.au/grant-of-arms-the-university-of-newcastles-declaration-of-independence|title=Grant of Arms â The University of Newcastleâs Declaration of Independence|work=Archives Outside|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]]|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was established under the authority of the then University of Technology New South Wales, which is now known as the [[University of New South Wales]]. At the time of its establishment the Newcastle University College had just five full-time students and study was restricted to engineering, mathematics and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcastle.edu.au/about/history.html|title=History|publisher=The University of Newcastle|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The university became autonomous through the University of Newcastle Act 1964 (NSW) which constituted the university on 1 January 1965 through a Proclamation of His Excellency the [[Governor of New South Wales]]. A document known as the Universityâs Grant of Arms is cited as being its very own Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref name=goa/&gt;

Each year the Universityâs student body celebrates autonomy day on 1 July. According to unverified sources the official autonomy of the University began on 1 January 1965 with a âsymbolic ceremonial bonfire held at the site of the Great Hallâ.&lt;ref name=goa/&gt; This celebration is said to have been officiated by Professor Godfrey Tanner who is said to have poured wine libations onto the ground as to âsanctify the land upon which the University restsâ.&lt;ref name=goa/&gt; Since the university technically became autonomous on 1 January 1965 autonomy day should be held on 1 January. The 1 July actually coincided with the University of Technology New South Walesâs autonomy from the Public Service Boardâs authority on 1 July 1954.&lt;ref name=goa/&gt; According to Don Wright, students interpreted Autonomy Day as celebrating the autonomy of the University of Newcastle from the University of New South Wales. The students were entitled to give the celebration whatever meaning they chose. The fact that they called it âautonomy dayâ heightened the studentsâ sense of the importance of autonomy and their need to defend it against outside interference.&lt;ref&gt;Looking back, a history of the University of Newcastle, Don Wright, 1992):113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the University established a partnership with the Institut Wira, a Malaysian private business school. In 2002, Ian Firms, a lecturer, failed a large number of student papers from Wira for [[academic dishonesty]], but his actions were reversed by the Newcastle administration and he was discharged. He then appealed to the New South Wales [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]], which made a finding of corruption against Dr Paul Ryder, a failure by Vice Chancellor Roger Holmes in the execution of his duty and recommended disciplining the Deputy Vice Chancellor, Professor Brian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icac.nsw.gov.au/documents/doc_download/3361-report-on-investigation-into-the-university-of-newcastles-handling-of-plagiarism-allegations-operation-orion-30-june-2005|title=Report on investigation into the University of Newcastleâs handling of plagiarism allegations|format=PDF|publisher=[[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]]|date=June 2005|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v52/i08/08a03901.htm|title=A Tarnished Reputation|page=52(8) A39|author=David Cohen|publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=14 October 2005|accessdate=}}(subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, The University of Newcastle, together with five other Australian universities ([[Macquarie University|Macquarie]], [[La Trobe University|La Trobe]], [[Flinders University|Flinders]], [[Griffith University|Griffith]] and [[Murdoch University|Murdoch]]) established Innovative Research Universities Australia (IRUA).

Forty years after obtaining autonomy, The University of Newcastle has developed a reputed history in their national and international university standings; ranked in the 10-14 range of the 38 universities in Australia by the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] and 215th in the world by the ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/schools/data/school_profile/default/universitynewcastle|title=

The university unveiled a new logo on 31 March 2007 as part of a brand refresh to better align the university's image with the its new strategic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/mpr/branding|title=About our new brand|publisher=The University of Newcastle|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2007, the university launched its new campus at the [[PSB Academy]]'s two main campuses in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.edu.au/location/singapore|title=The University of Newcastle, Singapore|publisher=The University of Newcastle|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student body and organisations ==
The University has a student population of just over 30,300 (including part time students) as of 2008, including 6773 international students from more than 115 countries.

The university is recognised for its commitment to equity in education and consistently enrols more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders than any other Australian university. The university has also graduated more than 60% of the nation's indigenous doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/186_10_210507/law10451_fm.html The Medical Journal of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at the Callaghan Campus of the university are represented by the [[Newcastle University Students' Association]] (NUSA), UoN Services Limited (UoN Services), Newcastle University Postgraduate Student Association (NUPSA); while students at Ourimbah Campus are represented by Campus Central. 

UoN Services is responsible for the social life of the university, as well as most of the commercial facilities on campus. It organises all the main entertainment events, usually performed at the University's two licensed venues, the Bar on the Hill and the Tanner Bar. Apart from student contributions (which have dropped significantly since the [[voluntary student unionism|abolition of universal student unionism]]), the UoN Services generates income from the stores, restaurants and bars on the Callaghan and city campuses.

NUSA and NUPSA are primarily advocacy organisations, representing students on a variety of issues from political activism to the internal organisation of the University. NUSA also produces ''[[Opus (magazine)|Opus]]'', the University's magazine written by and for students.
