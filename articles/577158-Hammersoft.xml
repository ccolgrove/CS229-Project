'''Sistema Brasileiro de TelevisÃ£o''' (''Brazilian Television System'')  is a Brazilian [[television network]]. The network first aired in 1981, and its headquarters are based in [[Osasco]], at the [[CDT da Anhanguera|CDT Anhanguera]] complex. SBT is owned by [[Silvio Santos]] (born Senor Abravanel), a popular Brazilian TV host. Its studios are located in [[SÃ£o Paulo]]. 

SBT has most of its schedule dedicated to children and pre-teens, making it the favourite network for the young audience. In 1998, SBT was running the longest-in-length children's programming block ever, together with [[TV Cultura]]; it was shown from ''SessÃ£o Desenho'', a cartoon block, at 7:00 am (right after the morning newscast), until 9:00 pm, when the children's [[telenovela]] ''[[Chiquititas]]'' normally ended. SBT promoted this situation on the screen, calling this whole period as SBT Kids, a total of 14 hours per day, and until nowadays neither SBT nor other networks have beaten this mark.

While most TV stations in Brazil depends mostly on national productions, SBT depends heavily on imports, mainly from Mexico and the USA. For more than 20 years comedy show ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'' (shown in Brazil as ''Chaves'') is one of the station's most-watched shows. The show also has a deal with Warner Brothers which gives the channel an exclusivity deal to show all their sitcoms, dramas and movies.

For a long time, Mexican telenovelas have been one of the most recognizable features on SBT, mostly during the early 1990s when they reached their peak in the country with titles like the children-oriented ''[[Carrusel]]'', ''[[La Usurpadora]]'', ''[[El Privilegio de Amar]]'', ''[[Luz Clarita]]'', and the incredibly successful MarÃ­a trilogy (''[[MarÃ­a Mercedes (telenovela)|MarÃ­a Mercedes]]'', ''[[Marimar (telenovela)|Marimar]]'', ''[[MarÃ­a la del Barrio]]''). Compared to the toned-down Brazilian telenovelas, Mexican soaps are considered tacky and exaggerated, but during the 1990s were a huge hit with lower-class people.

Other '90s hits include ''[[Domingo Legal]]'' (Cool Sunday, on literal translation), a Sunday variety show which during the later part of the decade was SBT's highest-rated show, even surpassing TV Globo; the most popular TV channel on Brazil, for hours, something which was very rare. ''Domingo Legal'' was criticized for being excessively sensationalist and ratings started to decline after the PCC scandal (see [[#The 2000s|below]]). As of 2008, the show is often ranked second in the ratings. The list of hits continues with ''[[Show do Ratinho]]'' (Ratinho's Show), which had a similar format to [[Jerry Springer]], ''[[Show do MilhÃ£o]]'' (The Million Show), a game show in the vein of ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire?]]'' and ''[[Chiquititas]]'', which was a big hit among kids.

For over 20 years SBT was the second place in Brazilian television ratings, behind [[Rede Globo]], but in February 2007 it was outpaced by [[Rede Record]] for the first time in [[SÃ£o Paulo]].

Since the 90s peak in popularity, Mexican telenovelas have been declining in the audience hitting an all time-low in the last two years (the last Mexican soap operas to have big ratings were ''[[Carita de Ãngel]]'' in the early 2000s and ''[[Rebelde]]'', which was a phenomenon in 2006). In 2001, SBT decided to start remaking Mexican soaps with Brazilian actors. The first soaps (''Picara Sonhadora'' and ''[[Marisol (telenovela)|Marisol]]'') did fairly well in the ratings; however, they have hit an all-time low recently, with soaps like ''[[Cristal (telenovela)|Cristal]]'', ''Os Ricos TambÃ©m Choram'' and ''Maria EsperanÃ§a'' (a version of the highly successful ''Maria Mercedes''), scoring very low ratings.

Beside Mexican soaps and their remakes, the channel also air cartoons during the morning, and formats like ''Ãdolos'', Brazilian version of [[American Idol]], that was replaced to TV Record, and the Brazilian version of ''[[Supernanny]]'', which are two of the most watched shows on the channel, and also a version of ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' (presented by Silvio Santos himself, who presents many of the network shows), lots of talent shows and one dating show. The channel also shows movies and ''[[A PraÃ§a Ã© Nossa]]'', a comedy show which has been one of the network's highest-rated shows since the early days.

==History==
===The pre-SBT years===
[[Rede Tupi]], channel 4 in SÃ£o Paulo, commenced operations in 1950. Since 1962, when he began his first TV program, [[Silvio Santos]] independently produced his own programs, not only on Tupi and TV Paulista, but on [[Rede Globo]] from 1965. Soon he had a structure able to support his dream of owning his own TV station. His own production company, ''Estudios Silvio Santos Cinema e Televisao'' was making good successes with his programs on Tupi and Globo, and since 1972, on [[Rede Record]], where he then owned half of the company's stakes. 

In 1976, thanks to the influence in governmental circles of humourist and his old-time friend Manoel de NÃ³brega, who had a show at Rede Globo then and was part of Bau de Felicidade, Santos finally obtained a license for his own station: [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s channel 11, called '''TV Studios''', or '''TVS''' for short. Soon after its launch its flagship program, the every-Sunday Programa Silvio Santos, was being aired from TVS. Other programs soon arrived as the network began to show support from city residents who were tired from excessive competition from Globo, Tupi, Bandeirantes and [[TV Rio]], the city's own network, which was related to TV Record (and later became a part of Record when it turned national in 1991); TVS was also related to it.

As the new channel debuted on May 14, 1976, it's symbol - a gold circle with the number 11 slanted, also in gold - would become a household logo among citizens of Rio de Janeiro for 5 years. It's first ident featured the new logo alongside the proud symbol of Rio de Janiero city and state, and Brazil's iconic statue symbol - the statue of [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]. Another ident showed the logo below the very hill where the statue is located.

When [[Rede Tupi]] collapsed in 1980, Santos obtained three stations from the network: [[SÃ£o Paulo]]'s channel 4, [[Porto Alegre]]'s channel 5 and [[BelÃ©m]]'s channel 5.  Thus, SBT was created, launched officially on August 19, 1981, still using the TVS name until 1990. Until the official formation of SBT, the Silvio Santos Group also had a station named TVS, in [[Nova Friburgo]] ([[Owned and operated|O&amp;O]] in channel 3).

However, [[Minas Gerais]]'s [[TV Alterosa]] in 1978 became one of SBT's broadcast affiliate networks. Some of the later affiliates were adopted from Rede Tupi, after its closure on July 18, 1980, by order of the then Brazilian Minister of Communications, Haroldo de Matos, who by the next year would give the order for SBT to begin transmissions. (When Tupi closed, Programa Silvio Santos then moved to Record, but continued to simulcast on TVS Channels 11 and 3 on Sundays.)  By then, he began to build up the network's expansion efforts, as well as convincing some stations to become SBT and Record affiliates.

===The 80s===

In the 1980s, SBT established itself with popular programming, contracting popular hosts and airing a mix of its own and some [[Televisa]] programming, especially Mexican [[telenovelas]] and comedy shows such as ''[[El Chavo del Ocho]]'' (''Chaves'') and ''[[El ChapulÃ­n Colorado]]'' (''Chapolin''). It quickly gained 2nd place ranking in Brazilian ratings, except for in Rio de Janeiro, where the flourishing [[Rede Manchete]] occupied this position. 

By 1986, the network had one thing on its mind. March that year saw the premiere telecast of its new talk show, ''Hebe'' with Hebe Camargo as host (the show was formerly seen on [[Rede Tupi]] and [[Rede Bandeirantes]]). It would soon become one of the network's longest-running programs, now running for over 24 years (the final show was on the final Monday of 2010, when she decided to end her contract), even having a spin-off show, Hebe por Elas (Hebe for All) in the early 90's. 

In 1987, Santos turned SBT practically upside-down, pursuing a better 'quality' program slate, while trying to attract a larger audience and better advertisers. This was the very year when, in response to the growing popularity of Rede Globo's Xou da Xuxa on weekdays and on Saturdays, SBT began increasing its children-oriented programming, with new titles like ''Oradukapeta'', ''Show Maravilha'' (later successful throughout South America), the ''Do Re Mi'' series programs with Simony and Marianne as hosts, and many others.  Almost all SBT kids' programs had female presenters (all different from the format of ''Xou da Xuxa'') because Oradukapeta was then hosted by Sergio Mallandro, also then a ''Show de Calorous'' judge.

Also in 1987, the network launched its famous slogan, &quot;Quem procura, acha aqui&quot;, modeled off NBC's three-year ''Be There'' project from 1983-85. The slogan lasted three seasons, with a new promo each year. The melody used each year was corresponding to NBC's melody in its project, as so:

* 1983/1987: NBC's &quot;Be There&quot; with SBT's first installment of &quot;QPAA&quot;
* 1984/1988: NBC's first installment of &quot;Let's All Be There&quot; with SBT's second &quot;QPAA&quot;
* 1985-86/1989: NBC's second installment of &quot;LABT&quot; with SBT's third and final &quot;QPAA&quot;

During the 80's, the most significant new personality signed by the network was humorist JÃ´ Soares, who was brought in from TV Globo in 1988, thus introducing the concept of late night talk-shows on Brazilian TV (with his Jo Soares 11:30 PM talk-show [aptly entitled ''JÃ´ Soares Onze e Meia'', and in the format of famous American programs in the same timeslot]). Also signed was Boris Casoy, who became the first [[Anchorman#News anchors|anchor]] in Brazil with its ''[[TJ Brasil]]'' newscast, which succeeded ''Noticentro'', the network's first newscast with Antonio Casale.

In 1988, Santos was able at the last minute to prevent TV host 'Gugu' Liberato from signing with Globo after several successful years on the network's ''Viva a Noite'' program as host, a role he had since 1986.  This was widely seen as an indication that Gugu would be Santos' successor on Sunday afternoons, reinforced with the extended time of Gugu's program ''Domingo Legal'', which would begin half a decade later. As a result, ''Programa SÃ­lvio Santos'' soon adopted the dual-presenter format, with Gugu hosting some program segments like ''Passa ou Repassa'' (famous for its Torta na Cara segment) and ''Cidade contra Cidade''. It was the same year when SBT broadcast the 1988 Seoul Olympics, two years after its 1986 FIFA World Cup coverage.

===The 90s===
TVS was merged into SBT in 1990, but the name change was only seen in August in the form of TV idents, celebrating SBT's 9th year of broadcasts.(That year, Silvio Santos had to let Record go by selling the station in order for it to go nationwide.) 1991, the year when SBT turned 10, saw the beginning of one of its best newscasts, ''Aqui Agora'' and Serginho Groisman's ''Programa Livre'' variety show.

1992 would see SBT and Rede Globo joining forces to bring the action of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics to all of Brazil. Its contributions even included a massive advertising campaign to cheer on the Brazilian national team.

SBT kept the same aggressive approach of the end of the 80s, investing heavily in its own [[telenovelas]] and getting television rights for some important sporting events (including [[Copa Mercosur]], Copa do Brasil and [[Champ Car]]). Also kept in touch with its heritage, signing with popular host Carlos 'Ratinho' Massa in 1998, obtaining more Mexican productions and launching some [[game shows]] like ''Show do MilhÃ£o'' in 1999. By the end of the decade, SBT was the undisputed 2nd place of Brazilian ratings and eyeing Globo's no.1 spot.

====Campaigns====
=====American and Australian imports=====
The 1990s was also SBT's most fruitful decade with importing American campaign. The following correlations were made this decade:

* 1987/1990: NBC's second installment of &quot;Come Home to NBC&quot;  with &quot;Vem Que Ã© Bom&quot;
* 1986/1991: NBC's ''first'' year of &quot;Come Home&quot; with &quot;10 anos com vocÃª&quot;. This slogan was its campaign for the 10th anniversary celebrations.
* 1990/1991/1993-94: CBS's second year of &quot;Get Ready for CBS&quot; with &quot;Se liga no SBT&quot;. On January 20, 1991, the Australian Network Ten launched &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; to coincide with a logo change, using in-house music but similar graphics.
* 1989/1992/1995: ABC's first year of &quot;America's Watching ABC&quot; with &quot;Fique ligado no SBT&quot;. In 1992, Ten launched &quot;This Is It&quot;, with the first half of the promo being the music from &quot;America's Watching&quot;, just in a different key and with different background instruments and vocals.

=====In-house productions=====
* In 1992, the one-minute spectacle &quot;Aqui Tem&quot; was launched for network-wide uage. The promo featured an in-house soundtrack and graphic elements from NBC's 1991 campaign, &quot;The Place to Be&quot;
* In August 1996, to recognise the network's 15th year on air, SBT launched a new logo-replacing multicoloured stripes with solid colours-and relaunched &quot;QPAA&quot; with a new side slogan, &quot;Tudo Pra VocÃª&quot;.
* For 1998, the network released &quot;A cara do Brasil&quot;, making use of a new graphics package and soundtrack.
* In 1999, the network began production on &quot;Na nossa frente, so vocÃª&quot;, with completely unused graphics and music. The 64-second promo was used on-air for the first time in 2000, but the slogan lived on until 2004.

===The 2000s===

SBT began the decade investing in movies, broadcasting a package of [[Disney]] (now working with Rede Globo) and [[Time Warner]] productions, the latter being promoted in a one hour block on the network.

In 2001, the controversial [[reality show]] ''Casa dos Artistas'', accused by many of being a copy of [[Endemol]]'s ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' marked the first time SBT led the ratings on Sunday night.

Since 2003, with the ratings advances of [[Rede Record]] (and later [[Bandeirantes]]), SBT has been in a ratings decline. Two important events in this year marked the beginning of its problems:
* Early in the year, Silvio Santos gave an interview with the TV gossip magazine ''Contigo!'', in which he stated that he was ill and had sold SBT. Later, he confessed that this was intended as a joke.

* The 'Gugu-[[Primeiro Comando da Capital|PCC]] scandal'. On September 7, ''Domingo Legal'' aired an interview with some so-called members of the criminal group PCC, threatening the deputy mayor of SÃ£o Paulo and the hosts of police coverage programs on the compteting TV Record and Rede TV! networks. Later it was discovered that this was a fake; the program was therefore suspended for one week, its audience never recovered, and Gugu Liberato, its host who was once seen as SÃ­lvio Santos' successor, never recovered his credibility.

Since then, the notable SBT success has been the airing of the program ''[[Rebelde]]'' and the seven-year old host [[Maisa]], who became a cult phemomenon. Problems have included constantly changing programming without any warning even to hosts, thus confusing the audience. In 2006 SBT celebrated its 25th anniversary amidst a deepening crisis.

Today, SBT is the second-largest network in the country, vying for leadership with [[Rede Record]]. The [[CDT da Anhanguera]] is the second largest television production center in the Brazil just behind of the [[Projac]] owned by the [[Rede Globo]]. Over 5000 employees work around the clock from SBT's 110 TV stations.

In 2008, SBT had a ratings crisis and lost second place to Record, but regained a tie for second place the next year.

In 2009, Liberato, after more than 20 years with SBT, jumped to Record; at the same time, SBT signed presenter Roberto Justus and Eliana to contracts â both were on Record. It also finally made its way to SKY Brazil, the last of the five major Brazilian networks to do so.

Among recent programs have been &quot;What's Your Talent&quot;, a localized version of such shows as [[Britain's Got Talent]] but primarily a modern version of [[Show de Calouros]] created and hosted by [[Silvio Santos]] in the 70's; a localized version of [[1 vs. 100]]; its annual telethon, which in 2009 raised $19 million &lt;!--currency unclear--&gt;; [[Kyle XY]]; the reality show [[Solitary (TV series)|Solitary]]; [[Smallville]]; [[Grey's Anatomy]]; and De Frente with Gabi, a talk show featuring journalist Marilia Gabriela.

In addition, TV Alagoas abruptly disaffiliated from the network in September 2009 and began broadcasting religious programs; SBT's executive director William Stoliar filed a lawsuit to ensure SBT's availability there. SBT returned to that station on June 1, 2010, due to viewer pressure and late rent payments for the religious programs.

==American influence==
The network has been strongly influenced by television in the United States.

=== Logo ===

The network logo was inspired by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] circle logo; however, in 1996, SBT added full colour to the logo to celebrate the station's 15th anniversary. 

The first network logo of 1981 was strongly similar to ABC's, with the golden ring (inherited from TVS 11 Rio) and the wordmark ''SBT'' in small letters, written in golden colors AND the same typeface used in ABC's logo. It would change in 1988, when the network adopted a new logo similar to the 1988 ABC campaign logo (''Something's Happening on ABC''): that of a circle with slanted multiple colored strips and the network name now colored in white lettering, the same one used in the TVS 4 logo.

=== Promos ===
In the late 80s and early-to-mid 90s, the image campaigns ''LideranÃ§a absoluto do segundo lugar'' (station launch to 1987), ''Quem Procura Acha Aqui'' (3 versions, released in 1987, 1988, and 1989, respectively), ''Vem Que Ã© Bom'' (1991) ''Se Liga no SBT'' (1993), and ''Fique ligado no SBT'' (1995) were nearly identical copies of [[NBC]]'s campaigns &quot;Let's All Be There&quot; (2 versions, 1983â84 and 1984â86) and &quot;Come Home to NBC&quot; (1987), CBS's &quot;Get Ready for CBS&quot; (1990 only), and ABC's &quot;Still the One&quot; (1977â79) and America's Watching ABC (1989â90).

=== Game shows ===
The sets of versions of American game shows ''[[Si o No]]'', ''[[Siempre o Bad]]'', ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]'', and ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' bear a very close resemblance to their American counterparts, although some of these shows were actually licensed.

=== News ===
In August 1997, SBT formed a partnership with [[Telemundo Internacional|CBS TelenotÃ­cias]] to provide news resources to ''Jornal do SBT''. More recently, the flagship nightly television news program [[SBT 24 Horas]] used opening sequences very similar to [[GMA Network]]'s &quot;24 Oras&quot; in 2005 and [[Telecinco]]'s ''NotÃ­cias Telecinco'' in 2006.

=== Movies ===

In the early 2000s, SBT signed long-term contracts with Warner Bros., MGM, Paramount, Televisa, Endemol, and FremantleMedia to air some of the highest-touted movies of the 20th and 21st centuries.
