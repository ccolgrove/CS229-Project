'''Courtnee Alyssa Draper''' (born April 24, 1985) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Morgan Hudson in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[The Jersey]]'' (1999â2003). Draper was a cast member on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' from April to October 2002 as Erica Lovejoy.

Draper was born at the Naval Hospital in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]]. She grew up in a military family. As a result, she has resided in and visited many areas of the United States (including Florida, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Arizona, and Hawaii) and the Far East (including Japan, Okinawa, Korea and Hong Kong). She was introduced to old movies and [[musical theatre|musicals]] at age five while living in Okinawa, Japan. She soon began singing in public places, often winning [[karaoke]] contests.

In 2011, at a PAX Prime panel for [[BioShock Infinite]], Draper said she had decided that acting &quot;wasn't for her&quot;, and had made the decision to go to law school to become a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5835060/liveblogging-the-bioshock-infinite-panel-at-pax-2011 Liveblogging the Bioshock: Infinite Panel at PAX 2011], Kotaku.com&lt;/ref&gt;
