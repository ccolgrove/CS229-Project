The '''Virginia Tech massacre''' was a [[school shooting]] that took place on April 16, 2007, on the campus of [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], United States. In two separate attacks, approximately two hours apart, the perpetrator, [[Seung-Hui Cho]], killed 32 people and wounded 25 others&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;&gt;

The [[massacre]] is the deadliest shooting incident by a single gunman in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18140540/ | title=Fact File: Deadliest shootings in the U.S. | accessdate=September 15, 2008 | work=MSNBC }} Note: there have been several deadlier shootings in U.S. history, but not by a single gunman, and not on a school campus.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the worst act of mass murder on college students since [[Syracuse University]] lost 36 students in the bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7c3001fc-9b21-11dd-a653-000077b07658.html|title=Remembering the Lockerbie bombing|date=18 October 2008|accessdate=September 1, 2011|first=Ellie|last=Levenson|work=Financial Times|publisher=FT.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho, a senior [[English studies|English]] [[Academic major|major]] at Virginia Tech, had previously been diagnosed with a severe [[anxiety disorder]].  During much of his [[middle school]] and [[high school]] years, he received therapy and [[special education]] support.  After graduating from high school, Cho enrolled at Virginia Tech.  Due to federal [[privacy law]]s, Virginia Tech was not informed of Cho's previous diagnosis or the accommodations he had been granted at school.  In 2005, Cho was accused of [[stalking]] two female students. After an investigation, a Virginia special justice declared Cho [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and ordered him to attend treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTgun-421&quot; /&gt; Lucinda Roy, a professor and former chairwoman of the English department, had also asked Cho to seek counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/VATech/story?id=3050437&amp;page=1 |publisher=ABC News |author=Jake Tapper |author2=Avery Miller |title=Teacher Warned Authorities About Va.

The attacks received international media coverage and drew widespread criticism of U.S. laws and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters_2007-04-17&quot;/&gt; It sparked intense debate about [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]], [[gun law]]s, gaps in the U.S. system for treating mental health issues, the perpetrator's state of mind, the responsibility of college administrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The massacre prompted the state of Virginia to close legal [[loopholes]] that had previously allowed Cho, an individual adjudicated as mentally unsound, to purchase handguns without detection by the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS). It also led to passage of the first major [[Gun law in the United States|federal gun control measure]] in more than 13 years. The law  strengthening the NICS was signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on January 5, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC_GunLaw&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Cochran | title=New Gun Control Law Is Killer's Legacy | url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/print?id=4126152 | publisher=ABC News | date=January 12, 2008 | accessdate=January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia Tech Review Panel, a state-appointed body assigned to review the incident, criticized Virginia Tech administrators for failing to take action that might have reduced the number of casualties.  The panel's report also reviewed gun laws and pointed out gaps in mental health care as well as privacy laws that left Cho's deteriorating condition in college untreated.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt;

Cho used two firearms during the attacks: a [[.22 Long Rifle|.22-caliber]] [[Walther P22]] [[Semi-automatic pistol|semi-automatic handgun]] and a [[9 mm caliber|9&amp;nbsp;mm]] semi-automatic [[Glock pistol|Glock 19]] handgun.&lt;ref name=&quot;roatimes_nomotive&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Reed | last=Williams | coauthors=Morrison, Shawna | title=Police: No motive found | url=http://www.roanoke.com/vtshootingaccounts/wb/114655 | publisher=The Roanoke Times | date=April 26, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shootings occurred in separate incidents, with the first at West Ambler Johnston Hall, during which Cho killed two pupils, and the second at Norris Hall, where the other 31 deaths, including that of Cho himself, as well as all the nonlethal injuries, occurred.

===West Ambler Johnston shootings===
Cho was seen near the entrance to [[Virginia Tech campus#Ambler Johnston Hall|West Ambler Johnston Hall]], a [[co-ed]] [[residence hall]] that houses 894 students, at about 6:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]].&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;roatimes_nomotive&quot; /&gt; The hall was normally only accessible to its residents via magnetic key card before 10&amp;nbsp;a.m. Cho's student mailbox was in the lobby of the building, so he had a pass card access after 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., but it is unclear how he gained earlier entrance to the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt;

Cho shot his first victims around 7:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. in West Ambler Johnston Hall. At about that time, Cho entered the room that freshman Emily J. Hilscher shared with another student.  Hilscher, a 19-year-old from [[Woodville, Virginia|Woodville]], [[Rappahannock County, Virginia|Rappahannock County]], Virginia, was killed.  After hearing the gunshots, a male [[resident assistant]], Ryan C. Clark, attempted to aid Hilscher. Clark, a 22-year-old-senior from  [[Martinez, Georgia|Martinez]], [[Columbia County, Georgia|Columbia County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], was fatally shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Annie | last=Johnson | coauthors=Thornburgh, Nathan | title=Witness: The Dormitory Murders | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1613010,00.html | publisher=Time Magazine | date=April 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://woubiyossi.tribe.net/thread/84e37a69-f2fa-41c8-8386-d783c3cb7b16 | title= Ryan C.

Cho left the scene and returned to his dormitory room. While police and [[emergency medical services]] units were responding to the shootings in the dorm next door, Cho changed out of his bloodstained clothes, logged on to his computer to delete his e-mail, and then removed the hard drive. About an hour after the attack, Cho is believed to have been seen near the campus duck pond. Although authorities suspected Cho threw his hard drive and mobile phone into the water, a search was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;roanoke1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Anna L. | last=Mallory | title=Investigators leave Tech Duck Pond empty-handed | url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/122648| publisher=The Roanoke Times | date=June 30, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesdispatch_practice&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Rex | last=Bowman | title=Cho may have practiced attack | url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-08-11-0121.html | publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch | date=August 11, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost two hours after the first killings, Cho appeared at a nearby post office and mailed a package of writings and video recordings to [[NBC News]]; the package was postmarked 9:01&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC Package 4-19&quot; /&gt; He then walked to Norris Hall. In a backpack, he carried several chains, locks, a hammer, a knife, two handguns with nineteen 10- and 15-round [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]], and almost 400 rounds of [[ammunition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt;

===Norris Hall shootings===

[[Image:Virginia Tech massacre Damiano photo from Holden Hall modified2.jpg|right|thumb|Elementary French class students take cover in Holden Hall room 212.]]
About two hours after the initial shootings, Cho entered [[Virginia Tech campus#Norris Hall|Norris Hall]], which houses the Engineering Science and Mechanics program among others, and chained the three main entrance doors shut. He placed a note on at least one of the chained doors, claiming that attempts to open the door would cause a bomb to explode. Shortly before the shooting began, a faculty member found the note and took it to the building's third floor to notify the school's administration. At about the same time, Cho had begun shooting students and faculty on the second floor; the bomb threat was never called in.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_33&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=US university shooting kills 33 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6560685.stm | publisher=BBC | date=April 17, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within one or two minutes of the first shots, the first call to [[9-1-1]] was received.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertbowman&quot;/&gt;

According to several students, before the shooting began Cho looked into several classrooms. Erin Sheehan, an eyewitness and survivor who had been in room 207, told reporters that the shooter &quot;peeked in twice&quot; earlier in the lesson and that &quot;it was strange that someone at this point in the semester would be lost, looking for a class&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC_recount&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Student Survivors Recount Shooting |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3048457 | publisher=ABC | date=April 17, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cho's first attack after entering Norris occurred in an advanced hydrology engineering class taught by Professor [[G. V. Loganathan]] in room 206. Cho first shot and killed the professor, then continued shooting, killing nine of the 13 students in the room and injuring two others.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt; Next, Cho went across the hall to room 207, in which instructor [[Jamie Bishop|Christopher James Bishop]] was teaching German. Cho killed Bishop and four students; six students were wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt; Cho then moved on to Norris 211 and 204.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertbowman&quot;/&gt;  In both of these classrooms, Cho was initially prevented from entering the classroom by barricades erected by instructors and students. In room 204, Professor [[Liviu Librescu]], a [[Holocaust]] survivor, forcibly prevented Cho from entering the room. Librescu was able to hold the door closed until most of his students escaped through the windows, but he died after being shot multiple times through the door. One student in his classroom was killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;israeli_lecturer&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Israeli lecturer died shielding Virginia Tech students from gunman | url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/849070.html | work= | publisher=Haaretz | date=April 17, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instructor [[Jocelyne Couture-Nowak]] and student Henry Lee were killed in room 211 as they attempted to barricade the door.&lt;ref name=&quot;canadian_class&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Tim | last=Harper | title=Canadian's class hardest hit | url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/204866 | work=The Washington Bureau | publisher=TheStar.com | date=April 19, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008 | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho reloaded and revisited several of the classrooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertbowman&quot;/&gt; After Cho's first visit to room 207, several students had barricaded the door and had begun tending the wounded.

[[Image:ChoSh.jpg|left|thumb|One of the photographs of [[Seung-Hui Cho]] that he sent to NBC News on the day of the massacre]]
The Virginia Tech Review Panel detailed numerous incidents of aberrant behavior beginning in Cho's junior year of college that should have served as warning signals of his deteriorating mental condition. Several former professors of Cho reported that his writing as well as his classroom behavior was disturbing, and he was encouraged to seek counseling.&lt;ref name=Disturbing1&gt;&quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18148802/ College gunman disturbed teachers, classmates]&quot; [[NBC News]].

The Virginia Tech Review Panel Report faulted university officials for failing to share information that would have shed light on the seriousness of Cho's problems, citing misinterpretations of federal privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Deborah |last=Charles |title=Report faults Virginia Tech response in shootings |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN2925438020070830?src=083007_11_TOPSTORY_response_faulted |publisher=Reuters |date=August 30, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Perilous Privacy at Virginia Tech |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0904/p08s01-comv.html |work=Opinion |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also pointed to failures by Virginia Tech's counseling center, flaws in Virginia's mental health laws, and inadequate state mental health services, but concluded that &quot;Cho himself was the biggest impediment to stabilizing his mental health&quot; in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;/&gt;

Cho's underlying psychological diagnosis at the time of the shootings remains a matter of speculation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Psychopath? Depressive?

Early reports suggested that the killings resulted from a romantic dispute between Cho and Emily Hilscher, one of his first two victims. However, Hilscher's friends said she had no prior relationship with Cho and there is no evidence that he ever met or talked with her before the murders.&lt;ref name=&quot;no_link_to_Hilscher&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Thane | last=Burnett | title=Cho, Hilscher Had No Link | url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/International/2007/04/19/4067325-sun.html | publisher=London Free Press | work=Sun Media | date=April 19, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing investigation, police found a [[suicide note]] in Cho's dorm room that included comments about &quot;rich kids&quot;, &quot;debauchery&quot;, and &quot;deceitful charlatans&quot;. On April 18, 2007, [[NBC News]] received a package from Cho time-stamped between the first and second shooting episodes. It contained an 1800 word [[manifesto]], photos, and 27 digitally recorded videos, in which Cho likened himself to [[Jesus Christ]] and expressed his hatred of the wealthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC Package 4-19&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Alex |last=Johnson | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18195423/ | title=Gunman sent package to NBC News | publisher=MSNBC |date=April 19, 2007 | accessdate = September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, among other things, &quot;You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option...You just loved to crucify me.

The Virginia Tech Review Panel concluded that because of Cho's inability to handle stress and the &quot;frightening prospect&quot; of being &quot;turned out into the world of work, finances, responsibilities, and a family,&quot; Cho chose to engage in a fantasy where &quot;he would be remembered as the savior of the oppressed, the downtrodden, the poor, and the rejected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot; /&gt;  The panel went further, stating that, &quot;His thought processes were so distorted that he began arguing to himself that his ''evil'' plan was actually doing good.

Within a day after the shootings, Virginia Tech, whose students call themselves ''The Hokies'', formed the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund (HSMF) to help remember and honor the victims. The fund is used to cover expenses including, but not limited to: assistance to victims and their families, grief counseling, memorials, communications expenses, and comfort expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Schwinn, Elizabeth | title =Virginia Tech Creates Memorial Fund After Monday's Rampage | work =Chronicle of Philanthropy| url =http://philanthropy.com/free/update/2007/04/2007041801.htm|date=April 18, 2007| accessdate =April 14, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015153225/http://philanthropy.com/free/update/2007/04/2007041801.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 15, 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web | title =Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund | publisher =Virginia Tech University | url =http://www.vt.edu/fund/index.php | accessdate =September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in June, 2007, the Virginia Tech Foundation announced that {{US$|3.2}} million was moved from the HSMF into 32&amp;nbsp;separate named [[Financial endowment|endowment]] funds, each created in honor of a victim lost in the shooting. This transfer brought each fund to the level of full endowment, allowing them to operate in [[perpetuity]].

Also early in June 2007, the university announced it would begin reoccupying Norris Hall within a matter of weeks.

[[Image:2007 Virginia Tech Massacre Bush handshake.jpg|left|thumb|President George W. Bush with Virginia Tech Student Government Association President James Tyger after Bush's speech at the school's convocation]]
Governor Kaine later created an eight-member panel, including former [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] [[Tom Ridge]], to review all aspects of the Virginia Tech massacre, from Cho's medical history to the school's widely criticized delay in warning students of danger and locking down the campus after the bodies of Cho's first two victims were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Turque |coauthors=Sari Horwitz |title=Kaine Gives Panel Latitude to Probe Campus Killings |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/19/AR2007041900830.html |publisher=Washington Post |date= April 19, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, the panel concluded, among more than 20 major findings, that the Virginia Tech Police Department &quot;did not take sufficient action to deal with what might happen if the initial lead proved false&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governor.virginia.gov/TempContent/techPanelReport.cfm?hpid=topnews |title=Report of the Virginia Tech Review Panel |accessdate=September 16, 2008 |work=State of Virginia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel made more than 70 preventative recommendations, directed to colleges, universities, mental health providers, law enforcement officials, emergency service providers, law makers and other public officials in Virginia and elsewhere. While the panel did find errors in judgment and procedure, the ultimate conclusion was that Cho himself was responsible for his own actions, and to imply that anyone else was accountable &quot;would be wrong.&quot;  The Review Panel validated public criticisms that university officials erred in &quot;prematurely concluding that their initial lead in the double homicide was a good one,&quot; and in delaying a campus-wide notification for almost two hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;/&gt; The report analyzed the feasibility of a campus lockdown and essentially agreed with police testimony that such an action was not feasible. The report concluded that the toll could have been reduced if the university had made an immediate decision to cancel classes and a stronger, clearer initial alert of the presence of a gunman.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;/&gt;

The incident also caused Virginia Commonwealth elected officials to re-examine gaps between federal and state gun purchase laws. Within two weeks, Governor Kaine had issued an executive order designed to close those gaps (see ''Gun politics debate'', [[#Gun politics debate|below]]).  Prompted by the incident, the federal government passed the most significant gun control law in over a decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters Gun Bill&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Ferraro |title=Senate passes gun bill in response to rampage |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1962838820071220 |publisher=Reuters |date=December 19, 2007|accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, {{USBill|110|H.R.|2640}}, mandates improvements in state reporting to the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS) in order to halt gun purchases by criminals, those declared mentally ill, and other people prohibited from possessing firearms and authorizes up to $1.3 billion in federal grants for such improvements.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times Gun Law&quot;/&gt; Both the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] and the [[National Rifle Association]] supported the legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;June bill&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Abrams |title=House Tempers Background Checks for Guns |url=http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&amp;fn=/2007/06/13/688491.html&amp;cvqh=itn_gunlaw |work= |agency=Associated Press |date= June 13, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure passed the [[United States House of Representatives]] on a voice vote on June 13, 2007.

[[Korean Americans]] criticized the fasting proposal, saying that it directed undue and irrelevant attention on Cho's ethnicity and not other, more salient, reasons behind the shooting.

Following the 2007 shootings, Virginia Tech began employing an alert system on their website, as well as text messages to warn students of danger. The alert system was first activated in 2008, when an exploded cartridge from a nail gun produced sounds similar to gunfire near a campus dormitory. It was later activated on August 4, 2011, during which the university was locked down, after three children attending a summer camp reported seeing a man near Dietrick Hall walking quickly toward the volleyball courts while carrying what might have been a handgun covered by some type of cloth. Police from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg and Christiansburg, as well as Virginia State Police and Montgomery County sheriff's deputies searched for the man, but could not find anyone matching the children's description.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/08/04/national/main20088053.shtml &quot;Virginia Tech reports possible gunman on campus&quot;].

The sale of firearms by licensed dealers in Virginia is restricted to residents who successfully pass a background check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3048534|first=Russell|last=Goldman|title=Shooter Identified as Seung-Hui Cho|publisher=ABC News|accessdate = September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia law also limits purchases of handguns to one every 30&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref&gt;Code of Virginia, [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2â308.2C2 Â§18.2â308.2:2(P) (2005)].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Federal law]] requires a [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|criminal background check]] for handgun purchases from licensed firearms dealers, and Virginia checks other databases in addition to the federally mandated [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|NICS]]. A [[Gun Control Act of 1968|1968 federal law]] passed in response to the assassinations of [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]],&lt;ref name=&quot;June bill&quot; /&gt; also prohibits those &quot;adjudicated as a mental defective&quot; from buying guns. This exclusion applied to Cho after a Virginia court declared him to be a danger to himself in late 2005&amp;nbsp;and sent him for [[Psychotherapy|psychiatric treatment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTgun-421&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Luo |title=U.S. Rules Made Killer Ineligible to Purchase Gun |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/us/21guns.html?pagewanted=print|publisher=New York Times |date=April 21, 2007 |accessdate = September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of gaps between federal and Virginia state laws, the state did not report Cho's [[legal status]] to the NICS.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTgun-421&quot;/&gt; Virginia Governor Timothy Kaine addressed this problem on April 30, 2007, by issuing an executive order intended to close those reporting gaps.&lt;ref name=&quot;VA gun order&quot;&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2007, the Virginia Tech Review Panel report called for a permanent change in the Code of Virginia to clarify and strengthen the state's background check requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;/&gt; The federal government later passed a law to improve state reporting to the NICS nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times Gun Law&quot;/&gt;

===Campus firearms ban===

The shootings also renewed debate surrounding Virginia Tech's firearms ban. The university has a general ban on possession or storage of firearms on campus by employees, students, and volunteers, or any visitor or other third parties, even if they are [[Carrying concealed weapon|concealed handgun permit]] holders.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2005, a student permitted by the state to carry concealed handguns was discovered possessing a concealed firearm in class. While no criminal charges were filed, a university spokesman said the University had &quot;the right to adhere to and enforce that policy as a common-sense protection of students, staff and faculty as well as guests and visitors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Miller |title=Virginia Tech's ban on guns may draw legal fire |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/xp-21770 |work= |publisher=Roanoke Times |date=April 13, 2005 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, prior to the shootings, legislator Todd Gilbert had introduced a related bill into the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]. The bill, HB 1572, was intended to forbid [[Public university|public universities]] in Virginia from preventing students from lawfully carrying a concealed handgun on campus.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university opposed the bill, which quickly died in subcommittee. Virginia Tech spokesman Larry Hincker praised the defeat of the bill, stating, &quot;I'm sure the university community is appreciative of the General Assembly's actions because this will help parents, students, faculty and visitors feel safe on our campus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roanoke Times gun bill&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Esposito |title=Gun bill gets shot down by panel |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-50658 |work= |publisher=Roanoke Times |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact on state and local law===
In August 2007, the Virginia Tech Review Panel Report recommended that the state's General Assembly adopt legislation &quot;establishing the right of every institution of higher education to regulate the possession of firearms on campus if it so desires&quot; and went on to recommend campus gun bans, &quot;unless mandated by law.&quot; The report also recommended gun control measures unrelated to the circumstances of the massacre, such as requiring background checks for all private firearms sales, including those at gun shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;August panel report&quot;/&gt;  Governor Kaine made it a priority to enact a private sale background check law in the 2008 Virginia General Assembly, but the bill was defeated in the Senate Courts of Justice Committee.&lt;ref&gt;

The incident and its aftermath energized student activist efforts seeking to overturn bans that prevent gun permit holders from carrying their weapons on college campuses. Thirty-eight states throughout the U.S. ban weapons at schools; sixteen of those specifically ban guns on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Virginia Tech killings underscore guns-on-campus campaign|publisher=International Herald Tribune |agency=Associated Press |date=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new group, [[Students for Concealed Carry on Campus]], formed after the massacre; as of March 2008, it claimed to have 16,000&amp;nbsp;members at 500&amp;nbsp;campuses nationwide.&lt;ref name=newsweek-student-group&gt;

===Political response===
The response to how gun laws affected the massacre was divided. According to a White House statement, &quot;The president believes that there is [[right to arms|a right for people to bear arms]], but that all laws must be followed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070416-1.html Press Briefing] Dana Perino, [[White House]], April 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brady Campaign|Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] said that it was too easy for an individual to get powerful weapons and called for increased gun control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;brady&quot;&gt;[http://bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=884 News Release: Nation Again Grieves Over A Tragedy Of Monumental Proportions], CNN, April 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Rifle Association]] board member [[Ted Nugent]], commenting on CNN, called for an end to gun-free zones and contrasted the Virginia Tech massacre with other incidents in which mass shootings have been ended by law-abiding gun owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;nugent&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ted |last=Nugent |title=Gun-free zones are recipe for disaster |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/commentary.nugent/index.html|publisher=CNN |date=April 20, 2007 |accessdate = April 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] proposed that licensed gun owners be allowed to carry their weapons anywhere in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Clay | last=Robison | title=Perry would allow carrying guns anywhere | url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/MYSA050107_07A_perry_guns_30eddd5_html4007.html | work=Austin Bureau | publisher=MySanAntonio.com | date=April 30, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some government officials in other countries joined in the criticism of U.S. gun laws and policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters_2007-04-17&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Perry |title=Massacre sparks foreign criticism of U.S. gun culture |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSL1752333820070417 |work= |publisher=Reuters |date=April 17, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] said that stringent legislation introduced after a 1996&amp;nbsp;[[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|mass shooting in Tasmania]] had prevented a problematic [[gun culture]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Paisley |last=Dodds |title=U.S. Gun Laws Draw Heat After Massacre |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3050071 |work= |agency=Associated Press |date=April 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Governor [[Tim Kaine]] condemned the gun politics debate following the massacre, saying, &quot;To those who want to make this into some sort of crusade, I say take this elsewhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washtimes&quot;&gt;&quot;Fairfax man identified as Tech shooter&quot; ''[[The Washington Times]],'' April 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aftermath==
On June 17, 2008, Virginia Circuit Court Judge Theodore J. Markow approved an $11&amp;nbsp;million [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in a suit against the state of Virginia by 24&amp;nbsp;of the 32&amp;nbsp;victims' families. Of the other eight victims, two families chose not to file claims, while two remain unresolved. The settlement also covered 18&amp;nbsp;people who were injured; their life-long health care needs included in the settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_June2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=O'Dell |coauthors=Dena Potter |title=Judge OKs $11M settlement in Va Tech shootings |url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2008/06/18/judge_oks_11m_settlement_in_va_tech_shootings/ |work= The Boston Globe|agency=Associated Press |date=June 17, 2008 |accessdate=September 24, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Virginia Tech families win $11 million settlement from state |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/US/06/17/virginia.tech.settlement/ |publisher=CNN|date= June 17, 2008|accessdate=June 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education fined the University $55,000 on March 29, 2011 for waiting too long to notify students of the initial shootings. The fine was the highest amount that the Department of Education could levy for the two violations of the [[Clery Act]] resulting from the failure to notify students in a timely manner of the shootings in West Ambler Johnston. &lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes_March2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Dena |last=Potter |coauthors= |title=Virginia Tech fined $55K for response to shootings |url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/03/30/general-us-virginia-tech-shootings_8381491.html |work= |agency=[[Forbes]] |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In announcing the fine against the University, the director of a department panel which reviewed the case was quoted as saying &quot;While Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute, the department's fine authority is limited&quot;. As of March 30, 2011, the University had announced its intention to appeal the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_March2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Bell |coauthors=CNN Wire Staff |title=Virginia Tech fined $55,000 in 2007 shooting rampage |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/03/29/virginia.tech.fine/index.html |work= |agency=[[CNN]] |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
