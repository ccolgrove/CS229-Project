'''Bayswater''' is a [[suburb]] of [[Auckland City]] in [[New Zealand]]. It lies on a peninsula which juts into the [[Waitemata Harbour]]. The population was 2,307 in the [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|2006 Census]], a reduction of 3 people from 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{NZ Quickstats|3508120|Bayswater}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The suburb is in the '''North Shore''' ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of Auckland City.

Bayswater was originally named O'Neill's Point after the first European settlers in the area, brothers Allan and James O'Neill&lt;ref&gt;Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;. Originally settling at the point (which still bears their name) at the end of the peninsula in the 1840s, by the 1850s&lt;ref&gt;Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; the O'Neills owned the entire peninsula. Some time later the area was renamed Bayswater after one of the more expensive new inner suburbs of [[London]]. The London Bayswater is located north of Hyde Park and was developed during the middle of the 19th century. The name was chosen for the Auckland suburb to evoke a sense of style as well as being a straight description of its physical location as a seaside development.
