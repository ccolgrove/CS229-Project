The '''2004 Iowa Hawkeyes football team''' represented the [[University of Iowa]] in the [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004 college football season]]. They played their home games in [[Kinnick Stadium]] and were coached by [[Kirk Ferentz]]. Finishing the 2003 season with a 10-3 record and an [[2004 Outback Bowl|Outback Bowl]] victory, the Hawkeyes began the season 2-0 with wins over {{cfb link|year=2004|team=Kent State Golden Flashes|title=Kent State}} and {{cfb link|year=2004|team=Iowa State Cyclones|title=Iowa State}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 2004 Football Schedule / Results |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teamsched?teamId=2294&amp;year=2004 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But after rocky performances at [[2004 Arizona State Sun Devils football team|Arizona State]] and [[2004 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], the Hawkeyes sat at 2-2 going into their game with [[2004 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;note-0&quot;/&gt;

The Hawkeyes handily defeated the Spartans 38&amp;ndash;16,&lt;ref name=&quot;note-1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 38, Michigan State 16 |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/100204aac.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2004-10-02 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and turned their attention to [[2004 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], a team whom the Hawkeyes had not beaten at home since 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 33, No. 23 Ohio State 7 |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/101604aaa.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2004-10-16 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind a strong [[American football strategy#Defensive strategy|defensive]] performance that allowed only 177 yards,&lt;ref name=&quot;note-3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa Cruises Past No. 25 Ohio State, 33-7 |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/101604aab.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2004-10-16 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hawkeyes easily defeated the Buckeyes by 26 points, the largest margin of victory over Ohio State in Iowa history.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-2&quot;/&gt; However,   tragedy struck soon thereafter, when [[head coach]] Kirk Ferentz's father died.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-3_2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Ferentz's Father Passes Away |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/102004aac.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2004-10-20 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the emotional game that ensued, the Hawkeyes narrowly defeated [[2004 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] 6&amp;ndash;4 on two Kyle Schlicher [[Field goal (football)|field goals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;note-4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Wine Online: A Defense Battle |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/102404aac.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com / George Wine |date = 2004-10-24 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hawkeyes then raised their record to 8-2 with victories over {{cfb link|year=2004|team=Illinois Fighting Illini|title=Illinois}}, [[2004 Purdue Boilermakers football team|Purdue]], and [[2004 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=&quot;note-0&quot;/&gt; With a share of the [[Big Ten]] [[Big Ten Conference football champions|championship]] on the line, the Hawkeyes met [[2004 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] in the final regular season game of the year.

In a game that was originally thought to be a defensive matchup,&lt;ref name=&quot;note-8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Capital One Bowl Breakdown |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/football/ncaa/specials/bowls/2004/12/29/capitalone.breakdown/index.html |publisher = SI.com |date = 2004-12-29 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the Hawkeyes took a 24&amp;ndash;12 lead early in the fourth quarter. But behind [[freshman]] [[quarterback]] [[JaMarcus Russell]], the Tigers stormed back, and took a one-point lead with 46 seconds remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-9&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa vs. Louisiana State |url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores105/105001/20050101NCAAFLSU-------0nr.htm |publisher = USA Today |date = 2005-01-02 |accessdate = 2007-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, LSU's comeback was all for naught, as Iowa's [[Drew Tate]] completed a 56-yard [[touchdown]] pass to [[Warren Holloway]] as time expired, giving Iowa the 30&amp;ndash;25 win&lt;ref name=&quot;note-9&quot;/&gt; and a 10-2 final record.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-0&quot;/&gt;

== Previous season ==

In 2003, Iowa began the season 4-0&lt;ref name=&quot;note-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = No. 14 Iowa 21, No. 16 Arizona State 2 |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/092003aab.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2003-09-20 |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would eventually complete the regular season with a 9-3 record that included wins over Iowa State, Michigan (Iowa's second straight victory against Michigan), and Minnesota. &lt;ref name=&quot;note-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 2003 Big Ten results |url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/bigten/03recap.htm |publisher = USA Today |date = 2004-05-01 |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Hawkeyes lost to Michigan State, Ohio State, and Purdue. Finishing fourth in the Big Ten standings,&lt;ref name=&quot;note-13&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =  FINAL - Big Ten Football Standings |url = http://www.goldfan.com/bigten/2003/bigten_1207.shtml |publisher = GoldFan.com |date = 2004-01-05 |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hawkeyes accepted a bid to play the [[2003 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] in the Outback Bowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = It's Tampa! |url  = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120703aac.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2003-12-07 |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite falling behind early on a 70-yard touchdown pass from [[Chris Leak]] to Kelvin Knight, the Hawkeyes reeled off 27 straight points en route to a 37&amp;ndash;17 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa vs. Florida |url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores104/104001/20040101NCAAFFLORIDA---0nr.htm |publisher = USA Today |date = 2004-01-01 |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a milestone victory, as it gave Iowa its second consecutive 10-win season along with the first Hawkeye victory in a January bowl game since the [[1958 Iowa Hawkeyes football team#Postseason|Rose Bowl]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-15&quot;/&gt;

Following the season, five Iowa players were selected in the [[2004 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;note-16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Gallery Second Overall Pick at NFL Draft |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/042404aaa.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2004-04-24 |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Gallery]], the 2003 [[Outland Trophy]] winner, became the second-highest pick in school history when he was selected 2nd by the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;note-16&quot;/&gt; Following Gallery in Iowa's draft order were [[Bob Sanders]], taken 44th by [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]], [[Nate Kaeding]], taken 65th by [[San Diego Chargers|San Diego]], [[Jared Clauss]], taken in the seventh round by [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]], and Erik Jensen, who was taken in the seventh round by [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;note-16&quot;/&gt;

== Before the season ==

Prior to the season, the Hawkeyes looked to replace seven offensive starters and four defensive starters.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-17&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = EARLY BIRD 2004 COLLEGE FOOTBALL PREVIEW - #18 Iowa Hawkeyes |url = http://www.nationalchamps.net/2004/earlybird/teams/iowa.htm |publisher = NationalChamps.net |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Key losses from 2003 included Maurice Brown, Robert Gallery, Nate Chandler, [[Fred Russell (football player)|Fred Russell]], and Ramon Ochoa on offense.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-17&quot;/&gt; Defensively, the Hawkeyes looked to replace Howard Hodges, Jared Clauss, Grant Steen, and Bob Sanders.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-17&quot;/&gt;

Replacement starters on offense were Drew Tate, Champ Davis, Jermelle Lewis, Calvin Davis, Tony Jackson, Lee Gray, Mike Elgin, and Chris Felder.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-18&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 2004 Football Preview |url = http://nationalchamps.net/2004/sub/previews/iowa.htm |publisher = NationalChamps.net |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On defense, [[Derreck Robinson]], Tyler Luebke, George Lewis, and Marcus Paschal assumed their roles on the starting lineup.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-18&quot;/&gt; On special teams, David Bradley returned for his senior season as [[Punter (American football)|punter]], while Kyle Schlicher replaced Nate Kaeding as the starting kicker.&lt;ref name=&quot;note-18&quot;/&gt;
