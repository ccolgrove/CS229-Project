==MTV on-air branding==

Since MTV's launch in Europe and around the world, MTV has made use of MTV US's on-air identity. Overtime, MTV  gradually produced its own on-air identity throughout the early 1990s. From 1997, MTV's regionalization throughout Europe brought about specialized an on-air identity which reflected the tastes and influences from that region.

As of July 1, 2009 all MTV channels globally share the same on-air branding such as a standard logo, idents and promos&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universaleverything.com/289&lt;/ref&gt; (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). This is part of MTV Networks International's global branding initiative. The on-air branding titled '''Pop X1000''' reflects the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]], with additional designs being added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding has been overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding has been adopted by MTV Networks Europe, MTV Networks Asia, MTV Networks Africa and MTV Networks Latin America.
