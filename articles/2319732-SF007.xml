'''Frugalware Linux''' is a general-purpose [[Linux distribution]] designed for intermediate users who are familiar with command-line operations. Early versions were based on [[Slackware]], but it is now an independently-developed distribution. Frugalware uses the [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman]] [[package management system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;openaddict-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Interview with Frugalware Linux Developer, VMiklos | publisher=Open Addict | url=http://www.openaddict.com/interview_with_frugalware_linux_developer_vmiklos.html | accessdate =2008-02-27 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070714171605/http://www.openaddict.com/interview_with_frugalware_linux_developer_vmiklos.html | archivedate =2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==
Frugalware's developers attempt to make Frugalware as simple as possible while establishing a priority based on comfortable use. Their goal is to ship consistently fresh and stable software, as close to the original source as possible.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== History ==
Frugalware was founded in 2004 by MiklÃ³s Vajna. He considered Slackware's [[Package management system|package manager]] ''pkgtools'' too slow, and wanted to rewrite it in [[C (programming language)|C]]. He was told that it would never be accepted by Slackware, so Vajna started to think about founding a separate Linux distribution. He replaced Slackware's original package manager, [[init]] scripts and build system. As a result, Frugalware was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;distrowatch-vmiklos&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Interview with MiklÃ³s Vajna, Frugalware Linux | publisher=[[DistroWatch]] | url=http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20060522#interview | accessdate =2008-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Package management ==
Since version 0.6 Frugalware has used Pacman-G2 package manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;terminus-changelog&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Frugalware 0.6 (Terminus) Changelog| publisher=Frugalware Project | url=http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/archive/frugalware-0.6/ChangeLog.txt | format=TXT | accessdate =2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fork of a CVS version of the complete rewrite of [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman]] by Aurelien Foret, which was not officially released at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;pacman-g2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Pacman-G2| work=Frugalware Stable Documentation | publisher=Frugalware Project | url=http://frugalware.org/docs/stable/pacman-g2.html | accessdate =2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Frugalware used a modified version of the older, monolithic Pacman by Judd Vinet.

Frugalware's packages' extension is .fpm.&lt;ref name=&quot;makepkg&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Creating new packages| work=Frugalware Stable Documentation | publisher=Frugalware Project | url=http://frugalware.org/docs/stable/makepkg.html | accessdate =2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The packages are archives that are compressed using [[xz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=About Frugalware| work=Frugalware Stable Documentation | publisher=Frugalware Project | url=http://frugalware.org/docs/stable/about.html | accessdate =2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repoman is a tool to compile source packages and automatically create and install closed-source packages.&lt;ref name=&quot;0.3pre1&quot;/&gt; With Repoman, the user can also download all packages' buildscript and recompile them with specific build options. The build options can be changed by editing a configuration file.&lt;ref name=&quot;makepkg&quot;/&gt; The first Frugalware release that had Repoman was Frugalware 0.3pre1.&lt;ref name=&quot;0.3pre1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Frugalware 0.3pre1-i686 released | accessdate =2008-02-27 | publisher=Frugalware Project | url=http://frugalware.org/news/22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branches ==
Frugalware has a -current and a -stable branch. The -current branch is updated daily, and the -stable branch gets updated every 6 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;

== Architectures ==
Frugalware currently supports x86 (Pentium Pro or higher), x86_64 (k8, aka. amd64) platforms and ppc (PowerPC)&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;.
