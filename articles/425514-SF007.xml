'''Art theft''' is usually for the purpose of resale or for [[ransom]] (sometimes called '''artnapping'''). Stolen art is sometimes used by criminals to secure loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Hopkins |title=How art treasures are stolen to order |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,245112,00.html |publisher=The Guardian |date=2000-01-08 |accessdate=2007-10-07 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One must realize that only a small percentage of stolen art is recovered. Estimates range from 5 to 10%. This means that little is known about the scope and characteristics of art theft. According to UNESCO, and police statistics the problem of art theft is number three in magnitude after illicit trade in drugs and arms. However there is a wide gap between these two (each over US$ 100 million, and art theft: some US$ 6 million.

==Individual theft==
Many thieves are motivated by the fact that valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms at most.  Transport for items such as paintings is also trivial, assuming the thief is willing to inflict some damage to the painting by cutting it off the frame and rolling it up into a tube carrier.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=July 2011}} Also, while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places with multimillion art collections works have disproportionately poor security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Cameron  |last=Skene |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Art theft ranked as fourth-largest criminal enterprise |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=40babe8f-84b5-46d7-a311-344494e03788|work= |publisher=[[National Post]]|date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical [[smash-and-grab]], but offer a huge potential payoff.

==Prevention in museums==
Museums can take numerous measures to prevent the theft of artworks include having enough [[Museum docent|docents]] or guards to watch displayed items, avoiding situations where security-camera sightlines are blocked, and fastening paintings to walls with hanging wires that are not too thin and with locks.&lt;ref name=rkhhii/&gt;. More attention should be paid to the problem on insider thefts (embezzlement). Many museums depend far too much on electronic alarm systems. Those systems only are valuable when integrated in sufficient structural and organizational measures.

=== Art theft education ===
The Smithsonian Institution sponsors the [http://natconf.si.edu/ National Conference on Cultural Property Protection], held annually in Washington, D. C. The conference offers insight and proven solutions for new and seasoned professionals in the field of cultural property protection.

Since 1996, the Netherlands-based [http://www.museum-security.org/ Museum Security Network] has disseminated news and information related to issues of cultural property loss and recovery. Since its founding the Museum Security Network has collected and disseminated over 20.000 reports about incidents with cultural property. Presently information can be received at a daily basis via http://groups.google.com/group/museum_security_network?hl=en. The founder of the Museum Security Network, Ton Cremers, is recipient of the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection Robert Burke Award.

2007 saw the foundation of the [http://www.artcrime.info/ Association for Research into Crimes against Art] (ARCA). ARCA is a nonprofit [[think tank]] dedicated principally to raising the profile of art crime ([[art forgery]] and [[vandalism]], as well as theft) as an academic subject.  Since 2009, ARCA has offered a well-respected but unaccredited postgraduate program dedicated to the study of art crime. The [[International Art Crime Studies Masters Program]] is held from June to August every year.

==Recovery==
The [[Art Loss Register]] ([http://www.artloss.com/ ALR]) was formed in 1991 in London by a partnership of leading international auction houses and art trade associations, the insurance industry, and the [[International Foundation for Art Research]] ([http://www.ifar.org/   IFAR]).&lt;ref&gt;International Foundation for Art Research: [http://www.ifar.org/about.php  About IFAR, Art Theft Database]&lt;/ref&gt; Its shareholders include [[Christie's]], [[Sotheby's]], [[Bonhams]], [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], and others. It is the world's largest database of stolen art and antiques dedicated to their recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Art Loss Register: [http://www.artloss.com/content/history-and-business   ALR, History]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public sphere, [[Interpol]], the [[FBI]] Art Crime Team led by special agent [[Robert King Wittman]], London's [[Metropolitan Police]], [[New York Police Department]]'s special frauds squad&lt;ref&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  &quot;A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,&quot;] ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide maintain &quot;squads&quot; dedicated to investigating thefts of this nature and recovering stolen works of art.

According to Robert K. Wittman, a former FBI agent who led the Art Crime Team until his retirement in 2008, the unit is very small compared with similar law-enforcement units in Europe, and most art thefts investigated by the FBI involve agents at local offices who handle routine property theft. &quot;Art and antiquity crime is tolerated, in part, because it is considered a victimless crime,&quot; Wittman said in 2010.&lt;ref name=rkhhii&gt;Kennedy, Randy, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/arts/design/07wittman.html?ref=arts &quot;His Heart Is in the Art of Sleuthing&quot;], p C1, ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

==State theft, wartime looting and misappropriation by museums==
Because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures, there are numerous cases where artworks (often displayed in the acquiring country for decades) have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy. One prominent example is the case of the [[Elgin Marbles]], which were moved from Greece to the [[British Museum]] in 1816 by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Many different [[Greece|Greek]] governments have maintained that removal was tantamount to theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Summer | last=Banks | coauthors= | title=Now you see it, now you don't | date=2008-01-25 | publisher= | url =http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/23119 | work =Yale Daily News | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-27 | language = | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080129122413/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/23119| archivedate = January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar controversies have arisen over [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Aztec]] and [[Italian culture|Italian]] artworks, with advocates of the originating countries generally alleging that the removal of artifacts is a pernicious form of [[cultural imperialism]]. [[Yale University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] is engaged (as of November 2006) in talks with the government of [[Peru]] about possible repatriation of artifacts taken during the excavation of [[Machu Picchu]] by Yale's [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]].

In 2006, New York's [[Metropolitan Museum]] reached an agreement with Italy to return many [[illicit antiquities|disputed pieces]].  The [[Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles is also involved in a [[Marion True|series of cases]] of this nature. The artwork in question is of Greek and ancient Italian origin. The museum agreed on 20 November 2006 to return 26 contested pieces to Italy. One of the Getty's signature pieces, a statue of the goddess [[Aphrodite]], is the subject of particular scrutiny.

From 1933 through the end of World War II, the [[Nazi]] regime maintained a policy of [[Nazi plunder|looting art]] for sale or for removal to museums in the Third Reich. [[Hermann GÃ¶ring]], head of the [[Luftwaffe]], personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces, generally stolen from [[Jews]] and other victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Members of the families of the original owners of [[looted art|these artworks]] have, in many cases, persisted in claiming title to their pre-war property. In 2006, after a protracted court battle in the United States and Austria (see [[Republic of Austria v. Altmann]]), five paintings by [[Austrians|Austrian]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] were returned by Austria to [[Maria Altmann]], the niece of prewar owner, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. Two of the paintings were portraits of Altmann's aunt, Adele.  The more famous of the two, the gold ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'', was sold in 2006 by Altmann and her co-heirs to philanthropist [[Ronald Lauder]] for $135 million. At the time of the sale, it was the highest known price ever paid for a painting. The remaining four restituted paintings were later sold at Christies auction house in New York for over $190 million.

The [[Nazi plunder]]ing of artworks was carried out by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories]] (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg fÃ¼r die Besetzen Gebiete). In occupied France, the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume Art Museum]] in Paris was used as a central storage and sorting depot for looted artworks from [[museum]]s and private [[art collection]]s throughout France pending distribution to various persons and places in Germany. The Nazis confiscated tens of thousands of works from their legitimate [[Jew]]ish owners. Some were confiscated by the [[Allies]] at the end of the war. Many ended up in the hands of respectable collectors and institutions. Jewish ownership of some of the art was codified into the [[Geneva conventions]].

In 1945, an American soldier Joe Meador stole eight medieval artifacts found in a mineshaft near [[Quedlinburg]] which had been hidden by local members of the clergy from Nazi looters in 1943.

Returning to the United States, the artifacts remained in Meador's possession until his death in 1980.  He made no attempt to sell them. When his older brother attempted to sell a 9th century manuscript and 16th century prayerbook in 1990, the two were charged. However, the charges were dismissed after it was declared the [[statute of limitations]] had expired.

[[Russborough House]], the [[Ireland|Irish]] estate of the late Sir [[Alfred Lane Beit|Alfred Beit]], has been robbed four times since 1974.

In 1974, members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], including [[Rose Dugdale]], bound and gagged the Beits, making off with nineteen paintings worth an estimated Â£8 million.  A deal to exchange the paintings for prisoners was offered, but the paintings were recovered after a raid on a rented cottage in [[County Cork|Cork]], and those responsible were caught and imprisoned.

In 1986, a [[Dublin]] gang led by [[Martin Cahill]] stole eighteen paintings worth an estimated Â£30 million in total.  Sixteen paintings were subsequently recovered, with a further two still missing to this day (2006).

Two paintings worth an estimated Â£3 million were stolen by three armed men in 2001.  One of these, a [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] had been previously stolen by Cahill's gang.  Both paintings were recovered in September 2002.

A mere two to three days after the recovery of the two paintings stolen in 2001, the house was robbed for the fourth time, with five paintings taken.  These paintings were recovered in December 2002 during a search of a house in [[Clondalkin]].

In film, a [[caper story]] usually features complicated heist plots and visually exciting getaway scenes. In many of these movies, the stolen art piece is a [[MacGuffin]].
