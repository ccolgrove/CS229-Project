Discovered by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â1939), led by Capt. [[Alfred Ritscher]], and named for German geographer [[Albrecht Penck]]. Maps of the German Antarctic Expedition incorrectly represent this feature with a north-south axis, but it was accurately mapped by the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) (1949â1952), led by [[John Schjelderup GiÃ¦ver]].
