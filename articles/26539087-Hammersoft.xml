{{Campaignbox War in Somalia (2009â)}}
The '''Battle of Mogadishu (2010â2011)''' began on August 23, 2010 when [[al-Shabaab]] insurgents began attacking government and [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] (AMISOM) positions in the Somali capital. Al-Shabaab began its offensive after its spokesman said the group was declaring a &quot;massive war&quot; on the AMISOM force, describing its 6,000 &quot;peacekeepers&quot; as &quot;invaders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11068805 |title=BBC News - Somali MPs killed in hotel suicide attack |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= August 24, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010 the number of [[AMISOM]] troops was increased to 8,000 and later to 9,000.

==Background==
Al-Shabaab had previously declared a &quot;massive&quot; war against the internationally backed Transitional Federal Government and [[AMISOM]] troop &quot;invaders.&quot; On July 11, 2010 they [[July 2010 Kampala attacks|attacked]] [[Kampala]], Uganda in revenge for the country's support of [[African Union]] troops in Somalia.

The attacks took place as hundreds of additional Ugandan troops arrived in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/08/201082464449278785.html |title=Al-Shabab vows 'massive' Somali war - Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====May - June: [[Bakaara market]] offensive====

[[Bakaara market]] has for several years been one of the main strong holds and sources of income (together with the port in [[Kismayo]]) for [[al-Shabaab]]. The market has been used for launching attacks and for shooting mortars towards [[AMISOM]] and [[TFG]] controlled areas of [[Mogadishu]]. It has been hard to target [[al-Shabaab]] hiding within the market as it's the largest in [[Somalia]] and packed with civilians.

On May 12th [[TFG]], [[AMISOM]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] launched an offensive towards [[Bakaara market]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bakaras1&quot;&gt; http://shabelle.net/article.php?id=6616 AU peacekeepers win territory from Somali rebels&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;advbakarah&quot;&gt; http://hiiraan.com/news2/2011/May/blast_in_somalia_kills_5_pro_gov_t_troops.aspx Blast in Somalia kills 5 pro-gov't troops&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the offensive was to take control of [[Bakaara market]] located in the Hawl Wadag district of [[Mogadishu]]. It was part of a major offensive going on in several places in [[Somalia]] to take control of the areas under [[al-Shabaab]] control.

Two days into the battle on May 14th the [[al-Shabaab]] commander of [[Bakaara market]] Abdifatah Mahamed was killed together with his intelligence officer Abdiwahab Sheik Dole.&lt;ref name=&quot;doledead&quot;&gt;http://www.bar-kulan.com/2011/05/14/amisom-gains-ground-in-mogadishu/ AMISOM gains ground in Mogadishu&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 15th heavy fighting occurred when more than 35 people were killed in the fighting,&lt;ref name=&quot;35kiatfg&quot;&gt;http://hiiraan.com/news2/2011/May/35_killed_in_mogadishu_clashes.aspx 35 killed in Mogadishu clashes &lt;/ref&gt; including [[al-Shabaab]] commander of Hawlwadag destrict Ali Burhan &quot;Ayatuulah&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakaras1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hornofafrica-abdikarim.blogspot.com/2011/05/amisom-takes-more-towns-in-somalia.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

After four days of fighting [[TFG]], [[AMISOM]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] forces had advanced around 500 meters towards the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;advbakarah&quot;/&gt; The front line was on May 16th around 500 - 700 meters north and west of the marked and 200 meters south of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakaras1&quot;/&gt; The areas sized from [[al-Shabaab]] included a former Sufi shrine that [[al-Shabaab]] used as a military base.&lt;ref name=&quot;advbakarah&quot;/&gt; In an attack on May 16th, 6 [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] soldiers were killed in a mortar attack and 17 injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;alumort1&quot;&gt;[http://shabelle.net/article.php?id=6614 6 pro-government fighters killed, 17 hurt in Mogadishu mortar attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy shelling hit the [[Bakaara Market]] on May 14th, resulting in at least 14 civilian deaths. Most of the civilians killed were women doing their shopping, one child was also among those killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuldead1&quot;&gt;[http://www.kulmiyenews.com/?nid=1884 Somalia shelling kills 14 civilians at market]&lt;/ref&gt; Shelling continued on May 20th and in Saraha Boliska in the Wadajir district, 3 people were killed in another shelling incident and 6 were injured. Mortars also hit the Bulahubey neighborhood, injuring 2 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;shabdeath6&quot;&gt;[http://shabelle.net/article.php?id=6768 Three killed in Mogadishu artillery shelling]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A major breakthrough happened on May 22nd when most of the marked roads, including the Wadnaha road (National road) fell into the hands of [[TFG]] and [[AMISOM]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wadroad&quot;&gt;http://shabelle.net/article.php?id=6834&lt;/ref&gt; During the fighting, 2 civilians, 4 [[AMISOM]] soldiers and 22 [[al-Shabaab]] fighters were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;adv1ami&quot;&gt;http://hiiraan.com/news2/2011/May/au_somali_forces_advance_onto_rebel_stronghold.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abukilled&quot;&gt; [http://somaliareport.com/index.php/post/819/Fighting_Rages_in_Mogadishu_for_Bakara Al-Shabaab counter-attack in Mogadishu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[al-Shabaab]] lost one of their top leaders in [[Mogadishu]]. Before being killed Abu Hubeyda was coordinating the [[al-Shabaab]] attacks from [[Bakaara market]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abukilled&quot;/&gt;
As the [[AMISOM]] and [[TFG]] forces advanced they captured the famous Red Mosque on May 23rd.&lt;ref name=&quot;redcap&quot;&gt;http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2011/may/government_troops_advance_to_southern_edge_of_bakara_market.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt on May 25th to open a second front and relief the some of the pressure from [[Bakaara market]], around 300 [[al-Shabaab]] fighters attacked [[AMISOM]] and [[TFG]] bases in Bondere, Shingani and Scibis. At least 5 [[al-Shabaab]] fighters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://somaliareport.com/index.php/post/836/Al-Shabaab_Counter-Attacks_in_Mogadishu?PHPSESSID=2e77f5622a677d4762e78b562bf2e0d7&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting continued the next night and at least 1 person was killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://shabelle.net/article.php?id=7004&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the tense situation in [[Bakaara market]] merchants started to evacuate the market. Some of the shop keepers re-opened in [[TFG]] controlled parts of [[Mogadishu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://shabelle.net/article.php?id=6971&lt;/ref&gt;

During the offensive several key places were captured by [[AMISOM]] and [[TFG]]. They include the Red mosque,&lt;ref name=&quot;redcap&quot;/&gt; Wadnaha road (National road),&lt;ref name=&quot;wadroad&quot;/&gt; Sheikh Ali Suffi mosque, African Village and &quot;Tarabunka&quot; (old parade ground).&lt;ref&gt;http://somaliareport.com/index.php/post/856/President_Sharif_Tours_Frontlines_in_Mogadishu?PHPSESSID=9ea3b4e7763441ae8cbd67bed1c85266&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 15 vehicles carrying foreign [[al-Shabaab]] fighters (of [[African]] origin and one truck of [[Demographics of Pakistan|Pakistani]] and [[Yemen]]ite) left Abdul Aziz district in [[Mogadishu]] heading to [[Afgoye]] on 30th May. At the same time [[al-Shabaab]] deployed fighters from [[Shabeellaha Hoose|Lower Shabelle]] and [[Bay, Somalia|Bay]] region to the front line in [[Bakaara market]] in an attempt to put an halt to the offensive made by [[AMISOM]] and [[TFG]].&lt;ref&gt;http://somaliareport.com/index.php/post/871/Al-Shabaab_Shuffles_Fighters_in_Mogadishu?PHPSESSID=816f8288790a02af764151f471fd13fc&lt;/ref&gt; 

At 16.45 hours [[al-Shabaab]] insurgence disguised as [[Military of Somalia|SNA]] soldiers driving a white mini van opened fire at [[AMISOM]] and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] fighters at the &quot;Dabka&quot; base. The insurgence objective was the [[Ugandan]] [[AMISOM]] soldiers stationed in Maka Al-Mukarama. Due to a mistake the insurgence attacked the building next to the one holding [[AMISOM]] soldiers, and instead attacked the one holding [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] fighters. The area was heavy guarded and 3 of the [[al-Shabaab]] insurgence was killed in the firefight while 2 exploded (suicide bombers) killing several civilians on the Maka Al-Mukarama road.
