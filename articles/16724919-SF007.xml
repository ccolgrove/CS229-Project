'''''Hovercraft''''' was a color vector arcade game by Cinematronics in 1983. The game was basically a futuristic 3D tank game but never reached the full production stage, and is often thought of as being a prototype only. The game possibly never reached full production because of the video game crash of 1983.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}
