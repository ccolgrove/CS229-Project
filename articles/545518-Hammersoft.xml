The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] began conducting a '''Men's Division I [[college soccer|Soccer]] Championship''' tournament in 1959 with an eight-team tournament. Currently, the tournament field consists of 48 teams. [[Saint Louis University|Saint Louis]] (10 titles), [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]] (7 titles), and [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] (6 titles) have historically been the most successful Division I schools.

The semifinals and finals of the Division I championship, for both men and women, are also known as the '''College Cup'''.

==Championship format==
The NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship is a 48-team, single-elimination tournament. 22 spots are reserved for the winners of automatic bids. Conferences granted automatic qualification are:

*[[America East Conference]]
* [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]
* [[Atlantic Sun Conference]]
* [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]
* [[Big East Conference]]
* [[Big South Conference]]
* [[Big Ten Conference]]
* [[Big West Conference]]
* [[Colonial Athletic Association]]
* [[Conference USA]]
*[[Horizon League]]

* [[Northeast Conference]]
* [[Pacific-10 Conference]]
* [[Patriot League]]
* [[Southern Conference]]
* [[The Summit League]]
*[[West Coast Conference]]
{{EndMultiCol}}

Each conference determines the format for their conference championship, which determines the school who receives the automatic bid. Many use conference tournaments, although some conferences award the championship and automatic bid to the regular season champion. The remaining 26 teams have received at-large bids. The at-large teams are selected by a committee consisting of representatives from each of the eight regions the NCAA has divided the country into. The committee uses a number of criteria, the most influential being the [[Ratings Percentage Index]], a mathematical formula designed to objectively compare the results and strength of schedule of all Division I teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/library/handbooks/soccer/2005/2005_d1_m_soccer_handbook.pdf 2005 NCAA D-I Men's Soccer Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The top 16 teams are seeded into the bracket and receive first round byes. The other 32 are grouped by geographical proximity. The first four rounds are played on campus sites, with matches being hosted by the higher seed. The College Cup, comprising the semifinal and final matches, is played at a predetermined site. 
The 2010, and 52nd College Cup was held at [[Harder Stadium]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. [[Akron Zips|Akron]] won the 2010 College Cup, beating [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]] 1-0 in the final.
