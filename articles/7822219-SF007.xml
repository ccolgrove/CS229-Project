'''Tamarin''' is a [[free software|free]] [[virtual machine]] with [[just-in-time compilation]] (JIT) support intended to implement the fourth edition of the [[ECMAScript]] standard.

Tamarin was developed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe Labs]] for its [[ActionScript]] virtual machine used in [[Adobe Flash|Flash 9]] and up and open-sourced in 2006.

==Tamarin and Mozilla==
The code was donated to the [[Mozilla]] project on November 7, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There were plans to use Tamarin as part of [[Mozilla application framework|Mozilla]] 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and therefore [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]]). The project to integrate Tamarin and [[SpiderMonkey (Javascript engine)|SpiderMonkey]] was called &quot;ActionMonkey&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Tamarin's interpreter turned out to be slower than SpiderMonkey's and because the plans of ECMAScript development shifted from [[ECMAScript#Future development|ECMAScript 4]] (which was partially implemented by Tamarin) to [[ECMAScript Harmony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tamarin continues to be used in [[Adobe Flash Player]], but it has not replaced [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey]] as the [[JavaScript engine]] of Mozilla applications.

The only part of Tamarin used in modern Mozilla applications (e.g. Firefox 3.5+) via [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey]] is '''NanoJIT''', a module that's used to generate native code when performing [[just-in-time compilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==What Tamarin is not==
Adobe contributed code for its virtual machine and the [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compiler. The JavaScript compiler (the program generating [[bytecode]] from JavaScript [[source code]]) was not contributed as part of Tamarin.

Tamarin is not the same as Adobe's [[Flash Player]], which remains closed source. The virtual machine is only a part of Flash Player.

==Related projects==
Two projects related to Tamarin were announced on July 25, 2007 in [[Brendan Eich]]'s keynote at The Ajax Experience West: IronMonkey and ScreamingMonkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; IronMonkey is a project to map [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]] to Tamarin led by Seo Sanghyeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ScreamingMonkey's goal is to allow Tamarin to run within non-Mozilla browsers (thus allowing them to understand JavaScript 2), starting with [[Internet Explorer]]. The project is led by Mark Hammond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Tamarin:ScreamingMonkey&amp;oldid=94625

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither project had production-quality releases and their current status is unclear.

==Etymology==
Both SpiderMonkey and Tamarin fulfill closely related goals and so were both dubbed after monkeys (the [[spider monkey]] and the [[tamarin]], respectively).
