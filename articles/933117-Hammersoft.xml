'''Filmmaking''' (often referred to in an academic context as '''film production''') is the process of making a [[film]], from an initial [[Narrative|story]], [[idea]], or commission, through [[scriptwriting]], [[Casting_(performing_arts)|casting]], shooting, directing, [[Film_editing|editing]], and [[Film_screening|screening]] the finished product before an [[audience]] that  may result in a [[theatrical release]] or [[television program]]. Filmmaking takes place all over the planet in a huge range of [[economic]], [[social]], and [[political]] contexts, and using a variety of technologies and [[cinematic techniques]]. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and takes from a few months to several years to complete, although it may take longer if there are production issues, and the record for the longest production time for a major film is ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 28 years development.

== Parts ==
Film production occurs in three stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiff |first=Josef |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Independent Filmmaking |publisher=Alpha Books |year=2005 |pages=26â28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Filmmaking#Pre-production|Pre-production]]'''&amp;mdash;Preparations are made for the shoot, in which cast and [[film crew]] are hired, locations are selected, and sets are built. This is also the stage in which the ideas for the film are created, rights to books/plays are bought, etc.
* '''[[Filmmaking#Production|Production]]'''&amp;mdash;The raw elements for the finished film are recorded.
* '''[[Filmmaking#Post-production|Post-Production]]'''&amp;mdash;The film is edited; production sound (dialogue) is concurrently (but separately) edited,  music tracks (and songs) are composed, performed and recorded, if a film is sought to have a score; sound effects are designed and recorded; and any other computer-graphic 'visual' effects are digitally added, all sound elements are mixed into &quot;stems&quot; then the stems are mixed then married to picture and the film is fully completed (&quot;locked&quot;).


=== Development ===
In this stage, the project's [[Film producer|producer]]  finds a story, which may come from a book, play, another film, a true story, original idea, etc. After identifying a theme or underlying message, the producer works with writers to prepare a synopsis. Next they produce a [[step outline]], which breaks the story down into one-paragraph scenes that concentrate on dramatic structure.  Then, they prepare a [[film treatment|treatment]], a 25 to 30 page description of the story, its mood, and characters. This usually has little dialogue and [[stage directions|stage direction]], but often contains drawings that help visualize key points. Another way is to produce a [[scriptment]] once a synopsis is produced.

Next, a [[screenwriter]] writes a [[screenplay]] over a period of several months. The screenwriter may rewrite it several times to improve dramatization, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue, and overall style. However, producers often skip the previous steps and develop submitted screenplays which investors, studios, and other interested parties assess through a process called [[script coverage]]. A [[film distributor]] may be contacted at an early stage to assess the likely market and potential financial success of the film. Hollywood distributors adopt a hard-headed business approach and consider factors such as the [[film genre]], the target audience, the historical success of similar films, the actors who might appear in the film, and potential directors. All these factors imply a certain appeal of the film to a possible audience and hence the number of &quot;A.I.S.&quot; (or &quot;Asses in Seats&quot;) during the theatrical release. Not all films make a profit from the theatrical release alone, so film companies take DVD sales and worldwide distribution rights into account.

The producer and screenwriter prepare a film [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]], or treatment, and present it to potential financiers.  If the pitch is successful, the film receives a &quot;[[green light]]&quot;, meaning someone offers financial backing: typically a major [[film studio]], [[film council]], or independent investor. The parties involved negotiate a deal and sign contracts.
Once all parties have met and the deal has been set, the film may proceed into the pre-production period. By this stage, the film should have a clearly defined marketing strategy and target audience.

=== Pre-Production ===
In pre-production, every step of actually creating the film is carefully designed and planned. The [[production company]] is created and a [[production office]] established. The production is [[storyboard]]ed and visualized with the help of [[illustrator]]s and [[concept artist]]s. A [[production budget]] is drawn up to plan expenditures for the film.  For major productions, [[insurance]] is procured to protect against accidents.  

The producer hires a crew. The nature of the film, and the budget, determine the size and type of crew used during filmmaking. Many Hollywood [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] employ a cast and crew of hundreds, while a low-budget, [[independent film]] may be made by a skeleton crew of eight or nine (or fewer). These are typical crew positions:

* The [[film director|director]] is primarily responsible for the storytelling, creative decisions and acting of the film.
* The [[assistant director]] (AD) manages the [[shooting schedule]] and logistics of the production, among other tasks.  There are several types of AD, each with different responsibilities.
* The [[casting director]] finds actors to fill the parts in the script. This normally requires that actors audition.
* The [[location manager]] finds and manages film locations. Most pictures are shot in the controllable environment of a studio [[sound stage]] but occasionally, outdoor sequences call for filming [[location shooting|on location]].
* The production manager manages the [[production budget]] and [[production schedule]]. They also report, on behalf of the production office, to the [[studio executives]] or financiers of the film.
* The [[cinematographer|director of photography]] (DoP) is the [[cinematographer]] who supervises the [[photography]] of the entire film
* The [[director of audiography]] (DoA) is the [[Audiography|audiographer]] who supervises the [[audiography]] of the entire film. For productions in the [[Western culture|Western world]] this role is also known as either [[sound designer]] or [[Supervising Sound Editor|supervising sound editor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Film Sound: Theory and Practice'', Edited by Elisabeth Weis and John Belton, Columbia University Press (1985) - Page 361&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[production sound mixer]] is the head of the sound department during the production stage of filmmaking.  They record and mix the audio on set - dialogue, [[Presence (sound recording)|presence]] and [[sound effects]] in [[mono]] and [[Ambience (sound recording)|ambience]] in stereo.&lt;ref&gt;''Sound for Digital Video'' by Tomlinson Holman (Focal Press) 2005 (p. 162)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogue Editing for Motion Pictures'' by John Purcell (Focal Press) 2007 (p. 148)&lt;/ref&gt; They work with the [[Boom operator (media)|boom operator]], Director, DoA, DoP, and First AD.

* The [[sound designer]] creates the aural conception of the film,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincent LoBrutto 1994&quot;&gt;Sound-On-Film by Vincent LoBrutto (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; working with the [[Supervising Sound Editor|supervising sound editor]]. On some productions the [[sound designer]] plays the role of a [[director of audiography]].
* The [[composer]] creates new music for the film. (usually not until post-production)
* The [[production designer]] creates the visual conception of the film, working with the [[art director]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vincent LoBrutto 1994&quot;/&gt;
* The [[art director]] manages the art department, which makes [[production sets]]
* The [[costume designer]] creates the clothing for the characters in the film working closely with the actors, as well as other departments.
* The make up and hair designer works closely with the costume designer in addition to create a certain look for a character.
* The [[storyboard artist]] creates visual images to help the director and production designer communicate their ideas to the production team.
* The [[choreographer]] creates and coordinates the movement and dance - typically for musicals.  Some films also credit a [[fight choreographer]].

=== Production ===

{{see also|Cinematography|Audiography}}

In production, the [[video production]]/film is created and shot. More crew will be recruited at this stage, such as the [[property master]], [[script supervisor]], [[assistant director]]s, stills [[photographer]], [[film editor|picture editor]], and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]]s. These are just the most common roles in filmmaking; the [[production office]] will be free to create any unique blend of roles to suit the various responsibilities possible during the production of a film.

A typical day's shooting begins with the crew arriving on the set/location by their call time. Actors usually have their own separate call times. Since set construction, [[Set dresser|dressing]] and [[lighting]] can take many hours or even days, they are often set up in advance.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Grip (job)|grip]], electric and production design crews are typically a step ahead of the camera and sound departments: for efficiency's sake, while a scene is being filmed, they are already preparing the next one.

While the crew prepare their equipment, the actors are wardrobed in their costumes and attend the hair and make-up departments. The actors rehearse the [[film script|script]] and [[Blocking (stage)|blocking]] with the director, and the camera and sound crews rehearse with them and make final tweaks. Finally, the action is shot in as many [[take]]s as the director wishes. Most American productions follow a specific procedure:

The [[assistant director]] (AD) calls &quot;picture is up!&quot; to inform everyone that a take is about to be recorded, and then &quot;quiet, everyone!&quot; Once everyone is ready to shoot, the AD calls &quot;roll sound&quot; (if the take involves sound), and the [[production sound mixer]] will start their equipment, record a verbal slate of the take's information, and announce &quot;sound speed&quot; when they are ready. The AD follows with &quot;roll camera&quot;, answered by &quot;speed!&quot; by the [[camera operator]] once the camera is recording. The [[clapper loader|clapper]], who is already in front of the camera with the [[clapperboard]], calls &quot;marker!&quot; and slaps it shut. If the take involves extras or background action, the AD will cue them (&quot;action background!&quot;), and last is the director, telling the actors &quot;action!&quot;.

A take is over when the director calls &quot;cut!&quot;, and camera and sound stop recording. The script supervisor will note any continuity issues and the sound and camera teams log technical notes for the take on their respective report sheets. If the director decides additional takes are required, the whole process repeats. Once satisfied, the crew moves on to the next camera angle or &quot;setup,&quot; until the whole scene is &quot;covered.&quot; When shooting is finished for the scene, the assistant director declares a &quot;wrap&quot; or &quot;moving on,&quot; and the crew will &quot;strike,&quot; or dismantle, the set for that scene. 

At the end of the day, the director approves the next day's shooting schedule and a daily progress report is sent to the production office. This includes the report sheets from continuity, sound, and camera teams. [[Daily call sheet|Call sheet]]s are distributed to the cast and crew to tell them when and where to turn up the next shooting day. Later on, the director, producer, other department heads, and, sometimes, the cast, may gather to watch that day or yesterday's footage, called ''[[dailies]]'', and review their work.

With workdays often lasting 14 or 18 hours in remote locations, film production tends to create a team spirit. When the entire film is ''in the can,'' or in the completion of the production phase, it is customary for the production office to arrange a [[wrap party]], to thank all the cast and crew for their efforts.

=== Post-production ===
{{main|Post-production}}
Here the video/film is assembled by the [[film editor|video/film editor]]. The modern use of video in the filmmaking process has resulted in two workflow variants: one using entirely film, and the other using a mixture of film and video.

This is the final stage, where the film is released to [[cinemas]] or, occasionally, to consumer media ([[DVD]], [[VCD]], [[VHS]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]) or direct download from a provider. The film is duplicated as required for distribution to cinemas. Press kits, posters, and other advertising materials are published and the film is advertised and [[film promotion|promoted]].

[[Film distributor]]s usually release a film with a launch party, press releases, interviews with the press, press preview screenings, and [[film festival]] screenings. Most films have a [[website]]. The film plays at selected cinemas and the [[DVD]] typically is released a few months later. The distribution rights for the film and DVD are also usually sold for worldwide distribution. The distributor and the production company share profits..

== Independent filmmaking ==
{{main|Independent film}}
Filmmaking also takes place outside of the mainstream and is commonly called [[independent filmmaking]]. Since the introduction of [[DV]] technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, traditional distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. In the past, most independent filmmakers have relied on [[film festival]]s to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. However, the [[Internet]] has allowed for relatively inexpensive distribution of independent films. As a result several companies have emerged to assist filmmakers in getting independent movies seen and sold via mainstream internet marketplaces, oftentimes adjacent to popular Hollywood titles. With internet movie distribution, independent filmmakers who fail to garner a traditional distribution deal now have the ability to reach global audiences.
