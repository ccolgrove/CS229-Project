'''Process Explorer''' is a [[freeware]] [[computer program]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] created by [[Sysinternals]], which has been acquired by [[Microsoft Corporation]].

Process Explorer is a system monitoring and examination utility. It provides the functionality of [[Windows Task Manager]] along with a rich set of features for collecting information about [[Process (computing)|process]]es running on the user's system. It can be used as the first step in debugging software or system problems.

Process Explorer can be used to track down problems. For example, it provides a means to list or search for named resources that are held by a process or all processes. This can be used to track down what is holding a file open and preventing its use by another program. Or as another example, it can show the command lines used to start a program, allowing otherwise identical processes to be distinguished. Or like Task Manager, it can show a process that is maxing out the CPU, but unlike Task Manager it can show which thread (with the callstack) is using the CPU â information that is not even available under a debugger.

Process Explorer is one of a set of administration and monitoring utilities available from the [[Microsoft]] [[Sysinternals]] website.

== History ==
Process Explorer began in the early [[Sysinternals]] days as two separate utilities, HandleEx and DLLView, which were merged in 2001 &lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2011/06/14/rtm-d-today-windows-sysinternals-administrator-s-reference.aspx RTMâd today: Windows Sysinternals Administrator's Reference] &lt;/ref&gt; Until 2008, Process Explorer worked on [[Windows 9x]]/[[Windows Me|Me]], [[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 2000]]. Versions of Process Explorer up to 12.04 work on [[Windows 2000]]; versions 14.0 and higher do not. The current version runs on [[Windows XP]] and upwards. Version 15 added GPU monitoring for [[Windows Vista]] and later.

== Features ==
* Hierarchical view of processes.
* Ability to display an icon and company name next to each process.
* Live CPU activity graph in the task bar.
* Ability to suspend selected process.
* Ability to raise the window attached to a process, thus &quot;unhiding&quot; it.
* Complete process tree can be killed.
* Interactively alter a service process' access security
* Interactively set the priority of a process
* Disambiguates service executables which perform multiple service functions.  For example, when the pointer is placed over a svchost.exe, it will tell if it is the one performing automatic updates/secondary logon/etc., or the one providing RPC, or the one performing terminal services, and so on.
