After the release of a slimmer, lighter, remodeled version of the PlayStation Portable (the PSP-2000/&quot;Slim &amp; Lite&quot;) in early September 2007, sales quadrupled in the United Kingdom the following week and increased by nearly 200% in North America for the month of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15555 |title=PSP Slim Release Quadruples UK Sales| date=2007-09-21| publisher=Gamasutra| accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3163779| title=September NPD| date=2007-10-18| last=Klepek| first=Patrick| publisher=1UP| accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was later replaced by another remodeling, the PSP-3000, which included a new screen and an inbuilt microphone. Since then, a complete redesign called the [[PSP Go]] has been released, which was sold alongside the PSP-3000. In 2011 a budget model, the [[PSP-E1000]], was announced. The PSP line is due to be succeeded by the [[PlayStation Vita]] in late 2011/early 2012 (varying by region).

===Launch===
{{Main|PlayStation Portable launch}}
On October 17, 2004, Sony announced that the PSP would launch in Japan on {{Nowrap|December 12}}, 2004, at a price of [[Japanese yen|Â¥]]19,800 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]181 in 2004) for the base model and Â¥24,800 (about US$226 in 2004) for the Value System.&lt;ref name=&quot;JPlaunchskus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/560/560947p1.html| title=Japanese Price and Date set| date=2004-10-17| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console's launch was a success with over 200,000 units sold the first day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20041213-4458.html| title=200k pretty sweet purchases during Sony's Japan PSP launch| date=2004-12-13| first=Fred| last=Locklear| publisher=Ars Technica| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different color variations were also sold in bundle packs, which cost more than usual, around $200.
Sony announced on February 3, 2005, that the PSP would go on sale in North America on {{Nowrap|March 24}}, 2005, in one configuration for a [[Suggested retail price|MSRP]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]249/[[Canadian dollar|CA$]]299.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/250| title=PSP (PlayStation Portable) set to release on {{Nowrap|March 24}} across North America| date=2005-02-03| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expressed concern over the high price,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/584/584983p1.html| title=PSP US Launch Date and Price Revealed| date=2005-02-03| first=Matt| last=Casamassina| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was almost US$20 higher than the system's price in Japan and more than $100 higher than the recently launched [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/04/sony_psp_us_launch/| title=Sony names US PSP launch date, price| date=2005-02-04| first=Tony| last=Smith| publisher=The Register| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the concerns, the PSP's North American launch was a success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/598/598595p1.html| title=PSP Launch: The Sony Metreon| date=2005-03-24| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/03/24/news_6121009.html| title=Spot On: The US PSP Launch| date=2005-03-24| author=Thorsen, Tor; Tim Surette| publisher=GameSpot| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; although reports two weeks later indicated that the system was not selling as well as expected despite Sony's claim that 500,000 units had been sold in the first two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/42013.html| title=Sony PSP Sales get off to lackluster start| date=2004-04-05| first=Jay| last=Lyman| publisher=technewsworld.com| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/News/PressReleases/268| title=PSP (PlayStation Portable) sells more than a half million units in its first two days| date=2005-04-06| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSP was originally to have a simultaneous [[PAL region]] and North American launch,&lt;ref name=&quot;GSE32004&quot; /&gt; but on {{Nowrap|March 15}}, 2005, Sony announced that the PAL region launch would be delayed because of high demand for the console in Japan and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingworldx.com/news/PSPReleasePostponedinEurop.shtml| title=PSP Release Postponed in Europe| date=2005-03-15| publisher=GamingWorldX| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on {{Nowrap|April 25}}, 2005, Sony announced that the PSP would launch in the PAL region on {{Nowrap|September 1}}, 2005, for [[Euro|â¬]]249/[[Pound sterling|Â£]]179.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pocket-lint.co.uk/news/news.phtml/1154/2178/view.phtml| title=Sony sets launch date in Europe for PSP| date=2005-04-25| first=Stuart| last=Miles| publisher=pocket-lint.co.uk| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony defended the high price, which was nearly US$100 higher than in North America, by pointing out that North American consumers had to pay local [[sales tax]]es and that the [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] (sales tax) was higher in the UK than the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4481991.stm| title=PSP European launch in September| date=2005-03-26| publisher=The BBC| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the high price, the console's PAL region launch was a resounding success, selling more than 185,000 units in the UK alone, selling out of all stock nationwide in the UK within three hours of launch, more than doubling the previous first-day sales record of 87,000 units set by the [[Nintendo DS]]. The system also enjoyed great success in other areas of the PAL region with more than 25,000 units preordered in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2005/08/31/news_6132318.html| title=PSP hits Oceania and Europe| date=2005-08-31| first=Tim| last=Surette| publisher=GameSpot| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly one million units sold across Europe in the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://play.tm/story/6430| title=European PSP sells big| date=2005-09-05| first=Luke| last=Guttridge| publisher=Play.tm| accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redesigns==
===PSP-2000===
[[File:PSP-2000.jpg|thumb|PSP-2000]]
The PSP-2000 (marketed in [[PAL region|PAL]] areas as &quot;PSP Slim &amp; Lite&quot; and still marketed as PSP in North America, Japan, China, India, Italy, and Portugal)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2007/08/08/h-103_76465_4807.jpg.jpg|title= PSP Slim &amp; Lite box image|date= August 8, 2007|publisher= Famitsu|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first redesign of the PlayStation Portable.

At [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2007, [[Sony]] released information about a slimmer and lighter version of the PlayStation Portable.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonyE3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.playstation.com/psp/news/articles/detail/item71810/Get-the-skinny!/ |title=Get the skinny! |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Europe |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2008-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new PSP was announced to be 33% lighter and 19% slimmer than the original PSP system.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonyE3&quot; /&gt; The model numbers were changed to '''PSP-2000''', following the previous region-based numbering scheme ([[cf.]] the PSP-1000 numbering scheme of the &quot;old&quot; PSP model).

It was released on August 30, 2007, in Hong Kong, on {{Nowrap|September 5}}, 2007, in Europe, on {{Nowrap|September 6}}, 2007, in North America, {{Nowrap|September 7}}, 2007, in South Korea and {{Nowrap|September 12}}, 2007, in Australia.

===PSP-3000===

In comparison to the PSP-2000, the PSP-3000 (marketed in PAL areas as &quot;PSP Slim &amp; Lite (with enhanced screen + built in microphone)&quot;  and still marketed as PSP in North America and Japan) has an improved LCD screen featuring an increased color range, five times the contrast ratio, half the pixel response time to reduce ghosting and blurring effects, new sub-pixel structure, and anti-reflective technology to improve outdoor playability. The disc tray, logos, and buttons have all been redesigned and the system now has a microphone. In addition, all games may now be output by component or composite using the video out cable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sony PSP-3000 Hands-On&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://uk.gamespot.com/features/6196930/index.html|title= Sony PSP-3000 Hands-On|date= August 28, 2008|publisher= Gamespot UK|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battery===
[[File:Psp-battery-types.jpg|right|thumb|Two different battery size standards]]
To make the PSP slimmer, the capacity of the battery was reduced by 1/3. However, due to more efficient power usage, the run time of the PSP is still the same as the previous model. Older model batteries will still work which extends the amount of playing time. However, the battery cover on the newer model does not fit over the older battery due to its bulkier size. The batteries take about one and a half hours to charge and last roughly 4.5â7 hours depending on factors such as screen brightness settings, [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] and volume levels.&lt;ref&gt;PlayStation Portable Safety and Support Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December 2007, Sony released the PSP Extended Life Battery Kit, which includes a 2200&amp;nbsp;mAh battery with a battery cover that fits over the bulkier battery included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2007/11/27/new-psp-battery-and-covers-coming-soon/ |title=PlayStation.Blog Â» New PSP Battery and Covers Coming Soon |publisher=Blog.us.playstation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially only available in North America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  The kit comes with two  new battery covers, one black and one silver.  In March 2008 the Extended Battery Kit was released in Japan.  However, unlike the North American kit, the batteries are sold individually with one specific cover. There are three separate kits; one kit includes a black cover, one includes a silver cover and one includes a white cover.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}{{-}}

===External appearance, inputs and outputs===
The PSP Slim &amp; Lite has a new gloss finish.  The serial port was also modified in order to accommodate a new video-out feature (while rendering older PSP remote controls incompatible).  In PSP-2000, PSP games will only output to external monitors or TVs in progressive scan mode, so televisions incapable of supporting progressive scan will not display PSP games. Non-game video outputs fine in either progressive or interlaced mode. [[USB]] charging was made possible (the PSP Slim will only charge while it is in &quot;USB mode&quot;. It cannot be charged via USB when playing a game). However, there are unofficial USB charge plug-in downloads for charging the PSP with a USB without the need for being in USB mode. The D-Pad was raised in response to complaints of poor performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=var authorId = &quot;41536478&quot; by Anoop Gantayat |url=http://uk.psp.ign.com/articles/673/673821p1.html |title=IGN: Capcom Fixes PSP Pad |publisher=Uk.psp.ign.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hands on with PSP Slim |publisher=pocketgamer.co.UK |url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/PSP/Sony+PSP/news.asp?c=3606 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while buttons offer improved responsiveness, confirmed in the [[GameSpot]] &quot;hands-on&quot; review: &quot;''several GameSpot editors have noticed that the d-pad and buttons on the new PSP provide a little more tactile feedback for a better overall feel.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E3 07: Redesigned Sony PSP Hands-On |publisher=GameSpot.com |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/features/6173974/index.html?tag=topslot;title;1 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new simpler and more compact [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] loading tray design was developed, in which the tray swivels out instead of opening up completely, while the Wi-Fi switch was moved to the top of the PSP. To address many consumer complaints about the Memory Stick door breaking off the old PSP, the Memory Stick door has been relocated and redesigned. The speakers were repositioned on the front of the PSP near the top of its screen.  The infra-red port was also removed because it offered no use to the original PSP generation other than in [[PlayStation Portable homebrew|homebrew]] applications.  Its analog stick was also redesigned to be more flexible and is not removable without opening the PSP. The air vent at the top of the original was also removed.

A &quot;[[1seg]]&quot; TV tuner (model PSP-S310) peripheral, designed specifically for the PSP Slim &amp; Lite model, was released in Japan on {{Nowrap|September 20}}, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;1seg&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=&quot;Slimmer and Lighter&quot; New PSP (PlayStation Portable) Comes In Six Color Variations To The Japanese Market |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=2007-07-17 |url=http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/070717e.html |accessdate=2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV output and accessory port===
[[File:Psp-component-cables.jpg|thumb|Component cable, which allows PSP-2000 and -3000 models to output analog [[Stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] and analog component  ([[YPbPr|YP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;]]) video]]
Sony added TV output to the PSP Slim through [[Firmware]] update 3.60. It can output in a conventional aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, [[Composite video|Composite]], [[S-Video]], [[Component video|Component]] ([[YPbPr|YP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[D-Terminal]] (YP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a [[progressive scan]] signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled meaning they are displayed with black [[Windowbox (film)|windowboxing]] when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. Although the user needs component cables and a TV that supports 480p (mainly found in HDTVs) to play PSP format software, a homebrew plugin called FuSa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foosa.do.am |title=FuSa Project - MAIN |publisher=Foosa.do.am |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows anyone with a Slim PSP to view their games on any SDTV or HDTV using Composite or Component cables. The plugin is also advantageous to those with TVs that do support 480p because it allows a full screen (1:1 ratio) viewing of games. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible to be used with a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP.  Sony has released a new version of the remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000.

Sony confirmed a GPS Accessory for the United States at Sony CES 2008. The GPS is to be retailed for the new Slim PSP models. It features maps on a UMD, and offer driving directions and city guide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}{{-}}

===Releases and Limited Edition models===
Limited Edition models began being released in Japan on {{Nowrap|September 12}}, 2007; North America on {{Nowrap|September 5}}, 2007; Australia on {{Nowrap|September 12}}, 2007; UK on {{Nowrap|October 26}}, 2007, and Europe on {{Nowrap|September 5}}, 2007. The PSP-2000 was made available in Piano Black, Ceramic White, Ice Silver, Mint Green, Felicia Blue, Lavender Purple, Deep Red, Matte Bronze, Metallic Blue and Rose Pink as standard colors (not all colors were available in all countries), and had several special edition colored and finished consoles for games including ''[[Final Fantasy&amp;nbsp;VII: Crisis Core]]'' (ice silver engraved), ''[[Star Ocean: First Departure]]'' (felicia blue engraved), ''[[Gundam]]'' (red gloss/matte black), and ''[[Monster Hunter Freedom]]'' (gold silkscreened) PSPs in Japan, ''[[Star Wars]]'' (Darth Vader silkscreened) and ''[[God of War: Chains of Olympus]]'' (Kratos silkscreened) PSPs in North America, a ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (bright yellow with white buttons, analog and UMD drawer) PSP in Australia and New Zealand, and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' (red gloss/matte black) and ''[[Final Fantasy&amp;nbsp;VII: Crisis Core]]'' (ice silver engraved) PSPs in Europe.

===Homebrew===
The [[PlayStation Portable homebrew|homebrew]] community were initially unable to hack the later PSP-2000s and the PSP-3000 because it had a new CPU (motherboards revealed to be TA-088v3 (for PSP Slim) and TA-090v2 (for PSP-3000)) which does not support the PRE IPL Exploit used in hacking the previous versions. This is due to the motherboard having its own PRE IPL where it checks the firmware thoroughly; if passed, the PRE IPL is cut off entirely to prevent unwanted modifications to the system.

In November 2008, [[Datel]] announced a &quot;Lite Blue Tool&quot; battery which allows the PSP-3000 to boot into service mode. This battery is not able to start homebrew as the new PRE-IPL has yet to be cracked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sceners&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sceners.org/?itemid=174|title= Welcome to Sceners.org|year= 2009|publisher= Sceners|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lite Blue Tool was deterred from distribution due to legal action by Sony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://portablevideogamer.com/2009/01/datel-faces-legal-trouble-over-lite-blue-tool/|title= Datel Faces Legal Trouble Over Lite Blue Tool|date= January 11, 2009|publisher= Portable Video Gamer|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, Datel changed the name from Lite Blue Tool to Max Power Digital and changed the description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pspupdates.qj.net/Datel-s-Lite-Blue-Tool-gets-name-change-deletes-PSP-3000-features/pg/49/aid/127769|title= Datel's Lite Blue Tool gets name change, deletes PSP-3000 features|date= January 7, 2009|publisher= QJ.net|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MaTiAz, a known hacker in the PSP hacking community, found an exploit which is done with a US copy of [[GripShift]] and a HEN save game exploit. However, this was only temporary. After the release of this initial hack, a sizable increase in sales of the game was experienced. Many eBay sellers inflated their prices to cash in on the sudden demand. A revised version of the PSP firmware (v5.03) was released shortly after to patch the exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psp-hacks.com/2009/01/03/poc-gripshift-savegame-exploit-found-works-on-psp-3000/|title= POC: GripShift SaveGame Exploit Found; Works on PSP-3000!|date= January 3, 2009|publisher= PSP Hacks|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malloxis found a TIFF crash which is proven to work on 5.02 and 5.03 firmwares for PSP-3000; further crafted and engineered by MaTiAz, the TIFF crash became a TIFF exploit capable of loading an h.bin from the root memorystick. Davee, another hacker, further engineered this exploit with a privilege escalation exploit and created a Homebrew Enabler (HEN) which would allow the execution of unsigned code by users. In firmware revision 5.50, the TIFF vulnerability was removed, preventing any further firmwares being affected by the exploit. The HEN for the TIFF exploit, which was called &quot;ChickHEN&quot;, was released on {{Nowrap|May 5}}, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psp-hacks.com/2009/05/06/chickhen-homebrew-enabler-released/|title= ChickHEN Homebrew Enabler Released: Homebrew on PSP-3000!|date= May 6, 2009|publisher= PSP Hacks|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psp-hacks.com/2009/05/06/chickhen-homebrew-enabler-r2-released/|title= ChickHEN Homebrew Enabler R2 Released: Homebrew on the PSP-3000, For Real.|date= May 6, 2009|publisher= PSP Hacks|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://davee.x-fusion.co.uk/|title= Davee's Devsite|publisher= Davee|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2009, custom firmware version 5.03GEN-A for HEN was released, which is compatible with both PSP-2000 v3 and PSP-3000. It allows users to play game backups (ISO/CSO), PS1 games, and includes access to PSN, VSH, and recovery mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pspslimhacks.com/custom-firmware-503-gen-a-for-hen-faq/|title= Custom Firmware 5.03 GEN-A for HEN FAQ|date= June 6, 2009|publisher= PSP Slim hacks|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a major step forward in ending Sony's PSP-3000 piracy protection. Two days later, on {{Nowrap|June 7}}, 2009, a duo of hackers (Xenogears and Becus25) released custom firmware support software based on a modified work of the released 5.03GEN-A for the formerly unhackable handheld called &quot;Custom Firmware Enabler 3.01&quot; in which PSP-3000 users can install custom firmware and load those firmware's files onto the PSP's RAM with the direct usage of &quot;ChickHEN&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sceners&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.psp-hacks.com/2009/06/08/custom-firmware-enabler-301-released-now-supporting-the-psp-3000/|title= Custom Firmware Enabler 3.10 Released: Now Supporting the PSP-3000! *Updated*|date= June 8, 2009|publisher= PSP Hacks|accessdate= November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2010, a user-mode exploit was revealed in the demo of the game ''[[Patapon 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wololo.net/wagic/2010/03/29/way-to-keep-a-secret-malloxis/|title= Way to keep a Secret, Malloxis|date= March 29, 2010|publisher= Wololo|accessdate= June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was quickly followed by the public release of &quot;Half-Byte Loader&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wololo.net/wagic/2010/03/29/devs-only-valentine-half-byte-loader-port-to-the-patapon2-demo-exploit/|title= Valentine: Half-Byte Loader port to the Patapon2 demo exploit|date= March 29, 2010|publisher= Wololo|accessdate= June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a piece of software allowing to load homebrew software on all PSP models (including the PSP Go) running firmwares less than 6.30. HBL has also been ported to ''[[Everybody's Golf]]'', allowing HBL to run on 6.30 and 6.31 firmwares.

On December 24, 2010, Total_Noob's HEN (6.20 TN-A) was released, allowing users to run Homebrew on any PSP Console with the 6.20 firmware.

On December 25, 2010, Liquidzigong, a well known hacker with numerous identities (such as hrimfaxi and Virtuous Flame), released a Homebrew application for 6.20 TN-A called Prometheus ISO Loader. This application allowed users to run game-backups on their console, which would have not been possible using the stand alone HEN.

On December 30, 2010, Total_Noob updated his HEN to the version B (6.20 TN-B), which featured a way to downgrade ALL the PSPs, including those with TA-088v3 motherboard, 3000+ and Go, breaking the long-established &quot;barrier&quot; that prevented these PSP versions from downgrading.

On January 2, 2011, Mathieulh announced the discovery the PSP's master keys, allowing homebrew to run on the PSP without any firmware modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psp-hacks.com/2011/01/02/encryptsign-anything-psp-homebrew-plugins-custom-firmwares/|title=Encrypt/Sign Anything PSP â Homebrew, Plugins, Custom Firmwares|date={{Date|2011-01-02|mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-01-03|mdy}}|publisher=PSP-Hacks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2011, Virtuous Flame and Coldbird updated their HEN to the Version B3 (6.35 PRO-B3). This provided users with the ability to run ISO and CSO game-backups, run Homebrew games and applications, to run PS1 Games, and to run Plugins, while retaining access the [[PSN]].

On May 29, 2011 the Pro CFW became open source and added compatibility with firmware version 6.39; this was upgraded on August 25, 2011 to version 6.60 compatibility.

===Hardware issues===
On release, an issue with interlacing was noticed on the PSP-3000 screen when objects were in motion. Gaming Bits (among others) did an [http://www.gamingbits.com/content/view/4785/2/ in-depth review] of the differences between the two versions, noting the interlacing issues, and about a week later Sony announced that they would not be releasing a software update to address the issue:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/sony-responds-to-psp-3000-screen-issues/ |title=Sony responds to PSP 3000 screen issues |accessdate=2009-07-10 |author=  John P.

Installed with this new LCD device, PSP-3000 offers more natural and vibrant colors on its screen, but the scan lines have come out to be more visible as a result of improving response time to alleviate the afterimages on PSP-3000. Since this is due to hardware specification, there are no plans for a system software update concerning this issue.}}

==PSP Go==
[[File:PSP GO 0104.jpg|thumb|PSP Go]]
{{Main|PSP Go}}
The PSP Go was revealed on May 30, 2009, in the June episode of the PlayStation Network online magazine [[Qore (PlayStation Network)|Qore]] and was later officially announced on {{Nowrap|June 2}}, 2009, at [[E3 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=now to post a comment! |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCdN0Vh2duk&amp;hd=1 |title=PSP GO â QORE June 2009 â HD |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSP Go features [[Bluetooth]] functionality, a smaller {{convert|3.8|in|mm|adj=on}} screen and weighs 43% less than the original PSP. Instead of the [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] drive as found on previous models, the PSP Go has 16&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] of internal flash memory and a [[Memory Stick Micro]] port that accepts cards up to 16&amp;nbsp;GB. Currently, the PSP Go has a max memory of 32&amp;nbsp;GB, but the M2 memory can be increased in firmware updates. Games must be downloaded from the [[PlayStation Store]]. The sliding mechanism on the screen hides the main face buttons and the analog 'nub' when not in use. With the release of the [[PSP Go]], most future PSP games will also receive a PlayStation Store release,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} whereas only a handful of games were available before.

Sony announced in April 2011 that it would stop production of the PSP Go to focus resources on developing the [[PlayStation Vita]] (then known as the NGP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Narcisse | first = Evan | title = Sony Confirms Death of PSPGo, Will Keep Making PSP-3000 | work = www.time.com | date = 2011-04-20 | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/04/20/sony-confirms-death-of-pspgo-will-keep-making-psp-3000s/ | accessdate = 2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, [[Sony Computer Entertainment of America|SCEA]] clarified that the PSP Go would still be produced for the North American market.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSPGoNA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/21/sony-continuing-production-of-psp-go-in-america/|title=Sony 'continuing production of PSP Go' in America|date={{Date||mdy}}|accessdate={{Date|2011-04-21|mdy}}|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

[[File:PSP White.png|thumb|A ceramic white PSP-1000. The shoulder buttons are on top, the directional pad on the left with the analog 'nub' directly below it, the PlayStation face buttons on the right and a row of secondary buttons below the screen.]]
The PlayStation Portable uses the common &quot;slab&quot; or &quot;[[Bar (form)|candybar]]&quot; form factor, measures approximately 17 Ã 7.3 Ã 2.2&amp;nbsp;cm (6.7 Ã 2.9 Ã 0.9&amp;nbsp;in), and weighs 280&amp;nbsp;g (9.88&amp;nbsp;oz). The front of the console is dominated by the system's 11&amp;nbsp;cm (4.3&amp;nbsp;in) [[LCD]] screen, which is capable of 480 Ã 272&amp;nbsp;pixel video playback with 16.77&amp;nbsp;million colors. Also on the front are the four PlayStation face buttons ([[File:PlayStationTriangle.svg|Triangle]], [[File:PlayStationCircle.svg|Circle]], [[File:PlayStationX.svg|X]], [[File:PlayStationSquare.svg|Square]]), the directional pad, the analog 'nub', and several other buttons. In addition, the system includes two shoulder buttons and a [[USB 2.0|USB 2.0 mini-B]] port on the top of the console and a [[Wireless LAN Network|WLAN]] switch and power cable input on the bottom. The back of the PSP features a read-only [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] drive for movies and games, and a reader compatible with Sony's [[Memory Stick|Memory Stick Duo]] [[flash memory|flash card]]s is located on the left of the system. Other features include an [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]] compatible infrared port (discontinued in PSP-2000 and later series), built in stereo speakers and headphone port, and [[IEEE 802.11b-1999|IEEE 802.11b]] [[Wi-Fi]] for access to the [[Internet]], ad-hoc multiplayer gaming, and data transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCEAspecs&quot; /&gt;

The PSP uses two 333&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] [[MIPS architecture|MIPS32]] R4000-based [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s, a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]  with 2&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] onboard [[Dynamic random access memory#Video DRAM (VRAM)|VRAM]] running at 166&amp;nbsp;MHz, and includes 32&amp;nbsp;MB main [[Random access memory|RAM]] and 4&amp;nbsp;MB embedded [[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] in total.&lt;ref name=&quot;SCEAspecs&quot; /&gt; The hardware was originally forced to run more slowly than it was capable of and most games ran at 222&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3160506| title=PSP Brought up to Speed with 3.50 firmware| date=2007-06-22| first=Andrew| last=Hayward| publisher=1UP| accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with firmware update 3.50 on May 31, 2007, Sony removed this limit and allowed new games to run at a full 333&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/47564| title=Sony Confirms Full PSP CPU Speed| date=2007-06-22| first=Chris| last=Faylor| publisher=Shacknews| accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PSP includes an 1800&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere-hour|mAh]] battery (1200&amp;nbsp;mAh on the 2000 and 3000 models) that will provide about 4â6&amp;nbsp;hours of gameplay, 4â5&amp;nbsp;hours of video playback, or 8â11&amp;nbsp;hours of audio playback.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNPSPFAQ&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/574/574557p6.html| title=Hard Charging: PSP Battery life â page 6| date=2004-12-20| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official accessories for the console include an AC adapter, car adapter, headset, headphones with remote control, extended-life 2200&amp;nbsp;mAh battery, battery charger, carrying case, accessories pouch and cleaning cloth, and system pouch and wrist strap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Accessories| title=PSP Accessories| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony has included the ability for the operating system, referred to as the ''System Software'', to be updated.&lt;ref name=&quot;SYSupdate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The updates can be downloaded directly from the [[Internet]] using the [System Update] feature under [Settings] in the [[XrossMediaBar|XMB]]. Alternatively, they can be downloaded to a computer from the official PlayStation website, placed on a [[Memory Stick Duo]] ([[Memory Stick Micro]] for PSP Go models) in following directory: PSP â GAME â UPDATE â EBOOT.PBP, and subsequently installed on the system. Updates can also be installed from [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] game discs that require the update to run the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;SYSupdate&quot; /&gt; The Japanese version of the [[Playstation 3|PS3]] allows the System Software to be updated by downloading the System Software onto the Hard Drive then to the PSP. Sony has prevented users from downgrading the PSP to an earlier version of the System Software that is currently installed.

While System Software updates can be used with consoles from any region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trejan.com/projects/psp/| title=Projects - Sony PSP| publisher=trejan.com| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony recommends only downloading updates released for the region corresponding to the system's place of purchase.&lt;ref name=&quot;SYSupdate&quot; /&gt; System Software updates have added various features including a web browser;&lt;ref name=&quot;v200&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm#update200| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Flash Player|Adobe Flash]] support;&lt;ref name=&quot;v270&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm#update270| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional codecs for images, audio and video;&lt;ref name=&quot;v200&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm#update260| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PlayStation 3]] connectivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm#update303| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patches against several security exploits, vulnerabilities and execution of [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm#update152| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/psp/history/index.htm#update282| title=&lt;nowiki&gt;PSPÂ® Update History | System Updates | Support - PlayStation.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;| [[publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment]]| accessdate={{Date|2010-10-18|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most current version is v6.60.

===Web browser===
[[File:PSP Browser.jpg|thumb|Web browser on a PSP-1000]]
The PSP Internet Browser is a version of the [[NetFront]] browser made by [[Access Co. Ltd.]] and was released for free with the 2.00 system software update.&lt;ref name=&quot;v200&quot; /&gt; The browser supports most common web technologies, such as [[HTTP cookie]]s, [[form (web)|form]]s, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], as well as basic [[JavaScript]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/network/browser/menu.html| title=PSP - Network - Internet Browser - Displaying the menu| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version 2.50 upgrade added [[UTF-8|Unicode (UTF-8)]] [[character encoding]] and Auto-Select as options in the browser's encoding menu, and also introduced the saving of input history for online forms.

Version 2.70 of the PSP's system software introduced basic [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] capabilities to the browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;v270&quot; /&gt; However, the player runs Flash version 6, five iterations behind the current desktop version 11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/| title=Adobe Flash Player| publisher=Adobe Systems| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; making some websites difficult to view.&lt;ref name=&quot;v270&quot; /&gt;

There are three different rendering modes: &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Just-Fit&quot;, and &quot;Smart-Fit&quot;. &quot;Normal&quot; will display the page with no changes, &quot;Just-Fit&quot; will attempt to shrink some elements to make the whole page fit on the screen and preserve layout and &quot;Smart-Fit&quot; will display content in the order it appears in the HTML, and with no size adjustments; instead it will drop an element down below the preceding element if it starts to go off the screen.

The browser also has limited [[tabbed document interface|tabbed browsing]], with a maximum of three tabs. When a website tries to open a link in a new window, the browser opens it in a new tab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/network/browser/tab.html| title=PSP - Network - Internet Browser - Tabs| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parents can limit content by enabling Browser Start Up Control which blocks all access to the web browser and creating a 4-digit PIN under [Settings] in [Security]. Additionally, the browser can be configured to run under a [[proxy server]] and can be protected by the security PIN to enable the use of web filtering or monitoring software through a network. Recently, TrendMicro for PSP was added as a feature that can be enabled via a subscription to filter or monitor content on the PSP.

The PSP browser is slower compared to modern browsers and often runs out of memory due to limitations put in place by Sony. Alternatively, Homebrew has allowed a custom version of the browser to be released that utilizes all 32/64 MB of the PSP's RAM, which allows the browser to load pages faster and have more memory for larger pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.qj.net/psp-development-forum/150582-netfront-internet-browser-beta-4-highmemorymod-p86-chickhen-psp-3000-support.html |title=Netfront Internet Browser Beta 4 â HighMemoryMod By pp86 â ChickHEN/PSP-3000 Support |publisher=Forums.qj.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opera Mini can also be used on PSP through PSPKVM, a homebrew application which is a Sun Java Virtual Machine. It was claimed to provide much faster loading times than the default browser and provides better web page capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.qj.net/psp-general/142629-opera-mini-psp.html |title=Opera Mini on PSP |publisher=Forums.qj.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remote Play===
&lt;!--[[File:Ps store remoteplay.jpg|thumb|The [[PlayStation Store]] for [[PlayStation 3|PS3]] displayed on a PSP via [[Remote Play]]  {{Pufc|1=Ps store remoteplay.jpg|date=13 January 2011}}]]--&gt;
{{Main|Remote Play}}
Remote Play allows the PSP to access many features of a [[PlayStation 3]] console from a remote location using the PS3's [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] capabilities, a home network, or the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/network/remoteplay/index.html| title=PSP - Remote Play| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features that can be used with Remote Play include viewing photos and slideshows, listening to music, watching videos stored on the PS3's [[Hard disc drive|HDD]] or on connected USB devices, and several other features.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutRP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/network/remoteplay/ps3set.html| title=PSP - Remote Play - About Remote Play| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Remote Play allows the PS3 to be turned on and off remotely and allows the PSP to control audio playback from the PS3 to a home theater system without having to use a [[television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/psp/current/network/remoteplay/menu.html| title=PSP - Remote Play - menu| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/outputdevice.html| title=PS3 - Settings - Audio Output Device| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the PS3's capabilities are accessible with Remote Play, playback of [[DVD]]s, [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, [[PlayStation 2]] games, most [[PlayStation 3]] games, and copy-protected files stored on the PS3's hard drive are not supported.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutRP&quot; /&gt;{{-}}

===VOIP access===

Starting with system software version 3.90, PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP-N1000 can use the [[Skype]] [[VoIP]] service. The PSP-2000 requires a headset for this feature while the microphone is built into the PSP-3000 and PSP-N1000. Due to hardware constraints, it is not possible to use the VoIP service on PSP-1000.&lt;ref name=&quot;skype1&quot;/&gt; The service allows Skype calls to be made over Wi-Fi and on the PSP Go over the Bluetooth Modem feature. Users must purchase Skype credit in order to make calls to non Skype devices such as a landline or mobile phone.

===Room for PlayStation Portable===

{{Main|Room for PlayStation Portable}}
Announced at [[Tokyo Game Show|TGS]] 2009, a similar service to [[PlayStation Home]], the PlayStation 3's online community-based service, was being developed for the PSP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/699463/PSP-Room-Its-Like-PS-Home-For-The-PSP.html|title=PSP Room: It's Like PS Home for The PSP|publisher=[[G4tv.com]]|accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named &quot;Room&quot; (officially spelled as ''RâM'' with capital letters and the [[infinity symbol]] in place of the &quot;oo&quot;), it was being beta tested in Japan from October 2009 to April 2010. It was able to be launched directly from the PlayStation Network section of the XMB. Just like in Home, PSP owners would have been able to invite other PSP owners into their rooms to &quot;enjoy real time communication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/24/tgs-2009-make-room-for-playstation-r-m/|title=TGS 2009: Make room for 'PlayStation Room'|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/102/1028005p1.html|title=Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Introduces Room for PSP|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of Room halted on {{Nowrap|April 15}}, 2010, due to the feedback of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/04/15/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-psp-social-network-service/|title=Sony Pulls The Plug On PSP Social Network Service|date=2010-04-15|author=Spencer|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital Comics Reader===
Sony has partnered with publishers such as [[2000AD (publisher)|2000AD]], [[Disney]], [[IDW Publishing]], [[Insomnia Publications|Insomnia]], [[iVerse]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[Titan Books|Titan]] to release digitized comics on the PlayStation Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/11/digital-comics-reader-now-available-for-psp-get-a-free-issue/ |title=Digital Comics Reader Now Available for PSP â Get a Free Issue! |publisher=Blog.us.playstation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2009/11/26/playstation-network-digital-comics/ |title=PlayStation Network Digital Comics |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new application requires PSP firmware 6.20 for it adds a new XMB category called &quot;Extra&quot;.

The PlayStation Store's &quot;Comic&quot; section launched in the United States and English speaking PAL regions (United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand) on {{Nowrap|December 16}}, 2009, though the first issues of ''[[Aleister Arcane]]'', ''[[Astro Boy|Astro Boy: Movie Adaptation]]'', ''[[Star Trek|Star Trek: Enterprise Experiment]]'' and ''[[Transformers|Transformers: All Hail Megatron]]'' were made available as early as {{Nowrap|November 20}} through limited time PlayStation Network redeem codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psnstores.com/2009/11/try-out-the-psp-comic-reader/ |title=Try Out The PSP Comic Reader |publisher=Psnstores.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service premiered in Japan on {{Nowrap|December 10}}, 2009, with licensed publishers [[Ascii Mediaworks]], [[Enterbrain]], [[Kadokawa Shoten|Kadokawa]], [[Kodansha]], [[Shueisha]], [[Shogakukan]], [[Square-Enix]], [[Softbank Creative]] (HQ Comics), [[Hakusensha]], [[Bandai Visual]], [[Fujimishobo]], [[Futabasha]] and [[Bunkasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jp.playstation.com/info/release/nr_20091118_store_comic.html |title=SCEJ press release Nov.18,2009 &quot;PSPããã¬ã¤ã¹ãã¼ã·ã§ã³ã»ãã¼ã¿ãã«ãåãã³ããã¯ã³ã³ãã³ãéä¿¡ PlayStationStoreã«ã¦2009å¹´12æ10æ¥(æ¨) éå§&quot; |publisher=Jp.playstation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2010 the application expanded to German, French, Spanish and Italian languages with Digital Comics available in the respective European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playstationcomics.com/country-selector.html |title=PlayStation Comics â country selector |publisher=Playstationcomics.com |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of regional Comic Reader software is dictated by the PSP's firmware region, and cannot be chosen. The Japanese Comic Reader will not display comics purchased from the European store, and vice versa. So although a Japanese PSP can log into the European Playstation Store and purchase and display videos and games bought there, any comics purchased cannot be displayed.

Sony has said downloadable games will still be limited to 1.8 GB, most likely to guarantee a potential UMD release.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Homebrew development==
{{Main|PlayStation Portable homebrew}}
On June 15, 2005, hackers disassembled the code of the PSP and distributed it online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Attack of the Playstation Hackers|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2005/tc20051230_356459.htm|date=2005-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the modified PSP allowed users to run custom code and a limited amount of protected software. Sony responded to this by repeatedly upgrading the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sony battles hackers over hijacked games|url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEN20050706033455&amp;Page=N&amp;Title=Infotech&amp;Topic=0|date=2005-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time people were able to unlock the firmware and allow users to run more custom content and more protected software. One of the ways hackers were able to run protected software on the PSP was through the creation of ISO loaders which could load copies of UMD games from the memory stick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three Hacker teams unlock the PSP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6397797.stm#chart|date=2007-02-26 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The PSP received generally favorable reviews soon after launch and most reviewers cited similar strengths and weaknesses. [[CNET]] awarded the system an 8.5 out of 10 and praised the console's powerful hardware and its multimedia capabilities while lamenting the lack of a screen guard or a guard over the reading surface of UMD cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/consoles/sony-psp/4505-10109_7-30895581.html| title=Sony PSP Review| date=2005-03-24| first=David| last=Carnoy| publisher=CNET| accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engadget]] applauded the console's design, stating that &quot;it is definitely one well-designed, slick little handheld&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2004/12/20/sony-playstation-portable-psp-hands-on-review/| title=Sony PlayStation Portable/PSP hands-on review| date=2004-12-20| first=Adam| last=Nielson| publisher=CNET| accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] commended [[Sony]]'s decision to include built-in [[Wi-Fi]] capability, but criticized the lack of a web browser at launch and the glare and smudges that resulted from the console's shiny exterior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,120117-page,1/article.html| title=First Look: Sony's Impressive PlayStation Portable| date=2005-03-18| first=Andrew| last=Brandt| publisher=PC World| accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most reviewers also praised the console's large and bright viewing screen and its audio and video playback capabilities. In 2008, [[Time (magazine)|Time]] listed the PSP as a &quot;gotta have travel gadget&quot;, citing the console's movie selection, telecommunications capability, and upcoming GPS functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1827576_1827591_1828191,00.html|title=25 Gotta Have Travel Gadgets|first= Josh|last=Quittner|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=2009-11-17 | date=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSP Go received mixed reviews to date. IGN gave the product a 7.2 stating that with the absence of the UMD slot, the PSP Go is difficult to consider for purchase.

==Controversial advertising campaigns==
*Sony admitted in late 2005 to hiring [[graffiti]] artists to spray paint advertisements for the PSP in seven major U.S. cities including New York City, [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]],  [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The mayor of Philadelphia has filed a [[cease and desist]] order and may file a criminal complaint. According to Sony, it is paying businesses and building owners for the right to spraypaint their walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69741| title=Sony Draws Ire With PSP Graffiti| date=2005-12-05| first=Ryan| last=Singel| publisher=Wired| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2006, Sony ran a poster campaign in England. One of the poster designs with the slogan &quot;Take a running jump here&quot; was removed from a [[Manchester Piccadilly station]] tram platform due to concerns that it might encourage suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=No play station, say Metro bosses | publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]] | date=2006-03-07 | url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/206/206881_no_play_station_say_metro_bosses.html | first=Clarissa| last= Satchell | accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In July 2006, news spread of a billboard advertisement released in the Netherlands which depicted a white woman holding a black woman by the jaw, saying &quot;PlayStation Portable White is coming.&quot; Some found this to be racially charged due to the portrayal of a white woman subjugating a black woman. Two other similar advertisements also existed, one had the two women facing each other on equal footing in fighting stances, while the other had the black woman in a dominant position on top of the white woman. The stated purpose of the advertisements was to contrast the white and black versions of its game console available for sale. These ads were never released in the rest of the world, and were pulled from the Netherlands after the controversy was raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=18101|title=Sony defends PSP ad following accusations of racism | publisher=gamesindustry.biz| date=2006-07-05| first=Ellie| last=Gibson| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having been released only in the Netherlands, the advertisement gathered international press coverage. Engadget notes that Sony may have hoped to &quot;capitalize on a PR firestorm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/06/sony-under-fire-for-racist-advertising/ |title=Sony under fire for &quot;racist&quot; advertising |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sony came under scrutiny online in December 2006 for a [[guerrilla marketing]] campaign hoping to go [[viral marketing|viral]], for the console, with advertisers masquerading as young bloggers who desperately wanted a PSP. The site was registered to and created by the St. Louis, Missouri, advertising firm [[Zipatoni]] on behalf of Sony before it was taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/11/sony-marketers-are-horrible-liars-pretend-to-run-fansite/| title=Sony Marketers pretend to run fansite| date=2006-12-11| first=Blake|last=Snow| publisher=JoyStiq| accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
