The '''Los Angeles Emmy Awards''' are awards presented by the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] (ATAS) in recognition of excellence in the local programming of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]. They are the only regional Emmys presented directly by the ATAS; all the other regional Emmys across the country are given out by each regional chapter of the ATAS' sister organization, the [[National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] (NATAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emmyonline.org/chapters.html | title=National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences: Chapters | accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/membership/nationalacademy.php | title=Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences: National Academy | quote=ecause our headquarters, the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, are located in Los Angeles, our offices handle regional membership and awards for the Los Angeles area only | accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdn.emmys.tv/contact/faq.php | title=Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences: FAQ | quote=The Academy also encompasses a Los Angeles branch whose members work in Southern California | accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
