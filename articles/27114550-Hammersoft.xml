'''''Young Justice''''' is an American animated television series created by [[Greg Weisman]] and Brandon Vietti for [[Cartoon Network]]. Despite its title, it is not an adaptation of [[Todd Dezago]] and [[Todd Nauck]]'s ''[[Young Justice]]'' comic series, but rather an adaptation of the entire [[DC Universe]] with a focus on young [[superhero]]es.{{r|YT-GWI1}}{{r|SHTV}} The series follows the lives of teenaged heroes and sidekicks who are members of a [[fictional]] [[covert operation]] team called Young Justice.  The team is essentially a young counterpart to the [[celebrity]]-level famous adult team, the [[Justice League]].{{r|DC-SDCC10}}{{r|CV-SDCC10}} The main setting is the [[fictional universe]] of [[List of DC Multiverse worlds#Earth-16|Earth-16]],{{r|DC-SDCC10}} during a time period in which superheroes are a relatively recent phenomenon.{{r|WB1}} The series debuted on January 7, 2011 with a two week reairing of the first two episodes, which originally aired as an hour long special on November 26, 2010.{{r|NYCC}}{{r|Details}}{{r|ScreenRant}} ''Young Justice'' premiered on September 9, 2011 on [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]], in [[Canada]].{{r|Teletoon}}

''Young Justice'' resumed airing new episodes September 16 at 6:30 PM Eastern on Cartoon Network{{r|Resume}} after a 6 month hiatus. The show went on another hiatus and will resume in January 2012.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

==Plot==
''Young Justice'' focuses on the lives of a group of teenaged superheroes and protÃ©gÃ©s attempting to establish themselves as proven superheroes as they deal with normal adolescent issues in their personal lives.{{r|SHTV}}{{r|WB1}}

===Pilot synopsis===
{{Main|List of Young Justice episodes}}

The show corresponds to the present time of our world, a time period Vietti has called &quot;a new age of heroes.&quot;{{r|WB1}}

The pilot movie aired a month prior to the debut of the regular series and introduced four characters: [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Aqualad]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]]. It established their desire for greater recognition and respect, namely, a promotion from sidekicks to full-fledged superheroes. Met with opposition from their respective mentors in the Justice League, [[Batman]], [[Aquaman]], [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]], and [[Green Arrow]], the protÃ©gÃ©s react in different ways. Speedy resigns from being Green Arrow's partner and begins calling himself Red Arrow. The others seek to persuade their mentors of their worth by secretly taking on a Justice League mission to investigate the [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] building. During their infiltration of Cadmus' headquarters, the three heroes find a clone of Superman named [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. After the discovery, the team finds out Cadmus is creating living weapons called Genomorphs.  The movie deals with this revelation, the origin of Superboy, and how this relates to a mysterious group of people called The Light. In the end, Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Superboy negotiate with Batman to organize a covert operations team as a practical contrast to the Justice League whose celebrity status makes it difficult to maintain secrecy.  After consulting with his colleagues, Batman establishes Young Justice in a secret cave on a secluded island. Here the teens are trained and mentored by the Justice League. [[Miss Martian]] makes an appearance at the end of the movie and joins as the fifth member.

===Continuity===
Although ''Young Justice'' follows a [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] considerably different from that of the mainstream DC Universe, Weisman has stated that the series covers its early stages.{{r|WB1}} Earth-16 was chosen by [[DC Comics#DC Entertainment|DC Entertainment]] for the show because it was largely untapped, freeing the series and its franchise from established continuity restraints set by either the main DC Universe or other worlds in the Multiverse.{{r|AG-MV}}{{r|IGN-SDCC10}}

There are crucial differences in the line-up of this Young Justice team as compared to the team in the comic series of the same name. [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Wally West]] were chosen over [[Tim Drake]] and [[Bart Allen]]/[[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]]. {{r|AG-YJ2}} Miss Martian, who was originally a [[White Martian]] in the comics, was added because the date of her arrival to Earth could still fit in the early DC Universe concept.{{r|YT-GWI1}} Aqualad, as opposed to Robin, is established in the beginning as the leader of the team. Furthermore, the Aqualad presented in the show is an entirely new character created by Weisman and Vietti, with Bourassa responsible for the original character design.{{r|CBR-CCIYJ}} [[Arrowette]] was replaced by [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]]{{r|SL-blog}} because of the producers' desire to focus on the latter's storylines.{{r|DCSE}} Some of the ''Young Justice'' characters' ages are tweaked from those of their original counterparts;{{r|CV-SDCC10}} however, the spirit and intent of the characters are said to be kept.{{r|AG-YJ2}}

Characters who are a part of the line-up in the comic will also make an appearance in the show. This includes [[Garth (comics)|Garth]],{{r|DC-SDCC10}}{{r|DCSE}} the first incarnation of Aqualad who later becomes the second [[Tempest (DC Comics)|Tempest]] in DC Comics; [[Arrowette]],{{r|DC-SDCC10}}{{r|DCSE}} the archer of the team in the ''Young Justice'' comic book series; and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]], whose legal issues originally prohibited the producers from using the character{{r|AG-WG}} but later allowed her to be included.{{r|DCSE}} In the show, Garth features as the best friend of Aqualad/Kaldur'ahm.{{r|NYCC}} Another character who was used was [[Secret (comics)|Secret]] she plays a major role in an episode.{{r|DCSE}}

==Production==
===Conception and development===
The series began development in March 2009,{{r|SHTV}} when [[Sam Register]], Executive Vice President of Creative Affairs of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] (also attached to executive produce),{{r|Collider}} wanted a show based on the concept of a cross between ''[[Teen Titans]]'' and ''Young Justice'' series of comics, but was not solely an adaptation of one or the other.{{r|YT-GWI1}} The title chosen for the show by Register was ''Young Justice'',{{r|SHTV}} as it was appropriately meaningful to the concept the creative team was looking for.{{r|AG-Name}} [[Greg Weisman]], whom Register sought immediately after the cancellation of ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated television series, and Brandon Vietti, whose work in directing a [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies|DC Universe Animated original movie]] ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'' Register particularly noted, were hired to produce.{{r|TZ-producers}} Register jokingly described the two as being similar in appearance, in addition to being similar in thought.{{r|DC-SDCC10}} [[Peter David]], who penned a majority of the comic book issues of ''Young Justice'', was approached to write several episodes.{{r|PD-writer}} Also attached to write are Greg Weisman, Kevin Hopps, Andrew Robinson, [[Nicole Dubuc]], Jon Weisman, and Tom Pugsley â with Vietti heavily involved in the scriptwriting process.{{r|AG-Stats}}

The result of the collaboration of Weisman and Vietti was a show about young heroes based on a combination of the 1960s ''Teen Titans'' run and the 1990s ''Young Justice'' run, in addition to the recent ''Teen Titans'' and ''Young Justice'' comics, and revolved around the theme of secrets and lies.{{r|YT-GWI1}}{{r|AG-YJ2}} In drawing material from a variety of comic book sources, the creative team sought to differentiate the tone of the show from that of the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated television series, which the team believed resembled the tone of the ''Young Justice'' series of comics rather than that of [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George PÃ©rez]]'s ''[[Teen Titans#New Teen Titans (1980â1996)|New Teen Titans]]'' series it was based on.{{r|AG-Name}} The concept of a covert operations team has been compared to [[Impossible Missions Force]], a fictional independent [[espionage]] agency in the ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'' series.{{r|SHTV}} Together, Weisman and Vietti came up with ideas, characters, and plot points for at least two seasons, although it is unknown as to how many season runs DC Entertainment and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] are looking for the series.{{r|YT-GWI1}} Although there were several characters the producers were not allowed to use in the first season (a list that has become shorter along the course of the development), they were usually in charge of the decisions determining which DC Universe character would or would not be used.{{r|AG-WW}} [[Geoff Johns]], [[Creative director|Chief Creative Officer]] of DC Entertainment, and Phil Bourassa, lead character designer for the show, also played a role in the conception and development process.{{r|YT-GWI1}}

===Design===
====Costumes====
The producers intended to create costumes based in reality to match the tone of the series while keeping consistent with traditional DC Universe continuity.{{r|BV-SUIT}} A majority of the art direction was led by Vietti, who established that the costume designs should not only reflect the physical needs of the wearer, but also his or her personality, with Bourassa incorporating these ideas into his designs.{{r|BV-SUIT}} In the case of [[Kid Flash]]'s suit, for instance, the padding serves to reduce the force of impact experienced during skids and collisions, and the leathery texture stabilizes his &quot;human cannonball&quot; momentum.{{r|BV-SUIT}}

Vietti cites the stark differences between the respective costumes of Aqualad and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] to best illustrate what he calls &quot;unique tailoring.&quot; Aqualad's costume is designed for the purposes of quick movement in water; Robin's costume provides bodily protection (even against bullets) in the streets of [[Gotham City]]. Aqualad's costume is composed of a &quot;slick and textureless material,&quot; giving the costume its &quot;nearly seamless and shiny&quot; appearance. Robin's costume, on the other hand, is padded and stitched with seams and sewn-in materials.{{r|BV-SUIT}} Batman's [[batsuit]] matches the extra stitching lines of Robin's outfit for similar functions, except that the batsuit is more military in style whereas Robin's costume is additionally influenced by athletic outfits to match his youthful energy.{{r|BV-SUIT}}

==Animation==
MOI Animation, Inc. animates ''Young Justice''.{{r|MOI}} Warner Bros. subcontracted production to the international studio located in Seoul, South Korea. Artists at the U.S. animation studio in Los Angeles,{{r|AG-ANI}} Warner Bros. Animation, draw [[storyboard]]s; design new characters, backgrounds, and props; draw character and background layouts; and make [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatic]]s.{{r|BV-PROD}} The overseas studio, MOI Animation, Inc., draws the [[Traditional animation#Animation|key animation]] and [[Inbetweening|inbetween]]s.{{r|AG-ANI}}{{r|BV-PROD}} However, Greg Weisman notes that some storyboards are done in Seoul.{{r|AG-ANI}} In the final stages, [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|ink and paint]] and editing are done by Warner Bros. Animation.{{r|AG-PMC}}{{r|BV-PROD}}

==Characters==
[[Image:Young Justice TV series.PNG|right|thumb|300px|From left to right: [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]], [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], and [[Aqualad]].]]
The six main characters were chosen by the producers, from a list of 50 to 60 DC Comics teenaged superheroes, as potential candidates.{{r|YT-GWI1}} The criteria consisted of age, powers, personality, [[cultural icon]] status, and dynamics.{{r|AG-MO}} An additional regular will be added halfway through the first season and another at the end of the season.{{r|YT-GWI1}}

* '''[[Aqualad]] / [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Kaldur 'Ahm]]'''{{r|CV-SDCC10}} (or &quot;Kaldur&quot; for short) is the sixteen-year-old leader of the team. His powers, channeled through the tattoos on his arms, are a mixture of Atlantean sorcery and science.{{cn|date=November 2011}} He displays the superior strength, durability as well as the ability to breathe and speak underwater typical of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlanteans]]. He also possesses the ability to discharge electricity through his hands.{{r|&quot;Independence Day&quot;}} He is elected leader because of his calmness and his ability to efficiently and clearly give orders.{{cn|date=November 2011}} He states that he does not want to remain leader and wishes to turn the position over to Robin when he is ready, saying that it is his destiny to lead this team.{{r|&quot;Drop Zone&quot;}}

* '''[[Robin (comics)|Robin]] / [[Dick Grayson]]'''{{r|DC-SDCC10}} is the youngest member (at age thirteen){{r|CV-SDCC10}} though he is also the most experienced superhero on the team.{{r|WB1}} He does not possess any [[List of superhuman features and abilities in fiction|superpowers]]. However, he is well-rounded in his abilities, using his strategic intellect and technological expertise. He has a flippant personality, and can be heard laughing in combat or when sneaking up on villains in order to throw them off. He repeatedly plays with the English language, particularly with words which cease to function without prefixes, such as &quot;disaster&quot; (&quot;aster&quot;), and &quot;underwhelmed&quot; (whelmed&quot;). Batman has forbidden Robin from revealing his secret identity to the team{{r|&quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;}}, though Kid Flash is aware of it.

* '''[[Kid Flash]] / [[Wally West]]'''{{r|DC-SDCC10}} is the team's fifteen-year-old speedster. He has enhanced speed,{{r|&quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;}} although he is slightly clumsy, often falling down while running at high speeds due to a misstep. Kid Flash cannot vibrate his molecules through solid objects like the Flash and gets a bloody nose if he attempts to.{{r|&quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;}} He is a [[flirt]], beginning with M'gann and extending to any woman he comes into contact with. Kid Flash and Robin know each other outside the team, even knowing each other's secret identities. Wally likes to collect items he calls &quot;souvenirs&quot; from the team's missions, such as T. O. Morrow's robotic eye and [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]'s mask.{{r|&quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;}}{{r|&quot;Infiltrator&quot;}}

* '''[[Superboy]] / [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]]''' is a sixteen-week-old [[cloning|clone]] of Superman, made by Project Cadmus.  Although he does not have all of Superman's abilities, he has super strength, invulnerability, enhanced hearing,{{r|&quot;Fireworks&quot;}} and vision, which also allows him to see in infrared.{{r|&quot;Drop Zone&quot;}} Superboy is typically sullen, ill-tempered and hates being told what to do as a result of being mind-controlled by [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]]. He becomes romantically involved with M'gann while under cover in Belle Reve.{{r|&quot;Terrors&quot;}}

* '''[[Miss Martian]] / M'gann M'orzz / Megan''' is Martian Manhunter's sixteen-year-old (by Martian standards) niece,{{r|AG-Name}} as well as being an inexperienced superhero.{{r|DC-SDCC10}} As a Martian, she has [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], [[telepathy]], and flight. Additionally, she can shape-shift, though she has trouble mimicking men.{{r|&quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;}} She has stated that she cannot become intangible as her uncle can, implying that this is an advanced skill.{{r|&quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;}} She pilots her own bio-ship, which transports the team and turn invisible. She is kind and optimistic, but has a naive streak born of having learned about life on Earth through Television Shows. In line with this, she makes regular use of the catchphrase &quot;Hello, M'gann!&quot; when suddenly realizes something. She became involved with Superboy while working undercover with him in Belle Reve. 

* '''Artemis / [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis Crock]]'''{{r|&quot;Downtime&quot;}} is the team's fifteen-year-old archer.{{r|DC-SDCC10}}{{r|TBU}} Like Robin, she has no superpowers, but is very skilled with a bow and arrow. She is introduced as Green Arrow's &quot;niece&quot; but it is later revealed that this is not the case. Red Arrow who knows the truth, believes that there must be a good reason behind Batman and Green Arrow's decision to add her to the team, and therefore agrees not reveal his suspicions about her to the rest of the group but warns Artemis to not harm his friends. [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]], a villain, is Artemis' sister, having left when Artemis was a young girl.{{r|&quot;Home Front&quot;}} In a therapy session Black Canary advises Artemis to reveal her secret to her teammates but she refuses to do it, telling her not to reveal it herself.

''Young Justice'' includes an array of characters from DC Comics as the supporting cast, which continues to expand throughout the series. The second season will be adding members to the team; [[Zatanna]] has been confirmed as one of the team's members for some episodes.{{r|YT-GWI1}} as well as other characters that are rumored to be included are [[Milestone Media]] character [[Rocket (comics)#Rocket|Rocket]] and [[Wonder Girl]], who was supposed to have been part of the series originally but due to licensing constraints was unable to be. The creators have strongly hinted that now this is no longer the case, and Wonder Girl will join Young Justice at some point. As of episode 16 of season 1, there are 135 characters from the DC Universe in the show.{{r|AG-Name}}

The Justice League play a major role, primarily as mentors to Young Justice.{{r|WB1}} There are sixteen members in total, though members that do not have an immediate connection with the main characters will serve as background characters.{{r|YT-GWI1}} Direct mentors â Batman, Superman, Aquaman, Flash, Martian Manhunter, and Green Arrow â will feature prominently.{{r|SHTV}}{{r|WB1}} Batman and Red Tornado are the most prevalent [[recurring character]]s, though Black Canary, Captain Marvel and Zatara are frequent additions to the cast. Batman also acts as Young Justice's [[List of Mission: Impossible characters#Jim Phelps|&quot;Jim Phelps&quot;]],{{r|SHTV}} choosing the team and assigning missions.{{r|WB1}} 

DC Universe characters who are neither affiliated with the Justice League nor Young Justice will also be supporting characters. This includes frequent recurring character Roy Harper, who starts out as [[Speedy (comics)#Roy Harper|Speedy]] and later assumes [[Roy Harper (comics)#Red Arrow|Red Arrow]] as his superhero identity.{{r|DC-SDCC10}}{{r|WB1}}&lt;!---Given the extensive amount of supporting characters, it is impossible to list every single name. Therefore, only characters that are notable enough in the show should be mentioned per WP:FICT and WP:MOSTV.---&gt;

==Other media==
''Young Justice'' has an official tie-in comic book series outside the television broadcast, expanding on the show's coverage of the continuity.{{r|ETC-NYCC}} It will be written by Greg Weisman and Kevin Hopps, who are a part of the show's writing team, with [[Mike Norton]] providing the art.{{r|AG-CB}} [[Art Baltazar]] and Franco Aureliani will substitute in place of Weisman and Hopps for issues #1-6, due to the latter duo's conflicting schedule and workload.{{r|AG-CB}} Along with Brandon Vietti, Weisman and Hopps will still oversee the issues for the maintenance of continuity.{{r|AG-CB}} While children of all ages are said to be able to enjoy the series, it is specifically aimed at teenagers.{{r|artfranco}}

The comic series largely takes place in-between the episodes of the show, and often expands upon events alluded to or mentioned in the series. For instance, issue #0 follows Kid Flash and Superboy as they attempt to kill time while the members of the Justice League set up Mount Justice for their arrival at the end of the pilot episode. In the episode &quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;, Robin mentions that the Justice League had been forced to abandon their headquarters in Happy Harbor after its location was compromised by supervillains, which is revealed in issue #2 of the comic book series to have been orchestrated by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. In addition, Baltazar and Aureliani confirmed that they were asked to introduce the Joker in the comic in order to set up his eventual appearance on the show.{{r|CBR}}

Geoff Johns took a liking to Kaldur'ahm as Aqualad,{{r|CBR-CCIYJ}} who was consequently introduced to mainstream continuity altered in comic book issue #4 of ''[[Brightest Day]]'' as the second incarnation of the mantle. In ''Brightest Day'', he is introduced as a teenager from New Mexico by the name of [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Jackson Hyde]] who is largely unaware of his [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantean]] roots.{{r|DC-BD}} In addition to his design, many aspects of the new Aqualad's back-story had to be altered to fit within the established continuity of the DC Universe.

===Licensed merchandise===
Additionally, several products based on the series have been licensed for release. [[Mattel]] will release lines of character [[action figure]]s and accompanying [[playset]]s, among other toys and games.{{r|Mattel}} In addition to toys for the six lead characters, figures of Cheshire, [[Icicle (comics)#Cameron Mahkent|Icicle Jr.]], Black Canary, Batman, Aquaman, the Flash and [[Ra's al Ghul]] have been confirmed as well.{{r|insidepulse}} Starting March 13, 2011, [[McDonald's]] restaurants began featuring ''Young Justice'' toys in their [[Happy Meal]]s. Figures include Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, Superboy, Superman, Batman, and the villains [[Captain Cold]] and [[Black Manta]].

===The Flaming C===
On the program ''[[Conan (TV series)|Conan]]'', [[Conan O'Brien]] visited [[Bruce Timm]] during one of his segments and they developed a super hero named [[the Flaming C]].&lt;ref&gt;http://teamcoco.com/content/conan-gets-animated&lt;/ref&gt; However, on several occasions, their original creation would be animated in preexisting sequences from ''Young Justice'' using the voice acting of whichever character Flaming C was placed over. These scenes were taken from &quot;Fireworks&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://teamcoco.com/content/flaming-c-gets-his-own-cartoon&lt;/ref&gt;, &quot;Welcome to Happy Harbor&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://teamcoco.com/video/flaming-c-evil-robot&lt;/ref&gt;, &quot;Schooled&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://teamcoco.com/content/flaming-c-schools-superboy&lt;/ref&gt;, and &quot;Denial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://teamcoco.com/content/flaming-c-returns-kick-some-cat-ass&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
[[Warner Brothers]] released ''Young Justice: Season One, Volume One'' on July 19, 2011, and features the first four episodes of the series.{{r|Vol1}} The first four episodes were also included in the ''Justice League: 3-Pack Fun'' box set, which contained the two-part ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episodes &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; and &quot;Injustice For All,&quot; as well as the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episodes &quot;For The Man Who Has Everything,&quot; &quot;The Return,&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Story Never Told&quot;.{{r|Vol1b}}
