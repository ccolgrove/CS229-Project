==Background==
Cricket in the Samoan islands has a colourful history since it was introduced in 1884 by the visit of the British Royal Navy vessel, the HMS Diamond. Since this time, not too much is known of organised cricket in the islands but from 1964, a band of locals and hardy expats would gather together as the Wanderers to play against passing cruise ships and other visitors. Ad hoc cricket fixtures and tournaments were the norm around Samoa until the late 1990s when an Association and committee was formed to take cricket to the next level.

===ICC Affiliate===
In 2000 the '''Samoa International Cricket Association''' (SICA) became an Affiliate member of the '''ICC'''. This affiliation provides annual funding support for SICA and also ensures that Samoa participates in regular '''ICC''' international fixtures and tournaments across the region and beyond. '''SICA''' also enjoys a strong partnership with '''Auckland Cricket''', who provide professional assistance and training in all areas of cricket including coaching, umpiring and administration.

==Association Structure==
'''SICA''' has a dedicated administration which is run by an experienced committee and headed by local cricket legend and leading businessman, '''Seb Kohlhase'''.  Seb, who played first class cricket in New Zealand and Australia, is well known in sporting circles in the region and his passion for cricket was one of the main reasons for his receiving an ICC award in 2006 for Lifetime Services to Cricket. 

The chairman of SICA is the Honourable Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegoai.  The Prime Ministerâs strong support of cricket has helped the sport maintain a high profile in Samoa and ensures that cricket continues to grow and develop.  For the second year in a row, cricket will be played at Samoa's premier cultural carnival, the '''Teuila Festival''', inextricably linking the sport with Samoan culture.

==Competitions==
In September 2009 Samoa hosted the '''Pepsi ICC East-Asia Pacific Trophy'''
