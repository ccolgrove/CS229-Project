'''UNTV''' (DWAO-TV 37) is a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[television station]] in the [[Philippines]] operated by the [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]], the same company that operates the [[DWNU|107.5 Win Radio]] and [[DWKY|91.5 Big Radio]] network of FM stations. DWAO is one of very few [[NTSC]]-System M stations in the world that broadcast on [[channel 37]]. This station studios are located #907 EDSA Philam, [[Quezon City]] and transmitter located at Crestview Heights Subdivision, Brgy. San Roque, [[Antipolo City]]. It is known for its broadcast of [[The Old Path]]. '''UNTV''' operates 24 hours a day, except on Mondays where the stations signs off from 12:00 am to 4:45 am. The network also goes off the air from 12:00 am of Holy Thursday to 12:00 am of Black Saturday, even though the network has ties with the [[Non-denominational Christianity|independent]] [[Members Church of God International]] which airs [[Ang Dating Daan]]. 

==History==
In May 2002, [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]] ventured to UHF television through UNTV 37. UNTV started as a television counterpart to NU 107, airing rock-related [[music videos]]. In its early years, UNTV gained a cult following through the program [[Strangebrew]], a.k.a. ''Ang show na may tama.'' In 2004, however, UNTV became the home of Ang Dating Daan and gradually reduced and eventually abandoned airing rock music videos. Since then it has become a 24-hour TV station, airing not only ADD Programs, but also news, public service and information programming.
