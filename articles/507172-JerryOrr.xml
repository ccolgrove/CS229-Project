He is notable for early work on [[automated planning]] in a [[blocks world]], on [[semantic network]]s, on [[neural network]]s (and, in particular, the [[cascade correlation algorithm]]), on the [[History of the Dylan programming language|Dylan programming language]], and on [[Common Lisp]] (in particular [[CMU Common Lisp]]). Recently, Fahlman has been engaged in constructing a [[Knowledge Base]], &quot;Scone&quot;, based in part on his thesis work on the NETL Semantic Network.

Fahlman received his [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] in 1973 from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[MIT]] in 1977. His thesis advisors were Drs [[Gerald Sussman]] and [[Patrick Winston]]. He is a fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]].

Fahlman acted as thesis advisor for Donald Cohen, David B. McDonald, [[David S. Touretzky]], Skef Wholey, Justin Boyan, [[Michael Witbrock]], and Alicia Tribble Sagae.

From May 1996 to July 2000, Fahlman directed the [[Justsystem Pittsburgh Research Center]].

== Emoticons ==

Fahlman is credited with originating the first [[smiley]] [[emoticon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/apr2001/nf20010423_785.htm Business Week Online, April 23, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/sefSmiley.htm Scott Fahlman's Smiley Lore page, containing his version of the history, accessed Sept. 19, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; which he thought would help people on a message board at Carnegie Mellon to distinguish serious posts from jokes.  He proposed the use of :-) and :-( for this purpose, and the symbols caught on.  The original message from which these symbols originated was posted on September 19, 1982. The message was recovered by Jeff Baird on September 10, 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Orig-Smiley.htm Fahlman's original message] Retrieved February 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and is quoted below:

From: Scott E Fahlman &amp;lt;Fahlman at Cmu-20c&amp;gt;
 
I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers:
        
:-)
        
Read it sideways.  Actually, it is probably more economical to mark
things that are NOT jokes, given current trends.  For this, use
        
:-(
&lt;/pre&gt;

Though credited with originating the smiley emoticons, he was not the first emoticon user; a similar marker appeared in an article of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' in May 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/computer/internet/smiley.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Emoticon (Smiley) Origin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview printed in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1969, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted, &quot;I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smileâsome sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nabokov1973&gt;{{Citation

==Smiley Award==

He and his colleagues, in the fall of 2007, created a student contest, a student award to foster innovation in technology-assisted person-person communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=They Said It |year=2007 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=317 |issue=5846 |page=1841 |doi=10.1126/science.317.5846.1841c }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
