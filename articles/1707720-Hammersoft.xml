&quot;'''Venus'''&quot; is a 1969 song by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] band [[Shocking Blue]] which the group took to number one in the U.S. and five countries across Europe in 1970.  When covered by girl group [[Bananarama]], the song returned to number one in the U.S. and topped the charts in six other countries around the world in 1986.  The composition has been featured in numerous films, television shows and commercials, and covered dozens of times by artists around the world.

==Shocking Blue==
Released in late 1969 as a single from the album ''At Home'', Shocking Blue's single reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] on February 7, 1970. [[RIAA]] certification came on January 28, 1970 for selling over one million copies in the U.S., garnering a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]].

The song's lead vocals are performed by [[Mariska Veres]]. The song's music and lyrics are written by [[Robbie van Leeuwen]], the band's [[guitar]]ist, [[sitar]]ist and background vocalist, who also produced, along with record producer Jerry Ross.

Van Leeuwen used &quot;The Banjo Song&quot;, an arrangement of &quot;[[Oh! Susanna]]&quot; on a 1963 album by [[Tim Rose#The Big Three|The Big 3]], as main inspiration; the bassline, riffs and melody are almost exactly the same.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, The Big 3 never claimed plagiarism.

&quot;Venus&quot; was [[remix]]ed and re-released by dance [[Record producer|producers]] The BHF (Bisiach Hornbostel Ferrucci) Team in May 1990, scoring the group a Top 10 hit in the UK and Australia 21 years after the release of the original. The remix featured a [[hip house]] rhythm and [[Sampling (music)|samples]].  An instrumental version was also released independently under the producer's alias &quot;Don Pablo's Animals&quot;.  The instrumental version (credited only to Don Pablos Animals - without referencing Shocking Blue) became the highest charting version of the song. &lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums 3&quot;&gt;{{cite book

&quot;Venus&quot; had been a part of Bananarama's repertoire for several years before they actually recorded it. The team's three members, [[Sara Dallin]], [[Siobhan Fahey]], and [[Keren Woodward]], had the idea of turning the song into a [[dance music]] tune, but they were met with resistance from their producers at the time, [[Jolley &amp; Swain|Steve Jolley and Tony Swain]]. Bananarama brought the idea to the production trio of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]], and it became Bananarama's first collaboration with them.

Dallin, Fahey, and Woodward had nearly completed recording their third album, titled ''[[True Confessions (album)|True Confessions]],'' with Jolley and Swain. Stock, Aitken and Waterman also resisted the idea because they believed that &quot;Venus&quot; would not make a good dance record. After persistence by the women, SAW relented, and the result was a worldwide smash. Bananarama's &quot;Venus&quot; went to number one in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Mexico, and South Africa. It hit number two in Germany and Hong Kong and was a top ten success in Italy, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Colombia, Norway, Portugal, Spain, and their native UK (#8 on [[UK Singles Chart]]). It also went to number one for two weeks on the [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play|U.S. Dance]] chart.

The collaboration on &quot;Venus&quot; led Bananarama and SAW to work together on the group's follow-up album ''[[Wow! (Bananarama album)|Wow!]]'' the following year.

A new mix of the track appeared as b-side to the 1989 limited release &quot;Megarama '89&quot; in Germany and France.  Bananarama has since re-recorded the track for their 2001 album ''[[Exotica (Bananarama album)|Exotica]]'' and it was later [[remix]]ed by [[Marc Almond]], with re-recorded vocals, and included on their 2005 album ''[[Drama (Bananarama album)|Drama]]''.

===Music video===
The [[music video]] for the song received extensive play on [[MTV]] and video channels across the world, and presented Bananarama in various costumes, including a [[Succubi|she-devil]], a French [[temptress]], a [[vampiress]], and several [[Greek mythology|Grecian]] [[goddess]]es.  In one sequence of the video, ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]],'' the painting by [[Sandro Botticelli]], was reenacted. The video marked a pivotal shift towards a more glamorous and sexual image for the girls that contrasted with the tomboyish style in their earlier work. Choreography by [[Bruno Tonioli]]. Music video directed by [[Peter Care]].

==&quot;Shizgarah&quot;, or &quot;Venus&quot; in Russian urban folklore ==
Despite the fact that the heavily controlled [[Soviet]] [[mass media]] totally ignored much of [[Western culture|Western]] [[popular culture]], the Shocking Blue song quickly become a popular hit in 1970s Russia, especially among street youth akin to Western [[hippie]] and &quot;hooligan&quot; [[subcultures]]. Due to the song's simple arrangement and danceable rhythm, &quot;Venus&quot; was adopted and performed by thousands of [[Resistance movement|underground]] amateur performers, both those who accompanied themselves on acoustic guitar and full contemporary bands who performed it with electric guitar at dance parties. Thus, the English language song of a Dutch band become a prominent phenomenon of Russian urban folklore and was considered by many an unofficial &quot;anthem of the generation&quot;.

The English language in the song, however, was only very loosely approximated, and the song was not even known by its title, &quot;Venus&quot;. A countless number of variants of Russian lyrics existed for this song, but traditionally it was performed using [[gibberish]] or [[scat singing]] phonetically inspired by the sounds of original English lyrics which had become hardly intelligible after being passed along via repeated duplicate copying on cheap, [[low fidelity|low-end]] [[tape recorder]]s. In the Russian variant, the first line of the chorus, &quot;She's got it&quot;, was usually pronounced as &quot;Shizgarah&quot; (&quot;Ð¨Ð¸Ð·Ð³Ã¡ÑÐ°&quot;) [''sheez-ga'-rah''], and it was this word which became a commonly adopted name of the song in the U.S.S.R., even among those who could understand the original English text.

In modern times, few disco clubs and a musical show on [[Nashe Radio]] are named &quot;Shizgarah&quot; after this song.

Also, &quot;Shizgarah&quot; (&quot;Ð¨Ð¸Ð·Ð³Ð°ÑÐ°&quot;) is a novel of Russian writer [[Sergey Soloukh]] portraying the life of young Soviet hippies in 1970's (http://lib.ru/ZHURNAL/SOLOUH/shizgara.txt).

==Legacy==
The Canadian teenage drama series program ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]],'' which is known for naming each installment after an 1980s hit song, named a two-part installment after this song.
