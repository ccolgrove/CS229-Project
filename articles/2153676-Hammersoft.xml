'''TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada'''&lt;ref&gt;Official name as stated in the CBC's annual reports, most press releases, and radio promotions. Usually '''Radio-Canada''' is used in on-air TV voiceovers, while the network's logo in print currently only carries the caption &quot;TÃ©lÃ©vision&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian [[French language]] [[television network]]. It is owned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], known in French as ''SociÃ©tÃ© Radio-Canada''.  Headquarters are at [[Maison Radio-Canada]] in [[Montreal]], which is also home to the network's flagship station, [[CBFT-DT]]. It is the only [[francophone]] network in [[Canada]] to broadcast over-the-air in all Canadian provinces.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada}}

This network is considered more populist than its English counterpart [[CBC Television]]. It has arguably been the more successful of the two as it does not face such immense competition from [[United States|American]] networks.  Despite this, it has trailed [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] in the ratings for most of the last 30 years, roughly as long as its English counterpart has trailed [[CTV Television Network|CTV]].  It has recently pulled closer with a resurgent schedule, including offbeat [[sitcoms]], and [[talk show]] ''[[Tout le monde en parle (Quebec)|Tout le monde en parle]].''

With this success, however, have come accusations of [[dumbing down]]. For instance, the aforementioned ''Tout le monde en parle'' replaced the long-running Sunday night arts series ''[[Les Beaux Dimanches]]''.

News programming is anchored by ''[[Le TÃ©lÃ©journal]]'', which airs nightly at 10:00 p.m. Local newscasts, which air during the lunch and supper hours, now also carry the ''TÃ©lÃ©journal'' name, i.e., ''Le TÃ©lÃ©journal MontrÃ©al''. Originally, the regional newscasts had the name ''Ce Soir (This Evening)''.

===''Le TÃ©lÃ©journal''===
All Radio-Canada newscasts are broadcast under the name ''[[Le TÃ©lÃ©journal]]''. The main evening broadcast airs most nights at 10:00 p.m. local time (11:00 p.m. in the [[Maritimes]]). ''Le TÃ©lÃ©journal'' is also seen live and as a repeat broadcast on sister cable news channel [[RÃ©seau de l'information|RDI]] and on time-delay worldwide via international [[francophone]] channel [[TV5MONDE|TV5]]. At present there are no morning newscasts. Local and regional news also takes the ''TÃ©lÃ©journal'' name followed by the name of a city, region or province, or by the time of day (for example ''Le TÃ©lÃ©journal [[Montreal|MontrÃ©al]]'', ''Le TÃ©lÃ©journal Midi'', etc.). [[CBVT-DT]] [[Quebec City]], [[CBLFT-DT]] [[Toronto]] and [[CBOFT-DT]] [[Ottawa]], and [[CBAFT-DT]] in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] run local midday bulletins whilst all affiliates run supper-hour bulletins which run from Monday to Fridays, with the exception of [[CBVT-DT]], [[CBOFT-DT]] and [[CBAFT-DT]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/REGIONS/Atlantique/Tele/atlantiquecesoir.shtml] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; which run seven days a week.

===Current affairs===

Investigative reporting is broadcast weekly as ''[[EnquÃªte]]''. Recent shows tested the safety levels of [[Tasers]] in the wake of concerns raised after a Polish immigrant died after RCMP police officers fired a Taser in [[Vancouver International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/emissions/enquete/2008-2009/Reportage.asp?idDoc=69664] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other shows such as ''[[DÃ©couverte]]'' raised concerns about the safety of overhead bridges in Montreal after the [[De la Concorde overpass collapse|collapse]] of a bridge in 2007.

There is also weekly programming on political affairs concerning the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] and the [[House of Commons (Canada)|House of Commons]] with ''Les coulisses du pouvoir'' (The Corridors of Power). Science and technology issues are covered in ''DÃ©couverte'' and agricultural and rural topics in ''La semaine verte''. Consumer affairs are covered in ''L'Ã©picerie'' and ''Facture''

===Sports===
From 1952 up until 2004 the network was home to weekly French-language broadcasts of [[ice hockey]] matches involving the [[Montreal Canadiens]], called ''[[La SoirÃ©e du hockey]]''.  The show was discontinued when broadcast rights reverted to [[RÃ©seau des sports|RDS]]. Viewers outside of Quebec were able to continue watching games via Radio-Canada stations up until 2006 when RDS became exclusive broadcasters. Radio-Canada were also the home of the [[Montreal Alouettes]] before moving also to RDS.

Occasionally live sports are carried by Radio-Canada including the Montreal Impact soccer club.

Currently, there is only one general sports show for 2011-2012 season: ''Droit au but'' on Saturday night. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/emissions/droit_au_but/] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was ''La zone'' which was broadcasted from Monday to Friday at 11:00 p.m. and was discontinued at the end of 2009-2010 season&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/emissions/la_zone/] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The show ''Tellement sport'' is on Saturday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/emissions/tellement_sport/] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Please check the website for more information.

===Entertainment===
The most popular entertainment shows on the network are variety shows such as ''[[Tout le monde en parle (Quebec)|Tout le monde en parle]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbm.ca/fr/que02232009.pdf] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''M pour musique'', sketch shows like ''Les invincibles'' and ''[[Et Dieu crÃ©a Laflaque]]'' and dramas such as ''[[Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin]]'', ''[[Virginie]]'' and ''Tout sur moi''.

''Tout le monde en parle'' in particular is a long running talk show imported from the same show of the same name in France and has featured high-profile guests, such as [[Julie Couillard]] and former [[Action dÃ©mocratique du QuÃ©bec]] leader [[Mario Dumont]]. A weekly music show called ''Studio 12'' makes an appearance on Sundays.

Although the bulk of the prime-time schedule is Quebec-produced, a few dubbed shows from the US also feature in prime-time, such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Perdus]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives|BeautÃ©es dÃ©sepÃ©rÃ©es]]'', and ''[[Ugly Betty|ChÃ¨re Betty]]''.

On New Year's Eve, Radio-Canada presents a live comedy special, ''[[Bye Bye (TV series)|Bye Bye]]'', which features musical and comedy guests, performing live.

===Children===
Children's programming airs in the morning and feature animated series such as ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[The Smurfs|Les Schtroumps]]'', ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' and ''La cour de rÃ©cre'' amongst Quebec-produced shows such as ''La vie selon Annie''.

Historically the most popular children's show on Radio-Canada was called ''[[Passe-Partout]]'', which was in production for 10 years and broadcast until 1987. It was for some time a co-production with [[TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec|Radio-QuÃ©bec]] and also aired on those networks and [[TVOntario]].

===Regional programming===
Non-news regional programming exists, and is usually programmed for broadcast on weekends, however it is limited to arts and culture and typically airs outside of Quebec, especially in Acadia and the Western provinces. For example '''''Zeste''''' broadcasts on stations in the Western provinces on Saturday early evenings, while '''''Luc et Luc''''' airs Sunday evenings in the Maritimes.

==Stations and affiliates==
{{See also|List of Radio-Canada television stations}}

Of Canada's three major French-language television networks, Radio-Canada is the only one that broadcasts terrestrially in all Canadian provinces. With the exception of [[Atlantic Canada]], where a single station serves all four provinces through an extensive network of rebroadcasters, the network has at least one originating station in every province. These stations serve every major market in French and English Canada, with privately owned [[affiliate]]s serving smaller markets in Quebec.

Unlike CBC Television affiliates, which often have several alternative programming sources, Radio-Canada affiliates are effectively constrained to carry network programming throughout the day in pattern with no preemptions.  The only exceptions are for local and regional programming and commercials.

In 2007, Radio-Canada announced its intention to terminate its long-time affiliation with three regional affiliates in [[Sherbrooke]], [[Trois-RiviÃ¨res]], and [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]].  These stations were owned by [[Cogeco]], majority owner of commercial rival TQS (now [[V (TV network)|V]]). By the end of the year, TQS had filed for bankruptcy; as part of exiting bankruptcy, a deal was announced the following spring for Radio-Canada to directly acquire the stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/n2008-5.htm#2 CRTC Application 2008-0516-1]&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was approved by the CRTC on June 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/db2008-130.htm CRTC Decision 2008-130]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the stations in [[Rouyn-Noranda]] and [[RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup]] remain as private affiliates, rather than [[owned-and-operated station|O&amp;Os]].

On February 27, 2009 CBC/Radio-Canada President Hubert Lacroix admitted at the [[Empire Club of Canada]] that the corporation is facing a budget shortfall and as a result some services may be forced to close down and/or stations merged or sold off, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;La crise Ã©conomique nous force Ã  revoir toutes les facettes de nos activitÃ©s.&quot;&lt;br&gt;(&quot;The economic crisis forced us to review all facets of our activities.&quot;)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/National/2009/02/26/005-Compressions-Radio-Canada.shtml] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is not yet clear how the announcement will affect stations owned by either CBC Television or TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada, however it is envisaged that regional news programming may be merged in the regions outside of Quebec.

==Slogans and branding==
In television listings such as ''[[TV Guide]]'' or ''TV Hebdo'', where space limitations usually require television networks to be referred to by a three-letter abbreviation, the network is normally coded as '''SRC''' (for SociÃ©tÃ© Radio-Canada, the French language corporate name of the CBC as a whole.) This has no official standing as a name for the network â although the network did once experiment with using SRC as its on-air brand in the 1990s, it reverted to &quot;Radio-Canada&quot; within a few months. In 2009 Radio-Canada refreshed its branding featuring simply the word &quot;TÃ©lÃ©vision&quot; underneath the corporate logo; in promos, it merely features the logo, without any wording or slogans.

This particular method of branding can cause slight confusion amongst Canadians as a whole. An exclusive interview with freed murderer [[Karla Homolka]] by Radio-Canada journalist Joyce Napier was hailed as a scoop for &quot;Radio-Canada&quot; in the English-language media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1120564138762_3]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst correct, technically the name &quot;Radio-Canada&quot; refers to the television, radio and internet operations in the French-language, not just &quot;la tÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada&quot;. This same confusion however can extend to [[CBC Television]], where on-air it is branded simply &quot;CBC&quot;.

===Slogans===
*1983-1985(?): &quot;Vous mÃ©ritez ce qu'il y'a de mieux&quot;
*1989-1990: &quot;Pour Vous Avant Tout&quot;
*1994-2006 (System cue/closedown): &quot;Le rÃ©seau national&quot; (The national network)
*1992-Fall 2004: ''Ici Radio-Canada'' (This is Radio-Canada): This is what the announcer said during the [[Station identification|system cue]], when the network logo is displayed on-screen, but in the early-2000s, it became a promotional slogan in its own right.
*2005: ''Vous allez voir'' (You are going to see/You will see).
*2006: ''Ici comme dans la vie'' (Here as in life) and ''Radio-Canada, source d'information'' (Radio-Canada, source of information) for news promos.
*2007: ''On l'aime dÃ©jÃ '' (We already love it){{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*2008: '' Bienvenue Ã  Radio-Canada '' {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*2009: ''Mon monde est Ã  Radio-Canada'' (My world is on Radio-Canada)

==Ombudsmen==
The current [[ombudsman]] of Radio-Canada is [[Julie Miville-DechÃªne]], since April 1, 2007. She was preceded by [[Renaud Gilbert]] (2000â2007), [[Marcel PÃ©pin]] (1997â1999), [[Mario Cardinal]] (1993â1997) and [[Bruno Gauron]] (1992).

==High-definition television==
[[Image:SRC HD.png|right|125px]]On March 5, 2005, TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada launched an [[High-definition television|HD]] simulcast of its [[Montreal]] station [[CBFT-DT]]. Since that time they have also launched HD simulcasts in [[Quebec City]] ([[CBVT-DT]]), [[Ottawa]] ([[CBOFT-DT]]), [[Toronto]] ([[CBLFT-DT]]) and [[Vancouver]] ([[CBUFT-DT]]). Radio-Canada HD is available nationally via satellite and on digital cable as well as for free via [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] using a regular TV antenna and a digital tuner (included in most new TVs) on the following channels:

* Quebec City: 12 (11.1)
* Montreal: 19 (2.1)
* Ottawa: 22 (9.1)
* Toronto: 24 (25.1)
* Vancouver: 26 (26.1)

On September 10, 2007, the network (as well as sister cable news network [[RÃ©seau de l'information|RDI]]) began broadcasting all programming solely in the [[16:9]] [[aspect ratio]] with few exceptions, and began [[letterbox]]ing its widescreen feed for standard definition feeds.

==International coverage==
Certain shows such as ''Virginie'' and ''Le TÃ©lÃ©journal'' are carried on international francophone channel [[TV5MONDE]].

Just like its [[English language]] counterpart [[CBC Television]], TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada stations can be viewed over-the-air in the northern [[United States]] including the border areas of eastern [[Maine]] via [[CBAFT-DT]] Moncton; central New England via [[CKSH-DT]] Sherbrooke; the border areas of [[New York State]] and [[Vermont]] via [[CBFT-DT]] Montreal, [[CBOFT-DT]] Ottawa-Gatineau or [[CBLFT-DT]] Toronto; in Southeastern [[Michigan]] and the [[Ohio]] [[Lake Erie|lakeshore]] from [[CBEFT]] Windsor; or in northwest [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] via [[CBUFT-DT]] Vancouver.
