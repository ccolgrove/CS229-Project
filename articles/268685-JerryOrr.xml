'''Carlo Tresca''' (March 9, 1879 - January 11, 1943) was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[United States|American]] newspaper editor, orator, and labor organizer who was a leader of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] during the decade of the 1910s. Tresca is remembered as a leading public opponent of [[fascism]], [[stalinism]], and [[Mafia]] infiltration of the [[trade union]] movement. Tresca was assassinated by a Mafia gunman in 1943.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Carlo Tresca was born March 9, 1879 in [[Sulmona]], [[Italy]], the son of a landowner.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot;&gt;Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), ''The American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pp. 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Tresca attended [[primary school|primary]], [[grammar school|grammar]], and [[secondary school|high school]] in Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt;

From 1898 to 1902, Tresca was Secretary of the [[Italian Federation of Railroad Workers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt; He was also the editor of ''Il Germe,'' a [[socialism|socialist]] weekly based in Abruzzo.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt;

Seeking to avoid a jail term for his radical political activities, Tresca emigrated to America in 1904, settling in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]].

===American years===

In America, Tresca was elected Secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Federation|Italian Socialist Federation of North America]] in 1904. He remained in that position for the next three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt; During this same interval, Tresca was also the editor of ''Il Proletario'' (The Proletarian), the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt;

Tresca's political views became increasingly more radical and he soon came to identify himself as an [[anarchism|anarchist]]. In 1907 Tresca resigned as editor of ''Il Proletario'' and began publishing his own newspaper, ''La Plebe'' (The Plebian).&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt; He would later transfer ''La Plebe'' to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and, with it, revolutionary ideas to Italian [[mining|miners]] and mill workers in Western [[Pennsylvania]]. In 1909, Tresca became editor of ''L'Avvenire,'' remaining in that capacity until the coming of [[World War I]], when the publication was suppressed under the so-called [[Espionage Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt;

After the victorious strike in Lawrence, Tresca was active in several strikes across the United States; the [[Little Falls (city), New York|Little Falls, New York]] textile workers' strike (1912), the [[New York City]] hotel workers' strike (1913), the [[Paterson silk strike of 1913|Paterson silk strike]] (1913), and the [[Mesabi Range]], [[Minnesota]], miners' strike (1916). He was arrested several times and jailed for 9 months awaiting trial for murder in conjunction with the Minnesota action, ultimately being released without going to trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt;

In August 1923, Tresca was arrested on charges of having printed an advertisement for a [[birth control]] pamphlet in his new publication, ''Il Martello.''&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt; He was found guilty in an October 1923 trial and was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in [[Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt; This sentence was confirmed on November 10, 1924 and Tresca entered prison on January 5, 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALWW&quot; /&gt;

===Making enemies===

Tresca became a major figure among Italian-Americans in trying to halt [[Benito Mussolini]]'s attempts to organize Italian immigrants into [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[support group]]s. At this time, Tresca was editing an [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] newspaper named ''Il Martello'', where he blasted Mussolini as a [[Class conflict|class enemy]] and [[traitor]] (the latter accusation made reference to the fact that Mussolini had been a socialist in the past). Tresca's activities were being monitored in [[Rome]], while, in the United States, he was under heavy surveillance from the American government. In 1926, Fascists attempted to assassinate Tresca with a bomb during a rally.  

Tresca was part of the defense committee for accused murderers [[Sacco and Vanzetti]], and frequently spoke in their defense at rallies and in articles.  

During the 1930s, Tresca became an outspoken opponent of Soviet [[Communism|Communists]] and [[Stalinism]], particularly after the [[Soviet Union]] had engineered the destruction of the [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist movement]] in [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]] during the [[Spanish Revolution]].&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Who Hired the Assassin? |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DE173AF931A35753C1A96E948260 |quote=On Jan. 11, 1943, the Italian-born anarchist editor Carlo Tresca, who had long been one of the stormiest and most vivid figures on the American labor and radical scene, was shot to death on the corner of 15th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York. The wartime blackout - Tresca was shot about 9:30 in the evening - prevented his companion from getting a good look at the assassin. And such was Tresca's current list of opponents and enemies - especially among the former Fascist sympathizers in the Italian-American establishment - that the Manhattan District Attorney's office never pursued several lines of investigation and the case has never been officially solved. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=October 2, 1988 |accessdate=2010-07-30 | first=Alfred | last=Kazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, Tresca had supported the [[Bolsheviks]], reasoning that a [[Communist state]] was preferable to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] state, regarding Soviet Communists as allies in the fight against Fascism.

Tresca was a member of the [[Dewey Commission]] which cleared [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] of all charges made during the [[Moscow Trials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewey Commission Report&quot;&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1937/dewey/index.htm Dewey Commission Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1938 Tresca publicly accused the Soviets of [[kidnap]]ping [[Juliet Stuart Poyntz]] to prevent her defection from the [[Communist Party USA]] underground apparatus. Tresca alleged that, before she had disappeared, Poyntz had talked to him about her disgust over [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|Great Terror]].  In 1941 Tresca, in a revealing moment, admitted to [[Max Eastman]] that [[Nicola Sacco]] was guilty of the crime with which he was charged, though [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Vanzetti]] was innocent. 

In New York, Tresca also began a public campaign of criticism of the Mafia in his weekly newspaper, ''Il Martello''.  Tresca appeared to be well aware of the risk he was running to his life.  At the end of an article published shortly before his death, Tresca stated, &quot;[[Morris Ernst]], my attorney, knows all the facts. He knows that if an anti-fascist is assaulted or killed, the instigator is Generose Pope&quot; (this is believed to be a reference to [[Generoso Pope]] Sr., a New York political power broker with ties to mobster [[Frank Costello]], whose Italian-American newspaper interests included the ''Corriere d'America'' and the daily ''[[Il Progresso Italo-Americano]]'').

===Assassination===
By 1943, Tresca, on parole at the time, was under police surveillance. On January 9, 1943, his surveillance team witnessed an incident in which a speeding car attempted to run Tresca over. 

Two days later, on January 11, 1943 in [[New York City]], Tresca was leaving his parole officer's offices when he dodged surveilling officers by jumping into a car that was waiting for him.  Two hours later, Tresca was crossing [[Fifth Avenue]] at 13th Street on foot when a black [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] pulled up beside him.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;  A short, squat gunman in a brown coat jumped out and shot Tresca in the back and the head with a handgun, killing him instantly. The black Ford was later found abandoned nearby with all four doors open.  One theory at the time was that the [[Mafia]] was the suspected assassin, acting on orders from  Sicily. Others have theorized that Tresca was eliminated by the [[NKVD]] as retribution for criticism of the Stalin regime of the Soviet Union.

More recent research by Alan A. Block in ''Space, Time and Organized Crime'', Dorothy Gallagher in ''All the Right Enemies'', and Nunzio Pernicone in ''Carlo Tresca: Portrait of A Rebel'' all confirm that the most likely scenario is that Tresca was killed by [[Carmine Galante]] on the order of Frank Garofalo, underboss to [[Joseph Bonanno]], Fascist sympathizer and close friend to [[Generoso Pope]]. Tresca had not only been critical of Pope but recently berated Garofalo and threatened to expose him in ''Il Martello''.  Galante, only recently released from prison, was seen by his parole officer fleeing the scene.  Unfortunately, due to the wartime ration of gasoline, the parole officer was unable to give chase.

A eulogy at his memorial service was delivered by [[Angelica Balabanoff]], the socialist activist and former Bolshevik. According to [[Lewis Coser]]'s account of the funeral, &quot;I was sitting near a burly Irish policeman who clearly didn't understand a word of Balabanoff's fierce Italian oratory. But at her climax he burst into tears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Coser, &quot;From a Heroic Past.&quot; ''Dissent,'' Summer 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
