==Development==
[[File:Acid3 3.png|thumb|right|Internet Explorer 9 displaying [[Acid3]]]]
Development of Internet Explorer 9 began shortly after [[Internet Explorer 8]] was released. Microsoft began taking features suggestions through Microsoft Connect soon after Internet Explorer 8 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Forget-about-IE8-Onward-to-Internet-Explorer-9-in-Windows-7-74575.shtml |title=Forget about IE8 - Onward to Internet Explorer 9 in Windows 7 |last=Oiaga |first=Marius |date=2007-12-20 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Explorer team focused on improving support for [[HTML5]], [[CSS3]], [[SVG]], [[XHTML]], and the user interface featuring agility and &quot;a clean new design&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/09/15/ie9-beta-available-for-download.aspx|title=Introducing Internet Explorer 9 Beta&amp;nbsp;â Internet Explorer Blog at MSDN|work=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|date=15 September 2010|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft first announced Internet Explorer 9 at [[Professional Developers Conference|PDC 2009]] and spoke mainly about how it takes advantage of hardware acceleration in [[DirectX]] to improve the performance of [[web applications]] and improve the quality of [[web typography]].

Later, Microsoft announced that they had joined the W3C's [[SVG Working Group]], which sparked speculation that Internet Explorer 9 will support the SVG [[W3C recommendation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx|title=An Early Look At IE9 for Developers|date=2009-11-18|first=Dean|last=Hachamovitch|work=IEBlog on [[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was proven to be true at [[MIX (Microsoft)#MIX 10|MIX 10]], where they demonstrated support for basic SVG markup and improved support for HTML5. They also announced that they would increase the support greatly by the time the first Internet Explorer 9 Beta was released. The Internet Explorer team also introduced the new JavaScript engine for 32-bit Internet Explorer 9, codenamed Chakra, which uses [[Just-in-time compilation]] to execute JavaScript as native code.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/05/29/q-a-64-bit-internet-explorer.aspx | title = Q&amp;A: 64-Bit Internet Explorer | author = Eric Law | date = May 29, 2009 | publisher = Microsoft | work = MSDN Blogs &gt; EricLaw's IEInternals | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5xLWkEWWv | archivedate = 2011-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Internet-Explorer-9-Beta-Next-New-IE9-Builds-Every-8-Weeks-138013.shtml |title=Internet Explorer 9 Beta Next&amp;nbsp;â New IE9 Builds Every 8 Weeks |last=Oiaga |first=Marius |date=2010-03-20 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2010/01/05/microsoft-joins-w3c-svg-working-group.aspx |title=Microsoft Joins W3C SVG Working Group |date=2010-01-05 |first=Patrick |last=Dengler |work=IEBlog on [[Microsoft Developer Network]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September 2011, the Acid3 test was revised to remove a few &quot;antiquated and unusual&quot; tests and as a result IE9 now passes the test with a score of 100/100&lt;ref name=acid3updated&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/acid3-browser-test-web-standard-compatibility-IE9,news-12583.html | title=Acid3 Test Simplified |publisher=Tom's Hardware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At MIX 10, the first Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released, which featured support for CSS3 and SVG, a new [[JavaScript]] engine called [[Chakra (JavaScript engine)|Chakra]], and a score of 55/100 on the [[Acid3]] test, up from 20/100 for [[Internet Explorer 8]]. On May 5, 2010, the second Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released, which featured a score of 68/100 on the [[Acid3]] test and faster performance on the [[SunSpider|WebKit SunSpider JavaScript benchmark]] than the first Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview. On June 23, 2010, the third Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released, which featured a score of 83/100 on the Acid3 test and a faster JavaScript engine than the second Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview. The third Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview also includes support for HTML5 audio, video, and canvas tags, and [[WOFF]]. On August 4, 2010, the fourth Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released, which features a score of 95/100 on the Acid3 test and a faster JavaScript engine than the third Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview. On September 15, 2010, the Internet Explorer 9 Public Beta was released alongside Platform Preview 5, featuring a new user interface. In contrast to the previews, the Beta replaces any previously installed version of Internet Explorer. The sixth Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released on October 28, 2010, and includes support for CSS3 2D transforms and HTML5 semantic elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;preview-6&quot; /&gt; The seventh Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview was released on November 17, 2010, and features better JavaScript performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/benchmarks/SunSpider/Table.html&lt;/ref&gt;

These previews were not full builds of Internet Explorer 9, as they were for testing the latest version of the [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] layout engine. They were for web developers to send feedback on the improvements made, functioned in parallel with any other installed browsers, and were previews of the renderer technology only, containing minimalistic user interfaces and lacking traditional interface elements such as an address bar and navigation buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/info/FrequentlyAskedQuestions/Default.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |date=2010-03-13 |accessdate=2010-03-18 |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft updated these previews approximately every eight weeks.

On November 23, 2010, two updates for the Internet Explorer 9 Public Beta were released. KB2448827 brings improvements to reliability and fixes stability issues from the previous beta release. There are not much details of resolved issues disclosed by Microsoft. Moreover, KB2452648 resolves the in-built feedback issue with Internet Explorer 9 and the latest version of Windows Live Sign-in Assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/11/23/updates-for-internet-explorer-9-beta.aspx|title=Updates for Internet Explorer 9 Beta - Internet Explorer Blog at MSDN|work=Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These updates can be fetched from [[Windows Update]] or the Microsoft Download Center website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=00c694cf-e182-4383-ad0f-3f24e94097ee|title=Update for Windows Internet Explorer 9 Beta for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 (KB2448827)|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c5b94711-620c-42b7-8f9f-e2e08ee4c433&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+MicrosoftDownloadCenter+(Microsoft+Download+Center)|title=Update for Internet Explorer 9 Beta feedback Tool for Windows Vista 64-bit Edition and Windows Server 2008 64-bit Edition (KB2452648)|publisher=Microsoft|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Internet Explorer build 9.0.8027.6000 based on Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview 7 was leaked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ditii.com/2010/11/23/internet-explorer-9-beta-2-build-9-0-8027-6000-leaked-to-the-web/ |title=Internet Explorer 9 Beta 2 Build 9.0.8027.6000 Leaked to the Web |publisher=Ditii.com |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, 2011, the Internet Explorer 9 [[Release Candidate]] and Platform Preview 8 were released.

====JavaScript engine====
{{Main|Chakra (JavaScript engine)}}
{{See also|Comparison of layout engines (ECMAScript)}}
Internet Explorer 9 (32-bit) features a faster JavaScript engine than Internet Explorer 8's, internally known as [[Chakra (JavaScript engine)|Chakra]]. Chakra has a separate background thread for compiling JavaScript. Windows runs that thread in parallel on a separate core when one is available. Compiling in the background enables users to keep interacting with webpages while Internet Explorer 9 generates even faster code. By running separately in the background, this process can take advantage of modern multi-core machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/03/16/html5-hardware-accelerated-first-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx |title=HTML5, Hardware Accelerated: First IE9 Platform Preview Available for Developers |first=Dean |last=Hachamovitch |authorlink=Dean Hachamovitch |date=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Microsoft's preliminary SunSpider benchmarks for the third 32-bit Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview, it outperformed the Internet Explorer 8 engine by a factor of 10 and also outperformed the newest Firefox 4.0 pre-release.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/IE9-Races-for-Fastest-Browsers-in-the-World-Spot-with-Chrome-Firefox-Opera-and-Safari-145545.shtml|title=IE9 Races for Fastest Browsers in the World Spot with Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari |date=2010-06-26 |publisher=Softpedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft provided information that its new javascript engine uses [[dead code elimination]] optimization for faster performance, which included a small section of code in the SunSpider test as dead code.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/11/17/html5-and-real-world-site-performance-seventh-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx|title=HTML5, and Real World Site Performance: Seventh IE9 Platform Preview Available for Developers|date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Sayre, a Mozilla developer investigated this further, showing that Internet Explorer 9's preview 3 dead code elimination had bugs, providing test cases exposing these bugs resulting in wrong compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2010/11/17/dead-code-elimination-for-beginners/ |title=Dead Code Elimination for Beginners |first=Rob |Sayre |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its final release, 32-bit Internet Explorer 9 has been tested to be the leading mainstream browser in the Sunspider performance test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Internet Explorer 9 speeds past the competition | url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9214674/Internet_Explorer_9_speeds_past_the_competition?taxonomyId=167&amp;pageNumber=2| author=Preston Gralla| date=2011-03-16|publisher=Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine significantly improves support for ECMA-262: [[ECMAScript]] Language Specification standard, including features new to the recently finalized Fifth Edition of ECMA-262 (often abbreviated ES5).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/07/16/how-ie9-platform-preview-feedback-changed-the-javascript-standard.aspx |title=How IE9 Platform Preview Feedback Changed the JavaScript Standard |first=Allen |last=Wirfs-Brock |date=2010-07-16 |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Explorer 9 browser release scored only 3 faults{{or|date=April 2011}} from 10440 tests in the [http://test262.ecmascript.org/default.html Test262 Ecmascript conformace test] (Ver. 0.6.2 5-Apr-2011) created by [[Ecma International]].

The 64-bit version of Internet Explorer 9, which is not the default browser even on 64-bit systems, does not have the JIT compiler&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/networking/chrome-10-vs-internet-explorer-9-reconsidered/792?pg=2 | title = Chrome 10 vs. Internet Explorer 9 Reconsidered | publisher = [[ZDNet]] | date = March 10, 2011 | author = Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols | accessdate = 2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and performs up to 4 times slower.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDNet_20110315&quot; /&gt;

====DOM====
{{See also|Comparison of layout engines (Document Object Model)}}
[[Document Object Model|DOM]] improvements include:
* DOM Traversal and Range
* Full DOM L2 and L3 events
* &lt;code&gt;getComputedStyle&lt;/code&gt; from DOM Style
* &lt;code&gt;DOMContentLoaded&lt;/code&gt;

===CSS===
{{See also|Comparison of layout engines (Cascading Style Sheets)}}

Internet Explorer 9 has improved [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) support. The Internet Explorer 9 implementation report, which was created using Internet Explorer 9 Beta, shows Internet Explorer 9 passing 97.7% of all tests on the [[W3C]] CSS 2.1 test suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/10/08/css-2-1-implementation-reports.aspx| title=CSS 2.1 Implementation Reports| author=Adrian Bateman|date=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest pass rate amongst CSS 2.1 implementation reports submitted to W3C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://test.csswg.org/harness/results?s=CSS21&amp;t=0|title=CSS 2.1 Test Suite Results|publisher=W3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTML5===
====HTML5 Media====
{{See also|Comparison of layout engines (HTML5 Media)}}

Internet Explorer 9 includes support for the HTML5 video and audio tags.

The audio tag will include native support for the [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] codecs, while the [[HTML5 video|video tag]] will natively support [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;prev3-media&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/IE9-Platform-Preview-3-HTML5-Evolution-Canvas-Video-and-Audio-Elements-Now-Supported-145416.shtml |title=IE9 Platform Preview 3 HTML5 Evolution: Canvas, Video and Audio Elements Now Supported |first=Marius |last=Oiaga |publisher=[[Softpedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for other video formats, such as [[WebM]], will require third-party plugins.&lt;ref name=&quot;prev3-media&quot;/&gt;

===Web typography===
{{See also|Comparison of layout engines (Web Typography)}}

Internet Explorer was the first browser to support web fonts through the &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt; rule, but only supported the [[Embedded OpenType]] (EOT) format, and lacked support for parts of the CSS3 fonts module.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://webfonts.info/wiki/index.php?title=@font-face_support_in_Internet_Explorer |title=@font-face support in Internet Explorer |publisher=Webfonts.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer 9 completed support for the CSS3 fonts module and added [[Web Open Font Format|WOFF]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/23/html5-native-third-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx |title=HTML5, Native: Third IE9 Platform Preview Available for Developers |date=2010-06-23 |first=Dean |last=Hachamovitch |authorlink=Dean Hachamovitch |publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navigation Timings===

Internet Explorer 9 implements the new W3C Navigation Timings format. Microsoft has been a part of creating this format during the development of Internet Explorer 9.

===Tracking Protection===

Internet Explorer 9 includes a ''Tracking Protection'' feature which improves upon Internet Explorer 8's ''InPrivate Filtering''. Internet Explorer 8's InPrivate Filtering blocked third-party content using an XML list which had to be imported or automatically built a list by observing third-party servers that users kept interacting with as they browsed the web, and once a server showed up more than a set number of times, InPrivate Filtering would block future connections to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/westindies/homesecurity/Browser-Security-InPrivate.aspx |title=InPrivate Filtering: Microsoft Home Security Kit |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 9 supports two methods of tracking protection. The primary method is through the use of Tracking Protection Lists (TPL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/SUBM-web-tracking-protection-20110224/#list-format/|title=Web Tracking Protection - List Format|publisher=W3C|date=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are now supplied by [[internet privacy]]-related organizations or companies. Tracking Protection by default remains on once enabled, unlike InPrivate Filtering which had to be enabled each time Internet Explorer 8 started. When a TPL is selected, Internet Explorer 9 blocks or allows third-party URI downloads based on rules in the TPL. Users can create their personal TPL's or [http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/Browser/TrackingProtectionLists/ select a TPL supplied by a third party].

The other method is the use of a [[Do not track header|Do Not Track header]] and DOM property.&lt;ref name=&quot;w3c-submission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Submission/2011/SUBM-web-tracking-protection-20110224/#do-not-track|title=Web Tracking Protection - Do Not Track|date=2011-02-24|publisher=W3C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browser requests from Internet Explorer 9 include this header whenever a TPL is selected. Websites that follow this header should not deliver tracking mechanisms in their websites. At the moment following this header is a voluntary code of conduct but this method could in future be enforced by government legislation.

These tracking protection methods were submitted to W3C for standardization.&lt;ref name=&quot;w3c-submission&quot;/&gt;

===Malware protection===

Internet Explorer 9 uses layered protection against malware. It uses technical measures to protect its memory like the [[Data Execution Prevention|DEP]]/NSX protection, Safe Exception handlers (SafeSEH) and [[Address space layout randomization|ASLR]] protection used in Internet Explorer 8.

In addition to those existing forms of [[memory protection]], Internet Explorer 9 now opts-in to SEHOP (Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection) which works by validating the integrity of the exception handling chain before dispatching exceptions. This helps ensure that structured exception handling cannot be used as an exploit vector, even when running outdated browser add-ons that have not been recompiled to take advantage of SafeSEH.&lt;ref name=&quot;sec_mem&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/07/internet-explorer-9-security-part-1-enhanced-memory-protections.aspx| title=Internet Explorer 9 Security Part 1: Enhanced Memory Protections|date=2011-03-07|author=Eric Lawrence (Microsoft)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Internet Explorer 9 is compiled with the new C++ compiler provided with Visual Studio 2010. This compiler includes a feature known as Enhanced GS, also known as [[Stack buffer overflow|Stack Buffer Overrun]] Detection, which helps prevent stack buffer overruns by detecting stack corruption and avoiding execution if such corruption is encountered.&lt;ref name=&quot;sec_mem&quot;/&gt;

Internet Explorer 8 used SmartScreen technology, which, according to Microsoft, was successful against phishing or other malicious sites and in blocking of [[Social engineering (security)|socially engineered]] malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/IE8-Blocked-Over-1-Billion-Malware-Download-Attempts-148943.shtml|title=IE8 Blocked Over 1 Billion Malware Download Attempts|date=2010-07-24|author=Marius Oiaga|publisher=Softpedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Internet Explorer 9, the protection against malware downloads is extended with SmartScreen Application Reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/10/internet-explorer-9-security-part-2-protection-from-socially-engineered-attacks.aspx/|title=Internet Explorer 9: Protection from Socially Engineered Attacks with SmartScreen URL Reputation|date=2011-03-10|author=Ryan Colvin(Microsoft)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This warns downloaders if they are downloading an application without a safe reputation from a site that does not have a safe reputation.

In late 2010, the results of browser malware testing undertaken by NSS labs were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/web-browser-group-test-socially-engineered-malware-q3-2010.html |title=Web Browser Group Test Socially-Engineered Malware Q3 2010 |publisher=nsslabs.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study looked at the browser's capability to prevent users following [[Social engineering (security)|socially engineered]] links of a malicious nature and downloading malicious software. It did not test the browser's ability to block malicious web pages or code.

According to NSS, Internet Explorer 9 blocked 99% of malware downloads compared to 90% for Internet Explorer 8 that does not have SmartScreen Application Reputation feature.
In early 2010, similar tests gave Internet Explorer 8 an 85% passing grade, the 5% improvement being attributed to &quot;continued investments in improved data intelligence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/12/14/enhanced-protection-with-ie9-s-smartscreen-filter.aspx |title=Enhanced Protection with IE9âs SmartScreen Filter |publisher=microsoft.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the same research showed that Chrome 6, Firefox 3.6 and Safari 5, which all rely on Google's Safe Browsing Service, scored 6%, 19% and 11%, respectively. Opera 10 scored 0%, failing to &quot;detect any of the socially engineered malware samples&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2374309,00.asp |title=NSS Labs: Internet Explorer 9 Offers Best Protection |publisher=pcmag.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers of other browsers criticized the test, focusing upon the lack of transparency of URLs tested and the lack of consideration of [[layered security]] additional to the browser, with [[Google]] commenting that &quot;The report itself clearly states that it does not evaluate browser security related to vulnerabilities in plug-ins or the browsers themselves&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubenking|first=Neil|title=Google Responds to NSS Labs Browser Security Report|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2374344,00.asp|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=2011-01-16|date=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] commenting that the results appeared &quot;odd that they received no results from our data providers&quot; and that &quot;social malware protection is not an indicator of overall browser security&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bakke|first=Kurt|title=Opera Also Questions IE Security Test Results|url=http://www.conceivablytech.com/4672/business/opera-also-questions-ie-security-test-results/|publisher=ConceivablyTech.com|accessdate=2011-01-16|date=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 9's dual-pronged approach to blocking access to malicious URLsâSmartScreen Filter to block bad URLs, and Application Reputation to detect untrustworthy executablesâprovides the best socially engineered malware blocking of any stable browser version.  Internet Explorer 9 blocked 92 percent of malware with its URL-based filtering, and 100 percent with Application-based filtering enabled. Internet Explorer 8, in second place, blocked 90 percent of malware. Tied for third place were Safari 5, Chrome 10, and Firefox 4, each blocking just 13 percent. Bringing up the rear was Opera 11, blocking just 5 percent of malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/07/internet-explorer-9-utterly-dominates-malware-blocking-stats.ars|title=Internet Explorer 9 utterly dominates malware-blocking stats |date=2011-07-16 |publisher=[[ArsTechnica]] |first=Peter|last=Bright|accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsslabs.com/research/endpoint-security/browser-security/web-browser-group-test-socially-engineered-malware-europe-q2-2011.html |title=Web Browser Group Test Socially-Engineered Malware |date=2011-07-16 |publisher=[[NSS Labs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User agent string===
Due to technical improvements of the browser, the Internet Explorer developer team decided to change the [[user agent]] (UA) string. The &lt;code&gt;Mozilla/4.0&lt;/code&gt; token was changed to &lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0&lt;/code&gt; to match the user agent strings of other recent browsers and to indicate that Internet Explorer 9 is more inter operable than previous versions. The &lt;code&gt;Trident/4.0&lt;/code&gt; token was likewise changed to &lt;code&gt;Trident/5.0&lt;/code&gt;. Because long, extended UA strings cause compatibility issues, Internet Explorer 9's default UA string does not include [[.NET Framework|.NET]] identifiers or other &quot;pre-platform&quot; and &quot;post-platform&quot; tokens that were sent by previous versions of the browser. The extended string is still available to websites via the browser's .userAgent property, and is sent when a web page page is displayed in [[Compatibility mode (browser)|compatibility mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff986085%28v=vs.85%29.aspx | title = Default User-Agent (UA) String Changed | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | date = April 13, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensibility===
In Internet Explorer 9, the extensibility mechanisms for [[Browser Helper Object|Browser Helper Objects (BHOs)]] and [[toolbar]]s remain the same. Not loading BHOs or toolbars improves startup time, but limits the ability of developers to augment the user experience through these extensibility mechanisms.

==Reception==
===Release candidate===
A [[release candidate]] was launched on February 10, 2011 in [[San Francisco]]. New features since the last beta version were tracking protection and use of hardware accelerated graphics, and improvements included faster performance and more support for emerging HTML5 standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2380054,00.asp | publisher = [[PC Magazine]] | title = Microsoft Launches IE9 Release Candidate | author = Michael Muchmore | date = February 10, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting that according to [[Net Applications]], Internet Explorer's share fell to 56% in January 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=144&amp;qpnp=1 | publisher = [[Net Applications]] | title = Browser Market Share January 2011 | archivedate = 2011-02-22 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5whMWZpne }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[BBC]] quoted Microsoft's claims that Internet Explorer 9 is &quot;playing catch up, but it leapfrogs everything&quot; and &quot;you are seeing innovation after innovation that other folks are catching up to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12424407 | title = Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 web browser goes live | date = February 10, 2011 | author = Maggie Shiels | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 2011-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Register]]'', Tim Anderson said Internet Explorer 9 was Microsoft's answer to the fall in Internet Explorer's market share (from 68.5% in July 2008 to 46% in January 2011, according to [[StatCounter]]). He felt it was &quot;fast and polished&quot;, a &quot;remarkable improvement&quot; over version 8, noting &quot;superb&quot; development tools and &quot;real and significant&quot; support for HTML5, though &quot;not as comprehensive as the company's publicity implies.&quot; However, configuration options are &quot;strewn all over the user interface&quot;, and the &quot;distinctive and excellent&quot; [[ActiveX]] filtering and [[Web visitor tracking|Tracking Protection]] features might be &quot;perplexing for less technical users.&quot; Having reached release candidate status eleven months after it was originally announced at the March 2010 [[MIX (Microsoft)|MIX conference]], &quot;Microsoft's development process is too slow.&quot; The new version is &quot;a good modern browser&quot; but &quot;the competition is moving faster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/14/ie_9_release_candidate_review/ | title = Microsoft's IE9: Don't believe the hype | publisher = The Register | author = Tim Anderson | date = February 14, 2011 | archivedate = 2011-02-22 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5whKrBsmD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]]'' observed that &quot;the feature set has piled up&quot; since development began, with recent changes including &quot;a completely rejigged JavaScript engine, and far better web standards support.&quot; It reported that Internet Explorer 9 RC ranked above Firefox, slightly above Safari, and below Chrome and Opera on [[Futuremark]]'s Peacekeeper browser benchmark. Internet Explorer 9 scored 95% on the unofficial [[Acid3]] standards test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] | url = http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/review/2026634/microsoft-internet-explorer-release-candidate-review | title = Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 release candidate review  | author = Dave Bailey | date = February 16, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Muchmore's first impressions in ''[[PC Magazine]]'' were broadly positive, praising features of the InPrivate mode (which &quot;I'm surprised other browser makers haven't included&quot;) and concluding that Internet Explorer 9's tracking protection was &quot;more flexible and comprehensive&quot; than Mozilla's. The review reported that Internet Explorer 9 &quot;now wins the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark&quot; and had achieved &quot;a hefty improvement&quot; on Google's JavaScript benchmark â though it was still far behind Chrome 9. However &quot;in normal browsing, I was hard pressed to see a [performance] difference between Chrome and Internet Explorer.&quot; The release candidate was also &quot;perfectly&quot; compatible with far more sites than the beta, but there are still issues with some sites because their developers are not yet testing with the new browser. The RC scores 4 out of 5 (&quot;very good&quot;) for now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369160,00.asp | publisher = [[PC Magazine]] | title = Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) Release Candidate | author = Michael Muchmore | date = February 10, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final release ===
On its first day of commercial availability, Internet Explorer 9 was downloaded over 2.35 million times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/222409/internet_explorer_9_downloaded_over_2_million_times_on_day_one.html | work= [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] | title = Internet Explorer 9 Downloaded Over 2 Million Times on Day One | author = Ian Paul | date = March 16, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blogging his March 2011 performance tests for [[ZDNet]], Adrian Kingsley-Hughes concluded that [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] 10, Internet Explorer 9 (32-bit) Final Release, [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 11.01 and [[Firefox]] 4's [[Release candidate]] were &quot;pretty evenly matched.... Microsoft has worked hard on IE, taking it from being the slowest in the pack to one of the fastest. Bottom line, I really donât think that JavaScript performance is an issue any more, and certainly in real-world testing itâs hard to see a difference between the browsers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDNet_20110315&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/ie9-vs-chrome-10-vs-firefox-4-rc-vs-opera-1101-vs-safari-5-the-big-browser-benchmark/11890?pg=6 | title = IE9 vs Chrome 10 vs Firefox 4 RC vs Opera 11.01 vs Safari 5 - The BIG browser benchmark! | publisher = [[ZDNet]] | author = Adrian Kingsley-Hughes | date = March 15, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2011, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] ranked Internet Explorer 9 as #19 on its ''100 Best Products of 2011''. The other web browser listed was [[Maxthon]] 3.1, a hybrid browser based on Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=100 Best Products of 2011 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |publisher = PCWorld Communications, Inc. |date=31 October 2011 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/collection/9806/2011_best_tech.html |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PC World praised for its performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mediati|first=Nick|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer 9|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/205394/internet_explorer_9_beta_rough_spots_but_performance_and_interface_enhancements_as_well.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=PC World|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile version==
At the February 2011 [[Mobile World Congress]], [[Steve Ballmer]] announced a major update to [[Windows Phone 7]] due towards the end of 2011,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET_20110215&quot;/&gt; which will include a mobile version of Internet Explorer 9 that supports the same web standards (e.g. HTML5) and hardware accelerated graphics as the PC version.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNET_20110214&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13970_7-20031778-78.html | title = Multitasking, IE9 coming to Windows Phone | author = Bonnie Cha | publisher = [[cNET.com|cnet]] | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft demonstrated hardware-accelerated performance of a fish-tank demo using a development build of mobile Internet Explorer 9 compared with slow performance on the [[iOS (Apple)|November 2010 iOS 4.2.1]] RTM of Safari on iPhone 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET_20110215&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG30mtlDKOs|title=IE9 for Windows Phone 7 support HTML5 and speed test with iPhone|Location=Mobile World Congress 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
