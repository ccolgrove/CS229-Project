The '''2009â10 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team''' represented the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]. The team was coached by [[Lon Kruger]], returning for his sixth year with the Runnin' Rebels.

They advanced to the championship game of the [[2010 Mountain West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] before losing to [[2009â10 San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team|San Diego State]]. They received an atâlarge bid to the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], earning an 8 seed in the Midwest Region, where they lost to 9 seed [[2009â10 Northern Iowa Panthers men's basketball team|Northern Iowa]] in the first round.

== Season ==
=== Non-conference schedule ===
On November 28, 2009, the team defeated #16 Louisville and became ranked nationally the following week.&lt;ref&gt;http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/teams/naj&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293322439&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] in double overtime, 74â72, on December 2, 2009, UNLV marked their first 6â0 start since the 1992â93 season and defeated Santa Clara on December 5 to move to 7â0, their best start since going 34â0 in 1990â91 and losing to Duke in the Final Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Youmans |first=Matt |url=http://www.lvrj.com/sports/rebels-get-by-on-road-78628447.html |title=NARROW ESCAPE: Rebels get by on road |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=December 6, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNLV would raise to #17/18 by the time they took on [[2009-10 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]] on a neutral court at the [[Orleans Arena]].  As in the previous two games, UNLV's sloppy first half play allowed their opponent to jump to an early lead.  Unlike in the games against Arizona and Santa Clara, UNLV was unable to move back in front and would lose their first game of the season, 95â80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/13/unlv-kstate-game-121309/ |title=K-State pesters and flusters No. 18 UNLV in 95â80 victory |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 13, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNLV's loss to Kansas State would drop them to #23 in the Coaches poll and knock them out of the AP poll all together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/14/rebels-drop-ap-poll-ranked-23rd-coaches/ |title=Rebels drop from AP poll, ranked 23rd by coaches |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Runnin' Rebels were able to rebound from the loss with a road win at [[Southern Utah Thunderbirds men's basketball|Southern Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/16/unlv-explodes-second-half-beat-southern-utah/ |title=UNLV explodes in second half to beat Southern Utah, 77â59 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and home wins against [[Weber State Wildcats men's basketball|Weber State]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/17/unlv-weberstate-blog-121709/ |title=UNLV uses consistency to get by Weber State, 72â63 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of South Carolina Upstate|South Carolina â Upstate]], before heading to Hawai'i for the inaugural [[Diamond Head Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/20/unlv-uscu-gamer-122009/ |title=Rebels avoid pitfall, keep focus in 88â58 blowout |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 20, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Runnin' Rebels would enter the tournament only ranked in the coaches poll at #20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/21/rebels-still-unranked-ap-poll-rise-20th-espnusa-to/ |title=Rebels still unranked in AP poll, rise to 20th in ESPN/USA Today |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNLV's first game of tournament would come against [[SMU Mustangs|SMU]].  UNLV took control of the game quickly, sprinting out to an 18â4 lead within mere minutes of tip off and never looked back in a 67â53 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/dec/23/unlv-smu-gamer-122309/ |title=Marshall steps up again, helps UNLV dance past SMU, 67â53 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the tournament's semifinal, the Rebels would face the tournament host, [[Hawai'i Warriors men's basketball|Hawai'i]].

=== Conference schedule ===
After eleven days off, UNLV began conference play against #23/25 [[BYU Cougars men's basketball|BYU]] at the [[Marriott Center]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].  Despite leading the Cougars for much of the game, including a six-point lead with less than six minutes to play.  Late miscues would doom the Runnin' Rebels, leading to a 77â73 defeat to BYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jan/07/unlv-byu-game-010710/ |title=Late miscues doom UNLV in 77073 loss to BYU |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following Saturday, UNLV would travel to [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]] to take on the #13/15 [[2009-10 New Mexico Lobos basketball team|New Mexico Lobos]].  UNLV was able to keep the sell-out crowd of 14,586 quiet for most of the game, beginning by forcing New Mexico into two turnovers on their first two possessions of the game and jumping to a 9â2 lead.  New Mexico would come back, taking over the lead twice in the game, but sophomore guard Kendall Wallace would pace the Rebels, going 7 of 10 on three pointers as UNLV upset New Mexico 74â62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jan/09/unlv-unm-game-011010/ |title=Wallace gets âthe feel,â UNLV gets the win, 74â62 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=January 9, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Runnin' Rebels had their conference home opener against [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]], a team that swept UNLV in their three meetings the previous season.  The first half of the game belonged to the bigger and athletically stacked SDSU, taking a 39â33 halftime lead.  The Runnin' Rebels however, were able to take control in the second half and came away with a hard fought 76â66 victory over their rival to improve to 2â1 in the Mountain West and 14â3 overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Greene |first=Ryan |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jan/14/unlv-sdsu-game-011410/ |title=UNLV surges late to chop down SDSU, 76â66 |work=Las Vegas Sun |date=January 14, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, thing soon went downhill as UNLV fell to Utah at home, 73â69. The Rebels rebounded and won in both Colorado State and TCU. Returning home, UNLV came from behind to beat Air Force, 60â50.
