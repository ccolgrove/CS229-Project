The military investigated Cartwright in 2009 and 2010 for possible misconduct involving a female Marine captain, and investigators recommended administrative action for &quot;failure to discipline a subordinate&quot; and &quot;fostering an unduly familiar relationship&quot;. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ray Mabus]], however, declined to implement the recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/us/politics/24pentagon.html | work=The New York Times | first=Thom | last=Shanker | title=General James Cartwright Is Cleared of Sex Accusations | date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[Q]uestions about how he oversaw his staff,&quot; however, were mentioned as a reason Cartwright had fallen out as favored candidate of President Obama for [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in 2011. Army chief Gen. [[Martin Dempsey]] was named to the post. &quot;Some Republicans [had] ... quietly criticized Gen. Cartwright, calling him 'Obama's general,'&quot; one report at the time also said.&lt;ref&gt;Entous, Adam, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303745304576355321237338548.html?mod=ITP_pageone_1 &quot;Top Officer in Army to Lead Joint Chiefs&quot;], ''The Wall Street Journal'', May 31, 2011.
