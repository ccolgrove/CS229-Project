'''Islamic architecture''' encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the [[History of Islam|foundation of Islam]] to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures in [[Islamic culture]].
The principal Islamic architectural types are: the [[Mosque]], the [[Tomb]], the [[Palace]] and the [[Fort]]. From these four types, the vocabulary of Islamic architecture is derived and used for buildings of lesser importance such as [[public baths]], [[fountains]] and domestic architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cop149&quot;&gt;Copplestone, p.149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;cid=1158658332974&amp;pagename=Zone-English-ArtCulture%2FACELayout A Tour of Architecture in Islamic Cities&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:Taj Mahal Calligraphy Example.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Islamic Calligraphy]] on large pishtaq of the [[Taj Mahal]]]]

A specifically recognizable Islamic [[architectural style]] emerged soon after [[Muhammad]]'s  time, inspired by Islam with addition of localized adaptations of the former [[Sassanid architecture|Sassanid]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] models, the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Visigoths]] in [[Spain]] also made a big contribution to Islamic architecture. They invented the [[Horseshoe arch]] in [[Spain]] and used them as one of their main architectural features, After the moorish invasion of Spain in 711 AD the form was taken by the Ummayyads who accentuated the curvature of the horseshoe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.green-man-of-cercles.org/articles/the_development_of_the_horseshoe_arch_in_christian_spain.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dome of the Rock]] (''Qubbat al-Sakhrah'') in [[Jerusalem]] (691) is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence ([[mosaic]] against a gold background, and a central plan that resembles that of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], although the church itself was renovated several times in the Islamic period&lt;ref&gt;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre
, Martin Biddleâ. p.68&lt;/ref&gt;), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic [[frieze]]. It featured interior vaulted spaces, a circular dome, and the use of stylized repeating decorative [[arabesque]] patterns.  The desert palaces in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] (for example, [[Mshatta facade|Mshatta]], [[Qasr Amra]], and Khirbat al-Mafjar) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated to promote an image of royal luxury.

[[File:TUNISIE KAIROUAN 04.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dome of the mihrab in the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] also known as the Mosque of Uqba, in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]]]
Religious and civic architecture were developed under the [[Umayyad]]s, when new concepts and new plans were put into practice. Thus, the âArab plan,â with court and [[hypostyle]] prayer hall, truly became a functional type with the construction of the Umayyad Mosque, or the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] of [[Damascus]] (completed in 715 by caliph Al-Walid I)&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, Robert. Islamic Art and Architecture, Thames &amp; Hudson World of Art series; 1999, London. ISBN 978050020305&lt;/ref&gt; on top of the ancient temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and in place of the basilica of [[St. John the Baptist]], the most sacred site in the city. This building served as a point of reference for builders (and for art historians) for the birth of the Arab plan, as Byzantine Christian.

The [[Abbasid dynasty]] (750 [[A.D.]]&lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt; 1258&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, World of Art&lt;/ref&gt;) witnessed the movement of the capital from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]], once the largest in the world, was built for the new capital.  Other major mosques built in the Abbasid Dynasty include the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in Cairo, [[Abu Dalaf]] in Iraq, the great mosque in [[Tunis]].  Abbasid architecture in [[Iraq]] as exemplified in the [[Fortress of Al-Ukhaidir]] (c.775-6) demonstrated the &quot;despotic and the pleasure-loving character of the dynasty&quot; in its grand size but cramped living quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (in [[Tunisia]]), considered as the ancestor of all the mosques in the western Islamic world,&lt;ref name=&quot;kairouan mosque&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=IaM9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=oleg+grabar+kairouan+mosque&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=oleg%20grabar%20kairouan%20mosque&amp;f=false John Stothoff Badeau and John Richard Hayes, ''The Genius of Arab civilization: source of Renaissance''. Taylor &amp; Francis. 1983. p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best preserved and most significant examples of early great mosques. Founded in 670 AD, it dates in its present form largely from the [[Aghlabids|Aghlabid]] period (9th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=399&amp;lang=en Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara mediterranean heritage)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Mosque of Kairouan is constituted of a massive square minaret, a large courtyard surrounded by porticos and a huge hypostyle prayer hall covered on its axis by two cupolas.&lt;ref name=&quot;kairouan mosque&quot;/&gt;  The [[Great Mosque of Samarra]] in [[Iraq]], completed in 847 AD, combined the [[hypostyle]] architecture of rows of columns supporting a flat base above which a huge spiraling [[minaret]] was constructed.
[[File:Dome of the Rock Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-11.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]
The [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul]] also influenced Islamic architecture. When the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s captured the city from the [[Byzantine]]s, they converted the [[basilica]] to a [[mosque]] (now a museum) and incorporated [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine architectural]] elements into their own work (e.g. [[domes]]). The Hagia Sophia also served as a model for many Ottoman mosques such as the Shehzade Mosque, the [[Suleiman Mosque]], and the [[RÃ¼stem Pasha Mosque]].

Distinguishing [[Motif (art)|motif]]s of Islamic architecture have always been ordered repetition, radiating structures, and rhythmic, metric patterns. In this respect, [[fractal geometry]] has been a key utility, especially for mosques and palaces. Other significant features employed as motifs include columns, piers and arches, organized and interwoven with alternating sequences of niches and colonnettes.&lt;ref&gt;Tonna (1990), pp.182-197&lt;/ref&gt; The role of domes in Islamic architecture has been considerable. Its usage spans centuries, first appearing in 691 with the construction of the [[Dome of the Rock]], and recurring even up until the 17th century with the [[Taj Mahal]]. As late as the 19th century, Islamic domes had been incorporated into Western architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, O. (2006) p.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen (2003), p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pergamon Museum Berlin P3.jpg|thumb|Section of the [[Mshatta facade]], now in a Berlin museum, from a palace near [[Damascus]]]]
There are few buildings dating to the era of Prophet Muhammad, one example is: Juatha mosque in [[Saudi Arabia]].

===Rashidun Caliphate===
{{main|Rashidun Caliphate}}
Rashidun Caliphate (632-661) was the first state to use Islamic Architecture, sought the first use of Islamic Forts, Administration systems (Dar al-Imara) and the first foundation of Islamic cities ([[Basra]], [[Kufa]] and [[Fostat]]).

===Umayyad Caliphate===
{{main|Umayyad Caliphate}}
Umayyad Empire (661-750), in the Umayyad era many new elements were included to the Islamic architecture: Minarates, Arabisque, Mosaic, Luxury palaces.

====Moorish architecture====
[[Image:Mosque of Cordoba Spain.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of the [[Mezquita]].]]
[[File:Castelo-dos-Mouros 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Castle of the Moors]], [[Sintra]], [[Portugal]].]]
{{Main|Moorish architecture}}Construction of the [[Mezquita de CÃ³rdoba|Great Mosque at Cordoba]] (now a cathedral known as the Mezquita) beginning in 785 CE marks the beginning of Islamic architecture in the [[Iberian peninsula]] and [[North Africa]] (see [[Moors]]). The mosque is noted for its striking interior [[arch]]es. Moorish architecture reached its peak with the construction of the [[Alhambra]], the magnificent palace/fortress of [[Granada]], with its open and breezy interior spaces adorned in red, blue, and gold. The walls are decorated with stylized [[foliage]] motifs, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions, and [[arabesque]] design work, with walls covered in glazed [[tile]]. There other, smaller, survivals such as the Bab Mardum in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], or the caliphal city of [[Medina Azahara]].  Moorish architecture has its roots deeply established in the [[Arab]] tradition of architecture and design established during the era of the first Caliphate of the [[Umayyads]] in the [[Levant]] circa 660AD with its capital [[Damascus]] having very well preserved examples of fine [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] design and geometrics, including the carmen, which is the typical Damascene house, opening on the inside with a fountain as the house's centre piece.

Even after the completion of the [[Reconquista]], Islamic influence had a lasting impact on the [[Spanish architecture|architecture of Spain]]. In particular, medieval Spaniards used the [[MudÃ©jar]] style, highly influence  Islamic design. One of the best examples of the Moors' lasting impact on Spanish architecture is the [[AlcÃ¡zar of Seville]].

===Abbasid Caliphate===
{{main|Abbasid Caliphate}}
Abbasid Caliphate (750-1513), Islamic Architecture peaked in the Abbasid era, cities such as Baghdad, Damascus, Aleppo were of the largest cities ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=yJPlCpzOY_QC&amp;pg=PA281 Societies, Networks, and Transitions: A Global History: To 1500, Craig A.

'''Break Away Kingdoms''':

====Fatimid architecture====
[[File:Mosquee al-akim le caire 1.jpg|right|thumb|Mosque of [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Hakim]] as renovated by [[Dawoodi Bohra]].]]
[[File:Bab al-Futuh.jpg|left|thumb|Bab al-Futuh gate built by Fatimid vazir [[Badr al-Jamali]] ]]

In architecture, the [[Fatimid]]s followed [[Tulunid]] techniques and used similar materials, but also developed those of their own. In [[Cairo]], their first congregational mosque was [[al-Azhar mosque]] (&quot;the splendid&quot;) founded along with the city (969â973), which, together with its adjacent institution of higher learning ([[al-Azhar University]]), became the spiritual center for [[Ismaili|Ismaili Shia]]. The Mosque of al-Hakim (r. 996â1013), an important example of Fatimid architecture and architectural decoration, played a critical role in [[Fatimid]] ceremonial and procession, which emphasized the religious and political role of the [[Fatimid]] [[caliph]]. Besides elaborate funerary monuments, other surviving Fatimid structures include the [[Aqmar Mosque]] (1125) as well as the monumental gates for Cairo's [[Defensive wall|city walls]] commissioned by the powerful [[Fatimid]] [[emir]] and [[vizier]] [[Badr al-Jamali]] (r. 1073â1094).

====Mamluk architecture====
The reign of the [[Mamluks]] (1250-1517 AD) marked a breathtaking flowering of Islamic art which is most visible in old Cairo. [[Zealotry|Religious zeal]] made them generous patrons of architecture and art. Trade and agriculture flourished under Mamluk rule, and Cairo, their capital, became one of the wealthiest cities in the [[Near East]] and the center of artistic and intellectual activity. This made Cairo, in the words of [[Ibn Khaldun]], &quot;the [[center of the universe]] and the garden of the world&quot;, with majestic domes, courtyards, and soaring minarets spread across the city.

The architectural identity of Mamluk religious monuments stems from the major purpose that individuals erected their own memorials, therefore adding a high degree of individuality. Each building reflected the patronâs individual tastes, choices, and name. Mamluk architecture is oftentimes categorized more by the reigns of the major [[sultan]], than a specific design. Interestingly, the mamluk elite were often more knowledgeable in the art of buildings than many historians.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. Cairo of the Mamluks : A History of Architecture and Its Culture. New York: Macmillan, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the Mamluks had both wealth and power, the overall moderate proportions of Mamluk architectureâcompared to Timurid or classical Ottoman stylesâis due to the individual decisions of patrons who preferred to sponsor multiple projects. The sponsors of the mosques of [[Baibars]], [[al-Nasir Muhammad]], [[Faraj bin Barquq|Faraj]], [[al-Muâayyad]], [[Barsbay]], [[Qaitbay]] and [[Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri|al-Ghawri]] all preferred to build several mosques in the capital rather than focusing on one colossal monument. Patrons used architecture to strengthen their religious and social roles within the community.

While the organization of Mamluk monuments varied, the funerary dome and minaret were constant leitmotifs. These attributes are prominent features in a Mamluk mosque's profile and were significant in the beautification of the city skyline. In Cairo, the funerary dome and minaret were respected as symbols of commemoration and worship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Patrons used these visual attributes to express their individuality by decorating each dome and minaret with distinct patterns. Patterns carved on domes ranged from ribs and zigzags to floral and geometric star designs. The funerary dome of [[Aytimish al-Bajasi]] and the mausoleum dome of Qaitbay's sons reflect the diversity and detail of Mamluk architecture. Therefore the creativity of Mamluk builders was effectively emphasized with these leitmotifs.

Expanding on the [[Fatimids]] concept of street-adjusted mosque facades, the Mamluks developed their architecture to enhance street vistas. In addition, new aesthetic concepts and architectural solutions were created to reflect their assumed role in history. By 1285 the essential features of Mamluk architecture were already established in the complex of Sultan Qalawan. However, it took three decades for the Mamluks to create a new and distinct architecture. By 1517, the Ottoman conquest brought Mamluk architecture to an end without a term of decadence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The Mamluk utilized chiaroscuro and dappled light effects in their buildings.
Mamluk history is divided into two periods based on different dynastic lines: the [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri Mamluks]] (1250â1382) of Qipchaq Turkic origin from southern Russia, named after the location of their barracks on the Nile and the [[Burji dynasty|Burji Mamluks]] (1382â1517) of Caucasian Circassian origin, who were quartered in the citadel.
The Bahri reign defined the art and architecture of the entire Mamluk period. Mamluk decorative artsâespecially enameled and gilded glass, inlaid metalwork, woodwork, and textilesâwere prized around the Mediterranean as well as in Europe, where they had a profound impact on local production. The influence of Mamluk glassware on the Venetian glass industry is only one such example.

The reign of Baybars's ally and successor, Qalaâun (r. 1280â90), initiated the patronage of public and pious foundations that included madrasas, mausolea, minarets, and hospitals. Such endowed complexes not only ensured the survival of the patron's wealth but also perpetuated his name, both of which were endangered by legal problems relating to inheritance and confiscation of family fortunes. Besides Qalaâun's complex, other important commissions by Bahri Mamluk sultans include those of [[al-Nasir Muhammad]] (1295â1304) as well as the immense and splendid complex of Hasan (begun 1356).

The Burji Mamluk sultans followed the artistic traditions established by their Bahri predecessors. Mamluk textiles and carpets were prized in international trade. In architecture, endowed public and pious foundations continued to be favored. Major commissions in the early Burji period in Egypt included the complexes built by Barquq (r. 1382â99), Faraj (r. 1399â1412), Muâayyad Shaykh (r. 1412â21), and [[Barsbay]] (r. 1422â38).

In the eastern Mediterranean provinces, the lucrative trade in textiles between Iran and Europe helped revive the economy. Also significant was the commercial activity of pilgrims en route to Mecca and Medina. Large warehouses, such as the Khan al-Qadi (1441), were erected to satisfy the surge in trade. Other public foundations in the region included the mosques of Aqbugha al-Utrush (Aleppo, 1399â1410) and Sabun (Damascus, 1464) as well as the Madrasa Jaqmaqiyya (Damascus, 1421).

In the second half of the 15th century, the arts thrived under the patronage of Qaâitbay (r. 1468â96), the greatest of the later Mamluk sultans. During his reign, the shrines of Mecca and Medina were extensively restored. Major cities were endowed with commercial buildings, religious foundations, and bridges. In Cairo, the complex of Qaâitbay in the Northern Cemetery (1472â74) is the best known and admired structure of this period.
Building continued under the last Mamluk sultan, Qansuh al-Ghawri (r. 1501â17), who commissioned his own complex (1503â5); however, construction methods reflected the finances of the state. Though the Mamluk realm was soon incorporated into the Ottoman empire (1517), Mamluk [[visual culture]] continued to inspire Ottoman and other Islamic artistic traditions.

===Persian architecture===
{{Main|Persian architecture}}

[[Image:Sheikh Lotfallah Esfahan.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque|Lotfallah Mosque]], in [[Isfahan]], Iran. When finished in 1618, this mosque became the private mosque of the Safavid royalty.]]
[[Image:Lotfollahmosque.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Interior view of the [[Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque|Lotfallah Mosque]].]]
The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century led early Islamic architects to borrow and adopt some traditions and ways of the fallen [[Persian empire]]. Islamic architecture thus borrows heavily from Persian architecture and in many ways can be called an extension and further evolution of Persian architecture.

In Iran and the north of India, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]], and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated.

Under the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]]s the âIranian planâ of mosque construction appears for the first time. Lodging places called ''khans'', or [[caravanserai]], for travellers and their animals, or caravansarais, generally displayed utilitarian rather than ornamental architecture, with rubble masonry, strong fortifications, and minimal comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;  Seljuq architecture  synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult.  Another important architectural trend to arise in the Seljuk era is the development of mausolea including the tomb tower such as the [[Gunbad-i-qabus]] (circa 1006-7) (showcasing a Zoroastrian motif) and the domed square, an example of which is the [[tomb of the Samanids]] in the city of [[Bukhara]] (circa 943).&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khanate period]] provided several innovations to dome-building that eventually enabled the Persians to construct much taller structures. These changes later paved the way for Safavid architecture. The pinnacle of Il-Khanate architecture was reached with the construction of the [[Soltaniyeh|Soltaniyeh Dome]] (1302â1312) in [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]], Iran, which measures 50 m in height and 25 m in diameter, making it [[List of largest domes in the world#Masonry|the 3rd largest]] and the tallest masonry dome ever erected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranreview.org/content/view/2280/51/&lt;/ref&gt; The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/domes&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb of [[ÃljeitÃ¼]] in [[Soltaniyeh]] is one of the greatest and most impressive monuments in Iran, despite many later depredations.

Iranian architecture and city planning also reached an apogee under the [[Timurid]]s, in particular with the monuments of [[Samarkand]], marked by extensive use of exterior ceramic tiles and [[muqarnas]] vaulting within.

[[File:Masjedk.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Nasir al-Mulk Mosque|The Nasir al-Mulk Mosque]] in [[Shiraz]], is a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar style]] mosque.]]

The renaissance in Persian mosque and dome building came during the [[Safavid dynasty]], when [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]], in 1598 initiated the reconstruction of [[Isfahan]], with the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] as the centerpiece of his new capital.&lt;ref&gt;Savory, Roger; Iran under the Safavids, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The distinct feature of Persian domes, which separates them from those domes created in the Christian world or the Ottoman and Mughal empires, was the colorful tiles, with which they covered the ''exterior'' of their domes, as they would on the interior. These domes soon numbered dozens in Isfahan, and the distinct, blue- colored shape would dominate the skyline of the city. Reflecting the light of  the sun, these domes appeared like glittering [[turquoise|turquoise gem]] and could be seen from miles away by travelers following the [[Silk road]] through Persia. This very distinct style of architecture was inherited to them from the [[Seljuq dynasty]], who for centuries had used it in their mosque building, but it was perfected during the Safavids when they invented the ''haft- rangi'', or seven- colour style of tile burning, a process that enabled them to apply more colours to each tile, creating richer patterns, sweeter to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, Stephen P.; Half the World, The Social Architecture of Safavid Isfahan, 1590- 1722, p. 143- 144&lt;/ref&gt; The colours that the Persians favoured where golden, white and turquoise patterns on a dark- blue background.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Sheila R.; Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive inscription bands of calligraphy and arabesque on most of the major buildings where carefully planned and executed by [[Reza Abbasi|Ali Reza Abbasi]], who was appointed head of the royal library and Master calligrapher at the Shah's court in 1598,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Sheila R.; Shah Abbas, The Remaking of Iran, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Shaykh Bahai]] oversaw the construction projects. Reaching 53 meters in height, the dome of Masjed-e Shah (Shah Mosque) would become the tallest in the city when it was finished in 1629. It was built as a double- shelled dome, with 14 m spanning between the two layers, and resting on an octagonal dome chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Hattstein M., Delius P.; Islam, Art and Architecture; p. 513- 514&lt;/ref&gt;

Persian-style mosques are also characterized by their tapered brick pillars, large [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and arches each supported by several pillars. In South Asia, elements of Hindu architecture were employed, but were later superseded by Persian designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-I&quot;&gt;&quot;Islam&quot;, ''The New Encyclopedia Britannica'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===Azerbaijani architecture===
[[Image:Bibi Heybat Mosque Baku 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
The [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century also helped Islamic architecture to flourish in [[Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isesco.org.ma/english/publications/Islamtoday/14/P6.php Journal Islam Today NÂ° 14-1417H/1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zerbaijan.com/azeri/azerbaijan4.htm Virtual Azerbaijan: Azerbaijan's History]&lt;/ref&gt; The country became home of
Nakchivan and Shirvan-Absheron architecture schools. An example of the first direction in the Azerbaijani Islamic architecture is the mausoleum of Yusuf, built in 1162.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ÐÑÑÐ¸ÑÐµÐºÑÑÑÐ° Ð¸ÑÐ»Ð°Ð¼ÑÐºÐ¸Ñ Ð¼ÐµÑÐµÑÐµÐ¹|url=http://anysite.ru/publication/islam|publisher=anysite.ru|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shirvan-Absheron school unlike Nakchivan style used stones instead of the bricks in the construction. At the same characteristics of this trend were the asymmetry and stone carving, which includes famous landmarks like [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]].

===Turkistan (Timurid) architecture===
[[File:Registan DP.jpg|thumb|[[Registan]] is the ensemble of three madrasahs, in [[Samarkand]], modern day [[Uzbekistan]].]]

Timurid architecture is the pinnacle of [[Islamic art]] in [[Central Asia]]. Spectacular and stately edifices erected by [[Timur]] and [[Timurid Dynasty|his successors]] in [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] helped to disseminate the influence of the [[Ilkhanid]] [[Art school|school of art]] in [[India]], thus giving rise to the celebrated [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] school of architecture. Timurid architecture started with the [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasavi|sanctuary of Ahmed Yasawi]] in present-day [[Kazakhstan]] and culminated in Timur's mausoleum [[Gur-e Amir]] in [[Samarkand]]. The style is largely derived from [[Persian architecture]]. [[Axial symmetry]] is a characteristic of all major Timurid structures, notably the [[Shah-e Zendah]] in [[Samarkand]] and the mosque of [[Gowhar Shad]] in [[Mashhad]]. Double [[dome]]s of various shapes abound, and the outsides are perfused with brilliant colors.They can be more good than bad.

===Ottoman architecture===
{{Main|Ottoman architecture }}
[[Image:Sultanahmet Camii 2006.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] in Istanbul]]

The standard plan of Ottoman architecture was inspired in part by the example of [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]], [[Ilkhanid]] works like [[Oljeitu]] Tomb and earlier [[Seljuks of Rum|Seljuk]] and Anatolian Beylik monumental buildings and their own original innovations. The most famous of Ottoman architects was (and remains) [[Mimar Sinan]], who lived for approximately one hundred years and designed several hundreds of buildings, of which two of the most important are [[SÃ¼leymaniye Mosque]] in Istanbul and [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]] in [[Edirne]]. Apprentices of Sinan later built the famous [[Blue Mosque]] in Istanbul and the Taj Mahal in [[India]].

The most numerous and largest of mosques exist in [Turkey], which obtained influence from Byzantine, [[Iranian architecture|Persian]] and [[Syria]]n-[[Arab]] designs. Turkish architects implemented their own style of [[cupola]] domes.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-I&quot;/&gt; For almost 500 years [[Byzantine architecture]] such as the church of Hagia Sophia served as models for many of the Ottoman mosques such as the Shehzade Mosque, the Suleiman Mosque, and the RÃ¼stem Pasha Mosque.
[[Image:Edirne 7333 Nevit.JPG|thumb|[[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]], built by Sinan in 1575. [[Edirne]], Turkey.]]
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s mastered the technique of building vast inner spaces confined by seemingly weightless yet massive domes, and achieving perfect harmony between inner and outer spaces, as well as light and shadow. Islamic religious architecture which until then consisted of simple buildings with extensive decorations, was transformed by the Ottomans through a dynamic architectural vocabulary of [[Vault (agrchitecture)|vaults]], domes, semidomes and columns. The mosque was transformed from being a cramped and dark chamber with arabesque-covered walls into a sanctuary of esthetic and technical balance, refined elegance and a hint of heavenly transcendence.

Another distinctive sub-style is the architecture of the [[Mughal Empire]] in [[South Asia]] in the 16th century and a fusion of [[Arabic]],  [[Central Asian]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]]  elements with the local [[Hindu architecture]].  The most famous examples of Mughal architecture are the series of imperial mausolea, which started with the pivotal [[Tomb of Humayun]], but is best known for the [[Taj Mahal]], completed in 1648 by emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]] who died while giving birth to their 14th child. The extensive use of precious and semiprecious stones as inlay and the vast quantity of white marble required nearly bankrupted the empire.{{Dubious|date=February 2011}} The Taj Mahal is completely symmetrical except for Shah Jahan's [[sarcophagus]], which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in red [[sandstone]] to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure. A famous example of the [[charbagh]] style of Mughal garden is the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] in [[Lahore]], where the domeless [[Tomb of Jahangir]] is also located.  The [[Red Fort]] in [[Dehli]] and [[Agra Fort]] are huge castle-like fortified palaces, and  the abandoned city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], 26 miles west of [[Agra]], was built for [[Akbar]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Fatehpur+Sikri+akbar&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=M13aTojEKMLKhAf-84nVDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Fatehpur%20Sikri%20akbar&amp;f=false John F.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TongxinAHG.jpg|right|The Great Mosque of Tongxin, Ningxia|thumb]]  --&gt;

The first [[China|Chinese]] mosque was established in the 7th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] in [[Xi'an]]. The [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]], whose current buildings date from the [[Ming Dynasty]], does not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, it follows traditional [[Chinese architecture]]. Some Chinese mosques in parts of western China were more likely to incorporate minarets and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like [[pagoda]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198504/muslims.in.china-the.mosques.htm|accessdate=2006-04-08|last=Cowen|first=Jill S.|date=July/August 1985|pages=30â35|publisher=Saudi Aramco World|title=Muslims in China: The Mosque}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on [[symmetry]], which connotes a sense of grandeur; this applies to everything from [[palace]]s to [[mosque]]s. One notable exception is in the design of [[garden]]s, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself.

Chinese buildings may be built with either red or grey bricks, but [[wood]]en structures are the most common; these are more capable of withstanding [[earthquake]]s, but are vulnerable to [[fire]]. The roof of a typical Chinese building is curved; there are strict classifications of gable types, comparable with the [[classical order]]s of European columns.

Most mosques have certain aspects in common with each other however as with other regions Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However in western China the mosques resemble those of the [[Arab World]], with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs. In northwest China where the Chinese [[Hui people|Hui]] have built their mosques, there is a combination of eastern and western styles. The mosques have flared Buddhist style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and [[minarets]].&lt;ref&gt;Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1985 , page 3035&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominantly-Muslim regions of South East Asia have been slow to adopt Middle Eastern architectural styles for Islamic sites.  For centuries, most Javanese mosques lacked a dome.  Instead, they had a multi-tiered roof (of Javanese or even Chinese influence) comparable with the multi-level pagodas of neighbouring [[Bali]].  The architecture of Javanese mosques had a clear influence on the design of other mosques in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], and the [[Philippines]].  The minaret of the [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], in Central Java, demonstrated further pre-Islamic influence on local Islamic architecture.

===Sahelian-Islamic architecture===
[[Image:Great Mosque of DjennÃ© 1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Mosque of DjennÃ©]] in [[Mali]] is a great example of [[Sudano-Sahelian]] architectural style.]]
{{Main|Sudano-Sahelian}}

In [[West Africa]], Islamic merchants played a vital role in the Western [[Sahel]] region since the [[Kingdom of Ghana]].  At [[Kumbi Saleh]], locals lived in domed-shaped dwellings in the king's section of the city, surrounded by a great enclosure. Traders lived in stone houses in a section which possessed 12 beautiful mosques (as described by [[Abu Abdullah al-Bakri|al-bakri]]), one centered on [[Friday prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;Historical Society of Ghana. Transactions of the Historical Society of Ghana, The Society, 1957, pp81&lt;/ref&gt; The king is said to have owned several mansions, one of which was sixty-six feet long, forty-two feet wide, contained seven rooms, was two stories high, and had a staircase; with the walls and chambers filled with sculpture and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Basil. The Lost Cities of Africa. Boston: Little Brown, 1959, pp86&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudano-Sahelian|Sahelian architecture]] initially grew from the two cities of [[DjennÃ©]] and [[Timbuktu]].  The [[Sankore]] Mosque in [[Timbuktu]], constructed from mud on timber, was similar in style to the [[Great Mosque of DjennÃ©]].

===Somali-Islamic architecture===
{{Main|Somali architecture}}
[[File:Ancient-Almnara.jpg|thumb|left|160px|''Almnara Tower'' [[Somalia]].]]
The peaceful introduction of [[Islam]] in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought Islamic architectural influences from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]], which stimulated a shift from [[drystone]] and other related materials in construction to [[Masonry|coral stone]], [[mud-brick|sundried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as [[mosques]] were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Culture and customs of Somalia - Mohammed Abdullahi Diriye pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; Concordant with the ancient presence of Islam in the [[Horn of Africa]] region, mosques in Somalia are some of the oldest on the entire continent. One architectural feature that made Somali mosques distinct from other mosques in Africa were [[minarets]].

For centuries, Arba Rukun (1269), the Friday mosque of [[Merca]] (1609) and [[Fakr ad-Din]] (1269) were, in fact, the only mosques in [[East Africa]] to have minarets.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Islamic history and civilization By David Ayalon pg 370&lt;/ref&gt; Fakr ad-Din, which dates back to the [[Mogadishu|Mogadishan]] [[Golden Age]], was built with [[marble]] and [[coral]] [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and included a compact rectangular plan with a domed [[mihrab]] axis. Glazed tiles were also used in the decoration of the mihrab, one of which bears a dated inscription. The 13th century ''Al Gami University'' consisted of a rectangular base with a large cylindrical tower architecturally unique in the [[Islamic world]].

[[Shrines]] to honor [[Somali people|Somali]] [[patriarchs]] and [[matriarchs]] evolved from ancient Somali burial customs. In Southern Somalia the preferred medieval shrine architecture was the [[Pillar tomb]] style while the North predominantly built structures consisting of [[domes]] and square plans.


===Interpretation===
[[File:Sebilj, Sarajevo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Sebilj]] is a [[Ottoman Empire|pseudo-Ottoman]] style wooden [[fountain]] in the centre of [[BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija]] square in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]].]]
Common interpretations of Islamic architecture include the following: The concept of God or [[Allah]]'s infinite power is evoked by designs with repeating themes which suggest infinity. Human and animal forms are rarely depicted in [[decorative art]] as God's work is considered to be matchless. Foliage is a frequent motif but typically stylized or simplified for the same reason.
[[Arabic Calligraphy]] is used to enhance the interior of a building by providing quotations from the [[Qur'an]]. Islamic architecture has been called the &quot;architecture of the veil&quot; because the beauty lies in the inner spaces (courtyards and rooms) which are not visible from the outside (street view). Furthermore, the use of grandiose forms such as large domes, towering minarets, and large courtyards are intended to convey power.

==Architecture Forms and Styles of mosques and buildings in Muslim countries==
{{Main|mosque}}

===Forms===
[[Image:Cordoba moschee innen5 dome.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the [[Mezquita]] in [[CÃ³rdoba, Spain]].]]
[[Image:Morocco Africa Flickr Rosino December 2005 82664690.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]. 210m high. A floor with room for 25,000 worshippers.]]
Many forms of Islamic architecture have evolved in different regions of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]]. Notable Islamic architectural types include the early [[Abbasid]] buildings, T-Type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]]. The [[Petroleum|oil]]-wealth of the 20th century drove a great deal of mosque construction using designs from leading modern architects.

''Arab-plan'' or ''hypostyle'' mosques are the earliest type of mosques, pioneered under the [[Umayyad Dynasty]]. These mosques are  square or rectangular in plan with an enclosed courtyard and a covered prayer hall. Historically, because of the warm Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates, the courtyard served to accommodate the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Most early hypostyle mosques have flat roofs on top of prayer halls, necessitating the use of numerous [[column]]s and [[Support (structure)|support]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masdjid1&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]], E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Masdjid. I. In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | issn = 1573-3912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable hypostyle mosques is the [[Mezquita]] in [[CÃ³rdoba, Spain|CÃ³rdoba]], [[Spain]], as the building is supported by over 850 columns.&lt;ref name=&quot;mit-handout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, hypostyle mosques have outer [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s so that visitors can enjoy some shade. Arab-plan mosques were constructed mostly under the Umayyad and [[Abbasid]] dynasties; subsequently, however, the simplicity of the Arab plan limited the opportunities for further development, and as a result, these mosques gradually fell out of popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masdjid1&quot;/&gt;

[[Ottoman Dynasty|The Ottomans]] introduced ''central dome mosques'' in the 15th century and have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. In addition to having one large dome at the center, there are often smaller domes that exist off-center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque, where prayer is not performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;mit-vocab&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051124083425/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2005-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style was heavily influenced by the [[Byzantine]] religious architecture with its use of large central domes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Masdjid1&quot;/&gt;

===Iwan===
[[Image:TajEntryArch.jpg|thumb|left|the iwan entrance to the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]]]]

===Sehan===
[[Image:Kairouan Mosque Stitched Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]], with a large '''[[courtyard]]â''sehan'' ''' surrounded by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, located in [[Kairouan]], Tunisia.]]
The traditional Islamic '''[[courtyard]]''', a '' '''sehan''' '' in [[Arabic]] (ar: ØµØ­Ù), is found in secular and religious structures.
#When within a residence or other secular building is a private courtyard and walled garden. It is used for: the aesthetics of plants, water, architectural elements, and natural light; for cooler space with fountains and shade, and source of breezes into the structure, during summer heat;  and a protected and proscribed place where the women of the house need not be covered in the [[hijab]] clothing traditionally necessary in public.
#A ''sehan''âcourtyard is in within almost every mosque in Islamic architecture. The courtyards are open to the sky and surrounded on all sides by structures with halls and rooms, and often a shaded semi-open arcade. Sehans usually feature a centrally positioned ritual cleansing pool under an open domed pavilion called a ''' ''[[howz]]'' '''. A mosque courtyard is used for performing ablutions, and a 'patio' for rest or gathering.

===Gardens===
{{Main|Islamic Gardens}}
{{Main|Persian Gardens}}
The [[Qur'an]] uses the garden as an analogy for paradise and Islam came to have a significant influence on [[garden design]]. The concept of [[paradise garden]] was commonly used the [[Persian gardens]], as well as ''[[Charbagh]] garden'' of [[Mughal architecture]].

[[File:Hafez 880714 095.jpg|thumb|right|The [[tomb of Hafez]] is a primary example of a Persian garden, with the typical, enclosed space, whater channels and large trees that provide cooling shades.]]

===Arabesque===
{{Main|Arabesque}}
[[File:Roof hafez tomb.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Complex [[Mosaic]] patterns also known as [[Girih]] are popular forms of architectural art in many [[Muslim]] cultures.]] 

An element of [[Islamic art]] usually found decorating the walls and window screens of mosques and Muslim homes and buildings, the [[arabesque]] is an elaborate application of repeating [[geometry|geometric]] forms that often echo the forms of plants, shapes and sometimes animals (specifically [[birds]]). The choice of which geometric forms are to be used and how they are to be formatted is based upon the Islamic view of the world. To Muslims, these forms, taken together, constitute an infinite pattern that extends beyond the visible material world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=tA9Uuy2cSIcC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=%22the+arabesque+is%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=_2t2TI_dO4X54gbv5cjbBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20arabesque%20is%22&amp;f=false Sheila R. Canby, ''Islamic art in detail'', page 26. Harvard University Press, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; To many in the Islamic world, they in fact symbolize the infinite, and therefore uncentralized, nature of the creation of the [[tawhid|one God]] (&quot;Allah&quot; in Arabic). Furthermore, the Islamic Arabesque artist conveys a definite spirituality without the [[icon]]ography of [[Christian art]]. Arabesque is used in mosques and building around the Muslim world, and it is a way of decorating using beautiful, embellishing and repetitive Islamic art instead of using pictures of humans and animals (which is forbidden ''[[Haram]]'' in [[Islam]]).

===Calligraphy===
{{Main|Islamic calligraphy}}
Arabic [[calligraphy]] is associated with geometric Islamic art (the Arabesque) on the walls and ceilings of mosques as well as on the page. Contemporary artists in the Islamic world draw on the heritage of calligraphy to use calligraphic inscriptions or abstractions in their work.

Instead of recalling something related to the reality of the [[spoken word]], calligraphy for the Muslim is a visible expression of spiritual concepts. Calligraphy has arguably become the most venerated form of Islamic art because it provides a link between the languages of the Muslims with the religion of Islam. The [[holy book]] of Islam, al-[[Qur'Än]], has played a vital role in the development of the Arabic language, and by extension, calligraphy in the [[Arabic alphabet]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an are still active sources for Islamic calligraphy.

==Elements of Islamic style==

Islamic architecture may be identified with the following design elements, which were inherited from the first mosque built byr hall (originally a feature of the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]]).

[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan minaret north.jpg|thumb|Minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] regarded as the oldest surviving minaret in the world, situated in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]

* [[Minaret]]s or towers (these were originally used as torch-lit watchtowers, as seen in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]; hence the derivation of the word from the Arabic ''nur'', meaning &quot;light&quot;). The minaret of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] is considered as the oldest surviving minaret in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;minaret&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=kairouan+oldest+minaret&amp;lr=&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=kairouan%20oldest%20minaret&amp;f=false Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam, Language and Meaning: Commemorative Edition''. World Wisdom. 2009. p.128]&lt;/ref&gt; It has the shape of a square massive tower of three superimposed sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;minaret&quot;/&gt;

* A four-[[iwan]] plan, with three subordinate halls and one principal one that faces toward Mecca

* [[Mihrab]] or [[niche (architecture)|prayer niche]] on an inside wall indicating the direction to [[Mecca]]. This may have been derived from previous uses of niches for the setting of the [[Torah]] scrolls in [[Jewish]] synagogues (see [[Torah ark]]) or the [[haikal]] of [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic]] churches.

* [[Dome]]s and [[Cupola]]s.

* Pishtaq is the formal gateway to the [[iwan]], usually the main prayer hall of a mosque, a vaulted hall or space, walled on three sides, with one end entirely open; a [[Persian language|Persian]] term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually  decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[https://archnet.org/library/dictionary/entry.jsp?entry_id=DIA0502 Dictionary of Islamic architecture: Pishtaq]  archnet.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pishtaq&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461774/pishtaq Pishtaq] ''[[Britannica.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Iwans to intermediate between different pavilions.

* The use of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] and foliage based [[arabesque]]s.

* The use of [[mocÃ¡rabe]] and [[muqarnas]], a unique Arabic/Islamic space-enclosing system, for the decoration of domes, minarets and portals, as used at the [[Alhambra]].

* The use of decorative [[Islamic calligraphy]] instead of [[pictures]] which were [[haram]] (forbidden) in mosque architecture.  Note that in secular architecture, human and animal representation was indeed present.

* Central [[fountain]]s used for [[Ritual purification|ablutions]] (once used as a [[wudu]] area for Muslims).

* The use of bright color, if the style is Persian or Indian (Mughal); paler sandstone and grey stones are preferred among Arab buildings. Compare the Registan complex of Uzbekistan to the Al-Azhar University of Cairo.

* Focus both on the interior space of a building and the exterior{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
