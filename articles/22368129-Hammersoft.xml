[[Image:Csulb-tower2.jpg|thumb|right|The &quot;Go Beach!&quot; water tower.]]
An [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] member, Long Beach State has 18 sports teams and plays competitively in [[baseball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[softball]], [[track and field]], women's [[tennis]], and women's [[soccer]], as well as both men's and women's [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[water polo]] and [[golf]] teams.  The university is a founding member of the [[Big West Conference]], and also competes in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] for sports not sponsored by the Big West.

In the realm of sports the school is referred to as &quot;Long Beach State.&quot; The official name of Long Beach State sports teams is &quot;The 49ers&quot; in honor of the year the university was founded and for the prospectors of the [[California Gold Rush]] one hundred years before then. Unofficially, &quot;The Beach&quot; is used to refer to Long Beach State and its sports teams as it is the only university on the West Coast with the word &quot;Beach&quot; in its name. One can see the cheer &quot;Go Beach!&quot; written on many CSULB products around campus and on the large [[water tower]] near the entrance to the campus.

The school colors have been black and gold since 2000, when they were changed by a student referendum (after [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] changed the football uniform colors) from the original brown and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditions|url=http://www.longbeachstate.com/trads/traditions.html|work=Long Beach State website|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Rivals==
The Beach has several rival schools when it comes to sports. In addition to being located in close proximity to each other, Long Beach State and [[California State University, Fullerton|Cal State Fullerton]] have competed heavily as conference rivals in baseball more than 20 years. More recently, specifically since 2006, Long Beach State and [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]] have participated in the annual &quot;Black and Blue Rivalry Series.&quot; In this challenge, each school earns points for its collective conference championships and head-to-head victories against each other (across all NCAA sports in which both schools participate). The totals are added up at the end of the season and a winner is declared. Both schools are currently tied 2-2. Finally, Long Beach State also has a long-standing &quot;beach school&quot; rivalry with [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]].

==Baseball==

Unlike all other Long Beach State sports teams, the baseball team unofficially goes under the moniker &quot;[[The Dirtbags]].&quot; After the hiring of Dave Snow as head coach in 1989, the LBSU baseball team has become one of the most successful teams in the school's athletic history. The Dirtbags are consistently ranked in the national top 30 and have appeared in 17 of the last 20 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] tournaments. Along the way, the team has won 9 Big West conference championships, hosted 4 NCAA regionals (plus 1 super regional), and appeared in 4 College World Series.&lt;ref name=&quot;championships&quot;&gt;Mike Weathers became 'Dirtbag' head coach in 2001.

Long Beach State is home to one of the top women's [[volleyball]] teams in the nation.

Long Beach State has won three national titles in women's volleyball, in 1989, 1993 and 1998. The 1998 women's team was the first team in NCAA Division I history to have an undefeated season. The team's most famous alumnus is [[Misty May-Treanor|Misty May]], who won two Olympic gold medals in Beach Volleyball in [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]].

The team has appeared in the conference title match every year since 2001.  The 2010 team went undefeated in league play to win the Big West Conference regular season championship.  The 2011 team captured another regular season title and then the program's eighth tournament championship by reaching a record eleventh consecutive conference final and then defeating rival UC Irvine for a sixth time in the championship match.  

'Beach Tennis' has qualified for eight NCAA Championships and advanced to the 'Round of 32' in 2006.  The 49ers have been a # 2 seed once, a # 3 seed five times and a # 4 seed twice in NCAA tournament play.

Three 'Beach Tennis' players have earned Big West Conference Player of the Year honors, including Hannah Grady who became the first student-athlete in any Big West Conference sport to be named Player of the Year four consecutive years (06, 07, 08, 09).  In February 2010, court #1 at the Rhodes Tennis Center was named Hannah Grady Court in lieu of retiring her number, as tennis players do not wear numbers.

The women's tennis team plays at the Terry L. Rhodes Tennis Center, which opened on campus Fall 2008. The tennis center is named after 49er alumnus Terry Rhodes following his $1.25 million gift to the women's tennis program. Mr. Rhodes' gift is the largest single sport donation in university history. The new facility also includes The Gloria and Bob Hendricks Family Scoreboard, a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} high electronic display of all matches donated by the family of the former 49er women's tennis head coach.  The facility is located on the northeast side of campus immediately next to the $70 million Student Recreation and Wellness Center that opened in Fall 2010.
