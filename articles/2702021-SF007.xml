'''AutoPatcher''' is an alternative to [[Microsoft Update]] that can be used for installing [[Patch (computing)|software patch]]es, [[service pack]]s and other updates for certain [[Microsoft Windows]] systems. It allows these to be [[download]]ed on a different machine or in advance, and then installed [[offline]]. By doing this, system updates can be [[automation|automated]] and [[scripting|scripted]], time and bandwidth required to download relevant updates is reduced, and exposure of [[computer security|unsecured systems]] online can be avoided. AutoPatcher also allows installation of some common additional software, [[Windows registry|registry]] settings, and patches for other Microsoft software, notably [[Microsoft Office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;What's_AutoPatcher&quot;&gt;{{cite web

AutoPatcher currently exists for [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], [[Windows 7|7]] and some server equivalents ([[Windows 2003]] and [[Windows 2008|2008]]). For some years it did not provide support for [[Windows 7]] or older systems, nor for some [[64 bit]] operating systems; updates are now possible for some of these in the 2011 version of Autopatcher. Originally software patches were distributed with AutoPatcher but following legal complaints the software was modified in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_no_longer_allowed&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Project History==
===Version 1.0 ===
The original '''AutoPatcher''' program was a simple batch script created by Jason Kelley and released on the Neowin forums on October 15, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Requesting hosting for a file?
  | url = http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=108204 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This original release contained 22 updates and could only be used on Windows XP SP1. Upon its release people asked for more updates, features, and a modern GUI. Jason was contacted by Antonis Kaladis and the two of them rewrote the AutoPatcher program and began maintaining and distributing the program.

===Versions 4.0 - 4.2 ===
Versions 4.0 - 4.2 were a great stepping stone from the old batch processes and the next stage of the program.  These releases saw the use of the .AXP file format&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = AutoPatcher Blog (Archived)
  | url = http://www.flishfun.com/blog_archive/?p=128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for custom programs as well as more stability.  There was only one release created for this series, the '''Full''' release that contained all critical, recommended and component updates, commonly used applications such as [[Sun Microsystems]]'s [[Java Platform]], and registry tweaks.

===Version 4.5 ===
Version 4.5, introduced in March 2004, saw some major changes from the previous v4 releases. This release was the first time there were multiple release packs;  '''Full''', '''Lite''', and '''Ultralite''' releases all contained critical updates.  The '''Lite''' release contained all recommended updates and a few extra applications that the UltraLite release did not have. The '''Full''' release contained critical, recommended and component updates, commonly used applications such as [[Java Platform|Java]], and registry tweaks. Version 4.5 also saw the integration of an XML database, and the current icon, designed by [http://www.iconaholic.com/ Foood].&lt;ref&gt;Racing the Clock {{cite web
  | title = AutoPatcher Blog (Archived)
  | url = http://www.flishfun.com/blog/?p=156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 5.1===
There were three 'release types' used in the 5.1-era; '''Full''' and '''Lite''' releases both contained critical, recommended and component updates, commonly used applications such as [[Java Platform|Java]], and registry tweaks. The '''Lite''' release contained fewer extra applications than the Full release. '''Update''' releases were for updating previous months releases with the latest copies of files found in the latest '''Full''' &amp; '''Lite''' releases, these smaller downloads were designed to reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for distribution.

===Version 5.6===
Version 5.6 of the AutoPatcher engine included a new [[user interface]], and more &quot;intelligent&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligent in the sense that it can act on a wider variety of detected software/settings&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scripting language|scripting]] than the previous version, 5.1.

Changes from version 5.1 include:
* Support for [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]];
* New detections: [[Windows Media Player]], [[Windows Live Messenger]]/[[MSN Messenger]], [[DirectX]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and [[Windows Installer]];
* Microsoft Office components detection: [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], [[Microsoft Access|Access]], [[Microsoft Project|Project]], [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]], [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]], [[Microsoft FrontPage|FrontPage]], [[Microsoft InfoPath|InfoPath]], [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]], [[Microsoft SharePoint Designer|SharePoint Designer]] and [[Microsoft Groove|Groove]];
* Detect [[hotfixes]] that were [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstreamed]].

====Windows====

New releases using this version started with the May 2007 release with a change in release terminology.
*'''Full''' releases were replaced with '''Core''' releases. The '''Core''' releases still contain the critical updates, recommended updates, optional updates, and various tweaks present in the '''Full''' releases, but most of the large add-ons were moved to separate '''Add-On packs'''.
*'''Lite''' releases no longer exist, due to add-ons being moved to their own packs.
*'''Update''' releases remained the same, and are available every month to update the '''Core''' release.

AutoPatcher '''Core''' releases were [[wikt:cumulative|cumulative]]; previous versions are not required.
AutoPatcher '''Update''' releases were [[wikt:incremental|incremental]]; All of the previous '''Update''' releases since the latest '''Core''' release need to be installed first.
Thus, the order in which to install the releases is:

    '''Core''' + '''Addon'''(Optional) + '''Update''' [+ '''Update''' &lt;nowiki&gt;[+ ...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

====Office====
The first AutoPatcher Office packages were released on August 20, 2007, consisting of '''AutoPatcher Office 2002 Core''', '''AutoPatcher Office 2003 Core''', '''AutoPatcher Office 2007 Core''' and '''AutoPatcher OfficePack Addon'''.&lt;ref&gt;Release threads: [http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=582275 2002]
[http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=582276 2003]
[http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=582277 2007]
[http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=582278 Addon Pack]&lt;/ref&gt;

The AutoPatcher Office releases follow the same naming structure as the AutoPatcher Windows releases.

====Custom Modules====
It is possible to produce custom &quot;Stand Alone&quot; modules for use with AutoPatcher to install other third-party programs, tweaks etc. This can be useful, for example, inside businesses where [[bespoke software]] needs to be maintained.

The AutoPatcher team maintained a list of stand alone modules that have been authenticated, signed and packaged for use with AutoPatcher,  but that are not eligible for inclusion into the add-on packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Stand-Alone Modules for AutoPatcher
  | url = http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=570386
  | accessdate = 2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project Shutdown ===
The AutoPatcher team was forced to shut down the project after receiving e-mail from Microsoft requesting them to stop distribution on August 29, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sad_day&quot;/&gt; Microsoft cited the security risks of third party distribution of their patches as their reason behind the decision. Microsoft denied that the possibility of circumventing their [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] protection with the software was behind it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_no_longer_allowed&quot; /&gt; &quot;I asked the representative if Windows Genuine Advantage had anything to do with it&quot;, stated Neobond, the administrator of Neowin forum, &quot;and he categorically told me this was not the case, he added that Windows Update for pre-Vista versions of Windows can now be accessed using Firefox and that the concern at Microsoft had more to do with the possible malicious code that could be redistributed with certified Microsoft updates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_no_longer_allowed&quot; /&gt;

=== Comeback ===
Kaladis revealed in the AutoPatcher Blog that his biggest concern after the project was shut down by Microsoft was that &quot;people around the globe [would] start writing their own custom modules and start redistributing their own releases&quot;, adding that one of the security features in AutoPatcher &quot;would automatically flag these releases as unofficial&quot;, but that if end-users only had a choice of unofficial releases the spread of malicious software would be very easy.

As a result the '''AutoPatcher Updater''', or '''APUP''', tool was created to automatically download the required patches from Microsoft's web servers and store them in the same file structure used in previous AutoPatcher releases. Once the files have been downloaded &quot;everything remains as you know it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The_Next_Day&quot; /&gt;
