'''Phyllis Linda Hyman''' (July 6, 1949 &amp;ndash; June 30, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] [[Soul music|soul]] [[singing|singer]] and [[actress]].

==Early years==
Phyllis Hyman was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and grew up in the [[St. Clair Village]], the [[South Hills (Pennsylvania)|South Hills]] section of [[Pittsburgh]]. Born to an an African American/Native American mother and an Italian father,she was the eldest of seven children and a third cousin of [[Earle Hyman]]. After leaving Pittsburgh, her music training started at a music school. On graduation, she performed on a national tour with the group New Direction in 1971.  After the group disbanded, she joined All the People and worked with another local group, The Hondo Beat.  At this time, she appeared  in the film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'' (1974). She also did a two-year stint leading a band called Phyllis Hyman and the P/H Factor. Hyman was discovered in 1975 by internationally known pop artist and music industry veteran Sid Maurer, and former [[Epic Records]] promoter Fred Frank, and signed to their Roadshow Records/Desert Moon imprint.

Hyman moved to [[New York City]] to work on her reputation.  She did background vocals on [[Jon Lucien]]'s ''Premonition'' and worked in clubs. It was during one of these performances that she was spotted by [[Norman Connors]], who offered her a spot as a vocalist on his album, ''You Are My Starship'' (1976).  The duo scored on the R&amp;B charts with a remake of [[The Stylistics]]' &quot;[[Betcha by Golly Wow!]]&quot;.

==Career==
Hyman sang with [[Pharoah Sanders]] and the Fatback Band while working on her first solo album, ''Phyllis Hyman'', released in 1977 on the [[Buddah Records]] label. When [[Arista Records]] bought Buddha, she was transferred to that label. Her first album for Arista, ''Somewhere in My Lifetime'', was released in 1978; the title track was produced by then-labelmate [[Barry Manilow]]. Her follow-up album, ''You Know How to Love Me'', made the R&amp;B Top 20 and also performed well on the clubâdance charts. In the late 1970s, Hyman married her manager Larry Alexander (who is the brother of Jamaican pianist and melodica player [[Monty Alexander]]), but both the personal and professional associations ended in divorce. Around this time, Hyman began using cocaine, which led to a life-long dependency.

Hyman's first solo Top Ten hit came in 1981 with &quot;Can't We Fall In Love Again&quot;, a duet with [[Michael Henderson]]. The song was recorded while she was performing in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Sophisticated Ladies]]'', a tribute to [[Duke Ellington]]. She performed in the role for almost two years, receiving a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical and winning a [[Theatre World Award]] for Best Newcomer. 

Problems between Hyman and her label, Arista, caused a pause in her recording career. She used the time to appear on movie soundtracks, television commercials and guest vocals, working with [[Chuck Mangione]], [[The Whispers]] and [[The Four Tops]]. Hyman provided vocals for three tracks on [[jazz]] [[pianist]] [[McCoy Tyner]]'s ''[[Looking Out]]'' (1982). She toured often and did a college lecture tour.

In 1983, Hyman recorded the song &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; as the title song for the [[Never Say Never Again|James Bond movie of the same name]], written by Stephen Forsyth and Jim Ryan. However, Warner Brothers informed Forsyth that [[Michel Legrand]], who wrote the score for the film, had threatened to sue them, claiming he contractually had the rights to the title song. An alternate title song composed by Legrand was eventually used for the film and performed by singer [[Lani Hall]], formerly of [[SÃ©rgio Mendes]] and Brasil '66.

Free from Arista in 1985, she released the album, ''Living All Alone'' on Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff's Philadelphia International label the following year, capitalizing on the torch songs, &quot;Old Friend&quot; and the melancholy title track, as well as &quot;You Just Don't Know&quot; and &quot;Screaming at the Moon&quot;. Shortly afterwards, she appeared in the films ''[[School Daze]]'' and ''The Kill Reflex''.  She would also continue to lend her voice to albums for other artists and musicians like [[Grover Washington, Jr.]] and [[Lonnie Liston Smith]], while at the same time doing international tours. 

Her next album, again on Philadelphia International, called ''Prime of My Life'', released in 1991, was the biggest of her career. It included her first number one R&amp;B hit as well as her first Billboard Top 100 hit, &quot;[[Don't Wanna Change the World]]&quot;. The album provided two more top 10 R&amp;B singles in &quot;Living in Confusion&quot; and &quot;When You Get Right Down to It&quot;, and the less successful &quot;I Found Love&quot;.  Just over a year later, she appeared one last time on a [[Norman Connors]] album, singing the title song, &quot;Remember Who You Are&quot;, which became a minor R&amp;B hit. ''Prime of My Life'' has sold 454,000 copies to date. The album and debut single were both RIAA certified Gold in 1992.

Hyman's last album, ''I Refuse to Be Lonely'', was a journey into her personal life.  Both the title track and the single &quot;I'm Truly Yours&quot; became minor R&amp;B hits.

==Death==
On the afternoon of June 30, 1995, Hyman committed [[suicide]] by overdosing on [[pentobarbital]] and [[secobarbital]] in her New York City apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n14_v88/ai_17210261|title=Coroner says Phyllis Hyman used sleeping pills to commit suicide; new LP due out soon|date=1995-08-14|publisher=''Jet''|accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was found unconscious hours before she was scheduled to perform at the [[Apollo Theater]] and died 3 hours later at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.&lt;ref name=jet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n11_v88/ai_17361614|title=Fans and friends mourn the death of singer Phyllis Hyman|date=1995-07-24|publisher=''Jet''|accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her suicide note read in part: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I'm tired. I'm  tired. Those of you that I love know who you are. May God bless you.&quot;&lt;ref name=jet /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

She was 45 years old. A memorial service was held at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan. The following week would have been her 46th birthday.&lt;ref name=jet /&gt;

==Posthumous releases==
In November 1995, Hyman's posthumous album ''[[I Refuse to Be Lonely]],'' was released.  Although the project had an overdrawn gestation, to combat the delay in its commercial release, Hyman started performing the tracks, &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot; and &quot;I Refuse To Be Lonely&quot; in concert.  The delay in the album's release adversely affected Hyman both emotionally &amp; financially and the delay was said to be cited over &quot;cost negotiations&quot;.

Three years after her death, a second posthumous album of previously unreleased material was released.  Songs were culled from various recording sessions from the mid 1980s into the early 1990s. ''Forever With You'' (1998) contains [[love song]]s, [[torch song]]s, bittersweet ballads, smooth jazz offerings and uptempo tracks, most of which showcase Hyman's' usual interpretation of heartbreak and strife. Hyman was quoted as saying that these songs were about &quot;relationships gone bad!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwHjp5gruQE&amp;t=58s&lt;i&gt;Arsenio Hall Show]&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the material on this album was initially intended for her ''Living All Alone'' release.  The song &quot;Funny How Love Goes&quot; contains a posthumous &quot;duet&quot; featuring vocalist Damon Williams.  Half of Hyman's vocals were re-recorded with both singers alternating vocals and providing Williams with exposure.

In September 2007, an authorized biography was released.  The book entitled ''Strength of a Woman: the Phyllis Hyman Story'', is written by Jason A. Michael in cooperation with the Estate of Phyllis Hyman. The book mentions Hyman's relationships with both men and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;armstrong&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |date=November 7, 2007 |first=Jenice |last=Armstrong |title=Hyman's demons |url=http://www.philly.com/dailynews/features/20071107_Jenice_Armstrong___Hymans_demons.html |periodical=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-01-08 |format= &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AArmstrong+intitle%3AHyman%27s+demons&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080101220558/http://www.philly.com/dailynews/features/20071107_Jenice_Armstrong___Hymans_demons.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an original version of the James Bond theme &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, which wasn't used in
the film due to contractual issues, was released by the track's co-writer Stephen Forsythe.
Stephen Forsythe has been quoted as stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;During the filming of the James Bond movie ''Never Say Never Again'', I co-wrote the title song for the movie with Jim Ryan. Warner Brothers informed our attorney that the song was to be used as the title song in the picture. However, shortly before its release, Warner Bros informed us that the song could not be used because Michel Legrand, who wrote the score, threatened to sue them, claiming that contractually he had the right to the title song. So my song was never released.
 
The legendary Phyllis Hyman was my first choice to sing the song and working with her is one of the highlights of my musical career. I personally auditioned and sang the song to her while she was having breakfast in her managerâs office. After agreeing to sing the song, she arrived at the studio and, without any rehearsal and only having heard the song sung once at the breakfast audition, sang the song in one perfect take. Phyllis sadly took her own life in the early nineties. The year before she died, she called me late one night and told me she felt that &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; was her best and favorite recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-news/2008/05/06/lost-theme-tune-to-sean-connery-s-final-bond-film-revealed-after-25-years-86908-20407169/|title=Lost theme tune to Sean Connery's final Bond film revealed after 25 years|date=2008-05-06|publisher=dailyrecord.co.uk|accessdate=2008-07-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080510170839/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment-news/2008/05/06/lost-theme-tune-to-sean-connery-s-final-bond-film-revealed-after-25-years-86908-20407169/ |archivedate = May 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
