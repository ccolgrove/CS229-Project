== Symbol of communism ==
The five-pointed red star, a [[pentagram]] without the inner [[pentagon]], is a symbol of [[communism]]. It is sometimes understood to represent the five fingers of the [[Working class|worker's]] hand, as well as the [[Continent#Number_of_continents|five continents]]. A lesser known suggestion{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} is that the five points on the star were intended to represent the five [[Group (sociology)|social group]]s that would lead Russia to communism: the [[youth]], the military, the [[industrial labour]]ers, the [[Agriculture|agricultural]] workers or [[peasant]]ry, and the [[intelligentsia]]. It was one of the emblems, symbols, and signals representing the [[Soviet Union]] under the rule of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], along with the [[hammer and sickle]]. Across [[Europe]], the symbol is treated very differently in different countries: some have passed laws banning it, claiming that it represents &quot;a [[totalitarian]] ideology,&quot; while other countries hold a very positive view of it as a symbol of [[antifascism]] and [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] against [[Nazi]] occupation. In the Soviet heraldry the red star symbolized the [[Red Army]] and the military service as opposed to the hammer and sickle which symbolized the peaceful labour.

=== History ===
The star's origins in a mass political movement are found in the [[Russian civil war]] and the end of the First World War, though its creator is unknown. It is most often thought that Russian troops fleeing from the Austrian and German fronts found themselves in Moscow in 1917 and mixed with the local Moscow garrison. To distinguish the Moscow troops from the influx of retreating Russians the officers gave out tin stars to the Moscow garrison soldiers, to wear on their hats. When those troops joined the Red Army and the [[Bolshevik]]s they painted their tin stars red, the color of socialism, thus creating the original red star.&lt;ref&gt;Khvostov, Mikhail (1996), ''The Russian Civil War (1) The Red Army'' Published by Men-At-Arms ISBN 1-85532-608-6&lt;/ref&gt; Another claimed origin for the red star relates to an alleged encounter between [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Nikolai Krylenko]]. Krylenko, an [[Esperantist]], was wearing a [[Esperanto symbols|green star]] lapel badge; Trotsky enquired as to its meaning and received an explanation that each arm of the star represented one of the five traditional continents. On hearing this, he specified that a similar red star should be worn by soldiers of the Red Army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/ny2/ts/stelo.html Pri La Stelo: Militista simbolo]&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech given by Trotsky in 1923, he mentions the red star:
{{quote|For the seventh time since the overthrow of Tsardom, for the sixth time under the sickle and hammer of the Soviets and the Red star of battle&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1922/military/ch16.htm Speech At the Parade on Red Square, 1 May 1923]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
And the badge was used in the Red Army during the civil war:
{{quote|Immediately after the [[October revolution]] all ranks of the 3rd Petrograd regiment wore their old uniforms but with shoulder-board removed and with Tsarist cap insignia replaced by the red star&lt;ref&gt;The Russian Civil War (1):The Red Army By Mikhail Khvostov, Andrei Karachtchouk, Page 37 (there are several mentions to the use of the red star from 1918)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Joseph Stalin]] is also known for wearing a pendant resembling the red star, as he did at the [[Teheran Conference]].

=== Wider use ===
Following its adoption as an emblem of the Soviet Union, the red star became a symbol for communism in a larger sense. The symbol became one of the most prominent of the Soviet Union, adorning all official buildings, awards and insignia. Sometimes the [[hammer and sickle]] was depicted inside or below the star. In 1930, the [[Order of the Red Star]] was established and given to Red Army and Soviet Navy personnel for &quot;exceptional service in the cause of the defense of the Soviet Union in both war and peace&quot;.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The red star was adopted by several [[Communist state]]s and often placed on their respective flags and [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], for example on the [[flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. [[Separatism|Separatist]] and socialist movements also sometimes adopted the red star, such as the [[Estelada flag]] in the [[Catalan countries]].

In former Yugoslavia red star was not considered a communist symbol, as were hammer and sickle; but a symbol of resistance against fascist and nazi occupation and their ethnic policies instead. Red star was worn by [[Yugoslav_partisans|Tito's partisans]] as an identification symbol, regardless of their worldview including people with religious background. As the red star spread to communism in the East, it was adapted: while some states kept the star as it was, some used a yellow star, particularly on a red field, with the same symbolism. The [[Far Eastern Republic]] used a yellow star on its military uniforms, and the [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|flag]] of the People's Republic of China has five yellow stars on a red field. In Brazil, however, the red star remained as it was.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Russian military newspaper is also called the ''Red Star'' (Russian: ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]''). Several sporting clubs from countries ruled by Communist Parties used the red star as a symbol, and [[Red Star Belgrade|Crvena zvezda]] ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Ð¦ÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð° Ð·Ð²ÐµÐ·Ð´Ð°}}), [[Belgrade]], and [[Roter Stern Leipzig|Roter Stern]], [[Leipzig]], named themselves after it. Since the fall of the [[Warsaw Pact]], the red star has been banned in some countries.

In 1970, the ''Rote Armee Fraktion'' or [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) was officially founded. The RAF, which described itself as a communist &quot;[[urban guerilla]]&quot; group, was a postwar West Germany [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Terrorism|terrorist]] organisation. Its highly recognisable symbol was a red star and a [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]]. The RAF operated from the 1970s to 1998, committing numerous crimes, especially in the autumn of 1977, which led to a national crisis that became known as the &quot;[[German Autumn]]&quot;. It was responsible for 34 murdersâincluding secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguardsâand many injuries in its almost 30 years of existence.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The red star was included in the flag of the ''EjÃ©rcito Zapatista de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional'' (EZLN) or [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] upon their formation in 1994. The EZLN, an armed [[revolutionary]] group based in [[Chiapas]], Mexico, takes its name from the Mexican revolutionary [[Emiliano Zapata]] and is most often represented by [[Subcomandante Marcos]], though he is not their leader. The same flag, a [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black flag]] with a red star, was used by US rock band [[Rage Against the Machine]] â who were vocal supporters of the EZLN and other left causes â so much so that the symbol came to be associated with the band, separate from the EZLN. The red star is used by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)]]. It is also used by the militant South African [[shack]] dweller's movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]].

[[Hugo ChÃ¡vez]] and his supporters in Venezuela have used the Red Star in numerous symbols and logos, and have proposed including it in the logo of the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV). It was also used throughout 2007 as a symbol of the &quot;5 Engines of the [[Bolivarian Revolution|Bolivarian Socialist Revolution]]&quot;.

North Korea's [[Red Star OS]] takes its name and logo from the communist red star.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

By march 2010, Russian government has readopted the Soviet red star (but now with a blue outline representing the three colors of the Russian flag) as a military insigna. This star is used as [[Russian Air Force]] roundel and can also be applied on vehicles. The old Soviet Red Star is still in widespread use.

[[Armed Forces of Belarus]] still use the old Soviet red star. The coat of arms of 
[[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan]] is also a modified version of the Soviet red star.

== Legal status ==
The Red Star and the Hammer and Sickle are regarded as occupation symbols as well as symbols of [[totalitarianism]] and [[state terror]] by several countries formerly occupied by the [[Soviet Union]]. Accordingly, Latvia{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, Lithuania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/7459976.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols | date=17 June 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,577305,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Poland Imposes Strict Ban on Communist Symbols | date=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; have banned the symbol, while Hungary&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Criminal Code 269/B.Â§ (1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; has only the latter symbol banned.
A similar law was considered in Estonia, but eventually failed in a parliamentary committee as too onerous for constitutionally guaranteed freedoms, most importantly, [[freedom of speech]].

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has ruled, in a similar manner, against the laws that ban political symbols, which were deemed to be in clear opposition with basic human rights, such as freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=837602&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR judgment in case Vajnai v.

There have been calls for an EU-wide ban on both Soviet and Nazi symbols, notably by politicians from Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. The European Commissioner for Justice, [[Franco Frattini]], initially expressed support for the idea, but the proposal was eventually withdrawn because there was no consensus on which symbols to ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4234335.stm | work=BBC News | title=EU ban urged on communist symbols | date=3 February 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Slovenia Red Star is respected as a symbol of resistance against fascism and nazism. On March 21, 2011, Slovenia issued a [[â¬2_commemorative_coins#2011_coinage|two-euro commemorative]] coin to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of [[Franc_Rozman_Stane|Franc Rozman]], a partizan commander, featuring a large red star (which can not be red on the coin, for obvious reasons).
