'''Gonzaga University''' is a private Roman Catholic university located in [[Spokane, Washington]], United States. Founded in 1887 by the [[Society of Jesus]], it is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]] and is named after the young Jesuit saint, [[Aloysius Gonzaga]]. The campus houses 105 buildings across 131 acres (437,000&amp;nbsp;mÂ²) of [[grassland]] along the [[Spokane River]], in a residential setting half a mile (800 m) from downtown Spokane. The university was founded by [[Joseph Cataldo|Father Joseph Cataldo, SJ]], an Italian-born priest and missionary who wished to create a Catholic school in the [[Pacific Northwest]] for local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = History of Gonzaga University| publisher = Gonzaga University | url = http://www.gonzaga.edu/About/Mission/Mission-Statement/History.asp| accessdate = 2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chastek Law Library primarily serves Gonzaga University School of Law.

===Center for Global Engagement===
The center for Global engagement is a new program at Gonzaga. Since the university has an extensive international presence it provides many programs in which the students can get involved with the international community. Some aspects of the Center for Global Engagement are MA/TESL, The Peace Corps, and the study abroad programs.

'''English as a Second Language'''
In the ESL program, students are required to take a placement test that determines the difficulty of the class that they will be enrolled in. Classes are required to meet five days a week and they teach reading, writing, vocabulary, speaking and English development. The ESL Program at Gonzaga seeks to provide international students with the resources and opportunities to get a first rate education, as well as graduate from Gonzaga with a competency in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Gonzaga University English Language Center| publisher = Gonzaga University | url = http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Instruction/PermaLinks/ESL.pdf| accessdate = 2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Peace Corps (PCMI MA/TESL)'''
The Peace Corps program consists of the masters program for graduate students and the MA/TESL and Peace Corps MI. The program is four semesters long including summer, as well as twenty-seven months of Peace Corps service. Applicants must have a competency in a language other than English. Since this is a graduate program, applicants are required to have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution with an average cumulative GPA of 3.0. This is a joint program with the Peace Corps in which students get the opportunity to teach English as a Second Language, as well as studies in culture and language.  Students in the Peace Corps will also complete a degree within their time in the Peace Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Gonzaga University MA/TESL &amp; Peace Corps MI| publisher = Gonzaga University | url = http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Libraries/Foley-Library/Departments/Instruction/PermaLinks/Overview.pdf| accessdate = 2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This club competes with over 600 other universities and institutions nationally and has attended a National Tournament 13 times consecutively. In order to become a member, students must go through a rigorous try-out process where they are chosen to be on different teams. On average, there are 21â24 students who participate in Mock Trial each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Mock Trial Political Law Clubs| publisher = Gonzaga University| url = https://gonzaga-community.symplicity.com/index.php?s=student_group&amp;tab=profile&amp;mode=form&amp;id=5829b3147f78a8b660d302ab47d61a57&amp;au=&amp;ck=| accessdate = 2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jundt Fall Exhibit===
Gonzaga University offers the invitational exhibit, âDrawn the Wall,â every three years in the Jundt Art Museum, located on the universityâs main campus.  This exhibit features five well-known Inland Northwest artists all of whom present an original work on 11 Â½-by-8-foot moveable museum wall. Each artist spends two weeks at the museum, during which time they create an original piece of art according to a common theme. For example, artists selected to participate in 2010âs âDrawn to the IVâ were asked to find workable solutions to large scale drawings and to the constraints of working in a âcommonâ environment. In a unique fashion, the drawings present in the exhibit are removed and painted over when the exhibit ends, and the walls upon which the drawings once resided are return to their normal use as gallery partitions.  âDrawn to the Wall IVâ features the distinct talents of Michael Horswill,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Art Spirit| publisher = Art Spirit Website| url = http://www.theartspiritgallery.com/html/ArtistBio.asp?artnum=13| accessdate = 2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Kodis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Spokanearts.org

==Athletics==
{{Main|Gonzaga Bulldogs}}
{{See also|Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball}}
[[File:GU Bulldogs Logo.svg|120px|left]]

Gonzaga University, whose official mascot is the Bulldog and whose players are nicknamed the ''Zags,'' is part of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I [[West Coast Conference]]. Its [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|men's basketball team]], which did not make its first appearance in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] until [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1995]] (more than a decade after NBA Hall of Fame player and Gonzaga alum [[John Stockton]] graduated), has become nationally prominent since making the regional finals of the NCAA tournament (&quot;Elite Eight&quot;) in [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]], re-appearing in the tournament every year since.

Gonzaga University [[basketball]] games are held in the [[McCarthey Athletic Center]], in which the men's basketball team has won over 90 percent of its games. The men's team often plays high-profile non-conference games at the [[Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena]] near downtown Spokane, in addition to the annual Comcast Battle in Seattle game held at [[KeyArena]] in Seattle.

Three of Gonzaga's most recent notable athletes are basketball playersâformer [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Ronny Turiaf]] (now playing for the [[New York Knicks]]); third overall [[2006 NBA Draft]] pick and [[Red Star Belgrade]] [[Adam Morrison]] (who was selected by the [[Charlotte Bobcats]]), regarded for his likeness to Hall of Famer [[Larry Bird]]; and [[Courtney Vandersloot]], 2011 winner of the [[Nancy Lieberman Award]] as the leading Division I women's [[point guard]] and women's [[Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award]] as the top Division I player no taller than 5'8&quot; (1.73 m), selected third overall by the [[Chicago Sky]] in the [[2011 WNBA Draft]]. Men's head coach [[Mark Few]] was the [[West Coast Conference]] coach of the year from [[2001 in sports|2001]] to [[2006 in sports|2006]], and again in [[2008 in sports|2008]]. Few became the [[head coach]] in the summer of [[1999 in sports|1999]], following the departure of [[Dan Monson]] to [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota]]. Women's head coach [[Kelly Graves]], a six-time WCC coach of the year, has led the Zags to seven consecutive WCC regular-season titles and four WCC tournament titles. The 2010â11 women's team, a #11 seed in [[2011 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|that year's NCAA Tournament]], became the lowest seed ever to advance to a regional final in the history of the women's tournament.

Like some other smaller colleges, Gonzaga's [[American football|football]] program ended in the Fall of 1941, just before the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], but not before producing two [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs: [[Tony Canadeo]] '41 of the [[Green Bay Packers]], and [[Ray Flaherty]] '26, head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]]. In addition, Flaherty recruited former Bulldog football stars, [[Ed Justice]], [[George Karamatic|George &quot;Automatic&quot; Karamatic]] and [[Max Krause]] to play in the Redskin backfield. Gonzaga football ended due to declining enrollment of young male athletes{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}. Efforts to restart the program in 1946 were unsuccessful, and the football stadium was razed in 1949.

Gonzaga University also has an [[Army ROTC]] [[Ranger Challenge]] team, which has won 15 championships in the last 16 years, and is a multiple winner of the Douglas MacArthur Award, given annually to the best Army ROTC program in the Western United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Bulldogs Making Headlines| publisher = Gonzaga University | url = http://www.gonzaga.edu/Academics/Undergraduate/Special-Programs/Military-Science/default1.asp| accessdate = 2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
