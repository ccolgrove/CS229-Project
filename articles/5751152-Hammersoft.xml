==History==
[[Image:Kalmia latifolia1.jpg|thumb|left|Mountain Laurel]]
A portion of the land within Moore State Park was once the home to at least five 18th and 19th century [[watermill]]s that were powered by the cascading waters of Turkey Hill Brook that fall 90 feet over a 400-foot run. The first mills built on the site were a [[gristmill]] and [[sawmill]] as early as 1747. The remnants of this mill village are still visible and include, in addition to the mills, a [[triphammer]], [[quarry]], [[School|school house]], and [[tavern]].

In the early 20th-century, the property became a private [[Estate (house)|estate]]; large portions of it have subsequently been included in the state park.
