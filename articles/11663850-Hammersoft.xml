&lt;!-- Refer to ref FAS for this paragraph --&gt;
The [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) began in 1974 as a Marxist-Leninist organization under the leadership of [[Abdullah Ãcalan]]. In 1978 the organization adapted the name &quot;Kurdistan Workers Party&quot; and waged [[Urban warfare|Urban War]] between 1978 and 1980. The organization restructured itself and moved the [[organization structure]] to Syria between 1980 and 1984 just after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'Ã©tat]].

The campaign of armed violence began in 1984.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} The rural-based [[insurgency]] lasted between 1984 and 1992. The PKK shifted its activities to include urban warfare between 1993 and 1995 and 1996 to 1999. The leader of the party was captured in Kenya in early 1999, following an international campaign by US, Israel, Greece, UK and Italy. After a unilaterally declared peace initiative in 1999, PKK was forced to resume the conflict due to Turkish military offensive in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot;/&gt; Since 1974, it had been able to evolve, adapt, gone through a metamorphosis,&lt;ref name=Joost&gt;Jongerden, Joost. &quot;[http://www.personal.ceu.hu/PolSciJournal/CEU_PolSciJournal_III_1.pdf PKK],&quot; ''CEU Political Science Journal''. Vol. 3, No. 1 page 127-132&lt;/ref&gt; which became the main factor in its survival. It had gradually grown from a handful of political students to a dynamic organization, and became part of the target on the [[War on Terrorism]].

With the aftermath of the failed [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]] against [[Saddam Hussein]] the UN established [[no-fly zone]]s in Kurdish areas of Iraq giving those areas de facto independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/news/un/iraq/sres/sres0688.htm UN Resolution 688], [[Federation of American Scientists]]&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK soon found a safe haven from which they could launch attacks against Turkey, which responded with [[Operation Steel]] (1995) and [[Operation Hammer]] (1997) in an attempt to crush the PKK.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fox, Kathie Young (March 1999). [http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/turkey/mar99_turkey_kurds.pdf Kurds in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, General Kemal Yilmaz, declared that the Special Warfare Department (the seat of the [[Counter-Guerrilla]]) was still active in the conflict against the PKK.&lt;ref name=KomTur&gt;[[Lucy Komisar]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n4_v61/ai_19254727 Turkey's terrorists: a CIA legacy lives on], ''[[The Progressive]]'', April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. State Department]] echoed concerns of Counter-Guerrilla involvement in its 1994 [[Country Report on Human Rights Practices]] for Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USDOS,,TUR,,3ae6aa7b18,0.html

Ãcalan was captured by CIA, agents in [[Kenya]] on February 15, 1999, who turned him over to the Turkish authorities. After the trial he was sentenced to death, but this sentence was commuted to life-long aggravated imprisonment when the [[death penalty]] was abolished in Turkey in August 2002.

With the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]] much of the arms of the former Iraqi army fell into the hands of the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] militias.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Lortz, Michael.

==The conflict==
'''{{Main|List of incidents in the TurkeyâKurdistan Workers' Party conflict}}'''

===1974â1984: Start of the conflict===
In 1973, a small group, under leadership of Abdullah Ãcalan, released a declaration about the Kurdish identity in Turkey. The group, which called itself the ''Revolutionaries of Kurdistan'' also included [[Ali Haydar Kaytan]], [[Cemil Bayik]], [[Haki Karer]] and [[Kemal Pir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kicadam/kurdistan/2_99/ocalan.html |title=Abdullah Ãcalan and the development of the PKK |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group decided in 1974&lt;ref name=&quot;security&quot;/&gt; to start a campaign for Kurdish rights. Cemil Bayik was sent to [[Urfa]], Kemal Pir was sent to [[Mus]], Hakki Karer to [[Batman, Turkey|Batman]] and  [[Ali Haydar Kaytan]] to [[Tunceli]], they then started student organisations which talked to local workers and farmers about Kurdish rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;/&gt;

In 1977, an assembly was held to evaluate the political activities. The assembly included 100 people, from different backgrounds and several representatives from other Leftist organisations. In Spring 1977, Abdullah Ãcalan travelled through whole Kurdistan on a campaign to make the public aware of the Kurdish issue. During his campaign he travelled to [[Mount Ararat]], [[Erzurum]], Tunceli, [[Elazig]], [[Antep]] and other cities. This was followed by a Turkish government crackdown against the organisation. On 18 March 1977, Haki Karer was assassinated in Antep. During this period, the group was also targeted by the [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]]'s [[Grey Wolves]]. They were also targeted by Kurdish landowners who on 18 May 1978, killed [[Halil Ãavgun]], which resulted in large Kurdish meetings in Erzurum, Dersim, Elazig and Antep.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;/&gt;

The founding Congress of the PKK was held on 27 November 1978 in Fis, a village nearby the city of [[Lice, Turkey|Lice]]. During this congress the 25 people, present decided to found the Kurdistan Workers' Party. The Turkish state, rightist groups and Kurdish landowners, continued their attacks on the group, in response the employed armed members to protect itself which got involved in the fighting between leftist and rightist groups in Turkey (1978â1980) at the side of the leftists. In Summer 1979, Ãcalan travelled to [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] where he made contacts with Syrian and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;/&gt; After 12 September [[1980 Turkish coup d'Ã©tat]] and a crackdown which was launched on all political organisations,&lt;ref name=Gil&gt;Gil, Ata. &quot;La Turquie Ã  marche forcÃ©e,&quot; ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', February 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; during which half a million people were imprisoned and 51 officially executed,&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]] [http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2010/09/turkeys_constitutional_referendum Erdogan pulls it off], Sep 13th 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of the PKK withdrew into Syria and Lebanon. Ãcalan himself going to Syria in September 1980, Kemal Pir, [[Mahsum Korkmaz]] and [[Delil Dogan]] being sent to set up an organisation in Lebanon. PKK fighters took part in the [[1982 Lebanon War]] at the Syrian side.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;/&gt;

The Second PKK Party Congress was then held in [[Daraa]], Syria from 20 August to 25 August 1982. Here it was decided that the organisation would return to Turkey to start an armed guerilla war there for the creation of an independent Kurdish state. Meanwhile they prepared guerilla forces in Syria and Lebanon to go to war. Many PKK leaders however were arrested in Turkey and sent to [[Diyarbakir]] Prison. The prison became the site of much political protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;/&gt;

In [[DiyarbakÄ±r Prison]] the [[PKK]] member [[Mazlum DoÄan]] burned himself to death on 21 March 1982 in protest at the treatment in prison. Ferhat Kurtay, Necmi Ãnen, Mahmut Zengin and EÅref AnyÄ±k followed his example on 17 May 1982. On 14 July 1982 the [[PKK]] members Kemal Pir, [[M. Hayri DurmuÅ]], [[Ali ÃiÃ§ek]] and [[Akif YÄ±lmaz]] started a hunger strike in DiyarbakÄ±r Prison.&lt;ref&gt;See the online edition [http://www.gundem-online.com/yazdir.asp?haberid=55278 of GÃ¼ndem of 14 July 2008] (Turkish).

On 13 April 1984 a 75-day hunger-strike started in Istanbul. As a result four prisoners â [[Abdullah Meral]], [[Haydar BaÅbaÄ]], [[Fatih ÃkÃ¼tÃ¼lmÃ¼Å]] and [[Hasan Telci]] â died.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the [[Human Rights Foundation of Turkey]]: File of Torture: Deaths in Detention Places or Prisons (12 September 1980 to 12 September 1995), Ankara, March 1996 ISBN 975-7217-09-03, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OHAL.png|thumb|right|300px|OHAL region in red with neighbouring provinces in orange, 1987â2002]]

During these attacks 1 gendarmerie soldier was killed, 7 soldiers, 2 policemen and 3 civilians were injured. It was followed by a PKK raid on a police station in [[Siirt]], two days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkishweekly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/article/217/chronology-of-the-important-events-in-the-world-pkk-chronology-1976-2006-.html |title=Chronology of the Important Events in the World/PKK Chronology (1976â2006) |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, Turkish authorities did not take the attacks seriously, however within the next two months the group was responsible for an attack that killed 3 of General [[Kenan Evren]]'s Preidential Guards in [[YÃ¼ksekova]] and an ambush which killed 8 Turkish soldiers in [[Ãukurca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=QuQBdYSc4d8C&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=August+15,+1984+PKK&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=LE-TTf_LE8mAOubI-V0&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=August%2015%2C%201984%20PKK&amp;f=false |title=The Kurdish Conflict: International Humanitarian Law and Post-Conflict (page 16) |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next 5 years some 2,500 people would be killed in the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;casualty years&quot;/&gt;

The Turkish state responded by deploying 350,000 soldiers and gendarmes and 35,000 police to the region, while setting up pro-government Kurdish militia named the [[Village Guards]] with a strength of 70,000 men, to combat the PKK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusi.org/downloads/assets/Turkey_terrorism.pdf |title=COMBATING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM Turkeyâs Added Value (page 10) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 1987 they created a region of emergency rule called the [[Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey|OHAL region]]. This included the provinces of [[BingÃ¶l Province|BingÃ¶l]], [[DiyarbakÄ±r Province|DiyarbakÄ±r]], [[ElazÄ±Ä Province|ElazÄ±Ä]], [[Hakkari Province|Hakkari]], [[Mardin Province|Mardin]], [[Siirt Province|Siirt]], [[Tunceli Province|Tunceli]] and [[Van Province|Van]] with [[AdÄ±yaman Province|AdÄ±yaman]], [[Bitlis Province|Bitlis]] and [[MuÅ Province|MuÅ]] as neighbouring provinces. They later added the newly created [[Batman Province|Batman]] and [[ÅÄ±rnak Province]]s.

In the 1990s the campaign intensified, with major protests called [[Serhildan]] breaking out in 1990 in [[Nusaybin]] and spreading to most Kurdish cities.&lt;ref&gt;Ä°lhan GÃ¼lsÃ¼n: ''PKK ve Åer odaklarÄ±''. Istanbul 1998. ISBN 978-9757841401. (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK also stepped up its attacks resulting in the confirmed deaths of at least 15,000 people between 1991 and 1995, which is 6x as much as in the preceding 5 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;casualty years&quot;/&gt; The [[Turgut Ãzal|Ãzal]] government had started an [[1992 Turkish offensive|anti-PKK offensive in 1992]], this was however halted after the PPK's September [[1992 Tasdelen attack]] which killed 20 Turkish soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oct08&quot;&gt;[[The New York Times]] [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/world/europe/05turkey.html 15 Turkish Soldiers Dead in Fighting With Rebels], October 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK had established bases in Northern Iraq after the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]] had resulted in Kurdish control of the area and expulsion of Saddam's Army. In response Turkey launched [[Operation Northern Iraq]] from 5 October 1992 to 15 November 1992, which they claim resulted in the death of 1,551 and capture of 1,232 PKK militants as well as the death of 28 killed and injury of 125 security forces, but was proved to be false.&lt;ref name=hurriyet1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotoanaliz.hurriyet.com.tr/GaleriDetay.aspx?cid=6755&amp;p=1&amp;rid=4369|title=Kuzey Irak harekatÄ± (5 Ekim â 15 KasÄ±m 1992)|publisher=[[HÃ¼rriyet]]|accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the two sides came closest to reconciliation as Turkish President Turgut Ãzal wanted to establish dialogue with the PKKâs leaders and said that he would be prepared to allow the broadcasting of Kurdish language and would even be prepared to discuss a federal system in Turkey to solve the problem. The PKK responded by announcing a cease-fire on March 20, 1993. However, Ãzal's death on April 17, 1993 brought a halt to such efforts from the Turkish government. The PKK responded by breaking the cease-fire with [[May 24, 1993 PKK ambush|an ambush]] that killed 33 Turkish soldiers on a road between the eastern provinces of ElazÄ±Ä and BingÃ¶l. After the Turkish government started a new crackdown which included the banning of Turkey's only Kurdish party the [[People's Work Party]], on June 16, 1994 and the arrest and imprisonment of several of their members. Part of the crackdown was also the evacuation of thousands of Kurdish villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;hurriyet&quot;&gt;[[HÃ¼rriyet Daily News and Economic Review]] [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=history-for-the-pkk-in-turkey-2009-09-14 History of PKK in Turkey], September 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The PKK launched attacks on Turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities in many Western European cities in 1993 and repeated these attacks in spring 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;security&quot;/&gt; A second, one-sided cease-fire was declared by the PKK on December 15, 1995 but this was ended on May 6, 1996 after talks between Turkey and Israel declared Ãcalan a terrorist.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceasefires&quot;/&gt;

Due to the PKK's claim to be the only true spokesman for Kurdish nationalism  in Turkey, a violent conflict also erupted with rival Kurdish group [[Kurdish Hezbollah|Hezbollah]] (a Kurdish group with an [[Islamist]] character), between 1992 and 1995, in which an estimated 500 PKK and 200 Hezbollah militants were killed. During this period, clashes between factions of Hezbollah led by [[HÃ¼seyin VelioÄlu]] and [[Fidan GÃ¼ngÃ¶r]] also took place, in which the VeliÄlu faction emerged victorious. These clashed took part without interference of Turkish security forces. Links between the Kurdish Hezbollah and Turkish security forces during this period have been alleged.&lt;ref name=&quot;KH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0317 |title=The Kurdish á¸¤izbullÄh in Turkey |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1990s the conflict reached its peak in violence,&lt;ref name=&quot;hurriyet&quot;/&gt; in 1994 the PKK had between 10,000 and 15,000 full-time and 60,000 to 75,000 part-time guerrillas, which is the highest it has ever been.&lt;ref&gt;[[global security]] [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/crs/Cterror2.htm CRS Report: Terrorism: Middle Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)], August 27, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; To counter the growing force of the PKK the Turkish military started new counter insurgency strategies between 1992 and 1995. To deprive the rebels of a logistical base of operations the military carried out de-forestation of the country-side and destroyed over 3,000 Kurdish villages, causing at least 2 million refugees. Most of these villages were evacuated, however other villages were burned, bombed, or shelled by government forces and several entire villages were obliterated from the air. While some villages were destroyed or evacuated, many villages were brought to the side of the Turkish government, which offered salaries to local farmers and shepherds to join the [[Village Guards]] which would prevent the PKK from operating in these villages, while villages which refused were evacuated by the military. These tactics managed to drive the rebels from the cities and villages into the mountains, although they still often launched reprisals on pro-government villages, which included attacks on civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Soc/soc.culture.indian/2005-08/msg00317.html Turkey's war on the Kurds], 13 Aug 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

After the unilateral cease-fire the PKK declared in September 1999, their forces fully withdrew from the Republic of Turkey and set up new bases in the [[Qandil Mountains]] of Iraq&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkishweekly&quot;/&gt; and in February 2000 they declared the formal end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;KDP&quot;/&gt; After this, the PKK said it would switch its strategy to using peaceful methods to achieve their objectives. In April 2002 the PKK changed its name to ''KADEK'' (Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress), claiming the PKK had fulfilled its mission and would now move on as purely political organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ataa&quot;/&gt; In October 2003 the KADEK announced its dissolution and declared the cration of a new organisation: ''KONGRA-GEL'' (Kurdistan Peoples Congress).&lt;ref name=&quot;new pkk&quot;&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/pjcis/pkk_1/Statement%20of%20Reasons%20PKK.pdf Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)], June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2004 there was a power struggle inside the KONGRA-GEL between a reformist wing which wanted the organisation to disarm completely and a traditionalist wing which wanted the organisation to resume its armed insurgency once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkishweekly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cemil Bayik&quot;&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4938 Leading PKK Commander Cemil Bayik Crosses into Iran], May 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative wing of the organisation won this power struggle&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkishweekly&quot;/&gt; forcing reformist leaders such as [[Kani Yilmaz]], [[Nizamettin Tas]] and Abdullah Ãcalan's younger brother [[Osman Ãcalan]] to leave the organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cemil Bayik&quot;/&gt; The three major traditionalist leaders, [[Murat Karayilan]], [[Cemil Bayik]] and [[Fehman Huseyin]] formed the new leadership committee of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menewsline.com/article-809-New-PKK-Leadership-Takes-Over-Ins.aspx |title=New PKK Leadership Takes Over Insurgency |publisher=Menewsline.com |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new administration decided to re-start the insurgency, because they claimed that without guerillas the PKK's political activities would remain unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;ataa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkishweekly&quot;/&gt; This came as the pro-Kurdish [[People's Democracy Party]] (HADEP) was banned by the Turkish Supreme Court om March 13, 2003&lt;ref&gt;European Court Of Human Rights [http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=878622&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 CASE OF HADEP AND DEMÄ°R v.

As result, the PKK reduced the size of its field units from 15â20 militants to 6â8 militants. It also avoided direct confrontations and relied more on the use of mines, snipers and small ambushes, using hit and run tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;PKK tactics&quot;&gt;Jamestown [http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=4494 PKK Changes Battlefield Tactics to Force Turkey into Negotiations], October 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Another change in PKK-tactics was that the organisation no longer attempted to control any territory, not even after dark.&lt;ref&gt;Jamestown [http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Insurgency-and-Terrorism/Partiya-Karkaren-Kurdistan-PKK-Turkey.html Partiya Karkaren Kurdistan (PKK) (Turkey), GROUPS â EUROPE â ACTIVE]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, violence increased throughout both 2004 and 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;security&quot;/&gt; during which the PKK was said to be responsible for dozens of bombings in Western Turkey throughout 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas&quot;/&gt; Most notably the [[2005 KuÅadasÄ± minibus bombing]], which killed 5 and injured 14 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4688575.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkish resort blast kills five | date=16 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the PKK denied responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4691755.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kurds 'deny' Turkey resort bomb | date=17 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights abuses==
{{further|[[Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey]]}}
Both Turkey and the PKK have committed numerous [[human rights]] [[abuses]] during the conflict.
Former French ambassador to Turkey Eric Rouleau states:&lt;ref name=rouleau&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rouleau |first=Eric |year=2000 |month=November/December |title=Turkey's Dream of Democracy |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=79 |issue=6 |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20001101faessay939/eric-rouleau/turkey-s-dream-of-democracy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''According to the Turkish [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Ministry of Justice]], along with the 30,000 people killed in military campaigns, 22,500 Turkish Politicians were assassinated between 1984, when the conflict began, and 1998. An additional 1,000 people were reportedly assassinated in the first nine months of 1999.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Abuses by the PKK===
[[Human Rights Watch]] has stated the following about the tactics of the PKK::
* Consequently, all economic, political, military, social and cultural organizations, institutions, formationsâand those who serve in themâhave become targets. The entire country has become a battlefield.
* The PKK also promised to &quot;liquidate&quot; or &quot;eliminate&quot; political parties, &quot;imperialist&quot; cultural and educational institutions, legislative and representative bodies, and &quot;all local collaborators and agents working for the Republic of Turkey.&quot;&lt;ref name=hrwdalema&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/news/1998/11/20/letter-italian-prime-minister-massimo-dalema Letter to Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema], [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many who died were unarmed civilians, caught in the middle between the PKK and security forces, targeted for attacks by inevitably, PKK suicide bombers.&lt;ref name=hrwdevelopments&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/reports/1993/WR93/Hsw-08.htm Turkey: Human Rights Developments], [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], the PKK killed and tortured Kurdish peasants and its own members in the 1980s. A number of Kurds have been abducted and killed because they were suspected of being &quot;collaborators&quot; or &quot;informers&quot; and it was a common practice for the PKK to kill their whole families.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyChapter3&quot;&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/turkey/turk3.htm Turkey campaign (Chapter 3)], [[Amnesty International]], 1997.{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1996 report by Amnesty International, &quot;in January 1996 the [Turkish] government announced that the PKK had massacred 11 men near the remote village of [[GÃ¼Ã§lÃ¼konak]]. Seven of the victims were members of the local [[village guard]] force&quot;.&lt;ref name=amntr&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/turkey/ Turkey campaign], [[Amnesty International]], 1996.{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuses by the Turkish side===

In response to the activities of the PKK, the Turkish government placed Southeastern Anatolia, where citizens of Kurdish descent are in the majority, under military rule. The Turkish Army and the Kurdish village guards loyal to it have abused Kurdish civilians, resulting in [[mass migration]]s to cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcdowall&quot;/&gt; However martial law and military rule was lifted in the last provinces in 2002.

In 2006 it was stated by the former ambassador Rouleau that the continuing human rights abuses of ethnic Kurds is one of the main obstacles to [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkish membership of the E.U.]]&lt;ref name=housegov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.house.gov/archives/107/73068.pdf |title=U.S. Policy In The Mediterranean: Managing The Greece, Turkey, Cyprus Triangle |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] |accessdate=September 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] notes that:
* As Human Rights Watch has often reported and condemned, Turkish government forces have, during the conflict with the PKK, also committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including [[torture]], extrajudicial killings, and indiscriminate fire. We continue to demand that the Turkish government investigate and hold accountable those members of its security forces responsible for these violations. Nonetheless, under international law, the government abuses cannot under any circumstances be seen to justify or excuse those committed by Ocalan's PKK.&lt;ref name=hrwdalema /&gt;

* The Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), a separatist group that espouses the use of violence for political ends, continues to wage guerrilla warfare in the southeast, frequently in violation of international humanitarian law, or the laws of war. Instead of attempting to capture, question and indict people suspected of illegal activity, Turkish security forces killed suspects in house raids, thus acting as investigator, judge, jury and executioner. Police routinely asserted that such deaths occurred in shoot-outs between police and &quot;terrorists.&quot; In many cases, eyewitnesses reported that no firing came from the attacked house or apartment. Reliable reports indicated that while the occupants of raided premises were shot and killed, no police were killed or wounded during the raids. This discrepancy suggests that the killings were summary, extrajudicial executions, in violation of international human rights and humanitarian law.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrwdevelopments&quot;/&gt;

According to an article printed in the November 2002 issue of the ''International Socialist'', monthly paper of the [[International Socialists (Scotland)|International Socialists]], during the conflict (and still [as of 2002]), the Turkish army killed and âdisappearedâ members of the PKK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.socialistworld.net/eng/2002/11/17kurdistan.html |title=Kurdistan: Turkey continues repression of Kurds |work=International Socialist |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Amnesty International (AI) reported that, &quot;'Disappearances' and extrajudicial executions have emerged as new and disturbing patterns of human rights violations ...&quot; by the Turkish state.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyChapter2&quot;&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/intcam/turkey/turk2.htm Turkey campaign (Chapter 2)], [[Amnesty International]], 1997.{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish-Kurdish human right activists in Germany accused Turkey of Using Chemical Weapons against PKK. Hans Baumann, a German expert on photo forgeries investigated the authenticity of the photos and claimed that the photos were authentic. A forensics report released by the Hamburg University Hospital has backed the allegations. Claudia Roth from Germany's Green Party demanded an explanation from the Turkish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,711536,00.html |title=Shocking Images of Dead Kurdish Fighters: Turkey Accused of Using Chemical Weapons against PKK â SPIEGEL ONLINE â News â International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman SelÃ§uk Ãnal commented on the issue. He said that he did not need to emphasize that the accusations were groundless. He added that Turkey signed to the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, and Turkey did not possess chemical weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/haber/20100814/Disislerinden-kimyasal-silah-iddialarina-ret.php |language=Turkish|title=DÄ±ÅiÅleri'nden 'kimyasal silah' iddialarÄ±na ret haberi Siyaset haberleri Haber7 haber7.com â GÃ¼ncel Haberler, Son dakika haberleri â Bu noktada haber var |publisher=Haber7.com |date=2010-08-14 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey has been a signatory to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction since 1997, and has passed all inspections required by such convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=officials-deny-der-spiegel8217s-claim-on-use-of-chemical-weapons-2010-08-13 |title=Turkish officials deny Der Spiegel's claim on use of chemical weapons â Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |publisher=Hurriyetdailynews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
