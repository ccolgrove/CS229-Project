==Astronomy==

The first significant work in astronomy in South Africa was performed by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] between 1751 and 1753, culminating in the measurement of the arc of the southern meridian and a catalog of almost 10 000 southern stars, later published as ''Coelum Australe Stelliferum''.&lt;ref name=theal-7475&gt;{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George M'Call|title=History of South Africa under the administration of the Dutch East India Company, 1652 to 1795|year=1897|publisher=S.

The [[Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope|Royal Observatory]] was established at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1820 and opened in 1829.&lt;ref name=clerke-8&gt;{{cite book|last=Clerke|first=Agnes M.|title=A popular history of astronomy during the nineteenth century|year=1893|pages=8|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/popularhistoryof00clerrich#page/8/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, with the main observing site having moved from the Cape of Good Hope to a higher site near [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]], it is host to the [[Southern African Large Telescope]] as well as numerous other South African and international telescopes.

Notable astronomers who have worked in the country include [[John Herschel]] who published ''Results of astronomical observations made during the years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope'' in 1847&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of astronomical observations made during the years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1847QB3.H52........|publisher=The Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Gill (astronomer)|David Gill]] whose work include the ''[[Cape Photographic Durchmusterung]]''.

The [[Karoo Array Telescope]] (or MeerKAT) is under construction as a pathfinder for the $2 billion [[Square Kilometer Array]] (SKA) project. South Africa, along with [[Australia]] is a candidate to host the SKA, with the host to be announced in 2012.

==Energy==
{{main|Energy in South Africa}}
Being rich in coal, South Africa has some of the largest [[List of coal power stations|coal fired power stations]] in the world.

In 1955 [[Sasol]] opened the first commercial [[Coal liquefaction]] plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;SASOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sasol produces 1,5 billion barrels of synthetic fuel from coal in fifty years|url=http://www.sasol.com/sasol_internet/frontend/navigation.jsp?articleTypeID=2&amp;articleId=12300007&amp;navid=1&amp;rootid=1|publisher=[[SASOL]]|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iupac.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Overview of the South African Chemical Industry: 1896 - 1998|journal=Chemistry International|year=1999|month=May|volume=21|series=3|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/1999/may/other3.html|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SASOL: COMMITTED TO GTL SINCE 1947|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2006/04/28/2013746/sasol-takes-the-technological-lead.html|work=Sasol takes the technological lead|publisher=Reed Business Information Limited|accessdate=26 June 2011|date=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercialization of copper indium gallium sulphur selenide (CIGSSE) [[thin film solar cell]] technology was pioneered by Professor [[Vivian Alberts]] at the [[University of Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=JÃ¤ger-Waldau|first=Arnulf|title=Joint Research Centre - Renewable Energy Unit - PV Status Report 2008|year=2008|publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-10122-9|url=http://solar.gwu.edu/index_files/Resources_files/EU_PV_Status_Report.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South African Solar Challenge]] is held bi-annually over a distance of {{convert|2500|mi}}.

{{as of|2011}} the [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]] is the only commercial nuclear energy station on the African continent.

[[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], was the first city in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and in [[Africa]] to have electric street lights - first lit on 1 September 1882 .&lt;ref name=&quot;kimberley-lights&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solplaatje.org.za/explore_history.php |title=Timeline of Firsts |accessdate=2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South African companies hold a considerable number of high value patents related to mining.&lt;ref name=MMCP&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=David|title=South African mining equipment and related services: Growth, constraints and policy|publisher=[[University of Cape Town]]|isbn=978-1-77011-236-0|pages=8â9|url=http://www.cssr.uct.ac.za/sites/cssr.uct.ac.za/files/pubs/MMCP%20Paper%205_0.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2011|chapter=2.

==Nuclear weapons programme==
{{Main|South Africa and weapons of mass destruction}}
[[File:South African nuclear bomb casings.jpg|thumb|Spare bomb casings from South Africa's nuclear weapon programme.]]
During the 1960s and 1980s South Africa had been pursuing research into the development of [[nuclear weapons]] as well as [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]]. South Africa was able to acquire [[Uranium]] from native ore deposits, and used [[Uranium enrichment|aerodynamic nozzle]] enrichment techniques to produce weapons-grade Uranium. Six bombs were constructed, with one still under construction before the termination of its nuclear weapons programme. It is alleged that South Africa had been collaborating with [[Israel]] to develop nuclear weapons and that it [[Vela Incident|possibly detonated one of its weapons]] over the [[Indian Ocean]] in a nuclear weapons test. South Africa dismantled its nuclear weapons programme in 1989, the first nation in the world to do so, and became a signatory of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1991.

South Africa continues to use its surplus of Uranium as part of its nuclear energy programme, supplying the [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]] and [[SAFARI-1]] [[research reactor]]s.
==Government policy==
Despite government efforts to encourage [[entrepreneurship]] in [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with Far Eastern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
