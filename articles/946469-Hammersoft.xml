'''Marian University''' is a Roman Catholic university in Indianapolis Indiana.

==About==
Marian University, sponsored by the Sisters of St. Francis in Oldenburg, Indiana, traces its roots to their founding in 1851. The Oldenburg Franciscans established schools and a teacher-training school to ensure that their members were good teachers. 

Marian University is located about four miles northwest of [[downtown Indianapolis]]. Marian University has more than 2,200 full- and part-time students from the United States and 12 other countries with a student-faculty ratio of 15.5:1.

==History==
'''1851 â Teacher Training'''

Formed in 1851 in the liberal arts tradition as a teacher training school by the Sisters of St. Francis, Oldenburg to serve the educational needs of the German-Catholic residents of southern Indiana. Under the direction of Father Francis Joseph Rudolph and Mother Theresa Hackelmeier, teachers were trained at Oldenburg for more than a decade before Indiana adopted its first tax-supported normal school.

'''1936 â The Beginning'''

Originally known as St. Francis Normal, the school became a four-year, state-approved institution which merged with Immaculate Conception Junior College to form Marian College. In November 1936, the Sisters of St. Francis purchased the former James Allison estate, âRiverdale,â located in Indianapolis, as a site for Marian College.

'''1937 â Marian College Is Born'''

In 1937, the college moved to Indianapolis under the direction of Mother M. Clarissa Dillhoff, after securing a state charter and purchasing the Riverdale estate in 1936. Allison Mansion became the new location of Marian College. The building housed the library, administrative offices, classrooms, and sleeping quarters for the Sisters. Classes began September 15, 1937.

'''1948 â Expansion, Co-Education, and Accreditation'''

Success brought a need for expansion and, in 1948 the college began an expansion program that included the addition of Clare Hall, the Gymnasium, and Marian Hall. In 1954, as the new Marian Hall was completed, the school became the first co-educational Catholic college in Indiana. Two years later, the North Central Association accredited Marian College.

'''1970 â Growth Continued'''

In 1970, a new {{convert|58000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} library was completed.  It was designed by [[Woollen, Molzan and Partners]].

'''1976 â Accreditation For Teachers and Nurses'''

The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education formally accepted all teacher education programs of the college in
1976. The Indiana State Board of Nursing approved the associate level nursing curriculum in 1977 and the baccalaureate program in
1987. The National League of Nursing has accredited both programsâthe associate in 1986 and the baccalaureate in 1992.

'''2000 â Marianâs Adult Programs'''

Marian's Adult Programs (MAP) offers bachelor and associate degrees in business.

'''2001'''

On November 2, 2001, Daniel J. Elsener was inaugurated as Marian College's eighth president.

'''2009 â Marian College Becomes Marian University'''

On July 1, 2009, Marian College became Marian University. Over the past several years, the college grew and progressed through expansions of the academic curriculum; enhancing the faith dimension on campus the addition of a football team and marching band; and adding and renovating buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marian.edu/Pages/news.aspx?newsid=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''2010 â Marian University Announces College of Osteopathic Medicine'''

On January 15, 2010, Marian University announced plans to begin a college of osteopathic medicine; the first in Indiana due to the generosity of an anonymous donorâs $30 million pledge.

'''2011'''

On August 1, 2011 Greg Ballard, Mayor of the City of Indianapolis declared it &quot;President Daniel J. Elsener Day&quot; in the city. The proclamation came on the 10-year anniversary of President Elsener's service to Marian University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marian.edu/NewsDocuments/Daniel%20Elsener%20Marian%20University%2010th%20Anniversary%20Day%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2011 the new school of osteopathic medicine is officially during the groundbreaking ceremony being named after the anonymous donor, AIT Labs CEO Michael A. Evans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marian.edu/Pages/news.aspx?NewsID=560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
{{peacock|section|date=February 2011}}
Marian University is dedicated to teaching and learning in the Franciscan and liberal arts traditions. Specifically, in the Franciscan school of thought and spirit, education is based on the values of dignity of the individual, peace and justice, reconciliation, and responsible stewardship. Marian University, educates all students in the liberal arts tradition, emphasizing an education of the mind, body, and spirit as well as through multi-department general education requirements.

'''Accounting Program'''

Marian Universityâs accounting program has a statewide reputation of excellence{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} with a 100 percent employment rate after graduation{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}, due in large part to the internship/co-op programs. These programs are designed to enrich and supplement academic study with the application of professional work experience. The programs are part-time and full-time paid positions for which students can earn up to 24 semester hours of academic credit. The programs can be completed within the four-year academic schedule, rather than the usual five or more years required by some colleges and universities. Upon graduation, many Marian University students are offered permanent, full-time professional positions with their internship employers, or as a result of their experiences.

'''Green Chemistry'''

Marian University launched its green chemistry program in 2003 when Dr. Carl Lecher joined the faculty. The program interlinks undergraduate student research with the first comprehensive, green organic chemistry laboratory curriculum in the state.

'''Speech Team'''

Marian University is one of a small number of Catholic universities with an active speech team. The teamâs faith-based approach to forensics emphasizes self-expression, community-building, and horizon-broadening as paths to spiritual maturity across a diversity of religious traditions.

The team travels to nearly 12 tournaments each year, plus a week-long trip to the National Forensic Associationâs Individual Events Tournament in April. At tournaments, students compete in a variety of events such as impromptu speaking, persuasive speaking, and dramatic interpretation. On February 20, 2010, the team claimed first place over-all at the state tournament.
