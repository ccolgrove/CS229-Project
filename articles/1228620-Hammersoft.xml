'''TCN''' is the [[Sydney]] [[flagship (television)|flagship]] [[television station]] of the [[Nine Network]] in [[Australia]] and is located at [[Willoughby, New South Wales|Willoughby]]. The licence, issued to a company named Television Corporation Ltd headed by [[Frank Packer]], was one of the first four licences (two in Sydney, two in Melbourne) to be issued for commercial television stations in Australia.

==History==
TCN began broadcasting on 16 September 1956, and became the first station in Australia to begin regular transmissions. Test broadcasts, initially consisting of a test slide and later documentaries and dramas, had commenced two months earlier on 13 July 1956.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;First test broadcast by TCN&quot;. The Daily Telegraph, 1956-14-07. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first TV tower was built there in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but was replaced by a taller one which is the tallest lattice tower in Australia at 233 metres and is now operated by TXA Australia which operates another tower nearby at Artarmon.

The first words spoken on the station were by John Godson, who introduced the station audio-only,&lt;ref name=&quot;Original Voice&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 |url = http://www.knowfirst.info/forums/archive/index.php/t-18983.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the first program, ''This Is Television'', was introduced by [[Bruce Gyngell]]. As Godson's voice only was heard, Gyngell (who spoke and was seen) is regarded as the first person to &quot;appear&quot; on Australian television. Original footage of Gyngell's opening address is not believed to exist, with the oft-screened &quot;opening&quot; footage being re-created in 1959 for archival purposes. Other early programming included the 1958 variety music program ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'' which was launched by [[Brian Henderson (television presenter)|Brian Henderson]]. It lasted for 14 years on the station and launched the careers of many Australian performers.

In 1957, the station formed an affiliation with [[Melbourne]] station [[HSV-7]], allowing them to share programming. In [[1963]], station affiliations changed; TCN-9 formed part of the [[National Television Network]] with [[GTV-9]] in Melbourne, [[QTQ-9]] in [[Brisbane]] and [[NWS-9]] in [[Adelaide]]. These stations formed the basis of what is now the [[Nine Network]], although only the Sydney and Melbourne stations were owned by the Packer-controlled company [[Nine Network|Nine Network Limited]].

On Frank Packer's death in [[1974]] ownership of Nine Network passed to his younger son [[Kerry Packer]]. Kerry's older brother [[Clyde Packer]] had been groomed to take over from their father but after a bitter split with his father ca. 1970 he relinquished his role in the company and subsequently moved to the USA.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:WelcomeToTelevision.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Bruce Gyngell]] welcoming television broadcasting in Australia via TCN-9.]] --&gt;

In December 1987, Kerry Packer sold the Sydney and Melbourne stations to [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]]'s Bond Media for $1.055 billion, including $200 million in shares of Bond Media. Bond already owned the [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Brisbane]] Nine affiliate stations (among others). In 1990, Bond Media's inability to pay out preference shares to Packer forced Nine into receivership. In July 1990, Packer bought back the expanded Nine network (Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane) for only $200 million, one-fifth of what he sold it for. Perth was not included due to Bond selling it to Sunraysia Television before Packer buying back the company. Adelaide and Perth stations are now owned by WIN Corporation and affliated with the Nine Network.

In 1994, Packer's print operations (owned by [[Australian Consolidated Press]]) and the Nine Network were merged into one new company, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] (PBL). On 1 October 1997, TCN-9 performed the first on-air trial of [[digital television|digital broadcasting]] in the southern hemisphere.

''Nine News Sydney'' is TCN's flagship nightly news bulletin presented by [[Peter Overton]] on Sunday to Friday nights and [[Georgie Gardner]] on Saturday nights. Sports news is presented by [[Ken Sutcliffe]] on Sunday to Thursday nights and [[Cameron Williams]] on Friday and Saturday nights. [[Jaynie Seal]] presents weather forecasts on weeknights. [[Leila McKinnon]] and [[Wendy Kingston]] are the regular fill-in presenters.

[[Brian Henderson (television presenter)|Brian Henderson]] was Nine's Sydney news presenter for a record 45 years - including 38 years presenting on weeknights. Retiring in November 2002, Henderson was succeeded as weeknight presenter by [[Jim Waley]]. Waley was at the time host of the ''Sunday'' program, and was one of Nine's most experienced presenters.

In March 2005, after falling ratings against Seven's [[Ian Ross (newsreader)|Ian Ross]], Waley was replaced as weeknight presenter by [[Mark Ferguson (television presenter)|Mark Ferguson]], who was previously the main weekend presenter in Sydney. Ferguson's successor as weekend presenter - [[Mike Munro]] - resigned in 2008 and was replaced by [[Michael Usher]].

In 2009, following a continuing run of poor ratings, [[Mark Ferguson (television presenter)|Mark Ferguson]] was demoted to his former role as weekend news presenter, with [[Peter Overton]] taking over as chief presenter on weeknights. Later in the year, Ferguson was removed from presenting Sydney bulletins after announcing his decision to move to the [[Seven Network]]. [[Georgie Gardner]] was appointed as Saturday night presenter with [[Peter Overton]] now also presenting the Sunday night bulletin.

During 2011, the 6pm Sydney bulletin officially overtook Seven's Sydney news in the ratings for the first time in seven years, winning 21 weeks compared to Seven's 14 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2011/10/22/nine-news-sydney-takes-ratings-crown-from-seven/ Nine News Sydney takes ratings crown from Seven], Media Spy, 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
