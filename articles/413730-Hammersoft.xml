<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="413730" ns="0" title="Earl of Wessex"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The title '''Earl of Wessex''' has been created twice in British history, once in the pre-[[Norman conquest of England|Conquest]] Anglo-Saxon nobility of England and once in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]]. The region of [[Wessex]] (the &quot;West Saxons'), in the south and southwest of England, had been one of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms (the [[Heptarchy]]), whose expansion in the tenth century created a united [[Kingdom of England]].

== First creation ==
Wessex was one of the four earldoms of Anglo-Danish England.&lt;ref&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', 1007: &quot;In this year also was Edric appointed alderman over all the kingdom of the Mercians.&quot;, 1017: &quot;This year also was Alderman Edric slain at London&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period the earldom of Wessex covered the lands of the old [[kingdom of Wessex]], covering the counties of the south of England, including [[Cornwall]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and extending west to the Welsh border.
During the reign of King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] the earldom  was conferred on [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex|Godwin]] at some time after 1020.&lt;ref&gt;Mason p33&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter Godwin rose to become, in King [[Edward the Confessor|Edward]]'s time, the most powerful man in the kingdom.

On his death in 1053 the earldom passed to Godwin's son, who later became [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold II]] and died at the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.

Following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in the winter of 1066, [[William I of England|King William]] bestowed the earldom on [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William FitzOsbern]], his most trusted [[Companions of William the Conqueror|companion]].&lt;ref&gt;Crouch p100&lt;/ref&gt;  
FitzOsbern continued to help William consolidate his new realm until his death in Normandy in 1071.

Following this the earldom was reduced in power and regional jurisdiction, and passed to FitzOsbern's son, [[Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger]], as the [[Earl of Hereford|earldom of Hereford]].&lt;ref&gt;Crouch p108&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]] (c. 1001â1053)
* [[Harold Godwinson]] (c. 1022â1066) also [[Earl of East Anglia]]; ascended to the throne of [[King of England]] in January 1066
* [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William FitzOsbern]] (c. 1020-1071)

In 1999, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II's]] youngest son, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], married [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Sophie Helen Rhys-Jones]]. Younger sons of the monarch are normally given [[Royal Dukedoms in the United Kingdom|dukedoms]] at the time of their marriage, and experts had suggested the former royal dukedoms of [[Duke of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Duke of Sussex|Sussex]] as the most likely to be granted to Prince Edward, but he was instead created Earl of Wessex. When the earldom was created, the Palace announced that the Earl of Wessex would be created [[Duke of Edinburgh]] after the death of his father, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], when that title reverts back to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page3025.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported that Prince Edward was originally to have been titled Duke of Cambridge after his marriage. However, after watching the 1998 film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', he was reportedly attracted to the title used by a character played by [[Colin Firth]], and asked the Queen to be given the title of Earl of Wessex instead.&lt;ref&gt;

The current Earl of Wessex is also '''Viscount Severn'''; this title is used as a [[courtesy title]] by the Earl's son, who was born on 17 December 2007.

The heir apparent is the present holder's son [[James, Viscount Severn]] (b. 2007). The Earl's son is currently the only person in the line of succession to the titles of Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn.

== Fiction ==

The [[1998 in film|1998 film]] ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' featured an entirely fictional, villainous Earl of Wessex, played by [[Colin Firth]].

There is also a fictional Earl of Wessex in [[Geoffrey Trease]]'s novel ''[[Bows Against the Barons]]''.

Sir Edward, Lord Wessex is a character in the 1973 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial, ''[[The Time Warrior]]'', portrayed by [[Alan Rowe]].
