'''Kimberlin Ann Brown''' (born June 29, 1961 in [[Hayward, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]], best known for her iconic role as [[Sheila Carter]] on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (May 1990 to May 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, August 2005 to January 2006) and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (May 1992 to October 2, 1998, April 2002 to November 2002, September 29, 2003 to October 10, 2003).

==Biography==
Brown has been married to Gary Pelzer since May 1991. They have two children, Alexes Marie (born 1994) and Nicholas.  They live in California and own an avocado farm.

Kimberlin started on ''The Young and the Restless'' in 1990 (after originally auditioning for the role of Cassandra Rawlins) and moved to ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' in 1992 playing Sheila on both soaps. 

While she left ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' in 1998, she continues to make special guest appearances. In 2002, her character killed off [[Hunter Tylo]]'s character, Dr. [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]] (although the character turned up alive when Tylo returned to the show in 2005). There was some irony involved, since Brown and Tylo had once been close friends then had a severe falling out after Brown and her husband sided with Tylo's husband [[Michael Tylo|Michael]] when the two Tylos were considering divorce. Brown testified that Hunter Tylo was an unfit mother. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In fall 2003, Brown made another special guest appearance to kidnap [[Ronn Moss]]'s character Ridge Forrester.

She portrayed Rachel Locke, mother of Livvie Locke ([[Kelly Monaco]]) on ''[[Port Charles]]'' from 1999-2001. In late 2004, Brown debuted in a recurring role of Dr. [[Paige Miller]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera, ''[[One Life to Live]]''. She exited the soap in 2005 when the soap could not match the salary ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' was offering in order for her to stay. She was replaced by [[Cady Huffman]] and [[Alexandra Neil]]. In 2005, Brown returned to the role of Sheila on ''The Young and the Restless'' after a long absence from the show.

In early 2006, she was released from her contract on ''The Young and the Restless'', though her character was still mentioned, from time to time.  When her character returned to ''The Young and the Restless'' later that year, however, she was not played by Brown.  It was explained that Sheila had undergone extensive plastic surgery to have her face reconstructed to look like [[Phyllis Summers Newman|Phyllis Newman]]. [[Michelle Stafford]] (who also plays Phyllis) took on the role, and played the dual roles of Sheila and Phyllis from December 2006 to February 2007. In a recent interview, Brown says the reason she didn't come back to play Sheila was because of an accident she had late last year.

In 2008, Brown starred in the film Proud American.  She also stars in the short upcoming film The Necklace.

Kimberlin had been asked to return to ''Y&amp;R'' early in 2010 for a storyline that was subsequently dropped.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blogtalkradio.com/show.aspx?userurl=olivia&amp;year=2010&amp;month=09&amp;day=24&amp;url=kimberlin-brown&lt;/ref&gt;  She will be taking on a short-term role as a judge on ''[[All My Children]]'' in October, in which she has now concluded.
