The '''1968  New South Wales  state election'''  was held on 24 February 1968. It  was conducted in single member constituencies with compulsory [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]] and  was held on boundaries created at a 1966 redistribution. The election was for all of the 94 seats in the  [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]].

==Redistribution==
An extensive redistribution of electoral boundaries was undertaken in 1966 by a commission consisting of Judge Amsberg of the [[District Court of New South Wales|District Court]], the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor-General]], G Prince and the [[New South Wales Electoral Commission|Electoral Commissioner]] J McDonald. Following  instructions from the government of [[Robin Askin]], the redistribution gave an increased weighting to the votes of electors in rural New South Wales . Of the 94 electorates, 48 were to be classified as &quot;urban&quot;  with an average enrollment of 27,531 and 46 were &quot;country&quot; with an average enrollment of 20,882. However, a continuing movement of population from rural to urban NSW meant that many of the &quot;country&quot; seats were effectively situated in the outskirts of Sydney, where the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] traditionally had strong electoral support. Four seats ([[Electoral district of Casino|Casino]], [[Electoral district of Cobar|Cobar]], [[Electoral district of Dulwich Hill|Dulwich Hill]] and [[Electoral district of Redfern|Redfern]]) were abolished and four new seats ([[Electoral district of Campbelltown|Campbelltown]], [[Electoral district of Corrimal|Corrimal]], [[Electoral district of Merrylands|Merrylands]] and [[Electoral district of Northcott|Northcott]]) were created . A further 9 seats, [[Electoral district of Ashfield-Croydon|Ashfield-Croydon]] ( renamed [[Electoral district of Ashfield|Ashfield]]), [[Electoral district of Concord|Concord]] ([[Electoral district of Yaralla|Yaralla]]), [[Electoral district of Hartley (New South Wales)|Hartley]] ([[Electoral district of Blue Mountains|Blue Mountains]]), [[Electoral district of Illawarra|Illawarra]] ([[Electoral district of Kembla|Kembla]]), [[Electoral district of Kurri Kurri|Kurri Kurri]] ([[Electoral district of Wallsend|Wallsend]]), [[Electoral district of Mudgee|Mudgee]] ([[Electoral district of Burrendong|Burrendong]]), [[Electoral district of Ryde|Ryde]] ([[Electoral district of Fuller|Fuller]]), [[Electoral district of Sturt (New South Wales)|Sturt]] ([[Electoral district of Broken Hill|Broken Hill]]) and [[Electoral district of Wollongong-Kembla|Wollongong-Kembla]] ([[Electoral district of Wollongong|Wollongong]]), were extensively changed and renamed. The notional net result of the redistribution was to reduce the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]'s representation by at least 5 and possibly 9 seats and to reduce the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] by 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= How the electorate changes will operate|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 16 April 1966 p16 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The redistribution was unsuccessfully opposed by the Labor Party with parliamentary walkouts, legal appeals and public rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Rally to protest electorate proposal|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 18 April 1966 p5 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
At the beginning of 1968, the Liberal/Country Party Coalition was perceived as a competent first-term government.  With the aid of a favourable redistribution, it appeared certain that the government would be returned and subsequently the campaign failed to generate significant public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 Million vote today|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 24 February 1968 p1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the term the government had controversially resolved the problem of cost over-runs and building delays at the [[Sydney Opera House]] by forcing the resignation of the architect, [[JÃ¸rn Utzon]]. However, this was seen by many as a positive action by the government &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mr Hughes and Mr Utzon|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 24 February 1968 p2 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. New government policies during the campaign included an increase in state aid for private schools, increased spending on hospitals and a consumer affairs agency to monitor prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 Million vote today|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 24 February 1968 p1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the coalition, Labor's leader and former Premier, [[Jack Renshaw]] had difficulty adjusting to a televised campaign and was unable to resonate with urban voters. He had also led a tired Labor government to defeat in the previous election 3 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Renshaw: Jack with Beanstalk and Giant|author= Evan Whitton |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 19 February 1968 p2 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Labor's campaign promises included four weeks annual leave for all employees on state controlled award wages, the restoration of the Sydney City Council, price controls for basic food items and state control of Credit Unions. Renshaw was unable to match the government's promises of aid for private schools, which was a difficult ideological question for Labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Renshaw: lists his priorities|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 19 February 1968 p8 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Prior to the election the Country Party had gained the seats of [[Electoral district of Bathurst|Bathurst]] from the Labor Party and [[Electoral district of Oxley (New South Wales)|Oxley]] from the Liberal Party at by-elections caused by the deaths of sitting members. There was a slight swing to the Labor Party in the two party preferred vote at the election. However, the effects of the redistribution resulted in a significant improvement in the position of the coalition government and changes in seats at the election reflected the effects of the re-distribution rather than a swing in voter sentiment. The government had a buffer of 6 seats in the new parliament:

* [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] 36 seats
* [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] 17 seats
* [[Australian Labor Party]] 39 seats
* Independent 2 seats

The DLP contested 42 seats but achieved less than 3% of the state-wide vote while the Communist party was reduced to 6 candidates who received negligible support. The [[New England New State Movement|New State Movement]], which had suffered a devastating defeat at a plebiscite on the formation of a new state in New England in 1967, contested 4 seats and gained 0.80% of the total vote but up to 35% in individual seats.

==Aftermath==
[[Robert Askin]] and [[Charles Cutler]] remained Premier and Deputy Premier throughout the term of the parliament. Renshaw was replaced as the Leader of the Labor Party by [[Pat Hills]] in December 1968. During the parliament there were 5 [[List of New South Wales state by-elections#Forty Second Parliament (1968-1971)|by-elections]].
