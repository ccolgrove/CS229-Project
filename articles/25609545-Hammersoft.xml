'''Disney XD''' is an American [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] television network, owned by the [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It is also a [[sister channel]] division of [[The Disney Channel]]. Disney XD mostly airs action-oriented [[children's television series|children's]] animated television series, with some live-action programming and movies aimed at male viewers age 6 to 18.

Disney XD airs original Disney XD content, such as ''[[Zeke and Luther]]'', ''[[Kickin' It]]'', ''[[I'm in the Band]]'', and ''[[Pair of Kings]]'' and some of Disney Channel's most popular programming, including recent and archived [[List of Disney Channel Original Series|original series]], such as ''[[The Suite Life of Zack and Cody]]'' and ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', as well as some [[List of Disney Channel Original Movies|made-for-TV movies]]. 

It is offered with Spanish language audio, either via a separate channel as part of a Spanish language network package sold by cable and satellite providers or a separate audio track with the [[second audio program|SAP]] option, depending on the system. The channel also offers a video-on-demand service to digital cable and IPTV subscribers, offering free programming.

==Overview==
The network launched in 2007 as an Internet channel for Disney and then relaunched on February 13, 2009 as a television channel, replacing [[Toon Disney]] and its evening programming block [[Jetix]], the latter of which targeted a similar audience as Disney XD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2009/02/09/daily65.html Disney Launches Disney XD Network, Web Site], ''Orlando Business Journal'', February 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/02/disney_xd_looks_good_in_debut Disney XD Looks Good in Debut], ''TV Week'', February 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Its target market is boys from 9 to 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney7-2008aug07,1,3536595.story |title = Disney to Target Boys with Rebranded Cable Channel|date=August 7, 2008|first=Dawn C.|last=Chmielewski|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate = 2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=disneyxdpr&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/08/toon_disney_rebrands_as_disney.php |title=Toon Disney Rebrands as Disney XD, Shifts Focus to Boys|date=August 7, 2008|first=Jon|last=Lafayette|publisher=TV Week |accessdate = 2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it also airs programming aimed at older audiences.

Like its predecessor Toon Disney, yet unlike sister network [[Disney Channel]], Disney XD is advertiser-supported and runs commercials for mostly non-Disney branded products during breaks, as well as network promos. Despite Disney XD's relationship to Disney Channel and airing some Disney Channel series, there is little cross-promotion of Disney Channel shows on the channel, though Disney Channel cross-promotes Disney XD programming within their promo breaks and has aired some of Disney XD's original programming. However, cross-promotion is more common for networks such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] or [[ESPN]].

According to [[Gary Marsh]], President of Entertainment for Disney Channel Worldwide, &quot;XD&quot; was chosen because is an [[emoticon]] for laughter. Marsh notes that &quot;the letter X has many cool associations&quot; and that &quot;the beauty of it is the audience can imbue it with all sorts of positive attributes.&quot; Coincidentally though, the name &quot;Disney XD&quot; was previously used as the name for an online media player and interactive web portal on the [[Disney.com]] website, which in that case stood for [[Disney Xtreme Digital]].

Since Disney XD's launch in the U.S., localized versions have launched in other countries, typically replacing international versions of Toon Disney or Jetix, depending on which network was available in the particular market.

==Programming==
{{update section|date=December 2011}}
{{See also|List of programs broadcast by Disney XD}}
{{See also|List of movies broadcast by Disney XD}}
Disney XD broadcasts original series such as ''[[Aaron Stone]]'' and ''[[Zeke and Luther]]'', as well as reruns of older [[Disney Channel]] and [[Jetix]] shows, as well as some from other channels. A large amount of the channel's schedule consists of action-oriented animated series, like ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', and several others. The channel airs a limited amount of Disney Channel series, particularly ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' (for which Disney XD had aired premieres of first-run episodes before Disney Channel, though Disney Channel Original Productions still produces the series, however, as of the episode &quot;Wizard of Odd&quot;, first-run episodes went back to Disney Channel), ''[[Cory in the House]]'', ''[[The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody]]'' and its spin-off ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'' had also been run. Upcoming original series set to debut include the Marvel Comics-produced animated series ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://disneyxdmedianet.com/DNR/2010/doc/DC_DXD_Upfront_2010.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable aspect of Disney XD's original series is that they tend to feature predominately male casts, and as such, its original programs feature very few females as main characters (with most live-action originals typically featuring only one female in its main cast) in comparison to Disney Channel's original programs, which tend to feature an equal or nearly equal amount of main characters of either gender. New episodes of live-action original series are usually aired on Monday nights, while new episodes of animated original series air on Saturday mornings. In addition, Disney XD airs movies, but unlike Disney Channel, movies are typically not aired in prime time; instead, films generally air at 5&amp;nbsp;pm ET with double features airing a few times a week. The channel's first (and so far only) made-for-TV movie, ''[[Skyrunners]]'', premiered on November 27, 2009.

In addition to full-length live-action and animated original series, the channel also debuts short series similar to those seen on Disney Channel during commercial breaks, such as ''Moises Rules'', ''The Next X'', and its spin-off ''The Next Winter X''. These shows often follow other network shows and last about two to three minutes or sometimes fifteen minutes, with the exception of a few short-form series. Often, these shows are televised in the last two minutes of the program, with the exception of the Disney XD Shortstop, or following the ending of a movie. [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'' provides youth-oriented sports updates periodically between shows. Edited segments of ABC's ''[[Wipeout (2008 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'' are also broadcast.

==Disney XD HD==
[[File:Disney XD HD.png|thumb|right|Disney XD HD logo since 2009]]
Disney XD HD is the branding used for the [[high-definition television|high-definition]] feed of the network. It is offered on some cable providers, as well as both satellite providers and telco IPTV providers in the Disney/ABC television networks preferred HD picture format of [[720p]]. The high-definition feed airs a limited amount of programming in high definition, mainly Disney XD's original programming as well as certain films and some episodes of Disney Channel series made after 2009. A high-definition simulcast of an international version of Disney XD HD in the [[Netherlands]] launched on April 15, 2010 and in Latin America launched in 2011. [[Disney XD UK]] has released Disney XD HD on October 18, 2010.  On June 1, 2011, [[Disney XD (Canada)|Disney XD]] Canada created an HD feed along with its launch. [[Dish Network]] currently{{When|date=November 2011}} does not carry the HD version of Disney XD due to a dispute with Disney/ABC.

==International channels==
Disney XD, similarly born of a merger between Jetix and Toon Disney, is also available on cable systems in France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latin America, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Spain and United Kingdom. A [[Disney XD (Canada)|Canadian channel]] has launched on June 1. &lt;ref name=&quot;XD 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=ASTRAL LAUNCHES DISNEY XD JUNE 1, 2011 â KIDS' SPECIALTY CHANNEL AND MULTI-PLATFORM BRAND TO DEBUT ACROSS CANADA|publisher=CNW|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2011/11/c2095.html|date=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia &amp; CIS countries was launched January 1, 2011.

===Latin America===
{{main|Disney XD (Latin America)}}
As Jetix, the channel aired mostly animated series, including the [[Jetix Animation Concepts]] and [[Disney Channel Original Series]]. Some live-action series like ''[[Power Rangers]]'' or local ''[[Casi Ãngeles]]'' were also aired. Third-party movies and series were also aired. The ''Fox Kids World Cup'' was re-named ''Jetix Kids World Cup'' and later just ''Jetix Cup'' and became smaller, with only Latin American countries playing. Eventually, Jetix started airing old series from [[Disney Channel Latin America|Disney Channel]], series that had been dropped or canceled from that channel. Those series include ''[[Phil of the Future]]'', ''[[Dave the Barbarian]]'', ''[[Even Stevens]]'' and some others. By 2008, most of the [[Jetix]] programming included ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[Pucca (TV series)|Pucca]]'', ''[[Dinosaur King#Anime 2|Dinosaur King]]'' , and ''[[Power Rangers]]''. Those series took most of the schedule of the channel. The channel also premiered a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]], ''[[Camp Rock]]''.

Late in 2008, ''Disney Channel Worldwide'' stated that Jetix Latin America, would become Disney XD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://disneyxdmedianet.com&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Jetix Cup'' was renamed ''Disney Soccer Cup'' to fit with the Disney XD re-branding.

Finally, Disney and ESPN Media Networks announced on May 2009 that Jetix would become Disney XD on July 3, 2009.&lt;ref name=date&gt;[http://www.anmtvla.com/2009/05/exclusivo-anmtv-disney-xd-ya-tiene.html Exclusivo ANMTV: Disney XD ya tiene fecha de estreno â Anime, Manga y TV]. Anmtvla.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-09].&lt;/ref&gt; The last series premiering on the channel were ''[[Monster Buster Club]]'' and ''Quantum Ray''. The promos of Disney XD showed different subjects of the new channel (like guitars, skates, video games or even shoes) appearing in front of the Jetix character on its own city.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
{{main|Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)}}
A one-hour timeshift of Disney XD is also available. [[Disney XD +1]] is available on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media]], and [[TalkTalk TV]] in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland on Sky and [[Magnet Networks]].

Beach Soccer was a joint initiative between [[England Beach Soccer]] and Disney XD, holding Beach Soccer Roadshows across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themarketer.co.uk/whats-new/new-campaign/disney-channel-launches-beach-soccer-campaign/ Disney channel launches beach soccer campaign â The Marketer magazine]. Themarketer.co.uk (2009-05-25). Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  An artificial beach was built in each of the five locations, and beach soccer tournaments were held in Southampton, Nottingham, Minehead and Stockport, culminating in a beach soccer final in Oxford Street, London on Saturday August 29, 2009. Leading the programme was the England National Beach Soccer squad themselves, who were on hand to teach skills and drills and oversee the dayâs coaching sessions.

British skateboarder [[Pete King]] skated his way across the UK to help get kids out and skateboarding as part of the launch of Disney XD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.mpora.com/watch/UK8QHQJFE/ Pete King skates across the UK for the Disney XD Challenge // Skateboarding Videos]. Video.mpora.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; From Landâs End to John OâGroats, Pete King kick-flipped and tail-slided through the UK executing daredevil tricks whilst conducting master classes for kids looking to become the next British skateboarding stars. Kingâs challenge was part of a series of challenges which Disney XD set for UK personalities to help inspire kids to try new activities. Viewers were able to watch the highlights of Kingâs journey on Disney XD in October 2009.
Also, two shows have been premiered in the UK before the US, called ''Football Funnies'' and ''Goalmouth''

===France===

The channel is available in France, Monaco, [[Netherlands]], Belgium, [[Luxembourg]], Switzerland, [[Madagascar]], RÃ©union, Mauritius and [[Caribbean Sea]] ([[Antilles]], French Guiana, [[Guadeloupe]], Martinique). The old address of the Jetix website (''www.jetixtv.fr'') now redirects to the Disney XD website. Sometimes,a clock is often shown during a program such as ''Phineas and Ferb''.
