The '''Fremont Cannon''' is the [[trophy]] awarded to the winner of the '''Battle for Nevada''', an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played annually by the [[Nevada Wolf Pack football]] team of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (Nevada) and the [[UNLV Rebels football]] team of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).  The trophy was built in 1970 and is a replica of a 19th century [[Howitzer]] cannon that accompanied American explorer and politician [[John C. FrÃ©mont]] on an expedition to [[Nevada]] in the mid 19th century.  Originally fired following a [[touchdown]] by the team in possession of the cannon, it has been inoperable since 1999.  The wooden carriage is painted the school color of the team in possession, blue for Nevada and red for UNLV.  The trophy is the heaviest and most expensive in college football.

The first game between the teams was in [[1969 college football season|1969]] with Nevada defeating UNLV.  The following year the cannon was built and UNLV became the first team to win the cannon.  Since then the cannon has changed hands twelve times with the current holder being Nevada, following a 37-0 victory in [[2011 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2011]] at [[Mackay Stadium]] in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]].  The 37-0 Nevada win in 2011 was the first shutout in the history of the rivalry.  Nevada has held the cannon for seven years straight, following a five year reign by UNLV.  Nevada has won 22 out of the 37 games played between the two teams for the cannon.

In 1967 Bill Ireland was hired by Nevada Southern University (the predecessor to UNLV) to coach their new football team,&lt;ref name=&quot;bill ireland obit&quot; /&gt; and by 1969 came up with the idea to have a trophy as a symbol of the rivalry between the two schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;love of the game&quot; /&gt;  Ireland was the first football coach of the UNLV Rebels,&lt;ref name=&quot;unique prize&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2003/oct/03/winner-of-rivalry-nabs-a-unique-prize/|title=Winner of rivalry nabs a unique prize|last= Christensen|first=Nick|date=Oct. 3, 2003|publisher=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[alumnus]] and former coach of Nevada.&lt;ref name=&quot;bill ireland obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/8860432.html|title=Bill Ireland, Longtime Nevada Coach, Dies in Reno|date=Aug 1, 2007|publisher=KOLO TV|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cannon was donated by [[Kennecott Utah Copper|Kennecott Copper]] and is a replica of a [[howitzer]] cannon that explorer [[John C.

The two schools first played each other on [[Thanksgiving Day]], [[1969 in sports|1969]], with the Wolf Pack winning 30-28, however construction of the cannon had yet to be completed.  The first competition for the cannnon was in [[1970 in sports|1970]] when the Rebels won 42-30 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon stats&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/oct/03/elevator-fremont-cannon-edition/|title=The Elevator: Fremont Cannon edition|last= Kantowski|first=Ron|date=Oct. 3, 2009 |publisher=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[1978 NCAA Division I-A football season|1978]], following Nevada's first victory over UNLV in four seasons, [[Chris Ault]] convinced security at [[McCarran International Airport]] to allow the team to disassemble the cannon and take it as [[carry-on luggage]] back to Reno.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannon stats&quot; /&gt;  The team had to figure out how to break down the cannon, a task that was usually done by the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]], which Nevada did not have in 1978.

The Fremont Cannon was refurbished by the UNLV athletics department at a cost of $1,500 in [[2000 NCAA Division I-A football season|2000]] following damage after a UNLV victory celebration wherein fans and players attempted to lift the cannon and dropped it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fremont Cannon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rgj.com/article/20101002/NEWS/10020323/Fremont-Cannon-Rolls-through-history-but-hard-to-roll|title=Fremont Cannon: Rolls through history, but hard to roll|last=Murray |first=Chris|date=October 2, 2010|publisher=Reno-Gazette Journal|accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While being refurbished, UNLV officials found inscriptions inside the cannon, including &quot;University of Notta Lotta Victories.&quot;  Traditionally, the team possessing the cannon would fire it each time they scored a [[touchdown]] during the rivalry game;&lt;ref name=&quot;unique prize&quot; /&gt; however, the cannon has not been fired since 2000 due to the damage it received when it was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fremont Cannon&quot; /&gt;

==History of the rivalry==

Students of Nevada's two public universities share a mutual disdain for each other, as evidenced by the numerous blue &quot;FUNLV&quot; and red &quot;FUNR&quot; shirts (UNR being shorthand for University of Nevada, Reno) at the stadium on rivalry days. Many Nevada students hail from Las Vegas and view UNLV as a glorified community college; UNLV students see Nevada as an overrated, stodgy institution in an uncultured part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwcconnection.com/2010/10/1/1725220/the-fremont-canon-history-of-the-battle-for-nevada-rivalry&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Wolf Pack coach [[Jeff Horton]] left Nevada after one season to coach for UNLV in what is referred to as the &quot;Red Defection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sagebrush&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nevadasagebrush.com/blog/2007/09/25/ault-sees-rivalry-through-knowing-eyes/|title=Ault sees rivalry through knowing eyes|last=Hylton|first=Garrett|date=September 25, 2007|publisher=The Nevada Sagebrush|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rivalry is heated inside the stadium as well. Sam Boyd Stadium and Mackay Stadium are two of the few NCAA institutions to sell alcohol on game day. This, combined with the heated nature of the rivalry has resulted in numerous fights in the stands. In 1995, UNLV players allegedly started a pre-game brawl, which prompted the Wolf Pack to run up the score in their 55-32 victory against UNLV. After the game, UNLV player Quincy Sanders threw his helmet in the direction of Nevada head coach Chris Ault. &lt;ref name=&quot;returning home&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1999/Oct-01-Fri-1999/sports/12063192.html|title=Returning Home|last= Anderson |first=Mark|date=October 01, 1999|publisher=Reno Gazette-Journal|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 a Nevada fan was charged with [[Battery (crime)|battery]] for throwing a half full plastic [[beer]] bottle at UNLV head coach [[John Robinson (coach)|John Robinson]], striking him near his head.&lt;ref name=&quot;beer can&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2003/Oct-21-Tue-2003/sports/22413093.html|title=UNR fan denies hitting Robinson|last=Sonner|first=Scott|date=October 21, 2003|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 2010, Nevada announced that they will join the [[Mountain West Conference]] starting in either 2011 or 2012; their entry was later confirmed for 2012. Since UNLV has been in the Mountain West Conference since 1999, the annual rivalry game will once again be a conference game. The last meeting of the two schools as conference rivals was in 1995, when both schools were members of the [[Big West Conference]].&lt;ref name=MtnWestMove&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5474774 |title=Nevada, Fresno State move to MWC |last= |first= |date=August 19, 2010 |publisher=ESPN.com News Services |accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game results==

''Nevada victories are colored &lt;font color=&quot;#003366&quot;&gt;ââ&lt;/font&gt; blue.  UNLV victories are colored &lt;font color=&quot;#C10202&quot;&gt;ââ&lt;/font&gt; scarlet.  Ties are white.''
