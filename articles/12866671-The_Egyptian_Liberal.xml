'''Al-Aqsa Mosque''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]:&lt;big&gt;Ø§ÙÙØ³Ø¬Ø¯ Ø§ÙØ§ÙØµÙ&lt;/big&gt; ''al-Masjid al-Aqsa'', {{IPA-ar|ÊÃ¦lËmÃ¦sÊÉªd Ã¦lËÊÉqsË¤É|IPA|ArAqsaMosque.ogg}}, &quot;the Farthest Mosque,&quot;) also known as '''al-Aqsa''', is the third [[Holiest sites in Islam (Sunni)|holiest site in Sunni Islam]] and is located in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. The site on which the silver domed mosque sits, along with the [[Dome of the Rock]], also referred to as ''al-Haram ash-Sharif'' or &quot;Noble Sanctuary,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schieck, Robert (2008) in Geographical Dimension of Islamic Jerusalem, Cambridge Scholars Publishing; See also Omar, Abdallah (2009) al-Madkhal li-dirasat al-Masjid al-Aqsa al-Mubarak, Beirut: Dar al-Kotob al-Ilmiyaah; Also by the same author the Atlas of Al-Aqsa Mosque (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Temple Mount]], the holiest site in [[Judaism]], the place where the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] is generally accepted to have stood. Muslims believe that [[Muhammad]] was transported from the [[Masjid al-Haram|Sacred Mosque]] in [[Mecca]] to al-Aqsa during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]]. [[Hadith|Islamic tradition]] holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the seventeenth month after the [[Hijra (Islam)|emigration]], when God directed him to turn towards the [[Ka'aba]].

The al-Aqsa Mosque is believed by Muslims to have been built in ancient times, 40 years after the construction of the [[Kaabah]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}  In the seventh century its walls were renovated by the [[Rashidun]] caliph [[Umar]], who also built a small building to the south. A major rebuilding of the Mosque Compound was commissioned by the [[Ummayad]] caliph [[Abd al-Malik]], and included the addition of the basement, gates and other structures such as the Dome of the Rock. The work was completed and finished by his son [[al-Walid]] in 705&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=Al-Aqsa Mosque |url=http://www.noblesanctuary.com/AQSAMosque.html |publisher=Noble Sanctuary Online Guide. |accessdate=7 September 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ruling dynasties of the [[Islamic Caliphate]] also constructed additions within al-Aqsa Mosqueâs enclave, such as its [[dome]], [[facade]], its ''[[minbar]]'', [[minaret]]s and the interior structure. When the [[First Crusade|Crusader]]s captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used parts of al-Aqsa Mosque as either residences, stables or churches, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by [[Saladin]]. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the [[Ayyubid]]s, [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]]s, the [[Supreme Muslim Council]], and [[Jordan]]. Today, the Old City is under [[Israel]]i control, but the mosque remains under the administration of the Palestinian-led Islamic ''[[waqf]]''.

==Etymology==
''Masjid al-Aqsa'' translates from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into [[English language|English]] as &quot;the farthest mosque.&quot; The name refers to a chapter of the [[Qur'an]] called &quot;[[Isra and Mi'raj|The Night Journey]]&quot; in which it is said that [[Muhammad]] traveled from Mecca to &quot;the farthest mosque,&quot; and then up to [[Heaven]] on a heavenly creature called ''[[Buraq|al-Buraq al-Sharif]]''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Atlas Travel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem |publisher=Atlas Travel and Tourist Agency |url=http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/al_aqsa_mosque.html |accessdate=29 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lailat al Miraj |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC MMVIII |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml |accessdate=29 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Ottoman conquest of Jerusalem in the 16th-century, &quot;''al-Masjid al-Aqsa''&quot; referred not only to the mosque, but to the entire Noble Sanctuary (Temple Mount). The sanctuary complex has since come to be known as ''al-Haram ash-Sharif'', and the mosque itself as ''al-Jami' al-Aqsa'' (al-Aqsa Mosque).&lt;ref name=Necipoglup85&gt;Necipoglu, 1998, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Aqsa Mosque as a whole is confused with a particular building within it, also known as al-Jami' al-Aqsa or al-Qibli or Masjid al-Jumah or al-Mughata, these names refer to the southern building with the silver lead dome.

For centuries, ''al-Masjid al-Aqsa'' referred not only to the mosque, but to the entire sacred sanctuary. This changed during the period of Ottoman rule (c. early 16th century to 1918) when the sanctuary complex came to be known as ''al Haram ash-Sharif'', and the mosque founded by Umar came to be known as ''al-Jami' al-Aqsa'' or al-Aqsa Mosque.&lt;ref name=Necipoglup85&gt;{{cite book|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on the Visual Culture of the Islamic World|first1=Sabri|last1=Jarrar|editor=GÃ¼lru NecipoÄlu|edition=Illustrated, annotated|publisher=BRILL|year=1998|isbn=9004110844, 9789004110847|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FG6ZlkRjD2IC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=aqsa+haram+sharif&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=aqsa%20haram%20sharif&amp;f=false|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-construction===
The al-Aqsa Mosque is located on the [[Temple Mount]], referred to by Muslims today as the &quot;Haram al-Sharif&quot; (&quot;The Noble Sanctuary&quot;), an enclosure expanded by King [[Herod the Great]] beginning in 20&amp;nbsp;BCE. The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the [[Tyropoeon Valley|Tyropoeon]] and [[Kidron Valley|Kidron]] valleys. At the time of the [[Second Temple]], the present site of the mosque was occupied by the [[Royal Stoa (Jerusalem)|Royal Stoa]], a [[basilica]] running the southern wall of the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Netzer, 2008, pp.161-171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|sacking of Jerusalem]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 70&amp;nbsp;CE. [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] built a Christian [[Church (building)|church]] on the site in the 530s which was consecrated to the [[Virgin Mary]] and named &quot;Church of Our Lady.&quot; The church was later destroyed by [[Khosrau II]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid emperor]], in the early 7th-century and left in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Jerusalem (A.D. 71-1099) |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Analysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from [[Lebanon Cedar|Cedar of Lebanon]] and [[cypress]]. Radiocarbon dating indicates a large range of ages, some as old as 9th-century BCE, showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings.&lt;ref&gt;N. Liphschitz, G. Biger, G. Bonani and W. Wolfli, Comparative Dating Methods: Botanical Identification and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C Dating of Carved Panels and Beams from the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', (1997) 24, 1045â1050.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction by the Umayyads===
[[Image:Al-Aqsa Mosque by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|The mosque along the southern wall of the The Noble Sanctuary]]

It is known that the current construction of the al-Aqsa Mosque is dated to the early Ummayad period of rule in [[Palestine]]. Architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], referring to a testimony by [[Arculf]], a [[Gaul|Gallic]] monk, during his pilgrimage to [[Palestine]] in 679â82, notes the possibility that the second [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of [[Mu'awiyah I]], and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elad&quot;&gt;Elad, Amikam. (1995). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=CDz_yctbQVgC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=Aqsa+Mosque+construction&amp;sig=ACfU3U18kr7-hEXqRvqOKs-Jg3Pk2_CeBg#PPA29,M1 Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage]'' BRILL, pp.29â43. ISBN 90-04-10010-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to several Muslim scholars, including [[Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi|Mujir ad-Din]], [[al-Suyuti]], and [[al-Muqaddasi]], the mosque was reconstructed and expanded by the [[caliph]] Abd al-Malik in 690 along with the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elad&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;le Strange&quot;&gt;le Strange, Guy. (1890). ''Palestine under the Moslems'', pp.80â98.&lt;/ref&gt; Guy le Strange claims that Abd al-Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;le Strange&quot;/&gt; In planning his magnificent project on the Temple
Mount, which in effect would turn the entire complex into the Haram al-Sharif (&quot;the Noble Sanctuary&quot;), Abd al-Malik wanted to replace the slipshod structure described by Arculf with a more sheltered structure enclosing the ''[[qibla]]'', a necessary element in his grand scheme. However, the entire Haram al-Sharif was meant to represent a mosque. How much he modified the aspect of the earlier building is unknown, but the length of the new building is indicated by the existence of traces of a bridge leading from the Umayyad palace just south of the western part of the complex. The bridge would have spanned the street running just outside the southern wall of the Haram al-Sharif to give direct access to the mosque. Direct access from palace to mosque was a well-known feature in the Umayyad period, as evidenced at various early sites. Abd al-Malik shifted the central axis of the mosque some {{convert|40|m|ft|sp=us}} westward, in accord with his overall plan for the Haram al-Sharif. The earlier axis is represented in the structure by the niche still known as the &quot;mihrab of 'Umar.&quot; In placing emphasis on the [[Dome of the Rock]], Abd al-Malik had his architects align his new al-Aqsa Mosque according to the position of the [[Foundation Stone|Rock]], thus shifting the main northâsouth axis of the Noble Sanctuary, a line running through the [[Dome of the Chain]] and the Mihrab of Umar.&lt;ref name=&quot;GandA&quot;&gt;Grafman and Ayalon, 1998, [http://www.archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/9702/doc/DPC1569.pdf pp.1â15].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Creswell, while referring to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, [[al-Walid I]], reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque over a period of six months to a year, using workers from [[Damascus]]. Most scholars agree that the mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713â14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from the dome of the Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elad&quot;/&gt; The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.&lt;ref name=&quot;GandA&quot;/&gt;

===Earthquakes and re-constructions===
In 746, the al-Aqsa Mosque was damaged in an earthquake, four years before [[as-Saffah]] overthrew the Ummayads and established the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The second Abbasid caliph [[Abu Ja'far al-Mansur]] declared his intent to repair the mosque in 753, and he had the gold and silver plaques that covered the gates of the mosque removed and turned into [[dinar]]s and [[dirham]]s to finance the reconstruction which ended in 771. A second earthquake damaged most of al-Mansur's repairs, excluding those made in the southern portion in 774.&lt;ref name=&quot;le Strange&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt; In 780, the successor caliph [[Al-Mahdi|Muhammad al-Mahdi]] had it rebuilt, but curtailed its length and increased its breadth.&lt;ref name=&quot;le Strange&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL&quot;/&gt; Al-Mahdi's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffers, 2004, pp.95â96.&lt;/ref&gt; In 985, Jerusalem-born [[Arab]] geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] recorded that the renovated mosque had &quot;fifteen naves and fifteen gates&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Saladin Minbar-Aqsa.JPG|thumb|right|The doors of the [[Saladin]] Minbar, early 1900s. The ''[[minbar]]'' was built on [[Nur al-Din]]'s orders, but installed by Saladin]]

In 1033, there was another earthquake, severely damaging the mosque. The [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]] rebuilt and completely renovated the mosque between 1034 and 1036. The number of naves was drastically reduced from fifteen to seven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt; Az-Zahir built the four arcades of the central hall and aisle, which presently serve as the foundation of the mosque. The central aisle was double the width of the other aisles and had a large gable roof upon which the domeâmade of woodâwas constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elad&quot;/&gt; Persian geographer, [[Nasir Khusraw]] describes the Aqsa Mosque during a visit in 1047: 

''The Haram Area (Noble Sanctuary) lies in the eastern part of the [[Jerusalem|city]]; and through the [[bazaar]] of this (quarter) you enter the Area by a great and beautiful gateway ([[Dargah]])... After passing this gateway, you have on the right two great colonnades ([[Riwaq]]), each of which has nine-and-twenty marble pillars, whose capitals and bases are of colored marbles, and the joints are set in lead. Above the pillars rise arches, that are constructed, of masonry, without mortar or cement, and each arch is constructed of no more than five or six blocks of stone. These colonnades lead down to near the [[Maqsurah]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/nasir.htm |title=The travels of Nasir-i-Khusrau to Jerusalem, 1047 C.E |publisher=Homepages.luc.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem was captured by the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s in 1099, during the [[First Crusade]]. Instead of destroying the mosqueâwhich they called &quot;Solomon's Temple&quot;âthe Crusaders used it as a royal palace and as a stable for horses. In 1119, it was transformed into the headquarters for the [[Knights Templar|Templar Knights]]. During this period, the mosque underwent some structural changes, including the expansion of its northern porch, and the addition of an [[apse]] and a dividing wall. A new cloister and church were also built at the site, along with various other structures.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, 2001, p.91.&lt;/ref&gt; The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building; the western currently serves as the women's mosque and the eastern as the [[Islamic Museum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Ayyubid]]s under the leadership of [[Saladin]] reconquered Jerusalem following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|siege of 1187]], several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al-Aqsa Mosque. In order to prepare the mosque for [[Friday prayer]]s, within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al-Aqsa removed, the floors covered with precious carpets, and its interior scented with rosewater and incense.&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Lee.

ISBN 0823942171&lt;/ref&gt; Saladin's predecessorâthe [[Zengid]] sultan [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur al-Din]]âhad commissioned the construction of a new ''[[minbar]]'' or &quot;pulpit&quot; made of [[ivory]] and wood in 1168â69, but it was completed after his death; Nur ad-Din's ''minbar'' was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin.&lt;ref name=Maddenp230/&gt; The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus, [[al-Mu'azzam]], built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218. In 1345, the [[Mamluk]]s under al-Kamil Shaban added two naves and two gates to the mosque's eastern side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s assumed power in 1517, they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included the building of the [[Fountain of Qasim Pasha]] (1527), the restoration of the [[Pool of Raranj]], and the building of three free-standing domesâthe most notable being the [[Dome of the Prophet]] built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the [[List of Ottoman Sultans|sultan]]s themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;AG07&quot;&gt;[http://www.aqsa.org.uk/MULTIMEDIA/AlAqsaGuide/tabid/82/language/en-GB/Default.aspx Al-Aqsa Guide] Friends of Al-Aqsa 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;AG07&quot;/&gt;

===Modern era===
{{See also|Al-Aqsa Intifada}}

[[Image:Al aqsa moschee 2.jpg|thumb|right|The dome of the mosque in 1982. It was made of aluminum (and looked like silver), but replaced with its original lead plating in 1983]]

The first renovation in the 20th-century occurred in 1922, when the [[Supreme Muslim Council]] under [[Amin al-Husayni]] (the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]) commissioned [[Turkey|Turkish]] architect Ahmet Kemalettin Bey to restore al-Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts. The council also commissioned [[United Kingdom|British]] architects, [[Egypt]]ian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924â25 by Kemalettin. The renovations included reinforcing the mosque's ancient Ummayad foundations, rectifying the interior columns, replacing the beams, erecting a [[scaffolding]], conserving the [[arch]]es and drum of the main dome's interior, rebuilding the southern wall, and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete. The renovations also revealed Fatimid-era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with [[plasterwork]]. The arches were decorated with gold and green-tinted [[gypsum]] and their timber tie beams were replaced with [[brass]]. A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Necipogulu96&quot;&gt;Necipogulu, 1996, pp.149â153.&lt;/ref&gt; Severe damage was caused by the 1927 and 1937 earthquakes, but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:AlAqsaFromKotel.JPG|thumb|left|The mosque seen from the [[Western Wall]] plaza, 2005.]]

On August&amp;nbsp;21,&amp;nbsp;1969, a fire occurred inside al-Aqsa Mosque that gutted the southeastern wing of the mosque. Among other things, the fire destroyed Saladin's ''minbar''.&lt;ref name=Maddenp230&gt;Madden, 2002, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, [[Palestinians]] blamed the Israeli authorities for the fire, and some Israelis blamed [[Fatah]], alleging they had started the fire so as to blame the Israelis and provoke hostility. However, the fire was started by neither Fatah nor Israel, but a tourist from [[Australia]] named [[Denis Michael Rohan]]. Rohan was a member of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian sect known as the [[Worldwide Church of God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Burning of Al-Aqsa |work=[[Time Magazine]] |page=1 |date=29 August 1969 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901289,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hoped that by burning down al-Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]], making way for the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount.

In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both members of the [[Gush Emunim Underground]], plotted to blow up the al-Aqsa mosque and the [[Dome of the Rock]]. Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the [[Third Temple|Third Temple of Jerusalem]] would be built on the location of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Dumper, 2002, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, 2001, pp.98â99.&lt;/ref&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;15,&amp;nbsp;1988, during the [[First Intifada]], [[Israeli troops]] fired [[rubber bullet]]s and [[tear gas]] at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/2ee9468747556b2d85256cf60060d2a6/03a0ba144d71e526852573700066e774 OpenDocument Letter] Dated 18 January 1988 from the Permanent Observer for the Palestine Liberation Organization to the United Nations Office at Geneva Addressed to the Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights Ramlawi, Nabil.

[[File:Al Aqsa.jpg|thumb|right|The silver-colored dome consists of lead sheeting]]

Unlike the [[Dome of the Rock]], which reflects classical Byzantine architecture, the Al-Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonen, 2003, p.95.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al-Malik. The present-day dome was built by az-Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead [[enamelwork]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elad&quot;/&gt; In 1969, the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with [[anodized aluminum]] instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting. In 1983, the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az-Zahir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archnet&quot;&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=475 Al-Aqsa Mosque Restoration] Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Aqsa's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the ''mihrab'' during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque at [[Sousse]] (850).&lt;ref&gt;Necipogulu, 1998, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the ''trateggio'' technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archnet&quot;/&gt;

===Minarets===
The mosque has four [[minaret]]s on the southern, northern and western sides. The first minaret, known as al-Fakhariyya Minaret, was built in 1278 on the southwestern corner of the mosque, on the orders of the [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Lajin]]. It was named after Fakhr al-Din al-Khalili, the father of Sharif al-Din Abd al-Rahman who supervised the building's construction. It was built in the traditional [[Syria]]n style, with a square-shaped base and shaft, divided by moldings into three floors above which two lines of [[muqarnas]] decorate the ''[[muezzin]]'s'' balcony. The niche is surrounded by a square chamber that ends in a lead-covered stone dome.&lt;ref&gt;Menashe, 2004, p.334.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghawanima Minaret-Aqsa.JPG|thumb|left|The Ghawanima Minaret, 1900]]

The second, known as the Ghawanima minaret, was built at the northwestern corner of the Noble Sanctuary in 1297â98 by architect Qadi Sharaf al-Din al-Khalili, also on the orders of the Sultan Lajin. Six stories high, it is the tallest minaret of the Noble Sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, Steven. ''Views of Jerusalem and the Holy Land''. Rizzoli, 2003. ISBN 0847825116&lt;/ref&gt; The tower is almost entirely made of stone, apart from a [[timber]] canopy over the ''[[muezzin]]'s'' balcony. Because of its firm structure, the Ghawanima minaret has been nearly untouched by earthquakes. The minaret is divided into several stories by stone molding and [[stalactite]] galleries. The first two stories are wider and form the base of the tower. The additional four stories are surmounted by a cylindrical drum and a bulbous dome. The stairway is externally located on the first two floors, but becomes an internal spiral structure from the third floor until it reaches the ''muezzin's'' balcony.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL1&quot;&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=5550 Ghawanima Minaret] Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1329, [[Tankiz]]âthe Mamluk governor of Syriaâordered the construction of a third minaret called the Bab al-Silsila Minaret located on the western border of the al-Aqsa Mosque. This minaret, possibly replacing an earlier [[Umayyad]] minaret, is built in the traditional Syrian square tower type and is made entirely out of stone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=5548 Bab al-Silsila Minaret] Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 16th-century, it has been tradition that the best ''muezzin'' (&quot;reciter&quot;) of the ''[[adhan]]'' (the call to prayer), is assigned to this minaret because the first call to each of the five daily prayers is raised from it, giving the signal for the ''muezzins'' of mosques throughout Jerusalem to follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, 2009, p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last and most notable minaret was built in 1367, and is known as [[Minaret of Israel|Minarat al-Asbat]]. It is composed of a cylindrical stone shaft (built later by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s), which springs up from a rectangular Mamluk-built base on top of a triangular transition zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asbat&quot;/&gt; The shaft narrows above the ''muezzin's'' balcony, and is dotted with circular windows, ending with a [[bulbous]] dome. The dome was reconstructed after the [[Jordan Valley earthquake of 1927]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Asbat&quot;&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=5551 Bab al-Asbat Minaret] Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no minarets in the eastern portion of the mosque. However, in 2006, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II of Jordan]] announced his intention to build a fifth minaret overlooking the Mount of Olives. The King Hussein Minaret is planned to be the tallest structure in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Farrell|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,251-2403700,00.html/|title=Minaret that can't rise above politics|work=The Times|date=2006-10-14|accessdate=2011-07-06|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aaron|last=Klein|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3360707,00.html|title=Israel allows minaret over Temple Mount|work=YNet|date=2007-02-04|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facade and porch===
[[File:Front of Al-Aqsa.jpg|thumb|The [[facade]] and porch of the mosque. They were constructed and expanded by the [[Fatimid]]s, the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s, the [[Mamluk]]s and the [[Ayyubid]]s]]

The [[facade]] of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[al-Mustansir]]. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The [[Crusades|Crusader]]s damaged the facade during their era of rule in Palestine, but it was restored and renovated by the [[Ayyubid]]s. One addition was the facade's covering with tiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;&gt;Ma'oz, Moshe and Nusseibeh, Sari. (2000).

The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-al-aqsa-mosque.htm Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem] Sacred Destinations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The porch is located at the top of the facade. The central bays of the porch were built by the [[Knights Templar]] during the [[First Crusade]], but Saladin's nephew [[al-Mu'azzam]] ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nusseibeh&quot;/&gt;

===Interior===
The al-Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of [[hypostyle]] [[nave]]s with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL&quot;&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=36 Al-Aqsa Mosque] Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 121 [[stained glass]] windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras. About a fourth of them were restored in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Necipogulu96&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Aqsa 1.jpg|thumb|left|Interior view of the mosque showing the central naves and columns]]

The mosque's interior is supported by 45 [[column]]s, 33 of which are [[white marble]] and 12 of stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;LHL&quot;/&gt; The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted. The remaining four rows are better proportioned. The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds: those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed, while those under the dome are of the [[Corinthian order]],&lt;ref name=&quot;LHL&quot;/&gt; and made from [[Italy|Italian]] white marble. The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket-shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket-shaped, but smaller and better proportioned. The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave, which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing.&lt;ref name=&quot;LHL&quot;&gt;[http://www.lifeintheholyland.com/al_aqsa_mosque.htm Al-Aqsa Mosque] Life in the Holy Land.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great portion of the mosque is covered with [[whitewash]], but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with [[mosaic]]s and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;LHL&quot;/&gt; The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King [[Farouk of Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[minbar]]'' (&quot;[[pulpit]]&quot;) of the mosque was built by a craftsman named Akhtarini from [[Aleppo]] on the orders of the Zengid sultan [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]. It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad-Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build (1168â74). Nur ad-Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem, but in 1187, Saladin captured the city and the ''minbar'' was installed. The structure was made of [[ivory]] and carefully crafted wood. [[Arabic calligraphy]], geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oweis&quot;&gt;Oweis, Fayeq S.

===Ablution fountain===
[[File:TM washing.JPG|right|thumb|The mosque's &quot;al-Kas&quot; ablution fountain]]

The mosque's main [[Ritual purification|ablution]] fountain, known as ''al-Kas'' (&quot;the Cup&quot;), is located north of the mosque between it and the Dome of the Rock. It is used by worshipers to perform ''[[wudu]]'', a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and face before entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Ummayads, but in 1327â28 Governor Tankiz enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied with water from [[Solomon's Pools]] near [[Bethlehem]], it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply.&lt;ref&gt;Dolphin, Lambert. [http://www.templemount.org/visittemp.html The Temple Esplanade].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.&lt;ref&gt;Gonen, 2003, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fountain of Qasim Pasha]], built by the Ottomans in 1526 and located north of the mosque on the platform of the Dome of the Rock, was used by worshipers for ablution and for drinking until the 1940s. Today, it stands as a monumental structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=5556 Qasim Pasha Sabil]. Archnet Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance in Islam==
In [[Islam]], the term &quot;al-Aqsa Mosque&quot; is not restricted to the mosque only, but to the entire Noble Sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saed |first=Muhammad |title=Islam: Questions and Answers - Islamic History and Biography |publisher=MSA Publication Limited |year=2003 |page=12
|url=http://books.google.com/?id=k22YCjWjF60C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Al-Masjid+Al-Aqsa |isbn=1861793235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque is believed to be the second house of prayer constructed after the [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]]. Post-Rashidun-era Islamic scholars traditionally identified the mosque as the site referred to in the ''[[sura]]'' (Qur'anic chapter) [[al-Isra]] (&quot;the Night Journey&quot;). The specific passage reads &quot;Praise be to Him who made His servant journey in the night from the sacred sanctuary to the remotest sanctuary.&quot; Muslims identify the &quot;sacred sanctuary&quot; as the Masjid al-Haram and the &quot;remotest sanctuary&quot; as the al-Aqsa Mosque. This specific verse in the Qur'an cemented the significant religious importance of al-Aqsa in Islam. Initially, Rashidun and Umayyad-era scholars were in disagreement about the location of the &quot;remotest sanctuary&quot; with some arguing it was actually located near Mecca. Eventually scholarly consensus determined that its location was indeed in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeriBach&quot;&gt;Meri and Bacharach, 2006, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic tradition, during Muhammad's night journey (''al-isra'') he rode on [[al-Buraq]] who took him from Mecca to the site of al-Aqsa. After he finished his prayers, the angel [[Jibril]] ([[Gabriel]]) took Muhammad to [[Heaven]], where he met several other [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]] and led them in prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeriBach&quot;/&gt;

===First qibla===
[[Image:Aqsa 2.jpg|thumb|Interior view of the mosque showing the ''[[mihrab]]'', indicating the ''[[qibla]]'']]

The historical significance of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al-Aqsa when they prayed for a period of sixteen or seventeen months after [[Hijra (Islam)|migration]] to [[Medina]] in 624, thus it became the ''[[qibla]]'' (&quot;direction&quot;) that Muslims faced for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Allen |first=Edgar |authorlink=Edgar Allen |year=2004 |title=States, Nations, and Borders: The Ethics of Making Boundaries |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521525756 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=bntCSupRlO4C&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=Al-Masjid+Al-Aqsa
|accessdate=9 June 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad later prayed towards the [[Ka'aba]] in [[Mecca]] after receiving a revelation during a prayer session.{{Quran-usc-range|2|142|end=151}}&lt;ref&gt;Shah, 2008, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''qibla'' was relocated to the Ka'aba where Muslims have been directed to pray ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Asali, 1990, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The altering of the ''qibla'' was precisely the reason the [[Rashidun]] caliph Umar, despite identifying the [[Foundation Stone|Rock]]âwhich Muhammad used to ascend to [[Heaven]]âupon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because the significance of that particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in [[Islamic jurisprudence]] by the Ka'aba in Mecca after the change of the ''qibla'' towards that site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaad&quot;/&gt;

According to early Qur'anic interpreters and what is generally accepted as Islamic tradition, in 638 CE Umar, upon entering a conquered Jerusalem, consulted with [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]]âa [[Jew]]ish convert to Islam who came with him from [[Medina]]âas to where the best spot would be to build a mosque. Al-Ahbar suggested to him that it should be behind the Rock &quot;...&amp;nbsp;so that all of Jerusalem would be before you.&quot; Umar replied, &quot;You correspond to Judaism!&quot; Immediately after this conversation, Umar began to clean up the siteâwhich was filled with trash and debrisâwith his cloak, and other Muslim followers imitated him until the site was clean. Umar then prayed at the spot where it was believed that Muhammad had prayed before his night journey, reciting the Qur'anic ''[[sura]]'' ''[[Sad (sura)|Sad]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaad&quot;&gt;Mosaad, Mohamed. [http://www.godsholymountain.org/papers/bayt.pdf Bayt al-Maqdis: An Islamic Perspective] pp.3â8&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to this tradition, Umar thereby reconsecrated the site as a mosque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mustaqim.co.uk/ipb-archive/alaqsa/chapone.htm The Furthest Mosque, The History of Al - Aqsa Mosque From Earliest Times] Mustaqim Islamic Art &amp; Literature. 5 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the holiness of Noble Sanctuary itselfâbeing a place where [[David]] and [[Solomon]] had prayedâUmar constructed a small prayer house in the southern corner of its platform, taking care to avoid allowing the Rock to come between the mosque and the direction of [[Ka'aba]] so that Muslims would face only Mecca when they prayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mosaad&quot;/&gt;

===Religious status===
{{Main|Holiest sites in Islam}}
Jerusalem is recognized as a sacred site in [[Islam]]. Muslims believe that numerous passages in the Qur'an refer to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name = &quot;Khatib&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=el-Khatib |first=Abdallah |date=1 May 2001 |title=Jerusalem in the Qur'Än |journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=25â53 |doi=10.1080/13530190120034549 |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;issn=1353-0194&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=25 |accessdate=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem is also mentioned many times in the [[Hadith]]. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as ''al-Fadhail'' or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The greatest source of information for al-Fadhail was the hadith, the Prophet's traditions, which were beginning to be quoted extensively in the last third of the first Muslim century (the seventh century of the Christian era). The traditions were used to enumerate the values of visiting the city and al-Aqsa Mosque. Circulating widely during the Umayyad period, these traditions were often a reflection of the ''Umayyad policy of enhancing the religious status of Jerusalem''.--&gt;

Between 661 and 750 the Umayyad Dynasty held the Caliphate and ruled from Damascus. ''During the time they ruled, on account of various internal and external pressures, the Umayyads exerted enormous effort to elevate Jerusalem's status'', perhaps even to the level of Mecca ... the Palestinian historian A.L. Tibawi writes, that building an actual Al Aqsa Mosque &quot;gave reality to the figurative name used in the Koran ...&quot; As Pipes points out, moreover, &quot;it had the hugely important effect of giving Jerusalem a place in the Koran post hoc which naturally imbued the city with a higher status in Islam.&quot; Which is another way of saying, before the Umayyads built Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa, Jerusalem had no status at all in Islam. Israeli scholar Izhak Hasson says: &quot;construction of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosque, the rituals instituted by the Umayyads on the Noble Sanctuary and the dissemination of Islamic-oriented Traditions regarding sanctity of the site, ''all point to the political motives which underlay the glorification of Jerusalem among the Muslims''.&quot; In other words the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam is based on the Umayyad building program.--&gt;

In addition, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], refers to the al-Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam (and calls for Arab sovereignty over it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/english/conf/is/2/2nd-is-sum.htm#2 |title=Resolution No. 2/2-IS |accessdate=17 November 2006 |date=24 February 1974 |work=Second Islamic Summit Conference |publisher=Organisation of the Islamic Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current situations==
===Administration===
The Waqf Ministry of [[Jordan]] held control of the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. After Israel's victory in that war, instead of the government taking control of the al-Aqsa Mosque, Israel transferred the control of the mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic ''waqf'' trust, who are independent of the Israeli government. However, [[Israeli Security Forces]] are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the ''waqf'' employed architects, technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The [[Islamic Movement (Israel)|Islamic Movement]] in Israel and the ''waqf'' have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]]. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passia.org/jerusalem/publications/khaled_khatib_Conservation_Jerusalem/chapter1.htm Social Structure and Geography] [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel claims sovereignty over the mosque along with all of the Temple Mount (Noble Sanctuary), but [[Palestinians]] hold the custodianship of the site through the Islamic ''waqf''. During the negotiations at the [[2000 Camp David Summit]], Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passia.org/publications/bookmaps/page2.htm#_edn8 Camp David Projections] [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]].

[[Arab citizens of Israel|Muslim residents of Israel]] and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AN&quot;/&gt; Israel occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers,&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; other times they are over an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh clashes mar al-Aqsa prayers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8298417.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bull&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel boosts security in east Jerusalem|url=http://www.bullfax.com/?q=node-israel-boosts-security-east-jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/08/middle_east_ramadan_prayers_at_al_aqsa_mosque/html/3.stm Ramadan prayers at al-Aqsa mosque] ''[[BBC News]]''. 5 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank.

Many [[rabbi]]s, including Israel's chief [[rabbinate]] since 1967, have ruled that Jews should not walk on the Temple Mount due to the possibility of their stepping on the site of the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Yoel. ''[http://www.jcpa.org/jpsr/s99-yc.htm The Political Role of The Israeli Chief Rabbinate in The Temple Mount Question]'', Jewish Political Studies Review, Volume 11:1-2 (Spring 1999), in [http://www.jcpa.org/index.htm Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs] website. Accessed on August 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israeli government]]al restrictions only forbid Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount, but allow Jews as well as other non-Muslims to visit for certain hours on certain days in the week. Several rabbis and [[Zionist]] leaders have demanded the right of Jews to pray at the site on [[Jewish holiday]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Aaron. [http://www.templeinstitute.org/archive/25-12-07a.htm Jews Demand Right to Pray on the Temple Mount] The Temple Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] has supported individual (as opposed to group) prayer, in practice [[Israeli police]] bar a Jew from praying &quot;in any overt manner whatsoever on the Temple Mount, even if he is just moving his lips in prayer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Public Security Minister Avi Dichter, {{cite news |title=No moving Jewish lips in prayer on Temple Mount, says Dichter |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=1 March 2008 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/940710.html |accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excavations===
{{Main|Excavations at the Temple Mount}}
Several excavations outside the [[Temple Mount]] took place following the 1967 War. In 1970, Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides. Palestinians made false accusations that tunnels were being dug under the Al-Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations, while the closest excavation to the mosque is some 70 meters to its south.&lt;ref name=storm&gt;{{cite web|first=Israel|last=Finkelstein|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/137273/|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2011|publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward|title=In the Eye of Jerusalemâs Archaeological Storm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Archaeological Department of the [[Religious Services Minister of Israel|Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs]] dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahram&quot;/&gt; According to [[UNESCO]]'s special envoy to Jerusalem [[Oleg Grabar]], buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/545/fr2.htm|title='Not impartial, not scientific': As political conflict threatens the survival of monuments in the world's most coveted city, Omayma Abdel-Latif speaks to UNESCO's special envoy to Jerusalem|first=Omayma|last=Abdel-Latif|work=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]|publisher=Al-Ahram|date=2001-08-08|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Islamic Waqf, which has custodial rights over the Temple Mount and is responsible for overseeing any construction work there, built an emergency exit for the [[Marwani Mosque]] (Solomon's Stables) in 1999. The move raised concerns from the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA) that, due to the use of bulldozers by the Waqf, damage was being done to structures dating from the early Muslim period. A number of Israeli archaeologists, however, accused the Waqf of destroying building material dating from the First Temple Period in Jerusalem, while [[Ehud Olmert]], the mayor of the city at that time, alleged that any construction on the Temple Mount without the supervision of Israeli authorities undermined Israel's claims to the religious complex. [[Adnan al-Husayni]], then head of the Waqf, responded by stating &quot;We never asked for permission from the occupation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0003/newsbriefs/flap.html|title=Jerusalem's Temple Mount Flap|date=March/April 2000|first=Kristin M.|last=Romey|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February&amp;nbsp;2007, the Department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge. This site was {{convert|60|m|ft|0}} away from the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lis |first=Jonathan |title=Majadele: Jerusalem mayor knew Mugrabi dig was illegal |work=[[Haaretz]]  |publisher=Haaretz |date=2 December 2007 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/824624.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080612123943/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/824624.html |archivedate=2008-06-12 |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavations provoked anger throughout the [[Islamic world]], and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque. [[Ismail Haniya]]âthen [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority]] and [[Hamas]] leaderâcalled on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations, while [[Fatah]] said they would end their ceasefire with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rabinovich |first=Abraham |title=Palestinians unite to fight Temple Mount dig |publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=8 February 2007 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21189993-2703,00.html |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel denied all charges against them, calling them &quot;ludicrous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Matti |title=Israel to resume dig near Temple Mount |publisher=USA Today |date=14 October 2007 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-10-14-2466485405_x.htm |accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
