The '''Japan Football Association''', sometimes known as the '''Japan Soccer Association''' ({{lang-ja|'''Nippon SakkÄ KyÅkai'''}}, {{nihongo|æ¥æ¬ãµãã«ã¼åä¼}}), is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] responsible for the administration of [[association football]] (soccer) in [[Japan]]. It is responsible for the [[Japan national football team|national team]] as well as club competitions.

==History==
The organisation was founded in 1921 as the {{nihongo|Greater Japan Football Association|å¤§æ¥æ¬è¹´çåä¼|Dai-Nippon ShÅ«kyÅ« KyÅkai}}, and became affiliated with [[FIFA]] in 1929. In 1945, the name of the organisation was changed to the {{nihongo|Japan Football Association|æ¥æ¬è¹´çåä¼|Nihon ShÅ«kyÅ« KyÅkai}}; its [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name was changed to the current title in 1975. This reflected common use of the word ''sakkÄ'' (ãµãã«ã¼), derived from &quot;soccer&quot;, rather than the older Japanese word ''shÅ«kyÅ«'' (è¹´ç; literally &quot;kick-ball&quot;). The word ''sakkÄ'' gained popularity during the post-World War II [[occupation of Japan]] by the Allied powers. The association generally translates its name to &quot;Japan Football Association&quot; in English,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jfa.or.jp/eng/&lt;/ref&gt; though &quot;Japan Soccer Association&quot; is also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= World Cup Roundup: Japanese decide on a new coach|author= |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/sports/02iht-wcbrief.2100472.html|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date= July 2, 2006|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol of the JFA is the [[Three-legged crow#Japan|Yatagarasu]], a mythical three-legged raven that guided Emperor [[Jimmu]] to Mount [[Kumano]]. Yatagarasu is also the messenger of the supreme [[Shinto]] sun goddess [[Amaterasu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfa.or.jp/eng/general_info/index.html JFA General Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football has become one of the most popular sports in Japan. After the very successful Asia cup, beating China 3-1 in the final, Japan beat Iran 2-1 and qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]].

==JFA principles==
To promote the most popular sport of all, football, to the masses all over Japan and to pass the ball of friendship in Asia and worldwide, the Japan Football Association(JFA) pledges to live by the following Code of Conduct, as the JFA progresses towards its 100th anniversary in 2021.

# Fair play is the most important aspect of the game. It is also what unites people. Fair play should be observed not only during the game, at training, or in the stands, but fair play should also be observed at all times by everyone in the world.
# There should be no priorities, no discrimination by gender, age, or physical abilities. An environment shall be provided in which everyone is given the chance to enjoy football or any other physical activity.
# Efforts shall be made to build high-standard stadia all over Japan at which football matches, national and international alike, can be organised and comfortably enjoyed.
# The Japanese National Teams of all age groups shall be developed to represent Asia on a regular basis, seeking to play at a competitive level against the very top teams in the world.
# Apply all human, intellectual, and material resources accumulated towards the contribution to Asian and global football.

All of us involved with JFA will work hand in hand with those dedicated to sports and will play an active role in accomplishing our goal. We will endeavor to have football and all other sports become accepted as an essential part of our daily lives and to help create a society in which our children will grow up with dignity and respect as they develop into their roles as leaders of the 21st century.

Motto: Green Grass and A Ball Expands the Circle of Friendship
