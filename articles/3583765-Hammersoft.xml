'''Route 8''' is a multi-state north&amp;ndash;south [[state highway]] in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]], running from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], through [[Massachusetts]] to [[Searsburg, Vermont]]. Its number dates from 1922, when it was a [[New England Interstate Route]], also known as the '''Stratford-Waterbury-North Adams Route''' (for the cities the original route connected). Most of the old route in Connecticut has been upgraded to a [[freeway]] and is a major transportation link between the cities of Bridgeport and [[Waterbury (CT)|Waterbury]].

The highway has kept its number for most of its routing, and in these sections now exists as [[Connecticut Route 8]], [[Massachusetts Route 8]], and [[Vermont Route 8]].  North of [[Searsburg, VT]], the old routing exists as part of [[Vermont Route 100]] and all of [[Vermont Route 155]] (which both used to be part of VT-8).

==Route description==
===Connecticut===
{{main|Connecticut Route 8}}
'''Connecticut Route 8''' begins as a freeway in the city of [[Bridgeport (CT)|Bridgeport]] co-signed with [[Route 25 (Connecticut)|Route 25]]. It has junctions with the [[Merritt Parkway]] in [[Trumbull (CT)|Trumbull]] and [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] in [[Waterbury (CT)|Waterbury]]. The freeway continues through the city of [[Torrington (CT)|Torrington]] up to [[US 44]] in [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]]. North of Winsted, Route 8 becomes a minor rural road through [[Colebrook, Connecticut|Colebrook]] into Massachusetts. The freeway portion of Route 8 is {{convert|58|mi|km}} long.

===Vermont===
'''Vermont Route&amp;nbsp;8''' begins in [[Stamford, Vermont]], where a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Vermont Route 100]] begins at the Massachusetts state line. VT Routes 8 and 100 split in [[Readsboro (VT)|Readsboro]], with VT Route 8 continuing north to end at [[Vermont Route 9]] in [[Searsburg (VT)|Searsburg]]. (VT Route 100, the original alignment of Route 8, takes a more circuitous route, heading southeast and east from the split before turning north to intersect VT Route 9 in [[Wilmington (VT)|Wilmington]].)

==History==
The original Route 8 began in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], running along the west bank of the lower [[Housatonic River]] until [[Shelton, Connecticut|Shelton]]. The southern end of Route 8 was relocated in 1951 to its current Bridgeport terminus as part of the freeway upgrading. The old surface road is now parts of [[Route 113 (Connecticut)|Route 113]] and [[Route 110 (Connecticut)|Route 110]]. North of Shelton, the old surface road (where it still exists) generally parallels the freeway, much of it still state-maintained.

In the late 1940s, a four-lane bypass was built south of [[North Adams, Massachusetts]] and designated as [[Route 8A (Massachusetts)|Route 8A]]. Around 1975, Routes 8 and 8A were swapped, with the original route now designated as Route 8A and the bypass route as Route 8.

Though the original Route 8 in Vermont did not run north of Wilmington, Route 8 was extended north to Londonderry by 1927 along present [[Vermont Route 100]], and by 1938 to [[Weston, Vermont|Weston]] and along [[Vermont Route 155]] to [[Wallingford, Vermont|Wallingford]]. This was still Route 8 in 1961, with Route 100 ending at Route 8 north of [[Weston (VT)|Weston]]. Route 100 was later extended south along Route 8 to the Massachusetts state line. The short piece of Route 8 between Weston and Wallingford became Vermont Route 155, and the Route 8 designation was assigned to its current alignment. (The piece of current Route 8 between Route 100 at [[Heartwellville, Vermont|Heartwellville]] and Route 9 at [[Searsburg (VT)|Searsburg]] had been unnumbered.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.unh.edu/nhtopos/Wilmington.htm 1954 USGS Wilmington quadrangle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.unh.edu/nhtopos/Londonderry.htm 1957 USGS Londonderry quadrangle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.unh.edu/nhtopos/Wallingford.htm 1955 USGS Wallingford quadrangle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1961 Gousha Massachusetts-Connecticut-Rhode Island map&lt;/ref&gt;
