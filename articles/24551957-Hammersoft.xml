However, the West Florida Seminary, as it was still generally called, continued to expand and thrive.

The post-war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), [[Library Science]], [[Nursing]] and Social Welfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;FSU General Bulletin&quot;/&gt; Strozier Library, Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building were also built at this time.

===Student activism===
[[File:FSU protest Tallahassee rc01458.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Student protest in Tallahassee â 1970]]During the 1960s and 1970s the Florida State University became a center for [[student activism]] especially in the areas of [[racial integration]], [[women's rights]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. The school acquired the nickname 'Berkeley of the South'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsu.edu/news/2006/09/06/remembering.sixties/ |title=Florida State University, News Archive, Events' |accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; during this period, in reference to similar student activities at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The school is also purported to have originated the 1970s fad of &quot;[[streaking]]&quot;, said to have been first observed on Landis Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsu.edu/~fstime/FS-Times/Volume2/apr97web/4apr97.html |title=Streaking an FSU First |publisher=Florida State Times |date=April/May 1997 |accessdate=June 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tallahasseenaturally.org/students.html |publisher=Tallahassee Naturally, Inc.'' |accessdate=June 29, 2007 |title=Streaking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 1969 the FSU chapter of [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]], an unregistered university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently decided not to allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and [[mass arrest]] at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night of Bayonets&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myweb.fsu.edu/jkoslow/studentprojects/pubhisfall06website/timeline.html |title=FSU Timeline â Exploring FSU's Past | date=March 4, 1969 | accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Night of Long Knives&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/google_archive/search.php |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |title=Night of the Long Knives | date=March 6, 1969 | accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at [[Kent State University]] causing classes to be canceled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Universities Close&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/google_archive/search.php |publisher=The Evening Independent |title=Universities Close; Kirk Sits All Night on Campus | date=May 8, 1970 | accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines.

The Florida State University aspires to become a top twenty public research university with at least one-third of its PhD programs ranked in the Top-15 nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strategic Plan_05-13&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flbog.edu/about/_doc/strategicplan/StrategicPlan_05-13.pdf |publisher=The Florida Board of Governors |title=Strategic Plan_05-13 â Florida State University, p.17 | date=June 9, 2005 | accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university owns more than 1,500 acres (6&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) and is the home of the [[National High Magnetic Field Laboratory]] among other advanced research facilities. The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research. Other milestones at the university include the first [[ETA10|ETA10-G/8]] [[supercomputer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;A History of Supercomputing at Florida State University by Jeff Bauer&quot;&gt;[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/super-users-view.html Ed-thelen.org] ''Jeff Bauer â A History of Supercomputing at Florida State University, 1991'' Retrieved on [[April 30|4â30]]-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; capable of 10.8 [[GFLOPS]] in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the [[Cray-2|Cray-2/8]], located at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug [[Taxol]].

===Undergraduate Honors Program===
The Florida State University Honors Program is a specially designed program for the most accomplished incoming undergraduates. Undergraduates in Honors participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned research in the area of the sponsoring faculty member. Admission to Honors is competitive. The FSU Honors Medical and Law early-admission, professional-track programs are designed to facilitate faster access to professional programs for the limited number of students who meet required standards. Honors students are eligible for the Honors residence hall and associated administrative benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;FSU Honors Program&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://honors.fsu.edu/prospective/main/academics.html |title=FSU Honors Program website | accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FSU Bulletin - Honors Program&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/undergrad/info/honors.htm |title=Florida State University 2007â2008 General Bulletin Undergraduate Edition â Honors Program | accessdate=December 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limited Access Programs===
A number of undergraduate academic programs at the Florida State University are termed &quot;Limited Access Programs&quot;. Limited Access Programs are programs where student demand exceeds available resources. Admission is thus restricted and sometimes extremely competitive. Examples of limited access programs include The [[Florida State University Film School]], the College of Communication and Information, the College of Nursing, most of the majors in the College of Education, several majors in the College of Visual Arts, Theatre and Dance and all majors in the College of Business.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limited Access Programs&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://registrar.fsu.edu/bulletin/undergrad/info/admissions.htm#LimitedAccess |title=FSU 2006â2007 General Bulletin Undergraduate Edition â Limited Access Programs |accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida State University researchers developed the anti-cancer drug [[Taxol]]. A number of groups based in the United States, including one led by [[Robert A. Holton]], attempted a [[total synthesis]] of the molecule, starting from [[petrochemical]]-derived starting materials. By late 1989, Holton's group had developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel with twice the yield of the Potier process. The Florida State University, where Holton worked, signed a deal with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] to license this and future patents. In 1992, Holton patented an improved process with an 80% yield. Taxol remains the best-selling anti-cancer drug ever manufactured, and the most commercially viable product ever created by a university in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/timeline/noflash/success_stories/S2_Taxol.htm |title=Success Story: Taxol |publisher=National Cancer Institute |year=2002|accessdate=December 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FSU Coastal and Marine Laboratory===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The FSU Coastal and Marine Laboratory is located about {{convert|45|mi|km}} from the main campus in Tallahassee.  It is on the coast of St. Teresa, Florida, between Panacea and Carrabelle, on Apalachee Bay, {{convert|8|acre|m2}} of which is right on the water and the remaining {{convert|70|acre|m2}} of which is directly across the road.  The mission of the FSUCML is to conduct innovative, interdisciplinary research focused on the coastal and marine ecosystems of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, with a focus on solving the ecological problems faced by the region by providing the scientific underpinnings for informed policy decisions.  Research is conducted by faculty in residence and by those from the main campus, as well as by faculty, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate investigators from FSU and other universities throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal &amp; marine Laboratory About Us|url=http://www.marinelab.fsu.edu/aboutus/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Florida State University established its first marine laboratory, the Oceanographic Institute, in 1949, on {{convert|25|acre|m2}} on the harbor side of the peninsula that forms Alligator Harbor, which maintained a substantial research effort throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Other marine stations maintained by Florida State University until 1954 included one at Mayport, on the St. Johns River near Jacksonville, which conducted research related to the menhaden and shrimp fisheries and oceanographic problems of the Gulf Stream and the mouth of the St. John's River, and one on Mullet Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay, which studied red tide. 

In the late 1960s, FSU moved the lab to its current location west of Turkey Point, on land donated by Edward Ball, the founder of the St. Joe Paper Company, and changed its name to The Edward Ball Marine Laboratory. In 2006, the lab became known as The Florida State University Coastal and Marine Laboratory (FSUCML), a name that better reflects the expanded programmatic base of its research, education, and outreach missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal &amp; marine Laboratory History|url=http://www.marinelab.fsu.edu/aboutus/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
The campus newspaper, the ''[[FSView &amp; Florida Flambeau]]'', publishes weekly during the summer and semiweekly on Mondays and Thursdays during the school year following the academic calendar. (No issues are published during Spring Break or Winter Break.) After changing hands three times in 13 years, the ''FSView'' was sold to the Tallahassee Democrat in late July 2006, making it part of the [[Gannett]] chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2006/09/19/CampusWatch/Corporate.Media.On.Campus-2284366.shtml |title=Corporate media on campus? Florida State University paper sold to Gannett Co. â The Brown Daily Herald | date= September 19, 2006 |accessdate=July 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exchange was allowed because the ''FSView'' had been for a long time a for-profit business that was not legally associated with the Florida State University. Since most collegiate newspapers are supported by their colleges, this was also among the very first time that a major corporation acquired a college newspaper. (Gannett had acquired the local Tallahassee paper, ''The Democrat'' in the few years preceding the acquisition of the ''FSView''.) ''FSView'' also produces ''Edge Magazine'', geared towards students, advertisements for local establishments, and a &quot;Tally Girl&quot; model.

The Florida State University, through its [[Broadcasting|Broadcast]] Center, operates two television stations, [[WFSU-TV|WFSU]] and [[WFSG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfsu.org/tv/index.html |title=Florida State University â Television Stations WFSU and WFSG '' |accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three radio stations, [[WFSU-FM]], [[WFSU-FM|WFSQ-FM]] and [[WFSU-FM|WFSW-FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wfsu.org/radio/index.html |title=Florida State University â Radio Stations WFSU-FM, WFSQ-FM and WFSW-FM |accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FSU operates a fourth radio station, [[WVFS]] (V89, &quot;The Voice&quot;, or &quot;The Voice of Florida State&quot;), as an on-campus instructional radio station staffed by student and community volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wvfs.fsu.edu/ |title=Florida State University â Radio Station WVFS-FM |accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; WVFS broadcasts primarily independent music as an alternative to regular radio.
