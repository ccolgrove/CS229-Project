'''Johnny Johns''' is an [[United States|American]] retired competitive [[figure skater]] who currently works as a  coach. As a [[pair skater]], he competed with [[Melissa Militano]] and won the 1974 and 1975 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dscclub.com/pairs.php Detroit Skating Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They placed 8th at the 1974 [[World Figure Skating Championships]] and 6th in 1975. With partner [[Mary Campbell (figure skater)|Mary Campbell]], he is the 1973 National Champion in [[ice dancing]]. Their highest placement at the World Championships was 6th, in 1973.

Johns, who is from the [[Detroit]] area, began skating at the age of 8 as a family activity.  For some years he was splitting his time between skating and [[Little League Baseball]], where he had developed the ability to pitch both left- and right-handed.  Johns carried this ambidextrousness over to his skating and learned how to do jumps in both directions as well.  He also early developed a very smooth stroking style.&lt;ref name=&quot;stylist&quot;&gt;&quot;Portrait of a Stylist&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, Jan 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

When his former coach left the Detroit area, Johns began to work with [[Ronald Ludington]], who insisted that he give up on baseball and concentrate of skating year-round.  Ludington was responsible for pairing him up first with [[Mary Karen Campbell]] in dance, and then with Laurie Johnson in pairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;stylist&quot;/&gt;

Johns attended regular schools during his skating career.  At the time he made the World team for the first time in 1971, he was a student at the [[University of Delaware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stylist&quot;/&gt;

Johns currently works as a coach. He coached at the [[Detroit Skating Club]] for 27 years before moving to the Arctic Edge Ice Arena  in [[Canton, Michigan]] in 2006. He coached [[Marcy Hinzmann]] &amp; [[Aaron Parchem]] to the Olympics and [[Danielle Hartsell]] &amp; [[Steve Hartsell]] to a World Junior title. His current and former students include [[Brooke Castile]] &amp; [[Ben Okolski]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00006365.htm | title = Brooke CASTILE  &amp; Benjamin OKOLSKI | publisher = [[International Skating Union]] | date = 16 November 2009 | accessdate = 21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tessa Virtue]] &amp; [[Scott Moir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00006989.htm | title = Tessa VIRTUE &amp; Scott MOIR | publisher = [[International Skating Union]] | date =  19 November 2009 | accessdate = 21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
