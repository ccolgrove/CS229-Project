}}'''Wanganui Park Secondary College''' is a Government [[secondary college]] with over 1,200 students from years 7 to 12 in [[Shepparton, Victoria]]. The school is mostly known for its innovative curriculum, with the most notable feature being its Vertical Modular Grouping (VMG) system and also offers 2 other levels - Year 7, and VCE.

==Uniform==
In 2009 the uniform at Wanganui Park Secondary College has received a make over. Male students now wear dark green shirts, compared to 2008 where they wore grey shirts. The year 12 students do not have a uniform meaning that they wear what ever they want (with some obvious restrictions). This is the only public school in the town of Shepparton that does not have a uniform for certain year levels.

==Enrolment==
2010 saw the largest amount of enrolments ever for Wanganui Park. This tipped their scales at approximately 1130 students. They are expecting an increase of 50 more students in 2011.

==Year 7==
Years 7 students choose their LOTE subjects ([[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) and every other subject is compulsory.  A new, innovative program called &quot;Learning to Learn&quot; was implemented in 2009.

==VMG==
VMG stands for Vertical Modular Grouping. VMG structures are different from horizontal structures in which students study at year levels, for example years 8, 9 and 10. In a vertical system students of any year (8, 9 and 10) are often in the same class. This arises because in VMG there are four levels from which to choose. Students are guided into the level which is appropriate to their ability in a given subject area.

Unlike Year 7 where students take a common course over the whole year, VMG allows students to select units from different Learning Areas, twice a year (each semester).

By offering a VMG system, students are given the opportunity to:

Work at a level appropriate to their abilities&lt;br&gt;
Choose from a wide range of subjects&lt;br&gt;
Pursue an area of interest&lt;br&gt;
Choose specialist studies&lt;br&gt;
Participate in single sex in some Learning Areas

Studentsâ progress is monitored by Homegroup teachers, House Leaders and the VMG Co-ordinators.

Our Year 8 to 10 VMG offers a balanced and comprehensive curriculum based on school philosophy, politics, and on the statewide Curriculum and Standards frameworks (CSF)

==VCE==
The VCE ([[Victorian Certificate of Education]]) is a single certificate which will normally be completed by school students over a minimum of two years.&lt;br&gt;
For successful completion of the VCE, students will need to satisfactorily complete sixteen units of study, including:&lt;br&gt; Three units of English And Two units from Group A studies And Two units from Group B studies And Three sequences of Units 3 and 4 studies other than English

Up to eight of the units of study may be VCE units obtained across two VET Programs.

At Wanganui Park Secondary College there are some selected students who will complete Level 1 and 2 units during their last semester of VMG and they will complete some unit 3 and 4 units during their Year 11 year. We encourage students to attempt some level 3/4 units in their first year of VCE as it gives them an extra unit to include in their [[Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank|ENTER]] (Equivalent National [[Tertiary Entrance Rank]])score. This should be discussed with parents and counsellors when choosing Units 1 and 2.

==Wanganui Wobbles==
In 2006 the under 14 [[football]] squad played the season undefeated. They competed against [[Shepparton High School]] in the semi final. Wanganui was leading at 3 quarter time, the wobbles overtook and Shepparton High School was able to come back and win by 1 point. The teams then competed in the Grand Final. Shepparton High School won by over 10 goals. Thus the Wanganui wobbles were born.
