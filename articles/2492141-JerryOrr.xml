== From university ==
Bozulich was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He attended [[UCLA]] and in 1966 graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[mathematics]]. Bozulich had worked his way through college by buying and selling highly technical used books and upon graduation decided to become a [[book publisher]]. 

== Ishi press ==
He moved to Japan and in 1968 in partnership with Stuart Dowsey founded The [[Ishi Press]], a book and magazine publishing company that primarily published books about the game of [[Go (board game)|go]].

Ishi Press' first few publications were translations of Japanese books such as [[Eio Sakata]]'s ''The Middle Game of Go'' and ''Modern [[Joseki]] and [[Fuseki]] Vol. I and II'' but Bozulich soon began working with Japanese professional players, as well as principal collaborators James Davies and John Power, to produce original works in English. The first of these, ''Basic techniques of Go by Nagahara and Haruyama'', was published in 1969. In 1973, Bozulich began work on a seven-volume set covering all the fundamentals of the game, The Elementary Go Series, with the publication of  ''In the Beginning'' by Ishigure and ''Life and Death'' by Kosugi and Davies. By 1984, the set was complete, when Ishi Press published Nagahara and Bozulich's ''Handicap Go.'' Meanwhile, Bozulich  continued to translate and publish Japanese material for the nascent Western go-playing community, selecting volumes such as Kageyama's ''Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go'' and ''Kage's Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go'', and a series of books about basic opening strategies: ''The Power of the Star-Point'' ((Takagawa), ''The Chinese Opening: The Sure Win Strategy'' (Kato) and ''The 3-3 Point: Modern Opening Theory'' (Cho). 

In 1977, the [[Nihon Ki-in|Japan Go Association]] ceased publication of ''Go Review'', their English-language magazine. Working closely with Power, Bozulich has published a quarterly magazine ever since. ''[[Go World]]'' remains the only source in English for comprehensive analysis of top Japanese tournament games.

== Kiseido ==
In 1982 Bozulich founded [[Kiseido Publishing Company]], publishing Invincible: The Games of [[Honinbo Shusaku|Shusaku]], Power's biography and collection of the games of the most famous Japanese player from the 1800s.  Kiseido became more active in the 1990s, when Bozulich produced two more multi-volume sets of instructional material: the five volume ''Mastering the Basics'', and the ten volume ''Get Strong at Go'' series. Kiseido continues to publish other books as well, such as ''The Go Player's Almanac'', ''The World of Chinese Go'' and ''An Introduction to Modern [[Fuseki]]: Korean Style''.
