'''Matt Walker''' is a musician and former [[drummer]] for [[Filter (band)|Filter]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and current drummer for Morrissey. 

Matt Walker began his career in Chicago in the mid 80s, when Matt began playing drums for the already well known Scott Bennett of Scott Bennett &amp; The Obvious and did double duty playing drums for Derrick &quot;Suede&quot; Stout's group The Clinic.  It was in this group that Derrick Stout introduced Matt to Jim Dinou who would eventually be his writing partner in Impossible Recording Machine. At the same time Matt formed his own band with bassist from Scott Bennett and The Obvious, Mick Vaughn, and good friend Marshall Dawson to form his pet project Moron Tasty. Scott bennett &amp; Derrick &quot;Suede&quot; Stout eventually formed  t h e  t u r n s t y l e s  and again hired Matt to be the primary drummer. Matt   then played with Peat Moss, (Brad Peterson's band), until joining the band Filter in 1994. Matt toured with Filter in support of the album, &quot;Short Bus&quot; until 1996. Filter toured with The Smashing Pumpkins in Europe and when Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was fired after a heroin overdose, Walker was hired to replace Chamberlin. He finished the ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]''  tour with the band ([[1996]] - [[1997]]) and all of their dates up until the beginning of the ''[[Adore (The Smashing Pumpkins album)|Adore]]'' tour; this includes their [[television]] appearance on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] where they played the song &quot;[[Muzzle (song)|Muzzle]]&quot;. Walker also recorded the song &quot;[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]&quot; with the band on the official ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]'' movie soundtrack, as well as several tracks on The Smashing Pumpkins ''Adore''. He also worked with Pumpkins frontman [[Billy Corgan]] on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Ransom (1996 film)|Ransom]]'' and with Pumpkins guitarist [[James Iha]] on Iha's solo album ''[[Let It Come Down (James Iha album)|Let It Come Down]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He once again rejoined the Pumpkins on percussion during the Chicago dates of their 20th anniversary tour in November and December 2008.

Matt went on to other collaborative efforts in The Cupcakes &lt;ref name=Hindin /&gt; and Ashtar Command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
