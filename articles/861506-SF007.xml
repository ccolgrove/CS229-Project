'''Figueira da Foz''' ({{IPA-pt|fiËÉ£ÉjÉ¾É Ã°É ËfÉÊ}}), also known as '''Figueira''' for short, is a municipality in the [[Coimbra District]], in [[Portugal]]. It is located at the mouth of the [[Mondego River]], 40&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Coimbra]], and sheltered by hills ([[Serra da Boa Viagem]]).

The seat is the city of Figueira da Foz. The city has a population of 46,600 and the municipality has in total 62,601 inhabitants. It is the second largest city in the district of Coimbra.

It is a coastal city with several beaches, summer and seaport facilities in the Atlantic Ocean coast. As a city of tourism it plays an important part in the centre of the country. A zone of legal gambling, one can find in Figueira one of the biggest [[casino]]s of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] â the Casino Peninsular.

==History and landmarks==
According to the legend the placeâs name is due to a [[Ficus|fig]] tree, which stood at the quay of Salmanha, where the fishermen used to tie up their boats. The historian Nelson Borges said, however, that Figueira comes from the word &quot;fagaria&quot;, which means &quot;opening, huge mouth&quot;. Foz comes from the Latin word &quot;fouces&quot; = &quot;mouth of a river&quot;, and Mondego comes from the pre-romanic expressions &quot;mond&quot; = &quot;mouth&quot; and &quot;aec&quot;= &quot;river&quot;. That means, Figueira da Foz would be &quot;the riverâs mouth opening&quot;. Some historical traces show that people were settling in this region since the [[Neolithic]] age. The oldest known document, however, dates from the year 1096. In this an abbot named Pedro donates estates, which belonged to the church of S. JuliÃ£o, to the cathedral [[SÃ© Velha of Coimbra]].

Knowing the great importance rivers had in the development of cities and of ancient civilizations, the mouth of the Mondego must have played a central role for the fixation of men in this region and for the formation of settlements, which were the beginning of the city of Figueira da Foz. Figueira da Foz had a huge development during the 18th and 19th centuries due to the immense port movements and the expansion of the [[shipbuilding]] industry, supplying the city with new communication routes, housing and other facilities. It was elevated to ''vila'' (small town) on March 12, 1771 and turned city (''cidade'') on September 20, 1882. Discovered as a sea resort by the end of the 19th century, it gained great reputation in the 1920s and 1930s. The city had the Potuguese nickname of ''Rainha das Praias'' (Queen of the Beaches).

The municipality has some noted landmarks like the Sotto Mayor Palace, the old fishing village of [[Buarcos]], the [[Serra da Boa Viagem]] â a small forested mountain by the Atlantic Ocean, several beaches, and its large seaside [[promenade]] paved with typical [[Portuguese pavement]]. Figueira da Foz has several Churches, many of them in the rich Baroque style, a Municipal Museum with archaeological, ethnographic and artistic collection, the [[Santa Catarina Fort]] and the old [[Buarcos Fortress]], the ''RelÃ³gio Tower'' by the main sandy beachy, several archaeological vestiges throughout the municipality, several Palaces and Manor Houses (like the Sotto Mayor Palace), as well as several green spaces and small gardens like those in the area of ''Abadias''.

==Economy==
The city is an important industrial centre, producing wood pulp and paper (Soporcel â a [[Portucel Soporcel]] company; CELBI â an [[Altri]] company) and glass (Saint-Gobain Mondego â a [[Saint-Gobain]] company). It also has notable naval construction and fish industries, as well as a factory of the [[CIMPOR|CIMPOR Group]] installed in the Mondego Cape ''([[Cabo Mondego]])''. The seaport and the fishing harbour are also important for its economy.

With its old and renowned [[casino]] (''Casino da Figueira''), the marina, several hotels, restaurants and other tourist facilities, Figueira is actually a very important Atlantic beach resort, in the center of Portugal's Silver Coast/''Costa de Prata'' [[tourism region]].

==Education==
The city has well-equipped kindergartens, schools and high schools. It had two [[private university|private universities]]: the [[Catholic University of Portugal]] (Figueira da Foz branch) and the [[Internacional University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/GC17/Governo/Ministerios/MCTES/Notas/Pages/20090930_MCTES_Universidade_Internacional.aspx Comunicado sobre a Universidade Internacional, a Universidade Internacional da Figueira da Foz e o Instituto Superior PolitÃ©cnico Internacional]&lt;/ref&gt; (Figueira da Foz branch) but they were closed in 2009 due to lack of funds and academic integrity.
