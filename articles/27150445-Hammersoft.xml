As a result, Alvina couldnât help but blame herself for her childrenâs misfortune and categorizes herself as a failure in being a mother. Can Alvina still find enough faith and fortitude to rebuild her family? More importantly, can she find it in her heart to forgive herself?

|English Title || Golden Rag
|- 
| Synopsis || Orang was raised in an Aeta community by a couple who rescued her from a mining accident. When her father was killed while trying to protect their land, Orang, her pregnant mother Ising, and sister Gilay were left with no choice but to evacuate and seek new life in the city.

But life in Manila turned out to be crueler than they expected. One night, while selling rugs on the street, a speeding car accidentally hit Ising, leaving her permanently incapacitated. As such, Orang was left with the responsibility of single-handedly caring and providing for her entire family.

By a stroke of fate, Orang meets Danny, a wealthy bachelor who mysteriously offers her a job as a maid in his grandmotherâs house. Nurturing a broken heart from her scheming girlfriend Sylvia, Danny plans to use Orang to claim revenge against Sylvia by educating and dressing their housemaid to act and look like a real socialite. Danny also changes her name from Orang to Laura Esquiviel.

But Danny soon realizes that he no longer needs to make Sylvia jealous as he is already falling in love with the beautiful Laura. Upon this discovery, however, Laura also finds out about what really happened during the night of the accident, which presumably involves Danny. Laura ends up running away from the mansion bearing two things in mind: to seek revenge and to unravel the mystery that conceals her true identity.
