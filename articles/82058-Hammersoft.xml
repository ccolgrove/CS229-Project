'''Brigham Young University''' (often referred to as '''BYU''', or sometimes just '''the Y''') is a [[Private education|private]] [[university]] located in [[Provo, Utah]].

Approximately 98% of the university's 34,000 students are members of the LDS Church, and one-third of its American students come from within the state of [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =About BYU - Demographics | publisher =BYU.edu | year= 2007 | url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/default.aspx?content=demographics | accessdate =2007-08-19  }}&lt;/ref&gt; BYU students are required to follow an [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|honor code]], which mandates behavior in line with LDS teachings (e.g., [[academic honesty]], adherence to [[dress code|dress and grooming standards]], and abstinence from [[law of chastity|extramarital sex]] and from [[Word of Wisdom|the consumption of drugs and alcohol]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Honor Code|url=http://www.besmart.com/college_prep/honorcode.php|work=CES Be Smart|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many students (78% of men, 10% of women) take a two-year hiatus from their studies at some point to serve as [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionaries]].&lt;ref name = mission/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Percentage of Students who have served missions|url=http://yfacts.byu.edu/viewarticle.aspx?id=264|work=Y Facts|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many BYU students speak foreign languages during their Mormon missions, and approximately 31% of the student body enroll in foreign language courses, making it one of the most multilingual student bodies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yfacts.byu.edu/viewarticle.aspx?id=139 |title=About BYU: Languages |accessdate=2011-6-29 |publisher=BYU.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BYU education is also less expensive than at similar private universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 3: Postsecondary Education|url=http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d10/ch_3.asp|work=Digest of Education Statistics: 2010|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; since approximately 70% of tuition is funded by LDS Church [[tithe|tithing]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Madsen| first =Grant| title =BYU number two value after BYU-Hawaii, says &quot;Consumers Digest&quot;| publisher =BYU News| date= 2004-05-04| url =http://byunews.byu.edu/release.aspx?story=archive04/may/cdigest| accessdate = 2007-08-19  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BYU offers programs in [[liberal arts]], [[engineering]], [[agriculture]], [[management]], and [[law]]. The university is broadly organized into 11 colleges or schools at its main Provo campus, with certain colleges and divisions defining their own admission standards. The university also administers two satellite campuses, one in [[BYU Jerusalem Center|Jerusalem]] and one in [[Salt Lake City]], while its parent organization, the [[Church Educational System]], sponsors sister schools in [[Brigham Young UniversityâHawaii|Hawaii]] and [[Brigham Young UniversityâIdaho|Idaho]]. The university's primary focus is on [[undergraduate education]], but it also has 68 [[master's degree|master's]] and 25 [[doctoral degree]] programs.

BYU's athletic teams compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are collectively known as the [[BYU Cougars]]. They are [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] in football, with other sports in the [[West Coast Conference]] and [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation|MPSF]], and have won ten national championships.

{{Main|History of Brigham Young University}}
[[File:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brigham Young]], the school's namesake]]

=== Early days ===
Brigham Young University's origin can be traced back to 1862 when a man named [[Warren Newton Dusenberry|Warren Dusenberry]] started a Provo school in a prominent adobe building called Cluff Hall, which was located in the northeast corner of 200 East and 200 North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = D. Robert |last = Carter |url = http://old.heraldextra.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=53358 |title = The hall the Cluffs built |work = The Daily Herald |date= 2005-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, 1875, [[Brigham Young]], then [[President of the Church|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], personally purchased the Lewis Building after previously hinting that a school would be built in Draper, Utah in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=BYU: The &quot;almost&quot; college of Draper, Utah| url=http://www.russpage.net/byu-the-almost-college-of-draper-utah/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, October 16, 1875 is commonly held as BYU's founding date.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Brigham Young High School History: 1869 to 1903 - The Founding Years | publisher =Brigham Young High School| url =http://abc.eznettools.net/D300015/X329586/History/HistoryDecades/From1869to1903.html| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Said Young about his vision: &quot;I hope to see an Academy established in Provo... at which the children of the Latter-day Saints can receive a good education unmixed with the pernicious atheistic influences that are found in so many of the higher schools of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dusenberry&quot;/&gt;

The school broke off from the [[University of Deseret]] and became ''Brigham Young Academy'',&lt;ref name=&quot;dusenberry&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first = Sarah |last = Bills |url = http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/43900 |title = Warren Dusenberry (1875 - 1876) |work = BYU NewsNet |date= 2003-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with classes commencing on January 3, 1876. Warren Dusenberry served as interim principal of the school for several months until April 1876 when Brigham Young's choice for principal arrivedâa German immigrant named [[Karl G. Maeser|Karl Maeser]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; The school did not become a university, however, until the end of [[Benjamin Cluff|Benjamin Cluff, Jr's]] term at the helm of the institution. At that time, the school was also still privately supported by members of the community and was not absorbed and sponsored officially by the LDS Church until July 18, 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;byhigh&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =From 1903 to 1920 ~ A High School Within a University| work =Brigham Young High School History| publisher =Brigham Young High School| year= 2007| url =http://www.byhigh.org/History/HistoryDecades/From1903to1920.html| accessdate = 2007-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of odd managerial decisions by Cluff led to his demotion; however, in his last official act, he proposed to the Board that the Academy be named &quot;Brigham Young University&quot;. The suggestion received a large amount of opposition, many members of the Board saying that the school wasn't large enough to be a university, but the decision ultimately passed. One opponent to the decision, Anthon H. Lund, later said, &quot;I hope their head will grow big enough for their hat.&quot;&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt; 

In 1903, Brigham Young Academy was dissolved, and was replaced by two institutions: [[Brigham Young High School]], and Brigham Young University.&lt;ref name=&quot;byhigh&quot;&gt;[http://www.byhigh.org/History/HistoryDecades/From1903to1920.html History of Brigham Young High School from 1903 to 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; (The BY High School class of 1907 was ultimately responsible for the [[hillside letters|famous giant &quot;Y&quot;]] that is to this day [[Y Mountain|embedded on a mountain]] near campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;byhigh&quot;/&gt;) The Board elected [[George H. Brimhall]] as the new President of BYU. He had not received a high school education until he was forty. Nevertheless, he was an excellent orator and organizer.&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt; Under his tenure in 1904 the new Brigham Young University bought {{convert|17|acre|m2}} of land from Provo called &quot;Temple Hill&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;byhigh&quot;/&gt; After some controversy among locals over BYU's purchase of this property, construction began in 1909 on the first building on the current campus, the Karl G. Maeser Memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =History| work =About BYU| publisher =BYU.edu| year= 2007| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/default.aspx?content=history| accessdate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brimhall also presided over the University during a brief crisis involving the theory of evolution. The religious nature of the school seemed at the time to collide with this scientific theory. [[Joseph F. Smith]], President of the Church, settled the question for a time by asking that evolution not be taught at the school. A few have described the school at this time as nothing more than a &quot;religious seminary&quot;. However, many of its graduates at this time would go on to great success and renown in their fields.&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt;

=== Expansion ===
[[File:Smoot Building.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Abraham O. Smoot Administration Building, the main administration building on the Provo campus]]
[[Franklin S. Harris]] was appointed President of the University in 1921. He was the first President of BYU to have a doctoral degree. Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true University, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was eventually replaced by President [[Howard S. McDonald]], who received his doctorate from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]]. When he first received the position, the [[Second World War]] had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The University did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in [[Ogden, Utah]] and rebuilt it to house some of the students.&lt;ref name = wilk/&gt; The next President, [[Ernest L. Wilkinson]], also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand to this day.&lt;ref name = ernest&gt;{{cite web| title =Ernest L. Wilkinson| work =Presidents| publisher =BYU.edu| year= 2007| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/president/wilkinson.aspx| accessdate = 2007-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, the student body increased six times, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school.&lt;ref name = wilk&gt;{{cite web| last =Wilkinson| first =Ernest L.| title =Highlights in the Ninety-Nine-Year History of BYU| publisher =Brigham Young University Press| date= 1974-10-10| url =http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6112| accessdate =2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, President Wilkinson reorganized the LDS church units on campus, with ten [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] and over 100 [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]] being added during his administration.&lt;ref name = ernest/&gt;
[[File:BYU Campus North.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Overlooking North Campus]]
[[Dallin H. Oaks]] replaced Wilkinson as President in 1971. Oaks continued the expansion of his predecessor, adding a law school and proposing plans for a new School of Management. During his administration, a new library was also added, doubling the library space on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Dallin H. Oaks| work =Presidents| publisher =BYU.edu| year= 2007| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/president/oaks.aspx| accessdate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey R. Holland]] followed as President in 1980, encouraging a combination of educational excellence and religious faith at the university. He believed that one of the school's greatest strengths was its religious nature and that this should be taken advantage of rather than hidden. During his administration, the university added a campus in Jerusalem, now called the [[BYU Jerusalem Center]]. In 1989, Holland was replaced by [[Rex E. Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Jeffrey R. Holland| work =Presidents| publisher =BYU.edu| year= 2007| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/president/holland.aspx| accessdate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was responsible for the Benson Science Building and the Museum of Art on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Rex E.

Bateman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Merrill J. Bateman| work =Presidents| publisher =BYU.edu| year= 2007| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/president/bateman.aspx| accessdate = 2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the University both on and off campus, including the expansion of the Harold B. Lee Library from 1996-1999. He was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the [[Mountain West Conference]], which BYU's athletics program joinedâBYU previously participating in the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. A [[BYU TV|BYU satellite TV network]] also opened in 2000 under his leadership. Bateman was also president during the [[September 11th attacks]] in 2001. The planes crashed on a Tuesday, mere hours before the weekly devotional normally held at BYU. Previous plans for the devotional were altered, as Bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Carter| first =Jane| coauthors =Marla Sowards| title =President leaves mark on campus| publisher =BYU Newsnet| date= 2003-04-16| url =http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/43904| accessdate = 2007-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bateman was followed by [[Cecil O.

=== Graduation honors ===
{{see also|Brigham Young University Honors Program}}
Undergraduate students may qualify for graduation honors. ''[[Brigham Young University Honors Program#University Honors|University Honors]]'' is the highest distinction BYU awards its graduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccc.byu.edu/honors |title=Honors |accessdate=2010-01-21 |publisher=Brigham Young University}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administered by the [[Brigham Young University Honors Program|Honors Program]], the distinction requires students to complete an honors curriculum requirement, a Great Works requirement, an Advanced Languages requirement, a service requirement, an honors thesis requirement, a graduation portfolio that summarizes the student's honors experiencesâall while maintaining at least a 3.5 GPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;honors&quot;/&gt;

The university also awards [[Latin honors|Latin scholastic distinctions]] separately from the Honors Program: ''summa cum laude'' (top 1 percent), ''magna cum laude'' (top 5 percent), and ''cum laude'' (top 10 percent).&lt;ref name=&quot;honors&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/Graduation.php#LatinScholDistinctions |title=BYU Graduation Honors |accessdate=2010-01-21 |publisher=Brigham Young University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university additionally recognizes [[Phi Kappa Phi]] graduation honors.

=== International focus ===
[[File:ESC Eyring Science Center.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Eyring Science Center]] houses a [[planetarium]] and a [[Foucault pendulum]].]]
Over three quarters of the student body have some proficiency in a second language (numbering 107 languages in total).&lt;ref name = langfact&gt;{{cite web| title =Why Use the Brigham Young University English Certification Test?| url =http://cito-lt.com/files/ECTComparisontoTOEFLTOEIC.pdf| accessdate = 2007-08-30 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is partially due to the fact that 45% of the student body at BYU have been [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and many of them learned a foreign language as part of their mission assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Languages| work =About BYU| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/default.aspx?content=languages| accessdate = 2007-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During any given semester, about one-third of the student body is enrolled in foreign language classes, a rate nearly four times the national average.&lt;ref name = langfact/&gt; BYU offers courses in over 60 different languages,&lt;ref name = langfact/&gt; many with advanced courses that are seldom offered elsewhere.  Several of its language programs are the largest of their kind in the nation, the Russian&lt;ref name = langvalue&gt;Owens, Eric. America's Best Value Colleges. New York: Princeton Review, 2004. pg.583. ISBN 0-375-76373-2&lt;/ref&gt; program being one example. The university was selected by the [[United States Department of Education]] as the location of the national Middle East Language Resource Center, making the school a hub for experts on that region.&lt;ref name = langvalue/&gt; It was also selected as a Center for International Business Education Research, a function of which is to train business employees in international languages and relations.&lt;ref name = langfact/&gt;

Beyond this, BYU also runs a very large study abroad program, with satellite centers in London, [[BYU Jerusalem Center|Jerusalem]], and Paris, as well as more than 20 other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =International Study Programs| work =David M. Kennedy Center| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://kennedy.byu.edu/isp/index.php| accessdate = 2007-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 2,000 students take advantage of these programs yearly.

A few special additions enhance the language-learning experience. For example, BYU's [http://ic.byu.edu/ International Cinema], featuring films in several languages, is the largest and longest-running university-run foreign film program in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =About Us| work =BYU International Cinema| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://ic.byu.edu/about_us.php| accessdate = 2007-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As already noted, BYU also offers an intensive foreign language living experience, the Foreign Language Student Residence.  This is an on-campus apartment complex where students commit to only speak their foreign language of choice while in their apartments. Each apartment has at least one native speaker to ensure correct language usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Room Options| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms.html| accessdate = 2007-08-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822224947/http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms.html |archivedate = August 22, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic freedom issues ===
{{Main|Academic freedom at Brigham Young University}}
In 1992, the university drafted a new Statement on Academic Freedom,&lt;ref name = acadfree&gt;{{cite web| title = Statement on Academic Freedom at BYU| publisher = BYU| date = 1992-09-14| url = http://fc.byu.edu/opages/reference/academicfreedom.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifying that limitations may be placed upon &quot;expression with students or in public that: (1) contradicts or opposes, rather than analyzes or discusses, fundamental Church doctrine or policy; (2) deliberately attacks or derides the Church or its general leaders; or (3) violates the [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|Honor Code]] because the expression is dishonest, illegal, unchaste, profane, or unduly disrespectful of others.&quot; These restrictions have caused some controversy as several professors have been disciplined according to the new rule. The [[American Association of University Professors]] has claimed that &quot;infringements on academic freedom are distressingly common and that the climate for academic freedom is distressingly poor.&quot;&lt;ref name=aaupreport&gt;{{cite web| title = Academic Freedom and Tenure |date = 1997-09-01| publisher = [[American Association of University Professors]] | url = http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/27EB0A08-8D25-4415-9E55-8081CC874AC5/0/Brigham.pdf | accessdate = 2008-05-25 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new rules have not affected BYU's accreditation, as the university's chosen accrediting body allows &quot;religious colleges and universities to place limitations on academic freedom so long as they publish those limitations candidly&quot;, according to associate academic vice president Jim Gordon.&lt;ref name=NascuOnAcademicFreedom&gt;{{cite web| title = The Issue of Academic Freedom: An Interview with Jim Gordon | publisher = ''BYU Magazine'' | year = 1997| url = http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=664| accessdate = 2008-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association of University Professors|AAUP]]'s concern was not with restrictions on the faculty member's religious expression but with a failure, as alleged by the faculty member and AAUP, that the restrictions had not been adequately specified in advance by BYU: &quot;The AAUP requires that any doctrinal limitations on academic freedom be laid out clearly in writing. We [AAUP] concluded that BYU had failed to do so adequately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cary Nelson]] (AAUP President), &quot;Praying to the Wrong God&quot; (Subject of massmail message), ''AAUP Online'', 2008 September 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brigham Young University is a part of the [[Church Educational System]] of LDS Church. It is organized under a [[Board of Trustees]], with the President of the Church ([[Thomas S. Monson]] as of 2011) as chairman.  This board consists of the same people as Church Board of Education which oversees the entire Church Educational System, a pattern that has been in place since 1939.  Before that BYU had a separate board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Ernest L., ''Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years''. (Provo: BYU Press, 1975) Vol. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  The President of BYU, currently [[Cecil O.

The university operates under 11 colleges or schools, which collectively offer 194 bachelor's degree programs, 68 master's degree programs, 25 Ph.D. programs, and a [[Juris Doctor]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Academic Organization| work =About BYU| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://unicomm.byu.edu/about/default.aspx?content=academic-organization| accessdate = 2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BYU also manages some courses and majors through the [[David M.

[[File:ForeignLanguageHousing.JPG|thumb|left|Foreign Language Student Residence, where students commit to speak only their language of study]]

Single students have four options for on-campus housing: Heritage Halls, Helaman Halls, Wyview Park, and the FLSR. Married students can live in Wymount Terrace.

Heritage Halls is a twenty-four building housing complex on campus which offers apartment-style living. The halls house both male and female students, divided by gender into separate buildings. Each building has ten to fourteen units capable of housing six people each.

Helaman Halls is a slightly newer complex which has recently undergone a 12 year renovation spanning 1991 and through 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Chamberlin| first =Sarah | title =A new home: Helaman Halls construction completed | publisher =BYU Newsnet| date= 2003-09-30| url =http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/45808| accessdate = 2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helaman Halls is a seven building (seventh added in the summer of 2010), dormitory style living area. Residents share a room (larger than Heritage Halls) with one other resident, but do not have their own kitchen and use shared bathrooms. Residents are required to have a meal plan, and eat at the newly remodeled Commons at the Cannon Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byu.edu/oncampushousing/rooms/room_options.shtml#helaman BYU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wyview Park was originally built for families in 1996, but this changed in 2006 when the complex began housing single students in order to counteract loss of singles' housing in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Schaerr| first =Stephanie | title =Single Students Move in to Wyview| publisher =BYU Newsnet| date= 2006-09-05| url =http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/60723| accessdate = 2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wyview Park has 30 buildings that offer apartment-style living for students, along with the option for shared or single rooms.

The Foreign Language Student Residence complex has twenty-five apartments where students speak exclusively in a selected foreign language. The immersion experience is available in nine languages, and students are accompanied by a native resident throughout the year to enhance the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =BYU Housing - FLSR Info| publisher =Brigham Young University| url =http://flsr.byu.edu/about.php| accessdate = 2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===
BYU has designated energy conservation, products and materials, recycling, site planning and building design, student involvement, transportation, water conservation, and zero waste events as top priority categories in which to further its efforts to be an environmentally sustainable campus.  The university has stated that &quot;we have a responsibility to be wise stewards of the earth and its resources.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Y Facts - Sustainability&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[File:BYU Concert Choir with Poppies.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The [[BYU Choirs|Concert Choir]] in performance]]
BYU also has a strong emphasis on [[jazz]] music with the premiere performing group ''Synthesis'' leading the way. ''Synthesis'' has toured in over 30 countries and performed at some of the biggest [[jazz festival]]s in the world, namely [[Montreux]] (Switzerland), [[Pori]] (Finland), [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark), [[Umbria]] (Italy), [[IAJE]] (International Association of Jazz Educators) and many others. ''Synthesis'' also performed at the [[Expo 2000|2000 World Expo]] in [[Hannover, Germany]]. Many of ''Synthesis''' alumni have gone on to perform and record nationally and internationally as well as teach at prestigious [[universities]] nationwide. BYU offers degree programs in [[Music theory|Music]], [[Music Education]], Music Performance, Jazz Studies and many more. 

BYU's Wind Symphony and Chamber Orchestra have toured many countries including [[Denmark]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Russia]], the [[British Isles]], and [[Central Europe]].

[[File:BYA Football Champions 1896.png|thumb|right|The school's first football team won the regional championship in 1896.]]
BYU has 21 NCAA varsity teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byucougars.com/athletic_department/quick_facts.jsp Athletic Department fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen of these teams have played mainly in the [[Mountain West Conference]] since its inception in 1999. Prior to that time BYU teams competed in the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. All teams are named the &quot;Cougars&quot;, and [[Cosmo the Cougar]] has been the school's mascot since 1953. The school's fight song is the [[The Cougar Song (BYU)|Cougar Fight Song]]. Because many of its players serve on full time missions for two years, BYU's athletes are often older on average than other school's players. The NCAA allows students to serve missions for two years without subtracting that time from their eligibility period. This has caused minor controversy, but is largely recognized as not lending the school any significant advantage, since players receive no athletic and little physical training during their missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Crain| first = Nate | title = The Myth of the BYU Missionary Advantage| publisher = Scout.com| date = 2005-06-10| url = http://coloradostate.scout.com/a.z?s=132&amp;p=2&amp;c=386324| accessdate = 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; BYU has also received attention from sports networks for refusal to play games on Sunday, as well as [[2010â11 BYU Cougars men's basketball team#Davies controversy|expelling players]] due to honor code violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Jackson| first = Lisa Ann | title =  Setting things straight| publisher = BYU Magazine| url = http://magazine.byu.edu/?act=view&amp;a=202| accessdate = 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BYU football will start the 2011 college football season as an independent.

BYU's stated mission &quot;is to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and [[Exaltation (LDS Church)|eternal life]].&quot; BYU is thus considered by its leaders to be at heart a religious institution, wherein, ideally, religious and secular education are interwoven in a way that encourages the highest standards in both areas.&lt;ref name = peer&gt;{{cite web| last = Peer| first = Larry H. | title = Beethoven's Kiss: On the Odd Reasons for Brigham Young's Excellent University| work = BYU Speeches| publisher = BYU| date = 2003-12-02| url = http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=4530| accessdate = 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This weaving of the secular and the religious aspects of a religious university goes back as far as Brigham Young himself, who told Karl G.

All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an [[honor code]]. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and early school President Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization&quot;, which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the schools moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was not created until about 1940, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and [[academic dishonesty]]. President Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards. This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process, and must be adhered by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the school or lose tenure.  Both LDS and non-LDS students are required to meet annually with a Church leader to receive an ecclesiastical endorsement for both acceptance and continuance.&lt;ref name = code&gt;{{cite web| last = Bergera| first = Gary James | coauthors =  Ronald Priddis| title = Chapter 3: Standards &amp; the Honor Code| work = Brigham Young University: A House of Faith| publisher = Signature Books| year = 1985| url = http://www.signaturebookslibrary.org/byu/chapter3.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[LGBT]] advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being [[gay rights opposition|anti-gay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heartstrong.org/HeartStrong/BYU.html &quot;BYU Continues the Legacy of Anti-Gay Policies&quot;], ''HeartStrong''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.affirmation.org/learning/byu.shtml &quot;Brigham Young University Pages&quot;], ''Affirmation: Gay and Lesbian Mormons''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soulforce.org/article/1124 &quot;The 2006 Equality Ride Route: Brigham Young University&quot;], ''Soulforce''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The high rate of enrollment at the university by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints results in an amplification of LDS cultural norms; BYU was ranked by ''The Princeton Review'' in 2008 as 14th in the nation for having the happiest students and highest quality of life.&lt;ref name = pr&gt;{{cite web| title = 2008 Best 366 Colleges Rankings| publisher = The Princeton Review| year = 2008| url = http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetailspr07.asp?categoryID=6&amp;topicID=43| accessdate = 2008-01-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080315163144/http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankingDetailspr07.asp?categoryID=6&amp;topicID=43 |archivedate = March 15, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quirkiness and sometimes &quot;too nice&quot; culture is often caricatured, for example, in terms of marrying early and being very conservative.

One of the characteristics of BYU most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a [[Dating and marriage at byu|&quot;marriage culture.&quot;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Study focuses on BYU marriage perceptions| work = Daily Universe| publisher = BYU| date = 2005-04-29| url = http://nn.byu.edu/story.cfm/55351| accessdate = 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints highly value marriage and family, especially marriage within the faith.&lt;ref name=marriage&gt;{{cite web| last = Clark| first = Natalie | title = BYU marriage rates higher than national average | work = Daily Universe| publisher = BYU| date = 2005-10-03| url = http://nn.byu.edu/story.cfm/56823| accessdate = 2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 51% of the graduates in BYU's class of 2005 were married. This is compared to a national marriage average among college graduates of 11%.&lt;ref name = marriage/&gt; BYU students on average marry at the age of 22, according to a 2005 study, while the national average age is 25 years for men and 27 years for women.&lt;ref name=marriage /&gt;

Many visitors to BYU, and Utah Valley as a whole, report being surprised by the culturally conservative environment. Brigham Young University's Honor Code, which all BYU students agree to follow as a condition of studying at BYU, prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, etc. As mentioned earlier, The [[Princeton Review]] has rated BYU the &quot;#1 stone cold sober school&quot; in the nation for several years running, an honor which the late LDS Church president [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] had commented on with pride.&lt;ref name = pr/&gt; BYU's 2010 &quot;#1 stone cold&quot; sober rating marked the 12th year in a row that the school had earned that rating. BYU has used this and other honors awarded to the school to advertise itself to prospective students, showing that BYU is proud of the rating. According to the [[Uniform Crime Reports]], incidents of crime in Provo are lower than the national average. Murder is rare, and robberies are about 1/10 the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provo UT Crime Statistics (2006 Crime Data)|publisher=Areaconnect.com|url=http://provo.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many on-campus student activities and clubs are organized by [[BYUSA]], the university's official student association.  A popular comedy club is [[Divine_Comedy_(BYU)|Divine Comedy]].
