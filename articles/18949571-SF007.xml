'''OpenBSD''' is a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] descended from [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD), a [[Unix]] derivative developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It was [[fork (software development)|forked]] from [[NetBSD]] by project leader [[Theo de Raadt]] in late 1995. The project is widely known for the developers' insistence on [[open-source]] code and quality documentation, uncompromising position on [[software licensing]], and focus on [[computer insecurity|security]] and code correctness. The project is coordinated from de Raadt's home in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada. Its logo and mascot is a [[pufferfish]] named Puffy.

OpenBSD includes a number of security features absent or optional in other operating systems, and has a tradition in which developers [[code audit|audit]] the source code for [[software bug]]s and security problems. The project maintains strict policies on licensing and prefers the [[open-source]] [[BSD licence]] and its variantsâin the past this has led to a comprehensive license audit and moves to remove or replace code under licences found less acceptable.

As with most other BSD-based operating systems, the OpenBSD [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and [[Userland (computing)|userland]] programs, such as the [[Unix shell|shell]] and common tools like [[cat (Unix)|cat]] and [[ps (Unix)|ps]], are developed together in one source code repository. Third-party software is available as binary packages or may be built from source using the [[ports collection|ports tree]].

The OpenBSD project maintains ports for 17 different [[computer hardware|hardware]] [[platform (computing)|platforms]], including the [[DEC Alpha]], [[Intel]] [[Intel 80386|i386]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[PA-RISC]], [[AMD]] [[AMD64]] and [[Motorola 68000]] processors, [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[PowerPC]] machines, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] and [[SPARC64]]-based computers, the [[VAX]] and the [[Sharp Zaurus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;plat&quot;/&gt;

Visited January 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is not wholly clear, although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its [[electronic mailing list|mailing lists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;glass&quot;/&gt; De Raadt has been criticized for having a sometimes abrasive personality: in his book, ''Free For All'', Peter Wayner claims that de Raadt &quot;began to rub some people the wrong way&quot; before the split from NetBSD;&lt;ref&gt;Wayner, Peter.

''[http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/7543 Theo de Raadt gives it all to OpenBSD],'' January 30, 2001. Visited March 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have different feelings: the same interviewer describes de Raadt's &quot;transformation&quot; on founding OpenBSD and his &quot;desire to take care of his team,&quot; some find his straightforwardness refreshing, and few deny he is a talented [[programmer|coder]]&lt;ref&gt;In [http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/1994/12/23/0000.html this message] the NetBSD core team acknowledge de Raadt's &quot;positive contributions&quot; to the project despite its problems with him.&lt;/ref&gt; and security &quot;guru&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Darknet. ''[http://www.darknet.org.uk/tag/theo-de-raadt/ Intel Core 2 Duo Vulnerabilities Serious say Theo de Raadt],'' July 18, 2007. Visited May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;de Raadt, Theo. Mail to openbsd-announce: ''[http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive2/announce/199610/msg00001.html The OpenBSD 2.0 release],'' October 18, 1996. Visited December 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months, each of which is maintained and supported for one year. The latest release, OpenBSD 5.0, appeared on November 1, 2011.

On 25 July 2007, OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the [[OpenBSD Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsdfoundation.org |title=Official OpenBSD Foundation site |publisher=Openbsdfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Canadian [[not-for-profit corporation]] formed to &quot;act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Bob. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://www.nabble.com/Announcing%3A-The-OpenBSD-Foundation-p11801927.html Announcing: The OpenBSD Foundation],'' July 25, 2007. Visited July 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just how widely OpenBSD is used is hard to ascertain: its developers neither publish nor collect usage statistics, and there are few other sources of information. In September 2005, the nascent BSD Certification Group performed a usage survey which revealed that 32.8% of BSD users (1420 of 4330 respondents) were using OpenBSD,&lt;ref name=survey&gt;[http://www.bsdcertification.org/ The BSD Certification Group.]; [[PDF]] of [http://www.bsdcertification.org/downloads/pr_20051031_usage_survey_en_en.pdf usage survey results].&lt;/ref&gt; placing it second of the four major BSD variants, behind [[FreeBSD]] with 77% and ahead of NetBSD with 16.3%.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple selections were permitted as a user may use multiple BSD variants side by side.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DistroWatch]] [[website]], well-known in the [[Linux]] community and often used as a reference for popularity, publishes [[Hit (internet)|page hits]] for each of the [[Linux distribution]]s and other operating systems it covers. As of June 2011, using a data span of the last six months it placed FreeBSD in 15th place with 484 hits per day; PC-BSD in 24th place with 346 hits per day; GhostBSD in 53rd place with 171 hits, OpenBSD in 58th place with 164 hits per day; DragonFly in 62nd place with 142 hits per day; and NetBSD in 100th place with 94 hits per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distrowatch Rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2001â2011 | url = http://distrowatch.com/ | title = DistroWatch.com | publisher = DistroWatch.com | accessdate = 2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open source and open documentation ==

When OpenBSD was created, Theo de Raadt decided that the source should be easily available for anyone to read at any time, so, with the assistance of Chuck Cranor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chuck.cranor.org/ Chuck Cranor's site].&lt;/ref&gt; he set up a public, anonymous [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] server. This was the first of its kind in the software development world: at the time, the tradition was for only a small team of developers to have access to a project's source repository.&lt;ref name=&quot;cvs&quot;&gt;Cranor, Chuck D, de Raadt, Theo. ''[http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix99/full_papers/cranor_f/cranor_f.pdf Opening The Source Repository With Anonymous CVS],'' USENIX June 6â11, 1999. Visited April 07, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cranor and de Raadt concluded that this practice &quot;runs counter to the open source philosophy&quot; and is inconvenient to contributors. de Raadt's decision allowed &quot;users to take a more active role&quot;, and signaled the project's belief in open and public access to source code.&lt;ref name=&quot;cvs&quot;/&gt;

A revealing incident regarding open documentation occurred in March 2005, when de Raadt posted a message&lt;ref&gt;de Raadt, Theo. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=111118558813932 Adaptec AAC raid support],'' March 18, 2005. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''openbsd-misc'' mailing list. He announced that after four months of discussion, [[Adaptec]] had not disclosed the documentation required to improve the OpenBSD [[device driver|drivers]] for its AAC [[Disk array controller|RAID controllers]]. As in similar circumstances in the past, he encouraged the OpenBSD community to become involved and express their opinion to Adaptec. Shortly after this, FreeBSD [[committer]], former Adaptec employee and author of the FreeBSD AAC RAID support Scott Long,&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.freebsd.org/~scottl/ Scott Long's site].&lt;/ref&gt; castigated de Raadt&lt;ref&gt;Long, Scott. Post to OSNews: ''[http://osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=10032&amp;offset=15&amp;rows=28#350222 From a BSD and former Adaptec person...],'' March 19, 2005. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[OSNews]] website for not contacting him directly regarding the issues with Adaptec. This caused the discussion to spill over onto the ''freebsd-questions'' mailing list, where the OpenBSD project leader countered&lt;ref&gt;de Raadt, Theo. Mail to freebsd-questions: ''[http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2005-March/081294.html aac support],'' March 19, 2005. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; by claiming that he had received no previous offer of help from Scott Long nor been referred to him by Adaptec. The debate was amplified&lt;ref&gt;de Raadt, Theo. Mail to freebsd-questions: ''[http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2005-March/081313.html aac support],'' March 19, 2005. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; by disagreements between members of the two camps regarding the use of [[binary blob]] drivers and [[non-disclosure agreement]]s (NDAs): OpenBSD developers do not permit the inclusion of [[closed source]] binary drivers in the source tree and are reluctant to sign NDAs. However, the FreeBSD project has a different policy and much of the Adaptec RAID management code Scott Long proposed as assistance for OpenBSD was closed source or written under an NDA. As no documentation was forthcoming before the deadline for the release of OpenBSD 3.7, support for Adaptec AAC RAID controllers was removed from the standard OpenBSD kernel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC?rev=1.406 OpenBSD CVS repository, commit by Theo de Raadt]. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation: in the slides for a December 2006 presentation, de Raadt explained that without it &quot;developers often make mistakes writing drivers&quot;, and pointed out that &quot;the [oh my god, I got it to work] rush is harder to achieve, and some developers just give up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;deraadtopencon06&quot;&gt;de Raadt, Theo. ''[http://www.openbsd.org/papers/opencon06-docs/index.html Presentation at OpenCON],'' December 2006. Visited December 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that vendor binary drivers are unacceptable to OpenBSD, that they have &quot;no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel&quot; and that there is &quot;no way to fix [them] ... when they break&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;deraadtopencon06&quot;/&gt;

== Licensing ==

A goal of the OpenBSD project is to &quot;maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix [[copyright]]s&quot;, which permitted a &quot;relatively un-encumbered Unix source distribution&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;OpenBSD.org. ''[http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html Copyright Policy].'' Visited January 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the [[ISC license|Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) licence]], a simplified version of the BSD licence with wording removed that is unnecessary under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]], is preferred for new code, but the [[MIT License|MIT]] or BSD licences are accepted. The widely used [[GNU General Public License]] is considered overly restrictive in comparison with these.&lt;ref&gt;NewsForge. ''[http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/09/2132233 BSD cognoscenti on Linux],'' June 15, 2005. Visited January 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, triggered by concerns over Darren Reed's modification of IPFilter's licence wording, a systematic licence audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Linux.com. ''[http://www.linux.com/feature/12774 OpenBSD and ipfilter still fighting over license disagreement],'' June 06, 2001. Visited May 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed, ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the licence. To ensure that all licences were properly adhered to, an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders: some pieces of code were removed, many were replaced, and others, including the [[multicast]] [[routing]] tools, mrinfo and map-mbone,&lt;ref&gt;Man pages: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mrinfo mrinfo] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=map-mbone map-mbone].&lt;/ref&gt; which were licensed by [[Xerox]] for research only, were relicensed so that OpenBSD could continue to use them; also removed during this audit was all software produced by [[Daniel J. Bernstein]]. At the time, Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution, a requirement to which OpenBSD developers were unwilling to devote time or effort.&lt;ref&gt;de Raadt, Theo. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2001-08/2544.html Re: Why were all DJB's ports removed? No more qmail?],'' August 24, 2001. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The removal led to a clash with Bernstein who felt the removal of his software to be uncalled for. He cited the [[Netscape]] [[web browser]] as much less freely licensed and accused the OpenBSD developers of hypocrisy for permitting Netscape to remain while removing his software.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, DJ. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2001-08/2812.html Re: Why were all DJB's ports removed? No more qmail?],'' August 27, 2001. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The OpenBSD project's stance was that Netscape, although not open source, had licence conditions that could be more easily met.&lt;ref name=&quot;espieqmail&quot;&gt;Espie, Marc. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2001-08/2864.html Re: Why were all DJB's ports removed? No more qmail?],'' August 28, 2001. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They asserted that Bernstein's demand for control of derivatives would lead to a great deal of additional work and that removal was the most appropriate way to comply with his requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;espieqmail&quot;/&gt;

The OpenBSD team has developed software from scratch, or adopted suitable existing software, because of licence concerns. Of particular note is the development, after licence restrictions were imposed on [[IPFilter]], of the [[PF (firewall)|pf]] [[packet filter]], which first appeared&lt;ref&gt;Hartmeier, Daniel. [http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf-paper.html Design and Performance of the OpenBSD Stateful Packet Filter (pf)]. Visited December 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; in OpenBSD 3.0 and is now available in [[DragonFly BSD]], NetBSD and FreeBSD. OpenBSD developers have also replaced GPL licensed tools (such as [[diff]], [[grep]] and [[pkg-config]]) with BSD licensed equivalents and founded new projects including the [[OpenBGPD]] routing daemon and [[OpenNTPD]] time service daemon.&lt;ref&gt;OpenBSD CVS logs showing import of [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/diff/diff.c diff], [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/grep/grep.c grep] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/pkg-config/pkg-config pkg-config]. [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bgpd OpenBGPD] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd OpenNTPD] man pages from OpenBSD. Visited May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Also developed from scratch was the globally used software package OpenSSH.

== Security and code auditing ==

{{details|OpenBSD security features}}

Shortly after OpenBSD's creation, Theo de Raadt was contacted by a local security software company named Secure Networks, Inc. or SNI.&lt;ref&gt;The Age. ''[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/07/1097089476287.html Staying on the cutting edge],'' October 8, 2004. Visited January 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ONLamp.com. Interview with OpenBSD developers: ''[http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2003/07/17/openbsd_core_team.html The Essence of OpenBSD],'' July 17, 2003. Visited December 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They were developing a &quot;network security auditing tool&quot; called Ballista (later renamed to Cybercop Scanner after SNI was purchased by [[McAfee|Network Associates]]), which was intended to find and attempt to [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] possible software security flaws. This coincided well with de Raadt's own interest in security, so for a time the two cooperated, a relationship that was of particular use leading up to the release of OpenBSD 2.3&lt;ref&gt;Theo de Raadt on SNI: &quot;Without their support at the right time, this release probably would not have happened.&quot; From the [http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive/misc/9805/msg00308.html 2.3 release announcement]. Visited December 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to form security as the focal point of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Wayner, Peter. ''Free For All: How Linux and the Free Software Movement Undercut the High Tech Titans,'' [http://www.jus.uio.no/sisu/free_for_all.peter_wayner/18.html#1009 18.3 Flames, Fights, and the Birth of OpenBSD], 2000. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until June 2002, the OpenBSD website featured the slogan:

{{cquote|Five years without a remote hole in the default install!}}

In June 2002, Mark Dowd of [[Internet Security Systems]] disclosed a bug in the [[OpenSSH]] code implementing [[challenge-response authentication|challenge-response]] [[authentication]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet Security Systems. [http://www.iss.net/threats/advise123.html OpenSSH Remote Challenge Vulnerability], June 26, 2002. Visited December 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[vulnerability (computer science)|vulnerability]] in the OpenBSD default installation allowed an attacker remote access to the [[superuser|root]] account, which was extremely serious not only to OpenBSD, but also to the large number of other operating systems that were using OpenSSH by that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/9169 A partial list of affected operating systems].&lt;/ref&gt; This problem necessitated the adjustment of the slogan on the OpenBSD website to:

{{cquote|One remote hole in the default install, in nearly 6 years!}}

The quote remained unchanged as time passed, until on March 13, 2007 when Alfredo Ortega of [[Core Security Technologies]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coresecurity.com Core Security Technologies' homepage].&lt;/ref&gt; disclosed a network-related remote vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Core Security Technologies. ''[http://www.coresecurity.com/content/open-bsd-advisorie OpenBSD's IPv6 mbufs remote kernel buffer overflow.]'' March 13, 2007. Visited March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The quote was subsequently altered to:

{{cquote|Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!}}

This statement has been criticized because the default install contains few running services, and most users will install additional software.&lt;ref&gt;Brindle, Joshua. ''[http://securityblog.org/brindle/2008/03/30/secure-doesnt-mean-anything/ Secure doesn't mean anything]'', March 30, 2008. Visited April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The project states that the default install is intentionally minimal to ensure novice users &quot;do not need to become security experts overnight&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/security.html OpenBSD security page: &quot;Secure by Default&quot;]. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which fits with open-source and code auditing practices argued to be important elements of a security system.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, David A.

OpenBSD includes features designed to improve security. These include [[application programming interface|API]] additions, such as the ''[[strlcat]]'' and ''[[strlcpy]]''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Todd C. and Theo de Raadt. [http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/millert.html strlcpy and strlcat â consistent, safe, string copy and concatenation]. Proceedings of the 1999 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, June 6â11, 1999, pp. 175â178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[subroutine|functions]]; toolchain alterations, including a [[static code analysis|static bounds checker]]; memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses, such as [[stack-smashing protection#GCC Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice)|ProPolice]]&lt;ref&gt;ProPolice site: here [http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[W^X]] (W [[exclusive or|xor]] X) [[paging|page]] protection feature; and [[cryptography]] and [[randomization]] features.&lt;ref&gt;de Raadt, Theo, Niklas Hallqvist, Artur Grabowski, Angelos D. Keromytis, [[Niels Provos]]. [http://www.openbsd.org/papers/crypt-paper.pdf Cryptography in OpenBSD: An overview] (PDF), June 1999. Visited January 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing [[privilege escalation]], some programs have been written or adapted to make use of [[privilege separation]], [[privilege revocation]] and [[chroot]]ing. Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the [[principle of least privilege]], where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the otherâalmost always the bulk of the codeâruns without privilege.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niels Provos]]. [http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html Privilege Separated OpenSSH]. Visited January 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the [[file system]], prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files. Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of common applications, including [[tcpdump]] and the [[Apache (webserver)|Apache]] [[web server]].&lt;ref&gt;OpenBSD CVS logs showing addition of privilege separation to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/tcpdump/privsep.c tcpdump] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd httpd] man page describing the chroot mechanism. Visited May 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenBSD developers were instrumental in the birth ofâand the project continues to developâ[[OpenSSH]], a secure replacement for [[Telnet]]. OpenSSH is based on the original [[Secure Shell|SSH]] suite and developed further by the OpenBSD team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openssh.com/history.html OpenSSH Project History and Credits]. Accessed April 07, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in OpenBSD 2.6 and is now the most popular SSH implementation, available on many operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openssh.com/usage/ SSH usage profiling].

The project has a policy of continually auditing code for problems, work that developer Marc Espie has described as &quot;never finished ... more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly Network. ''[http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2004/03/18/marc_espie.html An Interview with OpenBSD's Marc Espie],'' March 18, 2004. Visited January 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found, including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues, &quot;try[ing] to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended&quot;, and investigating whether &quot;it's possible to augment the [[compiler]] to warn against this specific problem&quot;.

[[Linux kernel]] creator [[Linus Torvalds]] has expressed the view that development efforts should be focused on fixing general problems rather than targeting security issues, as non-security bugs are more numerous (&quot;all the boring normal bugs are _way_ more important, just because there's a lot more of them&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Torvalds, Linus. Mail to linux-kernel: ''[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/701694/focus=706950 Re: &lt;nowiki&gt;[stable]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Linux 2.6.25.10]'', July 15, 2008. Visited July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;). On July 15, 2008, he criticised the OpenBSD policy: &quot;[T]hey make such a big deal about concentrating on security that they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Torvalds, Linus. Mail to linux-kernel: ''[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/706950 Re: &lt;nowiki&gt;[stable]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Linux 2.6.25.10]'', July 15, 2008. Visited July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; OpenBSD developer Marc Espie replied to Torvalds' statement: &quot;It's a totally misinformed opinion ... [Fixing normal bugs] is exactly what people in the OpenBSD project do, all the time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Espie, Marc. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openbsd-misc/2008/7/16/2536484 Re: This is what Linus Torvalds calls openBSD crowd]'', July 16, 2008. Visited July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Developer Artur Grabowski also expressed surprise: &quot;That's the funniest part about this ... [Torvalds] was saying the same things we say&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Grabowski, Artur. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openbsd-misc/2008/7/17/2545214 Re: This is what Linus Torvalds calls openBSD crowd]'', July 16, 2008. Visited July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2010, Gregory Perry sent an email to Theo de Raadt alleging that the [[FBI]] had paid some OpenBSD ex-developers 10 years previously to insert backdoors into the OpenBSD [[OpenBSD security features#Cryptography and randomization|Cryptographic]] Framework. Theo de Raadt made the email public on 14 December by forwarding it to the openbsd-tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the [[IPsec]] codebase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=129236621626462&amp;w=2 |title=Allegations regarding OpenBSD IPSEC |publisher=Marc.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/24136/_FBI_Added_Secret_Backdoors_to_OpenBSD_IPSEC_ |title=&quot;FBI Added Secret Backdoors to OpenBSD IPSEC&quot; |publisher=Osnews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Raadt's response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code. In the weeks that followed, bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors were found.&lt;ref&gt;

== Uses ==

OpenBSD's security enhancements, built-in cryptography and the pf [[firewall (networking)|packet filter]] suit it for use in the security industry, for example on firewalls,&lt;ref&gt;McIntire, Tim. ''[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-openbsd.html Take a closer look at OpenBSD]'', August 8, 2006â&quot;Because OpenBSD is both thin and secure, one of the most common OpenBSD implementation purposes is as a firewall.&quot; Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[intrusion-detection system]]s and [[virtual private network|VPN]] [[gateway (computer networking)|gateways]].

[[Image:OpenBSD49-fvwm.png|thumb|OpenBSD 4.9 running [[X.Org Server|X.Org]] with the default [[FVWM]] [[X window manager|window manager]].]]

[[proprietary software|Proprietary]] systems from several manufacturers are based on OpenBSD, including devices from Armorlogic (Profense web application firewall),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armorlogic.com/ Profense web application firewall].&lt;/ref&gt; Calyptix Security,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calyptix.com/ Calyptix Security's website].&lt;/ref&gt; GeNUA mbH,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genua.de/ GeNUA mbH's homepage].&lt;/ref&gt; RTMX Inc,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtmx.com/ RTMX Inc homepage].&lt;/ref&gt; and .vantronix GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vantronix.com/ .vantronix GmbH's homepage].&lt;/ref&gt; Code from many of the OpenBSD system tools has been used in recent versions of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX|Services for UNIX]], an extension to the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system which provides some Unix-like functionality, originally based on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.4BSD-Lite]]. Core Force, a security product for Windows, is based on OpenBSD's pf firewall.&lt;ref&gt;http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=Wiki&amp;action=view&amp;type=project&amp;name=Core_Force&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenBSD ships with the [[X Window System|X window system]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xenocara.org/ |title=About Xenocara |publisher=Xenocara.org |date=2006-07-10 |accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is suitable for use on the desktop.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanidakis, Manolis. [http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/52930 Using OpenBSD on the desktop], Linux.com, April 21, 2006. Visited April 07, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Packages for popular desktop tools are available, including desktop environments [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], and [[Xfce]]; web browsers [[Konqueror]], [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]]; and [[multimedia]] programs [[MPlayer]], [[VLC media player]] and [[xine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/49.html OpenBSD 4.9]â&quot;Over 6,800 ports...Gnome 2.32.1, KDE 3.5.10.&quot; Visited May 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenBSD's performance and usability is occasionally criticised. [[Felix von Leitner]]'s performance and [[scalability]] tests&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulk.fefe.de/scalability/ Scalability test results and conclusions].&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that OpenBSD lagged behind other operating systems. In response, OpenBSD users and developers criticised von Leitner's objectivity and methodology, and asserted that although performance is given consideration, security and correct design are prioritised, with project member Nick Holland commenting: &quot;It all boils down to what you consider important.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Nick. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://groups.google.co.uk/group/lucky.openbsd.misc/msg/2b6f9d5bf42b712a Re: OpenBSD Benchmarked... results: poor!],'' October 19, 2003. Visited January 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; OpenBSD is also a relatively small project, particularly when compared with FreeBSD and Linux, and developer time is sometimes seen as better spent on security enhancements than performance optimization. Critics of usability say that OpenBSD has a lack of user-friendly configuration tools, a bare default installation,&lt;ref&gt;NewsForge. ''[http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/11/01/1710223 Trying out the new OpenBSD 3.8],'' November 2, 2005. Visited January 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;spartan&quot; and &quot;intimidating&quot; installer.&lt;ref&gt;NewsForge. ''[http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/07/20/180234 Review: OpenBSD 3.5],'' July 22, 2004. Visited January 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These see much the same rebuttals as performance: a preference for simplicity, reliability and security. As one reviewer puts it, &quot;running an ultra-secure operating system can be a bit of work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DistroWatch. ''[http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-openbsd OpenBSD&amp;nbsp;â For Your Eyes Only],'' 2004. Visited January 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution and marketing ==

OpenBSD is available freely in various ways: the source can be retrieved by anonymous CVS or [[CVSup]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html OpenBSD anonymous CVS page]. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded either by [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html OpenBSD FTP page]. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Prepackaged [[CD-ROM]] sets can be ordered online for a small fee, complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release's theme song. These, with its artwork and other bonuses, are one of the project's few sources of income, funding hardware, [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] and other expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html OpenBSD orders page]â&quot;The proceeds from sale of these products is the primary funding of the OpenBSD project.&quot; Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common with other operating systems, OpenBSD provides a [[package management system]] for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html OpenBSD FAQ 15 â The OpenBSD packages and ports system]. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Packages are binary files which are extracted, managed and removed using the package tools. On OpenBSD, the source of packages is the ports system, a collection of [[Makefile]]s and other infrastructure required to create packages. In OpenBSD, the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version: this means that the ports or packages released with, for example, 4.6 are not suitable for use with 4.5 and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html#NoFun OpenBSD FAQ 15.4.1 â I'm getting all kinds of crazy errors. I just can't seem to get this ports stuff working at all]â&quot;Do NOT check out a -current ports tree and expect it to work on a -release or -stable system.&quot; Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenBSD at first used the [[BSD daemon]] mascot created by [[Phil Foglio]], updated by [[John Lasseter]] and copyright [[Marshall Kirk McKusick]]. Subsequent releases saw variations, eventually settling on Puffy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/27.html OpenBSD 2.7 page] with &quot;spacefish&quot; image. Visited May 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; described as a [[pufferfish]].&lt;ref&gt;Although in fact pufferfish do not possess spikes and images of Puffy are closer to a similar species, the [[porcupinefish]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork. The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or design but later the CD-ROMs, release songs, posters and tee-shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme, sometimes contributed to by Ty Semaka of the [[Plaid Tongued Devils]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html OpenBSD Release Songs]. Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; These have become a part of OpenBSD [[operating system advocacy|advocacy]], with each release expanding a moral or political point important to the project, often through [[parody]].&lt;ref&gt;Matzan, Jem, ''[http://www.softwareinreview.com/bsd/openbsd_4.0_review.html OpenBSD 4.0 review]'', Software In Review, November 1, 2006. &quot;Each OpenBSD release has a graphical theme and a song that goes with it. The theme reflects a major concern that the OpenBSD programmers are addressing or bringing to light.&quot; Visited April 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Past themes have included: in OpenBSD 3.8, the ''Hackers of the Lost RAID'', a parody of [[Indiana Jones]] linked to the new RAID tools featured as part of the release; ''The Wizard of OS'', making its debut in OpenBSD 3.7, based on the work of [[Pink Floyd]] and a parody of [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]] related to the project's recent [[wireless]] work; and OpenBSD 3.3's ''Puff the Barbarian'', including an 80s rock-style song and parody of [[Conan the Barbarian]], alluding to open documentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html OpenBSD lyrics page] Visited March 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
