<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="1432265" ns="0" title="Untitled"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The word &quot;'''untitled'''&quot; refers to something that has no [[title]]. [[Document]]s, [[art|works of art]], musical works, and other works can be untitled.  Generally, an untitled work is the result of a conscious choice by the artist or creator not to apply a title.  However to state another example; many computer programs will use &quot;untitled&quot; as a default title for documents, images, or other files.

Some works have a paradoxical title of ''Untitled''.
