The '''Embassy of Poland''' in [[Vienna]] is the diplomatic mission of the [[Republic of Poland]] to the [[Republic of Austria]]. The chancery is located at Hietzinger HauptstraÃe 42c, Vienna.

The main cancery of the Polish embassy in Vienna is to be found within a late-19th-century manor house on one of Vienna's main arterial routes, namely the Hietzinger HauptstraÃe. The building itself is designed in a form of neo-Bohemian baroque and is built entirely out of stone. With a large tower and a roadside gate representative of a monumental archway, the edifice presented is one of both beauty and authority. Within the main chacery the political and trade sections as well as the Military attache can be found.

The embassy's counsular section is located in an adjoining building of the same style and has the Vienna address, Hietzinger HauptstraÃe 42b.

The current ambassador of the Polish Republic to the Republic of Austria is Dr Jerzy MargaÅski.
