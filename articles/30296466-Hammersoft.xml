===2011 draft board===
{{Main|2011 NFL Draft}}

After finishing the 2010 season 10-6 and narrowly missing the playoffs, the Buccaneers had the 20th overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft.  A provision in the now expired collective bargaining agreement ensured that the draft still take place, despite the current lockout and lack of a new CBA.

==Regular season==
===General summary===
After a somewhat surprising 10-6 campaign in [[2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2010]], Tampa Bay had high hopes from 2011. A close loss to [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]] on opening day was followed by a three-game winning streak and a fairly strong 4-2 start with wins against division opponents [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta]] and [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]]. However, self-inflicted troubles started affecting the season, leading to a five-game losing streak. Turnovers, penalties, and poor defense began taking its toll. Quarterback [[Josh Freeman]]'s uncharacteristic 16 interceptions through week 12 (second-worst in the league) was nearly triple his total from 2010. The once dominate Tampa Bay defense ranks 31st in the league.

===Schedule===
The Buccaneers' regular season schedule was announced April 19. Tampa Bay will play [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in [[London, England]] on October 23 as part of the [[NFL International Series]], with Tampa Bay serving as the host team.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 04-18&quot;/&gt;

The team's [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers#Ring of Honor|Ring of Honor]] induction ceremony is scheduled to take place during the December 4 game against [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]]. The team will honor [[Jimmie Giles]] at halftime, and wear their orange [[throwback uniforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Tampa Bay hosted the winless [[Indianapolis Colts]] on [[Monday Night Football]]. Miscues and penalties nearly cost the Buccaneers control of the game, but [[Josh Freeman]] threw for 287 yards, and [[LeGarrette Blount]] rushed for 127 yards, as Tampa Bay won the game 24-17. [[Curtis Painter]] started at quarterback for the Colts, his first career NFL start.

The Colts led early after an [[Adam Vinatieri]] field goal. Tampa Bay then sacked [[Curtis Painter|Painter]] and recovered the fumble. [[Connor Barth]]'s field goal attempt, however, bounced off the upright, and the score remained 3-0. Late in the first quarter, [[Josh Freeman|Freeman]] connected to [[Arrelious Benn]], who ran 62 yards for an apparent touchdown. However, the touchdown was nullified since Benn has stepped out-of-bounds before the catch (illegal touching).

In the second quarter, the Buccaneers pinned the Colts at their own 2 yard line. [[Curtis Painter|Painter]] threw to [[Pierre GarÃ§on]], who ran for an 87-yard touchdown, and 10-0 lead. Tampa Bay answered with a touchdown, and trimmed the score to 10-7. In the final seconds of the first half, [[Josh Freeman|Freeman]] drove the Buccaneers to the Colts 19 yard line, but was sacked with 20 seconds to go and counting. The field goal unit hurried on to the field, and the field goal was initially good. Tampa Bay, however, was penalized for 12 men on the field, and the score was nullified.

Tied 17-17 in the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay received a punt with just under 7 minutes remaining. [[LeGarrette Blount]] blasted for a 35-yard touchdown run, and a 24-17 Tampa Bay lead. In the final three minutes, Tampa Bay ran out the clock, including a &quot;4th &amp; Inches&quot; quarterback sneak by [[Josh Freeman|Freeman]], to seal the victory.

This was Tampa Bay's first appearance on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' since 2008, and the first home Monday night game since 2003. This ''MNF'' telecast was notable in that [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s &quot;[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight|All My Rowdy Friends]]&quot; opening was omitted due to comments he made on ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' earlier in the day where he compared a golf outing involving [[Barack Obama]], [[John Boehner]], [[Joe Biden]], and [[John Kasich]] to &quot;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] playing golf with [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 10-05-11&quot;&gt;{{cite news
