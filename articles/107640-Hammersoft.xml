'''Inglewood''' is a city in southwestern [[Los Angeles County, California]], southwest of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. It was incorporated on February 14, 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;inc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=City History |work=City of Inglewood |url=http://www.cityofinglewood.org/about/city_history.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its population stood at 109,673 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]].  The city is in the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] region of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|greater Los Angeles area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chooselacounty.com/images/doingbusiness/la-county-map.jpg  Choose LA County ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Pre-American era===
The earliest residents of what is now  Inglewood were [[indigenous people]] who used the natural springs in today's Edward Vincent Jr. Park (known for most of its history as Centinela Park). Local historian [[Gladys Waddingham]] wrote that these springs took the name ''Centinela'' from the hills that rose gradually around them and which allowed ranchers to watch over their herds &quot;(thus the name centinelas or sentinels).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Waddingham|first=Gladys|title=The History of Inglewood|publisher=The Historical Society of Centinela Valley|location=Inglewood|year=1994|isbn=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|unpaged [xiv]|date=May 2009}}

Waddingham traced the written history of Inglewood back to the original settlers of Los Angeles in 1781, one of whom was the Spanish soldier [[Rancho La Ballona#Machado family|Jose Manuel Orchado Machado]], &quot;a 23-year-old muleteer from Los Alamos in  Sinaloa.&quot; These settlers, she wrote, were ordered by the officials of the San  Gabriel Mission &quot;to graze their animals on the ocean side of Los Angeles in order not to infringe on Mission lands.&quot; As a result, the settlers, or ''pobladores,'' drove some of their cattle to the &quot;lush pasture lands near Centinela Springs,&quot; and the first construction there was done by one [[Cornelio Avila#Antonio Ygnacio Avila|Ygnacio Avila]], who received a permit in 1822 to build a &quot;corral and hut for his herders.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|unpaged [xiv]|date=May 2009}}
[[Image:CentinelaAdobe-1890.jpg|thumb|left|Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela Adobe, 1889]]
Later Avila constructed a three-room adobe on a slight rise overlooking the creek that ran from Centinela Springs all the way to the ocean. According to the LAOkay web site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Things To Do In Los Angeles |work=LAOkay.com |url=http://www.laokay.com/AdobeSites.htm#Inglewood }}&lt;/ref&gt; this adobe was built where the present baseball field is in the park. It no longer exists.

In 1834 Ygnacio Machado, one of the sons of Jose Machado, built the [[Centinela Adobe]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|unpaged [xv]|date=May 2009}} which sits on a rise above the present 405 [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]] and is used as the headquarters of the Centinela Valley Historical Society. [http://www.cityofinglewood.org/depts/rec/centinela_adobe/default.asp] Two years later, Waddingham writes, Ygnacio&lt;ref&gt;Waddingham used the spelling ''Ignacio'' for both Avila and Machado.&lt;/ref&gt; was granted the {{convert|2220|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela]] even though this land had already been claimed by Avila.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|unpaged [xv]|date=May 2009}}

====Through the years====
[[Inglewood Park Cemetery]], a widely used cemetery for the entire region, was founded in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inglewood Park Cemetery: Living Heritage |work=Inglewood Park Cemetery |url=http://www.inglewoodparkcemetery.org/heritage.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city has been home to the [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]] since 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hollywood Park: About |work=Hollywood Park |url=http://www.hollywoodpark.com/about/history.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Fosters Freeze]], the first [[Soft Serve]] ice cream chain in California, was founded by George Foster  in 1946 in Inglewood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fosters Freeze: Company History |work=Fosters Freeze |url=http://www.fostersfreeze.com/Company.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inglewood was named an [[All-America City]] by the [[National Civic League]] in 1989 and yet again recently in 2009 for its visible progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Past Winners of the All-America City Award |work=National Civic League |url=http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners_1980s.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ku Klux Klan====
{{Main|Ku Klux Klan in Inglewood, California}}

Ku Klux Klan activities in Inglewood during the 20th century were highlighted by the 1922 arrest and trial of 37 men, most of them masked, for a night-time raid on a suspected [[rum-running|bootlegger]] and his family. The raid led to the shooting death of one of the culprits, an Inglewood police officer.  A jury returned a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict for all defendants who completed the trial. It was this scandal, according to the ''Los Angeles Times,'' that eventually led to the outlawing of the [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] in California.&lt;ref name=LAT19490521&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=418321431&amp;sid=4&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP &quot;Ex-Klan Chief Dies After Traffic Row; Knife Fight With Truck Driver Following Collision Proves Fatal for Gus Price, 64.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' May 21, 1949]&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan had a chapter in Inglewood as late as October 1931.

====African-American influence====
âNo blacks had ever lived in Inglewood,â Gladys Waddingham wrote,&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|59|date=May 2009}}  but by 1960, âthey lived in great numbers along its eastern borders. This came to the great displeasure of the predominantly white residents already residing in Inglewood. In 1960, the census counted only 29 'Negroes' among Inglewood's 63,390 residents. Not a single black child attended the city's schools. Real estate agents refused to show homes to blacks. A rumored curfew kept blacks off the streets at night. Inglewood was a prime target because of its [previous] history of restrictions.â âFair housing and school busing were the main problems of 1964. The schools were not prepared to handle racial incidents, even though any that occurred were very minor. Adults held many heated community meetings, since the Blacks objected to busing as much as did the Whites.â&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|61|date=May 2009}} In 1969, an organization called âMorningside Neighborsâ changed its name to âInglewood Neighbors&quot; &quot;in the hope of promoting more integration.â&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|63|date=May 2009}}

On July 22, 1970, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Max F. Deutz ordered Inglewood schools to desegregate in response to a suit filed by 19 parents.&lt;ref name=LAT19700902&gt;&quot;Parents Lose Plea in Inglewood Suit,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' September 2, 1970, page D-2&lt;/ref&gt; At least since 1965, said Deutz, the Inglewood school board had been aware of a growing influx of black families into its eastern areas but had done nothing about the polarization of its pupils into an eastern black area and a western white one.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Inglewood Order,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' July 26, 1970, page F-5&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, he rejected an appeal by four parents who said the school board was not responsible for the segregation but that the blacks &quot;selected their places of residence by voluntary choice.&quot;&lt;ref name=LAT19700902/&gt;

The first black principal among the 18 Inglewood schools was Peter Butler at La Tijera Elementary,&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|66|date=May 2009}} and in 1971, Waddingham wrote, âStormy racial meetings in 1971â included a charge by âsome [[real estate]] men in the overflowing Crozier Auditoriumâ that the Human Relations Commission was acting like âthe Gestapo.â&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|67|date=May 2009}} In that year, Loyd Sterling Webb, president of ''Inglewood Neighbors'', became the first black officeholder when voters elected him to the school board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=601423232&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=10&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP &quot;Negro Elected to Inglewood Public Office,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' April 7, 1971, page 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Curtis Tucker Sr. was appointed as the first black City Council member.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|69|date=May 2009}} That year composer LeRoy Hurte, an [[African American|African-American]], took the baton of the Inglewood Symphony Orchestra and continued to work with it for 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|75|date=May 2009}}  [[Edward Vincent]] became Inglewoodâs first black mayor in 1980. In that decade Inglewood became the first city in California to declare the birthday of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as a holiday.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|76|date=May 2009}}

====Rise of Latino population====

The 1990 census showed that Hispanics in Inglewood had increased by 134 percent since 1980, the largest jump in the South Bay. Economic factors apparently played a role in where new arrivals settled, said David Heer, a USC professor of sociology and associate director of the university's Population Research Laboratory. &quot;Housing is generally less expensive here than elsewhere . . . and I would say that they receive a warmer welcome here,&quot; said Norm Cravens, assistant city manager in Inglewood, where the Anglo population dropped from nearly 21 percent in 1980 to 8.5 percent in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquestÂ­.umiÂ­.comÂ­.ezproxyÂ­.laplÂ­.org/pqdwebÂ­?did=61104958Â­&amp;sid=3Â­&amp;Fmt=3Â­&amp;clientId=13322Â­&amp;RQT=309Â­&amp;VName=PQD Janet-Rae Dupree, âCensus Shows Influx of Asians on Peninsula,â ''Los Angeles Times,'' February 28, 1991, page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000 census, blacks made up 47 percent of the city's residents (53,060 people), and Hispanics made up 46 percent (51,829), but the Census Bureau estimated that in 2007 the percentage of blacks had declined to 41 percent (48,252) and that of Hispanics of any race were at 52.5 percent (61,847). The white population declined from 19 percent (21,505) to 17.7 percent (20,853).&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFFacts?_event=Search&amp;geo_id=01000US&amp;_geoContext=01000US&amp;_street=&amp;_county=Inglewood&amp;_cityTown=Inglewood&amp;_state=04000US06&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry=  U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder figures for 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&amp;geo_id=16000US0636546&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US06%7C16000US0636546&amp;_street=&amp;_county=Inglewood&amp;_cityTown=Inglewood&amp;_state=04000US06&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=160&amp;_submenuId=factsheet_1&amp;ds_name=DEC_2000_SAFF&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry= U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder estimates for 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

But in that year, only one of the city's five City Council members was Latino, Jose Fernandez. There were no Latinos on the five-member Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lapl.org/pqdweb?did=62342343&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=13322&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD Hugo Martin, &quot;Latino Revolution Leaves Some City Councils Untouched,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' October 9, 2000, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'''s &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; project supplied these neighborhood statistics based on the 2000 census.&lt;ref name=LATMapping&gt;[http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/neighborhood/inglewood/  &quot;Inglewood&quot; entry on the ''Los Angeles Times'' &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The population was 112,482, or 12,330 people per square mile, among the highest densities for the [[South Bay]] and among the highest densities for the county. The percentage of black people was high for the county, and the population was moderately diverse. Median household income was $46,574, low for both the South Bay and for the county. The median age was 29, young for the county; the percentage of residents aged 10 or under was among the county's highest. Three people, on the average, lived in each household â high for the South Bay but about average for the county. There was a higher percentage of families headed by single parents than elsewhere in the county. The percentage of veterans who served during 1975-89 and 1990-99 was among the county's highest.

===Schools history===
In 1888, a school district was organized, trustees were elected and a building was chosen. The school opened on May 21 that year on the second floor of a [[livery stable]] on Grevillea Avenue between Regent Street and Orchard (today's Florence Avenue), with 17 boys and 16 girls. The first teacher was Minnie Walker, a graduate of Los Angeles State Normal  School. The schoolroom, named Bucephalus Hall, after a horse belonging to town founder Daniel Freeman, was also used for community meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|6|date=May 2009}}

Meanwhile, a permanent school building was erected on Grevillea Avenue a block to the south, between Regent and Queen. It remained Inglewood's only school until 1911.  It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|6 and 26|date=May 2009}}

The [[Centinela Valley Union High School District]] was organized in 1904 to bring [[secondary education]] to the town. Inglewood High opened in two rooms of the school building with 15 students taught by Nina Martin, principal, and Anna McClelland. Four years later, a new building rose on {{convert|9.5|acre|m2}} of land, and the first graduation of one boy and four girls took place in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|13â14|date=May 2009}}
Until 1912 there was a new principal every year at the [[grammar school]], but on May 8 of that year George W. Crozier was named principal, and he held the post for 20 years. The school was renamed in his honor in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|20|date=May 2009}} In 1913, George M. Green was appointed principal of Inglewood Union High School; he retired from that position in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|22|date=May 2009}}

In 1914 voters approved bonds for high school improvement. Four more buildings and a [[Power station|power plant]] were erected, &quot;joined by walks and arcades.&quot; The improvement included a &quot;five-room model flat in the Home Economics Building.&quot; Nine acres of land were bought at Kelso Avenue and Damask (now Inglewood Avenue) for an experimental agricultural statement, thenceforth known as &quot;The Farm.&quot; There were gardens, an orchard and an alfalfa field. In 1915 Inglewood High won a first-place Los Angeles County prize for its beautiful ivy-covered brick buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|24|date=May 2009}} These buildings were destroyed in 1953 to make room for new ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|unpaged [58c]|date=May 2009}}

In the mid-1920s, the high school district stretched all the way south to El Segundo, so two women teachers were asked to live in El Segundo and ride the school buses with the students every day to and from that city â for an extra dollar a day in pay. In 1923 girls adopted a school uniform, &quot;a dark blue skirt with a white middy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|30|date=May 2009}}

In 1925 a new fine arts building for the high school was erected on the southwest corner of Grevillea and Manchester, replacing the Truax Candy Kitchen,&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|34|date=May 2009}} but it was severely damaged by the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake|Long Beach earthquake]] of 1933. It was &quot;later rebuilt with  WPA help but lost its magnificent stairway and all its fireplaces.&quot; Temporary classrooms were built on Olive Street, &quot;all too cold in winter and too hot most of the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|41|date=May 2009}}

The athletic field on the west side of the campus, later called Badenoch Field, was used for physical education and sporting events. In 1937, agricultural classes were ended at the Farm and Sentinel Field was dedicated there for sports activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|30|date=May 2009}} By 1938 there were more than 3,000 students and 141 teachers at the high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|43|date=May 2009}}

The &quot;startling news&quot; of 1948 was the dismissal &quot;of the entire administrative staff at Inglewood High School, beginning with Principal James R. Haines.&quot; He was replaced by Forrest Murdoch of Everett, Washington, as superintendent and Fred Heisner as principal.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|49|date=May 2009}}

In 1952, another secondary school campus in Inglewood was opened in the east side neighborhood of Morningside Park as [[Morningside High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|55|date=May 2009}} Center Park School of Los Angeles became part of the Inglewood School District in 1961 when its area (Crenshaw-Imperial) was annexed to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|59|date=May 2009}} In the 1970s, its name was changed to Worthington School to honor Frances and William Worthington.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|74|date=May 2009}}

==Religion==
In 2007 the area served by the Inglewood post office (including Lennox) had 98 churches, temples, mosques, chapels and other houses of worship, according to the AreaConnect.com Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inglewood Churches and Religion (Inglewood, CA) |work=areaConnect |publisher=MDNH, Inc. |url=http://inglewood.areaconnect.com/churches.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first church service was held on April 22, 1888, in the Inglewood House hotel on  Commercial Street (today's La Brea Boulevard), popularly called Mrs. Belden's Boarding House, when Inglewood had only 300 residents and 112 registered voters. Later services were in Bucephalus Hall, but eventually the congregation moved to Hyde Park, which left Inglewood with no church. On January 19, 1890, Inglewood's first permanent church â Presbyterian â was established on Market Street. A bit later the [United] Brethren constructed a building on South Market Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|6, 10, and 17|date=May 2009}}

In 1907, a group of Episcopalians began services in a private home, and a few years later the first Catholic services were held in Bank Hall.  In 1910 the Presbyterians moved their two buildings, a sanctuary and a manse,  to the corner of Grevillea and Nutwood &quot;because the streetcars [on Market Street] were so noisy and threw so much dust and sand fleas in the windows.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|14 and 17|date=May 2009}}

In 1923 St. John Chrysostom Catholic Church was founded.  The current church at the intersection of Centinela and Florence was built in 1959 and is the tallest point in the city.  It is the largest congregation in the city, consisting of almost 10,000 registered families.  Next door is St. John Chrysostom School, educating children since 1927 from Pre-K through 8th grade.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

By 1940, the Methodists had built a structure at Manchester and La Brea, but in that year they moved to a new building at Kelso and Spruce. &lt;ref name=&quot;GW&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|46 and 57|date=May 2009}}

The annual Open Studios event features &quot;drawing, painting, photography and more,&quot; under the general supervision of the Inglewood Cultural Arts organization, aided by the number of artists moving into the community.  The first year of the event saw six artists featured, but at the November 2011 event &quot;more than 30&quot; were expected, said Renee Fox, gallery director at the Beacon Arts Building on North La Brea Avenue. The structure has been turned into 14 artists' studios, with 16 more to be added by the end of 2011. A nearby former auto showroom has also been turned over to artsts.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Thornburg, &quot;Open Studios Blossoms With Promise,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 5, 2011, page E-2&lt;/ref&gt;
