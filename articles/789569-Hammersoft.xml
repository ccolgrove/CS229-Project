'''William V. &quot;Bill&quot; Bell''' is the current [[mayor]] of [[Durham, North Carolina]]. Bell holds a [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master's degree]] in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Howard University]] and [[New York University]], respectively.

Formerly a senior engineer for [[IBM]], Bell was first elected to the [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] Board of  Commissioners in 1972, where he served until 1994, and again from 1996 to 2000. He was the chairman of the Durham County Commissioners from 1982 to 1994. Bell was first elected mayor of Durham in 2001 and was re-elected in 2003 and in 2005.

Bell is currently Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of [http://www.udicdc.org/default.htm UDI Community Development Corp.], a [[non-profit organization]]. He is a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml| title=Mayors Against Illegal Guns: Coalition Members}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[bi-partisan]] group with a stated goal of &quot;making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.&quot; The Coalition is co-chaired by [[Boston]] Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] and [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

==2007 Mayor Re-election Campaign==
In 2007, Bell was challenged by Republican [[Thomas Stith, III]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/627449.html newsobserver.com | Local election season cranks up Friday&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/632652.html newsobserver.com | Durham councilman takes on mayor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Stith attacked Bell over several city issues including violence. During the weekend of October 13 and October 14, two people were murdered in Durham. On October 15, Bell tried to calm the public about the murders, claiming the city was safe and the weekend murders were not random. The next day, Stith went after Bell, pointing out that Durham's murder rate was up nearly 50 percent over the previous year. Stith and Bell continued to argue over how to deal with Durham crime. Stith consistently claimed that he would fight crime more consistently than Bell had, while Bell said that Stith had six years on the town council to do that. Stith said he wanted to see more police officers on the streets, while Bill Bell said the current police officers are well equipped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=local&amp;id=5710458 abc11.com: Recent Durham murders at the center of mayoral race 10/16/07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/news/durham/story/738320.html# newsobserver.com | Mayor's race locked in on crime&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2007, after lead was found in Durham drinking water, Stith sent out a campaign mailer that said in bold letters: &quot;'''Bill Bell knew and didn't tell us our water was dangerous to drink.'''&quot; Bell responded to this by saying &quot;That mailer sent out by Thomas Stith was a complete lie&quot;. Bell also said that Stith had no leadership experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/630/story/747390.html newsobserver.com | Durham mayoral candidates tangle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was re-elected in the November 6, 2007 election, getting 58% of the vote as opposed to Stith's 42%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/political/page/1992591/?group=durham Election Results :: WRAL.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/630/story/762893.html newsobserver.com | Bell turns back Stith in Durham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
It was later revealed that Bell endorsed and donated money to now-disgraced, former district attorney [[Mike Nifong]] during his reelection campaign surrounding the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse case]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A165525&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell also has been accused of being anti-preservation, as his company, UDI, gets many Durham contracts to demolish historic structures.
