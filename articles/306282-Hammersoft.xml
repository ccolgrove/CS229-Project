'''Wade Anthony Boggs''' (born June 15, 1958) is an American former professional [[baseball]] [[third baseman]]. He spent his 18-year baseball career primarily with the [[Boston Red Sox]], but also played for the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. His hitting in the 1980s and 1990s made him a perennial contender for [[American League]] batting titles, in much the same way as his [[National League]] contemporary [[Tony Gwynn]]. Boggs was elected to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004 and the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005|2005]]. With 12 straight [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances, Boggs is third only to [[Brooks Robinson]] and [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] in number of consecutive appearances as a third baseman. In 1999, he ranked number 95 on the ''[[Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team.

Boggs, a 1976 graduate of [[Plant High School]] in [[Tampa, Florida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Famous Faces|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=May 30, 2010|page=4E}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently resides in the [[Tampa Palms, Tampa, Florida|Tampa Palms]] neighborhood of Tampa.

==Minor league career==
Boggs played in the [[longest professional baseball game|longest game in professional baseball history]] as a member of the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] in 1981 against [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and the [[Rochester Red Wings]]. 

&quot;The Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings, two teams from the Triple-A International League, played the longest game in professional baseball history. It lasted for 33 innings over eight hours and 25 minutes. 32 innings were played from 18 to 19 April 1981 at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.&quot;(Wikipedia-Longest professional baseball game).

==Major league career==
===Boston Red Sox===
A left-handed hitter, Boggs won five batting titles starting in {{by|1983}}. He also batted .349 in his rookie year which would have won the batting title, but was 121 plate appearances short of the required minimum of 502. From {{by|1982}} to {{by|1988}}, Boggs hit below .349 only once, hitting .325 in {{by|1984}}. From 1983 to {{by|1989}}, Boggs rattled off seven consecutive seasons in which he collected 200 or more hits, an American League record for consecutive 200-hit seasons that was later matched and surpassed by Seattle's [[Ichiro Suzuki]]. Boggs also had six seasons with 200 or more hits, 100+ runs and 40+ doubles. Although he would not win another batting title after 1988 (his batting title that year broke [[Bill Madlock]]'s Major League record of four by a third baseman), he regularly appeared among the league leaders in hitting.

In 1986, Boggs made it to the [[1986 World Series|World Series]] with the Red Sox, but they lost to the [[New York Mets]] in seven games. The photo of him  [http://www.georgekalinsky.com/images/team/index4.html fighting back tears], taken by [[George Kalinsky]], photographer for the Mets, emblemized the emotions of many Red Sox fans after their team's loss at [[Shea Stadium]].

===New York Yankees===
In {{by|1992}}, Boggs slumped to .259 &amp;ndash; one of only three times in his career that he failed to reach .300 &amp;ndash; and at the end of the season he left the Red Sox, with whom he had spent his entire career to that point. He was heavily pursued by two teams: the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[Yankees â Red Sox rivalry|arch-rival]] of the Red Sox, the [[New York Yankees]] - he chose the Yankees when they added the third year to the contract that the Dodgers would not offer. Boggs went on to be awarded three straight all-star appearances, had four straight .300-plus seasons, and even collected two [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Awards]] for his defense.

In 1996, Boggs helped the Yankees to their first World Series title in 18 years. It was the only World Series title earned by Boggs.
At a key juncture in the 4th game of the series, in the 10th inning, Boggs's &quot;sharp eye and patience at the plate&quot; enabled him to draw a bases loaded walk in the 10th inning of a tie game, driving in the winning run and shifting the momentum of the series in favor of the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958&lt;/ref&gt; After the Yankees won the series in game 6, Boggs memorably celebrated by jumping on the back of an [[NYPD]] horse, touring the field with his index finger in the air - despite his self-professed fear of horses.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
Boggs signed with the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] for the final two seasons of his career, in 1999 collecting his 3,000th hit. Despite his reputation as a singles hitter with limited power, he is one of only two players whose 3,000th hit was a [[home run]],&lt;ref name=&quot;library&quot;/&gt; and was the only one until [[Derek Jeter]] hit his on July 9, 2011. The historic ball was caught in the right field stands of [[Tropicana Field]] by Mike Hogan, a sports information director at the [[University of South Florida]], who gave it back to Boggs at the conclusion of the game. Hogan had moved to Tampa just 10 days before the event. Boggs retired in {{by|1999}} after sustaining a knee injury, leaving with a career batting average of .328 and 3,010 hits. A yellow seat among the rest of the Tropicana's blue seats marks where the ball landed in right field, with a small metal plate noting it as the area that the ball landed.

While not unique among non-pitchers, Boggs also recorded a few innings pitching at the Major League level. His main pitch was a [[knuckleball]], which he used 16 times (along with one [[fastball]]) in one shutout inning for the Yankees against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] in a 1997 game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/21/sports/boggs-and-his-knuckler-are-the-stars-of-the-show.html|date= 1997-08-21|title= Boggs and His Knuckler Are the Stars of the Show|accessdate= 2010-05-24 |work= New York Times | first=Jack | last=Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His own style included mental preparedness techniques, which consisted in visualizing four at-bats each evening before a game and imagining himself successfully getting four hits.

As of June 8, 1986, over the course of the previous 162 games (equivalent to a full season, though across two seasons) Boggs was hitting .400, with 254 hits in 635 at-bats.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Globe, June 9, 1986. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Boggs &amp;ndash; who was up for a new contract following the season &amp;ndash; hit 24 home runs, the most in any year of his career.

On April 7, 2000 his #12 was retired by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/feats10.shtml|title= Retired Uniform Numbers in the American League|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=Baseball Almanac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he has not had his number retired by the Boston Red Sox, he was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/history/feature_hall_of_fame.jsp|title= Red Sox Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=RedSox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boggs was known for his [[superstition]]s. He ate [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] before every game ([[Jim Rice]] once called Boggs &quot;chicken man&quot;), woke up at the same time every day, took exactly 100 ground balls in practice, took batting practice at 5:17, and ran sprints at 7:17.&lt;ref name=&quot;library&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958|title= The Ballplayers - Wade Boggs Biography |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=BaseballLibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home dugout. He drew the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word &quot;[[Chai (symbol)|Chai]]&quot;, meaning &quot;life&quot;, in the batter's box before each at-bat, though he is not [[Jew]]ish.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rundown.'' &gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/aug/050806.waitwait.html |title= Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me|accessdate=2008-07-25 }} NPR. August 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Boggs is rumored to have once drunk 60-70 beers during a cross country flight, a story which originally received national attention via a sign in the background of an episode of [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College Gameday]] before a [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] vs [[Virginia Tech football|Virginia Tech]] football game. [[Tony Kornheiser]] and [[Michael Wilbon]] questioned Boggs on an episode of ESPN's [[Pardon the Interruption]]. According to Boggs  &quot;it was nothing to be proud of&quot; and &quot;let's just say it was a few [[Miller Lite]]s.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Gx8OmO9Rk|title=Wade Boggs likes beer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life outside baseball==
===The Margo Adams affair and palimony lawsuit===
Boggs garnered non-baseball related media attention in 1989 for his four-year extramarital affair with Margo Adams, a California [[mortgage broker]]. After Boggs ended the relationship in 1988, Adams filed a $12 million [[lawsuit]] for [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] and [[Breach of contract|breach of oral contract]]. She argued that Boggs had verbally agreed to compensate her for lost income and services performed while accompanying Boggs on road trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D6133EF930A35750C0A96F948260 |title=THE LAW; At the Bar |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | first=David | last=Margolick | date=1989-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boggs' reputation was further sullied when Adams agreed to an interview with [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'' magazine]] in which she discussed intimate details of her time with Boggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D7123FF930A15751C0A96F948260|title= BASEBALL; Gossip Checks In At Red Sox Camp |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | first=Murray | last=Chass | date=1989-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While acknowledging the affair, Boggs went on the offensive in order to combat the wave of negative press, denying many of the claims made by Adams. Boggs' rebuttal included an appearance on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' in which he presented his side of the story to [[Barbara Walters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D81F3EF936A15750C0A96F948260|title= SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Boggs Speaks Out |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | date=1989-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1989, an [[appellate court|appeals court]] threw out $11.5 million of the initial lawsuit, ruling that Adams could not seek compensation for emotional distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7D7103FF934A15751C0A96F948260|title= Big Hit for Boggs in Court |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | date=1989-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining demand for $500,000 was settled out of court later that year for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D9103CF930A25751C1A96F948260|title= SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL; Boggs Settlement |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=New York Times | date=1989-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hall of Fame plaque cap logo controversy===
Before his retirement, Boggs was plagued by newspaper reports that the expansion Devil Rays gave him financial compensation in return for selecting a Devil Rays cap for his plaque at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]], though he has denied that any such condition was part of his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/hallfame/2005-01-06-boggs-sandberg-questions_x.htm |title = Boggs, Sandberg field queries as new Hall of Famers |accessdate = 2008-05-21 |work = www.usatoday.com |publisher = USA Today | first1=Craig | last1=Muder | date=2005-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of those reports (and other rumors that teams were offering number retirement, money, or organizational jobs in exchange for the cap designation) the Hall decided in 2001 to change its practice of deferring to players' wishes regarding cap logo selection, and reinforced the Hall's authority to determine with which cap the player would be depicted. Boggs is wearing a Boston cap on his plaque.

===Family===
Boggs's mother died in June 1986 due to a car accident in Tampa while he was with the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Red Sox - Wade Boggs: 2005 Hall of Fame inductee|publisher=Boston Globe|author=Shaughnessy, Dan|date=July 31, 2005|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/07/31/wade_boggs_2005_hall_of_fame_inductee|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after her death, Boggs and his father bought a fish camp on [[U.S. 301]] just south of [[Hawthorne, Florida]] they named ''Finway'', which his father operated until shortly before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Florida Heritage Highway CMC Meeting|date=March 4, 2009|url=http://www.scenicus441.com/Agenda%20and%20Minutes/March_2009_minutes.pdf|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wade and his wife Debbie have two children, Brett and Meagann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/07/28/Sports/She_s_been_his_closes.shtml |last=Nipps |first=Emily |date=28 July 2005 |title=She's been his closest fan for 30 years |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade Boggs was named one of the Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by [[Men's Fitness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mensfitness.com/sports_and_recreation/athletes/181 Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrestling===
As a baseball player, Boggs made an appearance for the [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1988. He appeared in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] with wrestler [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] in which Perfect played baseball. 19 years later in 2007, Boggs inducted the late Perfect into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].
