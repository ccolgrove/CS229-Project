* '''American exceptionalism.''' There is a sense in which America sometimes sees itself as qualitatively different from other countries and therefore cannot be judged by the same standard as other countries; this sense is sometimes termed [[American exceptionalism]].

Others suggest U.S. should adopt a policy of [[realpolitik]] and work with any type of government who can be helpful.]]

* '''Other criticisms.''' The U.S. has been criticized for its historical treatment of native Americans. For example, the treatment of [[Cherokee Indians]] in the [[Trail of Tears]] in which hundreds of Indians died in a forced evacuation from their homes in the southeastern area, along with massacres, displacement of lands, swindles, and breaking treaties. It has been criticized for the war with [[Mexico]] in the 1840s which some see as a theft of land. It was the first and only nation to use a nuclear bomb in wartime. It failed to admit [[Jews]] fleeing persecution from [[Europe]] at the beginning of [[World War II]], as well as immoral policy for the [[Vietnam War]].

* '''Lack of vision.''' [[Zbigniew Brzezinski|Brzezinski]] criticized the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] presidency as having a foreign policy which lacked &quot;discipline and passion&quot; and subjected the U.S. to &quot;eight years of drift.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws21dec216d&quot;/&gt; The short-term election cycle coupled with the inability to stick with long term decisions motivates presidents to focus on acts which will appease the citizenry and avoid difficult long-term choices.

* '''Presidency is over-burdened.''' Presidents have not only foreign policy responsibilities, but sizeable domestic duties too. In addition, the presidency is the head of a [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]]. As a result, it is tough for one person to manage disparate tasks, in one view. Critics suggest [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] was overburdened, which prevented him from doing a good job of oversight regarding the [[IranâContra affair]]. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski|Brzezinski]] suggested in ''[[Foreign Affairs (magazine)|Foreign Affairs]]'' that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama|Obama]] is similarly overburdened.&lt;ref name=tws11janxzs&gt;{{cite news

* '''Dollars drive foreign policy.''' There are indications that decisions to go to war in [[Iraq]] were motivated by oil interests; for example, a British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the &quot;Bush administration is heavily involved in writing Iraq's oil law&quot; which would &quot;allow Western oil companies contracts of up to 30 years to pump oil out of Iraq, and the profits would be tax-free.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws22dec111dxx&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws21dec116sfpoiui&quot;/&gt; Whether motivated by oil or not, U.S. policy appears to much of the Arab world to have been motivated by oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;tws22dec216oopp&quot;/&gt; Some critics assert the U.S. decision to build the [[Panama Canal]] was motivated largely by business interests despite claims that it's motivated to &quot;spread democracy&quot; and &quot;end oppression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws22dec111dxx&quot;/&gt; [[Andrew Bacevich]] suggests policy is directed by &quot;wealthy individuals and institutions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws21dec214e4&quot;&gt;{{cite news

* '''Presidents may lack experience.''' Since the constitution requires no prior experience in diplomacy, government, or military service, it is possible to elect presidents with scant foreign policy experience. Clearly the record of past presidents confirms this, and that presidents who have had extensive diplomatic, military, and foreign policy experience have been the exception, not the rule. In recent years, presidents had relatively more experience in such tasks as peanut farming, [[Show business|acting]] and governing [[State government (United States)|governorships]] than in international affairs. It has been debated whether voters are sufficiently skillful to assess the foreign policy potential of presidential candidates, since foreign policy experience is only one of a long list of attributes in which voters tend to select candidates. The second [[George W. Bush|Bush]] was criticized for inexperience in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' for being &quot;not versed in international relations and not too much interested.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws21dec314a&quot;/&gt;

* '''Presidency has too much authority.''' In contrast to criticisms that presidential attention is divided into competing tasks, some critics charge that presidents have too much power, and that there is the potential for [[tyranny]] or [[fascism]]. Some presidents circumvented the national security decision-making process.&lt;ref name=&quot;tws21dec314a&quot;/&gt; Critics such as [[Dana D.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Tuchman Mathews|Mathews]] suggests the risk of nuclear terrorism remains unprevented.&lt;ref name=&quot;tws22dec216oopp&quot;/&gt;. In 1999 during the Kosovo War, the US supported the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a terrorist organization that was recognized as such by the US some years before. Right before the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia took place, the US took down the KLA from the list of internationally recognized terrorist organizations in order to justify their aid and help to the KLA.

* '''Historical instances of ineffective policies.''' Generally during the 19th century, and in early parts of the 20th century, the U.S. pursued a policy of [[isolationism]] and generally avoided entanglements with European powers. After [[World War I]], ''[[Time Magazine]]'' writer John L. Steele thought the U.S. tried to return to an isolationist stance, but that this was unproductive. He wrote: &quot;The anti-internationalist movement reached a peak of influence in the years just before [[World War II]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tws22dec116ex&quot;/&gt; But Steele questioned whether this policy was effective; regardless, isolationism ended quickly after the surprise attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in 1941.&lt;ref name=tws22dec116ex/&gt; Analysts have wondered whether the U.S. pursued the correct strategy with [[Japan]] before [[World War II]]; by denying Japan access to precious raw materials, it is possible that U.S. policy triggered the surprise attack and, as a result, the U.S. had to fight a two-front war in both the [[Far East]] as well as [[Europe]] during [[World War II]]. While it may be the case that the [[Middle East|Mideast]] is a difficult region with no easy solutions to avoiding conflict, since this volatile region is at the junction of three continents; still, many analysts think U.S. policy could have been improved substantially. The U.S. waffled; there was no vision; presidents kept changing policy. Public opinion in different regions of the world thinks that, to some extent, the [[9/11]] attacks were an outgrowth of substandard U.S. policy towards the region.&lt;ref name=tws21dec111&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The US supported the secession of Kosovo form FR Yugoslavia in 1999 and continued to support its independence since. Such unilateral policies have broken European and international treaties but have been dismissed as unique by the US. Such unilateral secession support has triggered many notable secessionist uprisings in Spain, Belgium, Georgia, Russia, China, among others that have secessionist movements. However, the US has dismissed any similarities between those secessionist movements and Kosovo, a clear contradiction.
