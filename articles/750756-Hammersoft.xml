The '''University of West Florida''', also known as '''West Florida''' and '''UWF''', is a mid-sized public university located in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. UWF is a member institution of the [[State University System of Florida]]. The University of West Florida is a Research University, which specializes in engineering and the humanities. UWF is a space-grant institution that was established in 1963. The University of West Florida sits on the third largest campus in the State University System, {{convert|1600|acre|km2}}, and its campus is a natural preserve that is bordered by two rivers and Escambia Bay. The University of West Florida is an exceptionally progressive university in terms of technology and environmental policy, as exemplified by their investment in the BEST house and their investments in solar powered student housing. The University of West Florida is known for its small class sizes and its intimate, private school like educational atmosphere, which distinguishes it from the larger universities in the State University System.&lt;ref&gt;http://uwf.edu/uwfMain/press/topstoryarch.cfm?emailID=19345&lt;/ref&gt; The university's mascot is an [[Argonauts|Argonaut]], and the school's logo is the [[Nautilus|Chambered Nautilus]].

==History==
[[Image:Typfoil1.jpg|thumb|225px|Foliage at UWF]]
[[Image:PIMG0125.JPG|thumb|225px|The entrance of the John C. Pace library]]
In 1962, the Florida Legislature authorized the State Board of Education to locate a state university in [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]]. Following a feasibility study which demonstrated the need for an institution of higher education in Northwest Florida, funds were allocated for the development of the University of West Florida. The founding President was [[Harold Crosby]]. UWF became the sixth state university of the [[State University System of Florida]], which today consists of eleven institutions of higher learning.

Ground was broken on April 16, 1965, and in the same year the [[Chambered Nautilus]] was adopted as the official UWF emblem. The initial building program, consisted of an administration classroom complex, library, Commons building, science complex, humanities building, audiovisual facility, utilities building and 15 student housing buildings accommodating approximately 500 resident students. Current facilities at UWF include: 35 academic buildings, 21 student services facilities, 25 dormitories, two university village student apartment complexes and 20 plant support facilities. In 1997, {{convert|600|acre|km2}} additional were acquired which brought the [[Pensacola]] campus to {{convert|1600|acre|km2}}, the second largest main campus in the State University System.

Initially, the university was organized in three resident or cluster colleges: Alpha, Gamma and Omega. Not only were academic disciplines assigned to these colleges, but [[student government]], cultural programs and other activities were conducted within the colleges. UWF was originally an upper-level institution enrolling juniors, seniors, and graduate students. The first students began classes in the fall of 1967, and the first commencement exercises were held in June 1968 where 58 students received degrees. In 1969, the university undergraduate programs were accredited by [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) and the first master's degree programs were established.

In July 1979, the university organized in a more traditional structure by establishing three colleges: Arts and Sciences, Business and Education. Following authorization by the [[Florida Legislature]], a lower division was established, and freshmen attended the university for the first time in the fall semester of 1983, boosting enrollment from 5,200 students to 5,920 students.

In July 1988, [[Computer Science]], a department within the College of Business, was identified as the Division of [[Computer Science]] as a stand alone and plans were begun to incorporate it into a fourth college, the College of Science and Technology. That decision was later reversed and computer science was moved to the School of Computer Science and Engineering within the College of Arts and Sciences. During the fall term of 1999, the colleges reorganized as the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business and the College of Professional Studies.

===Main campuses===
The main campus of {{convert|1600|acre|km2}} of rolling hills and natural woodland along the [[Escambia River]] is ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) north of downtown [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Its facilities have been designed to complement the natural forest and waterways. It is the largest library in the [[Northwest Florida]] area. In addition to the main library on the main campus north of [[Pensacola, Florida]], there is a branch library in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]]. It has 628,000 printed volumes, 1 million [[microfilm]]s and [[microfiche]]s, 3,000 serial subscriptions and nearly 2,000 online journal subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwf.edu/about.shtml|title=About the library|accessdate=2007-07-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070630234345/http://www.lib.uwf.edu/about.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UWF shares a branch campus in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., with [[Okaloosa-Walton College]], and has several centers and sites where academic programs and/or courses are taught. In addition, the University of West Florida has waterfront property on [[Santa Rosa Island, Florida|Santa Rosa Island]] that is available for recreational, academic, and research pursuits. The University also operates the NWFSC/UWF Fort Walton Beach Campus, the [[Eglin Air Force Base]] Center and the [[Hurlburt Field]] Center.  As a result, a significant number of UWF students have been military personnel assigned to [[NAS Pensacola]], [[NAS Whiting Field]], [[Eglin AFB]], [[Hurlburt Field]] and [[Duke Field]].  This is particularly true of commissioned officers at these installations pursuing postgraduate degrees outside of their normal duty hours.

===Online Campus===
UWF also maintains an [http://onlinecampus.uwf.edu/ '''Online Campus'''] with over '''400 online course sections each semester''' and '''28 fully online undergraduate, graduate and certificate programs''' that are available to students anywhere in the world. Acceptance to any of the fully online degree or certificate programs provides the opportunity to apply for an '''out-of-state tuition waiver''' that reduces out-of-state tuition to near that of in-state. The Online Campus provides students with an additional way to access education at UWF whether completing courses far away from the campus or selecting to take an online course to round out a semester.{Director, UWF Online Campus, 2011}

===Historic Pensacola Village===
{{Main|Historic Pensacola Village}}
In 2001, the university acquired [[Historic Pensacola Village|West Florida Historic Preservation, Inc]], the previously state-controlled group that manages the [[Historic Pensacola Village]]. A few years later, [[John C. Cavanaugh]] became the fourth president on July 15, 2002. Under his supervision the university has created several classes taught by and/or in conjunction with the staff at Historic Pensacola. The [[Clara Barkley Dorr House]] was also appropriated as a downtown home for the institute president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwf.edu/trustees/committees/finance/fm_040617.doc|title=Finance, Administration and Audit Committee Minutes - June 17, 2004|accessdate=2007-07-15|format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and organization==
The University of West Florida is a [[public university|public institution]], receiving most of its funding through state funds and [[tuition]]. A 13-member [[Board of Trustees]] governs the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwf.edu/trustees/|title=UWF Board of Trustees|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduate and graduate programs are divided into three Colleges, with the [[University of West Florida College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] being the largest and most complex, followed by the College of Professional Studies, and finally the College of Business.

In 2010 UWF opened a new multimillion dollar facility, home of the new School of Science and Engineering including the Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mathematics and Statistics, Physics, and Software Engineering programs.

The building includes prototype robot fabrication and testing laboratories, 3-D virtual reality simulators, a state-of-the-art holo deck and a glass wall atrium that helps put science into public view. This construction is based on [[Project Kaleidoscope]], a national initiative funded project by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[Keck Foundation]]. This collegiate facility is one of the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwf.edu/sse/|title=School of Science and Engineering - UWF|accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's mascot is a robot named PHLEN (PHenomenally Lifelike Eidetic Nerd) who is deployed to meet guests and give tours of the building's more advanced features.

===Underwater Archeology===
The shipwreck, which was discovered last summer in Pensacola Bay by two university students, is the remains of one of the colonization ships of the Tristan de Luna fleet that sank during a hurricane in 1559. The prehistoric sites at which we have conducted the most extensive investigations are an Early Woodland Stage Deptford shell midden on Pensacola Bay known as Hawkshaw (50 B.C.-A.D. 250) and a Middle Woodland Santa Rosa-Swift Creek shell ring on Escambia Bay (A.D. 400-650). UWF has one of the best underwater archaeology programs in the country because Pensacola has such rich, historically significant archaeological sites right in its own backyard. UWFâs graduate and undergraduate students gain hands-on experience that they simply would not have access to in other programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwf.edu/anthropology/research/|title=Underwater Archeology- UWF|accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

UWF hosts many opportunities for involvement through student clubs and organizations. Registered [[Student society|student organizations]], administered by the University Commons, include: academic clubs, Greek organizations, professional and honor societies, religious organizations and special interest groups. Additionally, UWF own property on Pensacola Beach. The said property is frequently used by students for research and recreation. Because UWF is situated in a wilderness preserve, students may rent canoes, kayaks, and water-ski on Escambia river at their leisure. UWFâs offers numerous mountain bike trails that are located on campus and may be used by students free of charge. The University of West Florida offers its students a wide variety of recreational activities that are located on campus.  

===Housing===
Over 2,000 students choose to live on campus. UWF offers traditional residence halls, small community residence halls, and University-owned apartment complexes. Single-student housing is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwf.edu/housing/|title=UWF Housing|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional residence halls are Argo Hall, Martin Hall, and Pace Hall which offer double and triple spaces;  the &quot;Southside Villages&quot; offer double and single spaces; student apartments are in University Village Student Apartments-East and University Village Student Apartments-West.

On June 3, 2009 ground was broken in order to build Heritage Hall, a new residence hall at UWF. Heritage Hall will be able to comfortably house around 250 students, and will cost around $12.9 million to build. It will be designed along the lines of a [[duplex (building)|duplex]]. The new dormitory will be outfitted with solar panels and, during daylight hours, will be powered exclusively by the sun. Construction is scheduled to be complete in Fall of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20090603/NEWS01/90603012/UWF+breaks+ground/|title=PNJ New Housing|accessdate=2007-07-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the great traditions at UWF is the inter-hall competition known as &quot;Battle of the HallStars&quot; which is held every October. The event features student teams from each of the areas competing in various field sports and spirit competitions, each team wears their hall colors to represent spirit and pride.
