The '''2010 Grand National''' (known as the [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] Grand National for sponsorship reasons) was the 163rd renewal of the world-famous [[Grand National]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] that took place at the [[Aintree Racecourse]] near [[Liverpool]], [[England]], on 10 April 2010.

The main race was held at 16:15 [[British Summer Time|BST]] and was won by [[Don't Push It]], ridden by [[Tony McCoy]], five lengths ahead of Black Apalachi in second, and twenty ahead of State of Play in third.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tony McCoy wins Grand National on Don't Push It&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/8611001.stm|title=Tony McCoy wins Grand National on Don't Push It|date=2010-04-10|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was McCoy's first win in the Grand National at his fifteenth attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Unreal McCoy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/8613763.stm|title=The Unreal McCoy|date=2010-04-10|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don't Push It started the race as 10-1 joint-favourite, having been backed down from 20-1 in the hours prior to the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tony McCoy wins Grand National on Don't Push It&quot; /&gt; In the process of winning, McCoy avoided equalling the record for most rides in the National without winning, held by Jeff King.

The main race was seen by the largest attendance at Aintree since [[2005 Grand National|2005]], with a crowd of 70,341 on the day, and a total of 150,426 attending over the course of the three-day meeting.&lt;ref&gt;www.aintree.co.uk/docLib/2009_pages010109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trivia==
For the first time since 2005, there were no equine fatalities in the main race. In each of the previous four years there was one casualty.

Plaisir d'Estruval and Prudent Honour both died instantly after jumping ''Valentine's'', the 13th fence in the Topham Chase on 9 April, a handicap over two miles and 5Â½ furlongs. Both horses broke their necks. Earlier the same day, in the grade one Melling Chase over standard chase fences on the Mildmay track, Schindlers Hunt was put down after fracturing a leg in a fall at the third fence. Schindlers Hunt's jockey Paddy Flood broke his collarbone in the fall; the other jockeys were unhurt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/09/deaths-grand-national-aintree Three horses die at Aintree] guardian.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gala_Coral_Group#Coral|Coral bookmakers]] took the decision to refund bets placed on race-day for King John's Castle. The horse was bidding to become the first grey to win the National since 1961,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/racing/article7093606.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Rob | last=Wright | title=King Johns Castle primed for Grand National glory | date=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but refused to run when the race started. Although under betting rules customers bets should have been classified as losers, Coral took the decision to make a goodwill refund gesture to their customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bettingpro.com/category/Racing/Coral-Refund-Stakes-on-King-Johns-Castle-2010041000145/ Coral Refund stakes on King Johns Castle]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jockeys and quotes==
Selected quotes from the jockeys including winner at the fifteenth attempt, Tony McCoy, 17-year-old Sam Twiston-Davies who was aiming to become the second-youngest winning jockey ever, and Nina Carberry attempting to be first female rider to win the race:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportinglife.com/racing/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=racing/10/04/10/RACING_National_Jockeys.html Quote...unquote] Sportinglife.com&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Tony McCoy''' (Don't Push It, first): &quot;If you get enough goes at something and you keep going, once you're in there you've always got a chance. I'm delighted for JP [McManus, owner] as he's the best supporter this game has ever had and ever will have, and I'm very privileged to ride a Grand National winner in his colours.&quot;

*'''Denis O'Regan''' (Black Apalachi, second): &quot;My fella's a tremendous horse and he gave me a tremendous feel. He just loves bowling along and loves this place. He was a bit keen early on but once he settled into a lovely rhythm he was fantastic. It's a pleasure to ride a horse like him round here.&quot;

*'''Paul Moloney''' (State Of Play, third): &quot;It was a serious run from a serious horse who's been very good to me - and he might win it next year, please God.&quot;

*'''Barry Geraghty''' (late replacement jockey for Big Fella Thanks, fourth): &quot;That was brilliant. He galloped from end to end, the best ride I've ever had round here. But if you can't have the winner then it's good to see AP [McCoy] win it.&quot;

*'''Sam Twiston-Davies''' (Hello Bud, fifth): &quot;That was brilliant. The horse has been a real star and has jumped from fence to fence.&quot;

*'''Nina Carberry''' (Character Building, seventh): &quot;He couldn't lay up and the plan was to give him a chance. I thought I had a really great chance of being in the money and in the first three over the Canal Turn, but he got tapped for toe and in the end I just got done for sixth. He ran a great race had it been softer he might have come back to them a bit more. Hopefully he'll come back next year.&quot;

Tony McCoy lined up as the most experienced rider in the race for the fourth consecutive year, having taken over as senior rider from Carl Llewellyn after the 2006 National. It had also been an honour he had shared for a time with [[Mick Fitzgerald]] and Paul Carberry. 2010 also marked McCoy's fifteenth ride in the National, a feat previously achieved by only nine other riders, however, defeat this year would have seen McCoy become only the seond rider to take fifteen rides in the race without ever winning. His ultimate victory saw this dubious honour remain solely Jeff King's.

At the opposite extreme, nine riders made their Grand National debut, though only one, Sam Twiston-Davies managed to complete the course, finishing fifth. Danny Cook's first National ended at the second fence while Ritchie McLernon, Brian Hughes, Roger Loughran, Tom Siddall, Harry Skelton and Tom Molloy were also taking part for the first time.

==Broadcasting==
As the [[Grand National]] was accorded the status as an event of national interest within the United Kingdom and was listed on the [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed &amp; Designated Events]], the event had to be shown on free-to-air terrestrial television in the UK. As with previous years the rights to broadcast the race were held by the [[BBC]] and the race, along with several others were shown on [[BBC One]]. It was also the first horse race in the UK to be broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on the [[BBC HD]] channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand National to be UK's first horse race broadcast in HD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/north-west-broadcasting/grand-national-to-be-uk's-first-horse-race-broadcast-in-hd-201003297776/|title=Grand National to be UK's first horse race broadcast in HD|date=2010-03-29|publisher=''HowDo''|accessdate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC's coverage was produced by [[Sunset and Vine]] who, with the aid of the SiS outside broadcast unit, provided coverage of fifteen races throughout the three-day meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/7578481/Grand-National-2010-Good-work-BBC-now-do-more-of-it.html  SIS OB support announcement for HD Grand National Broadcast]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clare Balding]] served as anchor presenter for the fifth consecutive year with Rishi Persad providing interviews from the jockey's room as well as taking a closer look at the horses in the paddock with [[Richard Dunwoody]]. [[Mick Fitzgerald]] guided viewers through the course as well as providing post-race analysis from all the build-up races. [[Richard Pitman]] provided nostalgia with interviews with several famous names from the history of the race, including an interview with his ex-wife [[Jenny Pitman]] while [[Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes]] interviewed spectators in the stands for unusual and interesting stories. [[John Parrott]] and Gary Wiltshire completed the team with news from the betting ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=109198  UK film and television news]&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary team for the 2010 Grand National consisted of [[Ian Bartlett]], [[Darren Owen]] and [[Jim McGrath (Australian commentator)|Jim McGrath]], who called the winner home for the thirteenth consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/8613378.stm  BBC closing stages]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time for six years that the team had been reduced from four to three with Tony O'Hehir being dropped in what the BBC called a cost-cutting exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/aintree-grand-national-bbc-cuts-grand-national-commentary-team/677988/ BBC announce three man commentary team]&lt;/ref&gt; As is tradition, anchor presenter Balding conducted the interviews with the winning connections while Bartlett, Dunwoody and Fitzgerald then took the viewers through a detailed rerun of the race.

BBC radio also covered the race live for the seventy-ninth time as part of its wider Five Live Sports broadcast. [[Mark Pougatch]] presented the programme live from Aintree with race commentary called by [[Cornelius Lysaght]] and [[John Hunt]]. The race was also covered by Racing UK into bookmakers' offices throughout the UK and Ireland using alternative camera shots from the BBC with their own commentary team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4aYO1YBpq0  Race coverage as broadcast to bookmakers]&lt;/ref&gt;
