'''''Pawn Stars''''' is an American [[reality television series]] on the [[History (TV channel)|History Channel]], produced in [[Manhattan]] by Leftfield Pictures. The series is filmed in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], where it chronicles the daily activities at the Gold &amp; Silver [[Pawn Shop]], a 24-hour [[family business]] operated by patriarch Richard Harrison (or &quot;The Old Man&quot;), his son Rick Harrison (who opened the shop with his father in 1988), Rick's son Corey (who has worked there since childhood), and Corey's childhood friend, Austin &quot;Chumlee&quot; Russell. The show, which became the network's highest rated show,&lt;ref name=CNNMoney&gt;Childers, Linda.

Reruns can be seen on History as well as its sister network [[Lifetime (TV channel)|Lifetime]], which added the show in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locatetv.com/tv/pawn-stars/6388433 ''Pawn Stars''], Locate TV, accessed December 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Harrison and Tim Keown.

The series depicts the staff's interactions with customers, who bring in a variety of artifacts to sell or pawn and who are shown haggling over the price and discussing its historical background, with narration provided by the Harrisons and occasionally Chumlee. The series also follows the [[interpersonal relationship|interpersonal conflicts]] among the cast. One reviewer referencing these conflicts described the show as a version of ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' &quot;hijacked by ''[[American Chopper]]'''s&quot; Teutul family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/living/51132932.html Lawrence, Christopher. &quot;Las Vegas pawnshop center of new reality series&quot;] ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''; July 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'' has offered a similar description, calling the show &quot;one part ''Antiques Roadshow'', a pinch of ''[[LA Ink]]'' and a dash of ''[[COPS (TV series)|COPS]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=TVGuide&gt;Moynihan, Rob. &quot;Summer's Guilty Pleasures&quot; ''[[TV Guide]]''; June 21, 2010; Page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Pawn Stars'' began with Brent Montgomery and Colby Gaines of Leftfield Pictures, who were struck by the array of eclectic and somewhat seedy pawn shops in Las Vegas during a 2008 weekend visit to the city. Thinking such shops might contain unique characters, they searched for a family-run shop on which to center a TV series, until they found the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop less than two miles from the [[Las Vegas Strip]],&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek&gt;Fixmer, Andy. [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_44/b4201108281805.htm &quot;Pawn Stars: Our Most Revealing Reality Show&quot;]. ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''. October 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; whose manager, Rick Harrison, had been trying unsuccessfully to pitch a show based on his shop for years,&lt;ref name=EW&gt;Smith, Grady. [http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/28/pawn-stars-rick-harrison-interview/ &quot;'Pawn Stars':&quot; Rick Harrison talks about cable's most unlikely hit!&quot;], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', June 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and who had been featured in the Las Vegas episode of ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvu6APT3JLY &quot;Pawn Stars circa 2003&quot;]. [[YouTube]], accessed Sep 19, 2009, July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The series, initially called ''Pawning History'', was originally to be broadcast on [[pay cable]], though the network interested in it desired a ''[[Taxicab Confessions]]''-style series. The format eventually evolved into the now-familiar family-oriented motif used on the series.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt; [[History (TV channel)|History]] president Nancy Dubac, who had been charged with creating programming with a more populist appeal to balance out the network's in-depth military programming, picked up the series, though she adjusted its storyline in order to bring it in line with the network's brand, which included the on-camera experts appraising the items brought into the Gold &amp; Silver, though she did not discourage the interpersonal conflicts among the show's stars.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt; The network renamed the show ''Pawn Stars'', believing that name to be more pleasing and easily remembered.&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;

Although jewelry is the most commonly pawned item at the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pezzed Off&quot;; ''Pawn Stars''; Episode 2.15; January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; most of the customers featured in episodes bring in a variety of vintage or antique items to the store, which has 12,000 items in its inventory as of July 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Face the Music|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|airdate=July 25, 2011|season=4|number=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5,000 of which are typically held on pawn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Wright Stuff|series=Pawn Stars|network=History|airdate=August 15, 2011|season=4|number=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode consists of segments devoted to approximately five or six of these items, in which either Rick, his son, Corey, or Harrison's father Richard (known as the &quot;Old Man&quot;), explain the historical facts behind the object. Whoever is evaluating the object goes over potential value with the customer, interspersed with an interview in which he explains the basis of his decision to the viewer. A price tag graphic at the bottom corner of the screen provides the ever-changing dollar amount as the two haggle over the item's price. When the Harrisons are unable to evaluate an object, they consult with a knowledgeable expert who can evaluate it to determine its authenticity and potential value and, in the case of items needing repair, the cost of restoration. Following that, they are shown haggling over price with the customer (except in the case of objects needing restoration, which Rick usually purchases in advance, taking a risk on the cost of restoration).&lt;ref&gt;Examples include the [[chronometer]] in &quot;Sharks and Cobra&quot; and the barber's chair in &quot;A Shot and a Shave&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpersonal narratives focusing on the relationship and conflicts among Rick, Corey, the Old Man, and Corey's childhood friend, Austin &quot;Chumlee&quot; Russell, who also works at the shop, are also shown. These usually pertain to arguments over the running of the shop, Rick and the Old Man questioning Corey's judgment,&lt;ref name=CoreySales/&gt;&lt;ref name=CoreyExpensive/&gt; and aspersions cast on Chumlee's intelligence and competence.&lt;ref name=ChumSmart/&gt; Before the second commercial break, a multiple choice trivia question pertaining to the shop or the cast members is shown, with the answer provided after the break.

In an October 2010 ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' interview, Rick Harrison indicated that talks were in progress for a fourth season.&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt; 

In July 2011, Harrison signed a record-breaking 80-episode renewal contract for four more seasons of the series.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt;

===Reception===
''Pawn Stars'' is History's highest-rated series.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt; An original episode broadcast on January 24, 2011 was watched by seven million viewers, the most-watched telecast ever on History, according to the network and Nielsen Media Research.&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;Seidman, Robert.

''TV Guide''. September 19, 2011. Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Christopher Long, reviewing the first season DVD for DVD Town, praised the series for its cast and the educational value of the items examined, calling it &quot;addictive&quot; and &quot;a big-time winner&quot;, and opined that it is the best show on the [[History Channel]] and perhaps cable.&lt;ref name=DVDTown/&gt; In one issue of ''[[TV Guide]]'', writer Rob Moynihan included the show in a list of &quot;guilty pleasures.&quot;&lt;ref name=TVGuide/&gt; April McIntyre of Monsters and Critics, whose negative view of pawn shops influenced her view of the series' setting, reviewed one episode of the series, which she labeled a &quot;cool ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]''&quot;. Though she found aspects of it interesting, she criticized what she perceived as an emphasis on cheap laughs at the expense of family [[patriarch]] Richard Harrison over the show's historical material, as well as Corey Harrison's weight. She ultimately saw potential for the series if aspects of it that she found to be in poor taste were curbed.&lt;ref name=McIntyre&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1490653.php/History_s_Pawn_Star_some_thoughts April MacIntyre &quot;History's Pawn Star$, some thoughts&quot; Monsters and Critics; July 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'''s Gary Strauss opined that the bickering among the Harrisons, as well as the customers seen in the shop, is &quot;alternately amusing and grating&quot;.

The series has also attracted some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, claim that the series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects in order to pay their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20100131/LIFESTYLE/1310324|title=Local pawn shops see more DVDs than diamonds|last=Nelson|first=Emily|date=January 31, 2010|work=The News-Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}

In 2010 Rick Harrison and the staff of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop were awarded the Pawnbroker of the Year Award by the National Pawnbroker's Association for bringing the industry greater recognition and a better image with the TV show.&lt;ref name=NewYorkPost/&gt;&lt;ref name=EW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpawnbrokers.com/a979106-pawn-stars-rick-harrison-awarded-pawnbroker.cfm &quot;Pawn Starsâ Rick Harrison Awarded &quot;Pawnbroker of the Year&quot; by the National Pawnbrokers Association&quot;] Nc Pawnbrokers; Accessed August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/blogs/luxe-life/2010/jul/23/strip-scribbles-obama-chooses-elaine-wynn-kennedy-/ &quot;Star Surveillance&quot;] Las Vegas Weekly; Accessed August 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to spawning imitators, such as the [[truTV]] series ''[[Hardcore Pawn]]'', the success of ''Pawn Stars'' has been a boon to the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop, which has become a Las Vegas tourist site, and has expanded its business accordingly. The shop, which averaged between 70 and 100 customers per day, grew to more than 1,000 by October 2010. As a result, the shop hired nearly 30 new employees,&lt;ref&gt;Corey Harrison indicates he manages 30 employees in the second season episode &quot;Backroom Brawl&quot;, and later states the shop has 48 employees in the third season episode &quot;Like a Rolling Chum&quot;. The [http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/28/pawn-stars-rick-harrison-interview/ June 2010 ''Entertainment Weekly'' source] also indicates a staff of over 40 employees. According to Austin &quot;Chumlee&quot; Russell, writing in Rick Harrison's 2011 book, ''License to Pawn: Deals, Steals, and My Life at the Gold &amp; Silver'', the shop had only ten employees at the time the show began production.&lt;/ref&gt; and underwent a $400,000 expansion of their showroom by two thirds, to 15,000 square feet,&lt;ref name=USAToday/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessWeek/&gt; the shop's tenth expansion since it opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Peacemaker|episodelink=|url=|series=Pawn Stars|serieslink=|credits=|network=History|season=4|number=27|city=|airdate=2011-05-9|minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Harrison also mentioned in the fourth season episode &quot;Over the Top&quot; that he was building a gym above the Pawn Shop for the staff's use.&lt;ref name=OverTheTop/&gt; The shop also now sells its own brand merchandise, whose designs originate from fans entering design competitions on [[Facebook]], which saves the Harrisons the cost of hiring professional designers. The staff's presence on Facebook and [[Twitter]] also ensures audiences during local nightclub appearances, for which Corey Harrison and Chumlee Russell are paid $1,000 a night.&lt;ref name=CNNMoney/&gt;
