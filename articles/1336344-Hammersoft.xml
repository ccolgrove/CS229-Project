'''ABC Upper Hunter''' (call sign: '''2UH''') is an [[Australian]] [[radio station]]. It is the [[Upper Hunter]] service of the [[ABC Local Radio]] network, and serves [[Muswellbrook]] and surrounding areas. 

==History==

ABC Upper Hunter commenced as a local relay of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]'s 2NC (now [[1233 ABC Newcastle]]) in 1964. While there was some local information on the station, the reporter responsible was based in Newcastle.  It wasn't until 1990 when a local office of the ABC was established in the Upper Hunter, basing itself in Market Lane Muswellbrook. [[Mike Pritchard (Australian journalist)|Mike Pritchard]] joined the broadcaster from the ''[[Scone Advocate]]'' newspaper, and has been the station's rural reporter ever since, even acting as the lone employee in the region on occasion. In 1997, the station moved to its current facilities in Brook Street. 

Throughout 2009, the station's programming went on hiatus while the studios were upgraded with digital equipment. Rural programming came from [[ABC New England North West]], while local news and other programming continued to originate from ABC Newcastle. Regular programming resumed mid-year once the upgrade was complete.

==Frequencies==

ABC Upper Hunter transmits on both the AM and FM bands from four transmitter sites in the Upper Hunter.

The main AM signal, with the callsign 2UH (as in '''U'''pper '''H'''unter), operates on 1044 [[kilohertz|kHz]], and reaches most of the Upper Hunter. This signal is transmitted from the [[Broadcast Australia]] site on Sandy Creek Road just outside Muswellbrook. 

The station relays its programs on the FM band from three transmitter sites, all using the callsign 2HVR (as in '''H'''unter '''V'''alley '''R'''adio).

==Programming==

The station produces local programming for both its local frequencies and for Newcastle's [[ABC Radio National]] frequency.

Two rural reports are produced, one for the Lower Hunter and transmitted on the Radio National frequency at 5.30am weekday mornings and infrequently [http://www.abc.net.au/rural/nsw/upperhunter/ podcast] online. The second is an Upper Hunter-focused report, and airs at 6.35am on ABC Upper Hunter's local frequencies following a news bulletin from the Muswellbrook studios. 

A local breakfast program follows at 7.00am with another news bulletin transmitted at 7.30am before crossing to the network for the national news and ''[[AM (ABC Radio)|AM]]''.

The station opts out of lunchtime programming from 1233 ABC Newcastle to carry ''[[The Country Hour]]'' at 12.00pm, followed by ''[[The World Today]]'' on a one-hour delay at 1.00pm. A Hunter-based news bulletin is aired during the Country Hour at 12.30pm from the Newcastle studios. This is simulcast on the Newcastle Radio National frequency.

Outside of these times, the station carries ABC Newcastle and national programming, including [[Newcastle Knights]] and [[Newcastle Jets]] games, provided other sports coverage (such as [[cricket]]) does not force local sports coverage onto the Newcastle [[ABC NewsRadio]] frequency (incidentally, the former frequency of fellow Muswellbrook station [[2NM]]).

Radio National program ''[[Late Night Live]]'' often originates from these studios, as presenter [[Phillip Adams]] and his partner [[Patrice Newell]] own an organic farm in the area.

In mid-2009, the station launched a new hour long program called ''Upper Hunter Weekend'', which previews events in the Upper Hunter for the coming weekend. It airs Friday mornings at 11am, and is hosted by Silas Moss and Niav Owens.
