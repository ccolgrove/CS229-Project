'''''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!''''' is a [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[reality television]] show, first screened in 2002, in which celebrities live in jungle conditions with few creature comforts. The show is filmed in Australia and broadcast on [[ITV]] &lt;small&gt;([[ITV1]]/[[STV (TV network)|STV]]/[[UTV]])&lt;/small&gt; in the UK and on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] in Ireland. The show is one of the largest in the [[world]] with over 700 staff working on the show 24 hours a day for 3 weeks. It is [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] in the UK by supermarket chain [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] and in Ireland by [[Restaurant chains in Ireland|Four Star Pizza]].

The main show has been hosted by [[Ant &amp; Dec]] since its inception. As of series 9, the behind-the-scenes companion show, ''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!'', is hosted by ''[[EastEnders]]'' actor [[Joe Swash]], the winner of series 8. His co-presenter during series 9 and 10 was model and presenter [[Caroline Flack]] who left the show in May 2011 after accepting the job of co-presenter on the ''[[The X Factor (UK)#The Xtra Factor|The Xtra Factor]]''. The pair had replaced previous hosts [[Mark Durden-Smith]], [[Emma Willis]] and [[Matt Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/2596905/Caroline-Flack-to-Im-A-Celeb-jungle.html|title=Flack flies to jungle|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
{{unsourced section|date=November 2011}}
In return for their appearance on the show, the celebrities are asked to nominate a [[charitable organization|charity]] to which the producers, [[LWT]] (weekend shows) and [[Granada Television]] (weekday shows), make donations.  The celebrities themselves are also paid a fee (reported to be Â£25,000 for UK competitors) to compensate them for possible loss of earnings while they are in the jungle.  The producers of the show keep the precise details of the celebrities' contracts very private, prompting much speculation from the tabloid media.  The money is raised by allowing viewers to vote by phone, text message or the &quot;red button&quot; (a colloquialism popular in the UK for TV interactive services) for the celebrity they would like to complete a &quot;Bushtucker Trial&quot; â a physical task usually involving snakes, spiders or other creepy-crawlies found in the jungle â and, later in each series, to vote for the celebrity they would like to see win the show.  The last remaining celebrity after all others have been evicted is declared the winner of the show, and is branded &quot;King of the Jungle&quot; or &quot;Queen of the Jungle&quot;.

==Bushtucker Trial==
Bushtucker trials are used in the show to allow the contestants to gain food and treats for camp. Bushtucker Trials take two formats: eating trials and physical or mental tasks.

In the eating trials, contestants are required to eat a variety of different 'jungle' foods that are placed in front of them. Each dish successfully eaten will gain the contestants one star, which equals one meal for camp (although the number of meals per star can vary). These trials generate the most viewer responses according to the ITV website. The foods that are required to be eaten can include: crickets (in a variety of forms, such as cooked into biscuits, blended into drinks or eaten alive or dead), green ants, mealworms, witchetty grub, roasted spider or tarantulas, kangaroo testicles, kangaroo penis, kangaroo vaginal parts, crocodile penis, cockroach (prepared in various ways such as being cooked into biscuits, blended into drinks, eaten alive or dead). Other past foods include beach worms, bull's tongues, the anus of various animals, vomit fruits, cooked pigs' brains, various animal testicles, raw fish eyes, sheep eyes, blended rats or mice tails.

The second type of challenge is more of a physical or mental task that requires the contestants to perform activities to gain stars. These can include searching through dung, going through tunnels, negotiating obstacles on high wires, or performing other tasks.

==Celebrity Chest==
Another way camp can earn treats is to do what is known as the 'celebrity chest'. This involves two or more celebrities going into the jungle to perform a task that releases keys to unlock a metal chest from a selection of locks and chains. Once that has been completed and the chest has been retrieved it is returned to camp. The celebrities then have to answer a question usually relating to a celebrity. If the question is answered correctly the celebrities are allowed to open compartment A or compartment B. If they answered incorrectly the treats gained from the chest are usually small but are highly prized{{Clarify|date=January 2011}}.

==Filming location==
[[Image:Imacelebritygetmeottahere004.jpg|thumb|left|On location in the &quot;Jungle&quot; in Dungay, north-eastern [[New South Wales]]{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- The main text says it's filmed in Queensland. To be fair, the main text also says that not all filming is done at the main location, but this caption could make it clearer that the photo is not of the main location (assuming the main location *is* still in Queensland, of course). --&gt;]]

The programme is filmed in [[Springbrook National Park]], [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], Australia.

Inside the entrance to the filming location is an open area allocated to temporary buildings which house on-site medical facilities, containers for the storage of props, and so on. It is in this area that the families and friends of the celebrities bide their time each morning during evictions â awaiting the fate of their loved ones. From this area, a restricted access road climbs to the site of the temporary studios. The road then heads down into a valley via [[four-wheel drive]] access to the set of the show.

Some of these areas are viewable from [[Google Earth]], though it is difficult to view the suspension bridges and open-air studio that [[Ant &amp; Dec]] broadcast from.  While the roof of the main building is bright red, when filming is out of season, this whole area is covered with hessian to obscure the aerial view.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- Does &quot;when filming is out of season&quot; mean when they're *not* filming, or when they're filming at unusual times? It's also unclear whether, at those times, the roof is red, or the area is covered with hessian, or both. --&gt;

The creeks and camp areas are situated directly below the main suspension bridges. As they are so close to the celebrities, the crew have to be careful during filming to keep voices and music down.

Many of the &quot;bush tucker trials&quot; are not performed here; in fact, some are performed well away from the area.

The Park has a hotel attached, minutes from the camp, where crew and family members stay. Once out of the jungle the celebrities stay at the opulent six-star hotel - [[Palazzo Versace]].{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- Is this the same hotel or a different one? Should it be &quot;*an* opulent six-star hotel&quot;? --&gt; {{Clear}}
The health and wellbeing of the celebrities and crew are looked after by Medic [[Bob McCarron]] and his team from EMS. McCarron is responsible for all of the creatures and food in the challenges.

==Popularity and criticism==
The finals of the second and third UK series were seen by 12.73 and 14.99 million people respectively{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} â  in both cases well over half of all people watching television in the country at the time.

The site in which the celebrities stay appears to be open to the elements, but is largely covered by sheets above the view of the cameras.  In one episode, a celebrity had to swim in a swamp apparently infested with [[crocodile]]s.  Marksmen were shown ready to shoot the animals if they attacked.  In actuality, the area where this was filmed does not have crocodiles because it is too far south.

In series 9 it was revealed that [[Katie Price]] was getting paid almost four times as much as the other contestants, which sparked some criticism. It was also reported that, as a result, cash-strapped ITV were unable to provide any more money for the series, and the quality of the trials went down.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/celebrity/news/a189977/celeb-bosses-regret-price-return.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===

* ITV apologised in 2006 after confusion over the instructions for telephone and 'red-button' interactive voting led to allegations in the media that the wrong person had been evicted in the run-off vote in series 6 between [[Toby Anstis]] and [[Dean Gaffney]].&lt;ref name=TheSunVoteStorm&gt;{{cite news

* The show was forced to enhance its procedures after Ofcom found that after complaints, on the 23 November 2006 episode, the show had breached Rule 1.16 of the Broadcasting Code for airing bad language before the [[Watershed (television)|watershed]].&lt;ref name=OfcomBulletin83&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 30 November 2006 episode was ruled to have breached Rule 2.2 of the Broadcasting Code after an investigation launched as part of the wider UK television public voting controversy. Due to late running, seven percent of phone and text votes for that episode of the show were not counted, although this did not affect the result.&lt;ref name=OfcomBulletin108&gt;{{cite web

* [[Sarah Matravers]] blamed the show for the breakdown of her relationship with contestant [[Marc Bannerman]] after he flirted with [[Cerys Matthews]] in series 7.&lt;ref name=RTEBannermansEx&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Former [[Sex Pistols]] manager, [[Malcolm McLaren]], who was due to appear on series 7 but pulled out at the last minute, alleged that the show and the choice of winner was fixed, and the trials posed no real danger. He alleged that show doctor told him that &quot;Things are so safe, I would send my own kids in to do the show'. There is nothing bad in there. They're hoodwinking the public&quot;.&lt;ref name=RTEMcLaren&gt;{{cite web

===Ultimate King or Queen of the Jungle===
An ITV spokesperson reported earlier in 2011 that ITV were considering that they might celebrate the show's tenth anniversary in 2012 by having past Kings and Queens of the Jungle and other favourite contestants going head to head, to be crowned Champion King or Queen of the Jungle. The concept would have reflected the format of [[Ultimate Big Brother]], broadcast in 2010 to commemorate [[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'s ending on [[Channel 4]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/im_a__celebrity/3278621/Whos-the-all-time-King-of-the-Jungle.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Ally | last=Ross | title=Whos the alltimebr King of the Jungle | date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, in July 2011, the Daily Star reported that the plans had been ditched by ITV &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s100/im-a-celebrity-uk/news/a329780/aaron-carter-linked-to-im-a-celebrity.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!''==
'''''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! NOW!''''' is a 'behind the scenes' programme. It is broadcast on [[ITV2]] in the United Kingdom and [[3e]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

For series 1 (2002), the show was presented by Louise Loughman, an Irish TV presenter.

For series 2 (2003) to 4 (2004), the show was presented by [[Mark Durden-Smith]] and [[Tara Palmer-Tomkinson]].

For series 5 (2005), Palmer-Tomkinson returned to present the show. However, Durden-Smith did not, as he decided to spend time with his new twin babies. He was replaced by [[Matt Brown (TV presenter)|Matt Brown]].

For series 6 (2006) [[Brendon Burns (comedian)|Brendon Burns]] initially presented the show, but left after three episodes. This led to Mark Durden-Smith returning for the rest of the series, where he presented from the UK. He was joined by new presenters [[Kelly Osbourne]] and [[Jeff Brazier]], who presented from the jungle in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/11/16/4709/im_a_comic,_get_me_out_of_here I'm a comic, get me out of here] Chortle.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

For series 7 (2007) and series 8 (2008), the show was hosted by Mark Durden-Smith in the UK, with series 6 winner [[Matt Willis]], and Willis's wife [[Emma Willis]] (nÃ©e Griffiths) in the jungle. Due to the couple having a child in early 2009, they did not present series 9.

For series 9 (2009) and 10 (2010), the show was presented by [[Caroline Flack]] with roving reporter [[Joe Swash]], e-mail/people reporter [[Russell Kane]], and a panel of pundits, who changed approximately every three to five days.
