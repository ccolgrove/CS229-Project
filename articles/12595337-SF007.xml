JeOS refers to a customized operating system that fits the needs of a particular application. It is not a generic, one-size-fits-all operating system so it only needs to include the pieces of an [[operating system]] (e.g., [[Kernel_(computing)|kernel]]) required to support a particular application and any other third-party components contained in the appliance. 

This makes the appliance smaller, and possibly more secure than an application running under a full general purpose OS.

== Common JeOS Implementations ==

Typically, a JeOS consist of the following:
*JeOS media (OS core {Kernel,Virtual Drives,Login})
*OS Minimum maintenance tools
*Minimum user space tools 
*Packages repository (DVD or Network based)

It is important to differentiate between true fully '''Minimalized OS''' install profiles forced, for example, with security hardening tools or representing Recovery Console images and '''JeOS ''' richer install profiles which is designed and built for wider audience usage, so VM/VA Creators and their Users can easily perform needed install / config tasks.
