==Early life==
Pattinson was born in London. His mother, Clare, worked for a modelling agency, and his father, Richard, imported vintage cars from the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Isabelle |url=http://www.harpercollinschildrens.com/HarperChildrens/Kids/BookDetail.aspx?isbn13=9780061765537&amp;BDMode=8 |title=Robert Pattinson |publisher=Harpercollinschildrens.com |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattinson has two elder sisters, singer [[Lizzy Pattinson]], and Victoria Pattinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Tibbetts|first=Graham|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3541846/Profile-of-Twilight-star-Robert-Pattinson.html|title=Profile of Twilight star Robert Pattinson|date=2 December 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glaswegian&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglaswegian.co.uk/entertainment-lifestyle/2009/11/26/twighlight-star-robert-pattinson-reveals-his-shy-side-102692-21851022|title=Twighlight star Robert Pattinson reveals his shy side|date=26 November 2009|first=Susan|last=Griffin|publisher=The Glaswegian|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up in the [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] suburb of London,&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography Today&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biography Today|year=2009|page=136|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit]], Michigan |isbn=978-0-7808-1052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; he attended [[Tower House School]] until he was 12, and then [[The Harrodian School]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Biography Today&quot;, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stubbs&gt;{{Cite news| author=Flora Stubbs|title=Potter star 'next Jude Law'|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/film/article-20955856-details/Potter+star+%27next+Jude+Law%27/article.do|publisher=[[Evening Standard]]|date=17 November 2005|accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became involved in amateur theatre at the Barnes Theatre Company.

==Career==
===Model&lt;!--British English--&gt;ling===
Pattinson began modelling when he was twelve years old, but the number of jobs began to decrease only four years later. In December 2008 he blamed the lack of work as a model on his masculine appearance: &quot;When I first started I was quite tall and looked like a girl, so I got lots of jobs, because it was during that period where the [[androgyny|androgynous]] look was cool. Then, I guess, I became too much of a guy, so I never got any more jobs. I had the most unsuccessful modelling career.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2008/12/why_robert_pattinsons_modeling.html|title=Why Robert Pattinson's Modeling |work=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattinson appeared in the advertising campaign for [[Hackett (clothing)|Hackett's]] autumn 2007 collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hackett&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Pattinson-Hackett Campaign|publisher=Nachophoto.com|url=http://nachofoto.com/photo-of-Robert-Pattinson-Hackett-Campaign-4ac9aa70ac4f|accessdate=16 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
