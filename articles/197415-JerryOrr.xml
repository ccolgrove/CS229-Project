'''''Reign in Blood''''' is the third studio album and the major label debut by the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]. It was released on October 7, 1986 through [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album was the band's first collaboration with record producer [[Rick Rubin]], whose input helped the band's sound evolve. ''Reign in Blood'' was universally well received by both critics and fans, and was responsible for bringing Slayer to the attention of a mainstream metal audience. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine described the record as &quot;the heaviest album of all time,&quot; and a breakthrough in thrash metal and speed metal. Alongside [[Metallica|Metallica's]] ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', [[Anthrax|Anthrax's]] ''[[Among the Living]]'' and [[Megadeth|Megadeth's]] ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'', ''Reign in Blood'' is considered by critics one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all time, thrash metal in particular.

''Reign in Blood''{{'}}s release was delayed because of concerns regarding its graphic artwork and lyrical subject matter. The opening track, &quot;[[Angel of Death (song)|Angel of Death]]&quot;, which refers to [[Josef Mengele]] and describes acts, such as human experimentation, that Mengele committed at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], provoked allegations of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry King: Maniac.

==Record label changes==
Following the positive reception to Slayer's previous release ''[[Hell Awaits]]'', the band's producer and manager [[Brian Slagel]] realized the band were in a position to hit the &quot;big time&quot; with their next album. Slagel negotiated with several record labels, among them [[Rick Rubin]] and [[Russell Simmons]]'s [[Def Jam Recordings]]. However, Slagel was reluctant to sign the band to what was at the time primarily a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] label. Slayer drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] was made aware of Rubin's interest, and made a move to contact him. However, the other Slayer members were apprehensive at leaving [[Metal Blade Records]], with which they were under [[contract]].&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Lombardo contacted [[Columbia Records]]âwhich was Def Jam's [[distribution (business)|distributor]]âand managed to get in touch with Rubin, who along with photographer [[Glen E. Friedman]] agreed to attend one of the band's concerts. Friedman had produced [[Suicidal Tendencies]]'s [[Suicidal Tendencies (album)|self-titled debut album]], in which Slayer vocalist [[Tom Araya]] made a guest appearance in the music video for the album's single &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, pushing Suicidal Tendencies's vocalist [[Mike Muir]]. Around this time, Rubin asked Friedman if he knew Slayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] was surprised by Rubin's interest in the band, and was impressed by his work with the hip hop acts [[Run DMC]] and [[LL Cool J]]. During a visit by Slagel to a European music [[convention (meeting)|convention]], Rubin spoke with the band directly, and persuaded them to sign with Def Jam. Slagel paid a personal tribute to Rubin, and said that Rubin was the most passionate of all the label representatives the band were in negotiations with. Following the agreement, Friedman brought the band members to [[Seattle]] for two days of publicity shots, possible record shots, and photos for a tour book; Rubin felt no good photos of the band had been taken before that point. One of the photos was used on the back cover of the band's 1988 release ''[[South of Heaven]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; The album became an [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]] album after Rick Rubin ended his partnership with [[Russell Simmons]]. It was one of only two Def Jam titles to be distributed by [[Geffen Records]] through [[Warner Bros. Records]] because of the original distributor's refusal to release work by the band.

==Recording==
''Reign in Blood'' was recorded and produced in Los Angeles with Rick Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective led to a drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reign in Blood - Slayer&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Reign in Blood - Slayer | author = Huey, Steve | publisher = Allmusicguide.com | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r18220|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate = 5 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since admitted their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slay Ride&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Slay Ride|author=La Briola, John|publisher=Westword.com|date=22 July 2004 |url=http://www.westword.com/2004-07-22/music/slay-ride/|accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guitarist [[Kerry King]] later remarked that &quot;It was like, 'Wowâyou can hear everything, and those guys aren't just playing fast; those notes are on time.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Hanneman has since admitted that while the band was listening to [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. &quot;If we do a verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't trying to make the songs shorterâthat's just what we were into,&quot; which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend; &quot;You could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked &quot;Do you realize how short this is?&quot; Slayer members looked at each other, and replied &quot;So what?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt; The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was &quot;neat,&quot; as &quot;You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = An exclusive oral history of Slayer| publisher = [[Decibel Magazine]]| url = http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566| accessdate = 3 January 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061020200807/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features_detail.aspx?id=4566| archivedate = October 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases helping to push the gap between [[thrash metal]] and its predecessor [[hardcore punk]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Reign in Blood - Slayer&quot;/&gt; and is played at an average of 210 [[beats per minute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrew Haug speaks with Dave Lombardo from Slayer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrew Haug speaks with Dave Lombardo from Slayer |author=Haug, Andrew|publisher=Abc.net.au|date=13 October 2006|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/racket/listen/audio_alpha_S.htm|accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubin called Lombardo daily to insist he return, telling him, &quot;Dude, you gotta come back in the band.&quot; Rubin offered Lombardo a salary, but he was still hesitant about returning; at this point Lombardo had been out of the band for several months. Lombardo's wife convinced him to return in 1987; Rubin came to his house and picked him up in his [[Porsche]], taking him to a Slayer rehearsal.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

Although it was omitted from a number of concerts because of short time allotments, Slayer have often said that they enjoy playing the album in its entirety. According to Hanneman: &quot;We still enjoy playing these songs live. We play these songs over and over and over, but they're good songs, intense songs! If it were melodic songs or some kind of boring 'clap your hands' song, you'd be going crazy playing those every night. But our songs are just bam-bam-bam-bam, they're intense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLAYER - Jeff Hanneman&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Controversy==
===Artwork===
Def Jam's distributor, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album due to its controversial lyrical themes and cover art. ''Reign in Blood'' was eventually distributed by [[Geffen Records]]; however, due to the controversy it did not appear on Geffen's release schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;An exclusive oral history of Slayer&quot;/&gt;

The artwork was designed by [[Larry Carroll (artist)|Larry Carroll]], who at the time was creating political illustrations for ''[[The Progressive]]'', ''[[Village Voice]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''. The cover art was featured in [[Blender (magazine)|''Blender Magazine'']]'s 2006 &quot;top ten heavy metal album covers of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Top Ten Greatest Heavy Metal Album Covers of All Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Lyrical themes===
For the album, Slayer decided to abandon the [[Satanism|Satanic]] themes explored on their previous album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'', and write about issues that were more on a street level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slayer - Tom Araya - January 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Hanneman was inspired to write &quot;Angel of Death&quot; after he read a number of books on Mengele during a Slayer tour. Hanneman has complained people usually misinterpret the lyrics, and clarified, &quot;Nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man, because to me&amp;nbsp;â well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knac.com interview with Jeff Hanneman&quot;/&gt; The band utilized the controversy to attract publicity, incorporating the [[Reichsadler]] into their logo (also the S in the band's name resembles the [[Sig runes]] used by the SS), and writing a song titled &quot;SS-3,&quot; which mentions [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the second in command in the [[Schutzstaffel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Master of Death - Heydrich&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==In popular culture==
&quot;Raining Blood&quot; was covered by [[Tori Amos]] on her 2001 album ''[[Strange Little Girls]]''. King has admitted that he thought the cover was odd: &quot;It took me a minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like a minute and a half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'&quot; The band however liked the cover enough to send Slayer t-shirts to Tori Amos.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Conversation With Kerry King&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = A Conversation With Kerry King
