The '''ZEN''' is a [[portable media player]] designed and manufactured by [[Creative Technology]]. The [[flash memory]]-based player is the ''[[de facto]]'' successor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=France|first=Jasmine|url=http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9767400-1.html|title=Sweet new Creative Zen coming soon|publisher=[[CNET|CNET.com]]|accessdate=2007-11-14|date=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creative ZEN#ZEN Vision:M|ZEN Vision:M]] and was announced on August 29, 2007, to be available in capacities of 2, 4, 8, and 16&amp;nbsp;GB, as of September 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mp3.com/creative-zen/hardware/262/summary.html|title=Creative ZEN Reviews and Specs|publisher=MP3.com|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 32&amp;nbsp;GB model was announced on December 4, 2007, setting a record for storage capacity among flash players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://asia.creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12867|title=Creative Introduces the World's First 32GB Flash Memory-based Portable Media Player with the Latest Credit-Card sized ZEN|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2007-12-04|publisher=[[Creative Technology|Creative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player has a width of {{convert|83|mm|in|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|55|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is {{convert|11.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} thickâmaking it the slimmest Creative portable media player and the second slimmest Creative player of any type (other than the now-defunct [[Creative MuVo player models|MuVo Slim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MuVo Slim Product Page|url=http://sg.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&amp;subcategory=215&amp;product=10052|publisher=[[Creative Technology|Creative]]|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so far. Because of its dimensions, the ZEN is advertised to be the &quot;size of a credit card&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://creative.com/corporate/pressroom/releases/welcome.asp?pid=12786|title=Creative Introduces the Credit Card-sized ZEN with a Stunning 2.5-inch Colour Screen for Music, Video and Photos|date=2007-08-29|accessdate=2007-12-04|publisher=[[Creative Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first Creative player to have a [[Secure Digital card|SD card]] slot (enabling the support of SD and [[Secure Digital card#SDHC|SDHC]] cards; an optional adapter is needed for [[microSD]] and [[miniSD Card|miniSD]] cards), support for [[Digital rights management|DRM]] free iTunes-encoded [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] (in a &quot;.m4a&quot; extension), as well as a [[truecolor]] [[Thin film transistor liquid crystal display|TFT LCD]] display.

==ZEN MX==
The ZEN MX is a derivative of the ZEN launched in 2009. The form factor is exactly the same as the ZEN, though less than a millimeter thicker at 11.9 mm (0.47 inches), but there are a few notable feature differences. The ZEN MX does not support .AVI, .MPG, or .AAC files natively. In order for them to be played back on the device, they must be transcoded using the bundled converter. The player's button layout is slightly altered, merging the play/pause button with the power button. The MX version also allows for music to be imported from the SD card to the player's internal memory and library, in addition to the ZEN's original picture import mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creative.techinhiding.com/2009/04/creative-strips-zen-calls-it-zen-mx/|title=Creative Strips ZEN, Calls It ZEN MX|date=2009-04-28|accessdate=2009-07-14|publisher=Tech in Hiding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ZEN MX features the [[MSC]]/[[UMS]] transfer system that makes the player compatible with Apple computers, it makes use of a slightly altered firmware which may not be installed on the original ZEN or vice versa.

== Firmware releases ==
Numerous firmware updates were released very soon after the player's launch, fixing a variety of bugs, but Creative did not add features to the [[SD Card]] functionality. The SD card functionality is considered to be poor by many people who own a Creative Zen because these people had expected the SD card to function more along the lines of a RAM expansion pack or additional non-volatile RAM instead of a separate drive with limited functionality, which is how Creative designed it to act. The ZEN MX requires an entirely different firmware.

The earlier ones have reportedly caused players to occasionally result in a white [[screen of death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epizenter.net/news.php?item.354.4|title=ZEN owners experiencing the White Screen of Death, Here's how to Fix it.|date=2007-12-14|accessdate=2008-01-13|author=Lemon|publisher=epiZENter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1.20.02&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epizenter.net/news.php?item.358.4|title=New ZEN Firmware (1.20.02) adds limited SD-card Importing|date=2007-12-22|accessdate=2008-01-13|author=dreimanis|publisher=epiZENter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 1.10.05 was released on October 23, 2007. Thai language support was added, while video playback was improved. Adapter charging and startup time were quickened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.epizenter.net/news.php?item.339.4|title=Creative ZEN Firmware 1.10.05 Now Available|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2008-01-13|author=RJZen|coauthors=ramakandra|publisher=epiZENter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prior version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.creative.com/support/downloads/download.asp?MainCategory=210&amp;nRegionFK=&amp;nCountryFK=&amp;nLanguageFK=&amp;sOSName=Windows+Vista+32-bit&amp;region=1&amp;Product_Name=ZEN+4GB%2F8GB%2F16GB%2F32GB&amp;Product_ID=17108&amp;modelnumber=&amp;driverlang=1033&amp;OS=26&amp;drivertype=4&amp;x=5&amp;y=3|title=ZEN Firmware download|accessdate=2008-01-13|publisher=[[Creative Technology|Creative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.20.02, was released on December 19, 2007. Transferring content via the SD card slot is enabled, though only image files are viewable.&lt;ref name=&quot;1.20.02&quot; /&gt;

Firmware version 1.21.01 was released on February 28, 2008. It improves the player's playback performance of WMA (.wma) files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.creative.com/support/downloads/download.asp?MainCategory=213&amp;nRegionFK=&amp;nCountryFK=&amp;nLanguageFK=&amp;sOSName=Windows+XP&amp;region=1&amp;Product_Name=ZEN+4GB%2F8GB%2F16GB&amp;Product_ID=17108&amp;modelnumber=&amp;driverlang=1033&amp;OS=10&amp;drivertype=4&amp;x=10&amp;y=15|title=ZEN Firmware 1.21.01 download and info.|accessdate=2008-03-01|publisher=[[Creative Technology|Creative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version, 1.21.03, was released on January 19, 2009, which improves FM radio player operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.creative.com/Products/ProductDetails.aspx?catID=213&amp;CatName=MP3+Players&amp;subCatID=214&amp;subCatName=ZEN&amp;prodID=16999&amp;prodName=ZEN| title=ZEN Firmware 1.21.03 download and info.|accessdate=2009-01-23|publisher=[[Creative Technology|Creative]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AAC Support==
Creative states that the ZEN supports the [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] audio format. However, only [[iTunes]]-encoded files can be played by the player hardware. iTunes's implementation has been licensed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] from [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]] and is proprietary.  These files are in the .m4a format, which is the same as the Apple Lossless Audio Codec.  Creative has acknowledged this issue in a support article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.creative.com/kb/ShowArticle.aspx?sid=45327 &quot;Audio Format is not supported&quot; while Playing Back AAC files in ZEN and ZEN X-Fi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of Nero-AAC Encoder (1.3.3.0) &quot;Solved compatibility issues with some hardware devices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nero.com/eng/release-notes-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.html Release Notes of Nero AAC Codec]&lt;/ref&gt; Including ZEN. This update makes Nero-Coded AAC files playable on ZEN.
