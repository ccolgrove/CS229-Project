[[Portable application|Portable software]] is a class of [[Computer program|software]] that is suitable for use on portable drives such as a [[USB flash drive|USB (thumb) drive]] or [[digital audio player]] or [[PDA]] with &quot;drive mode&quot;, although any [[external hard drive]] can be used.

The concept of carrying one's favored applications, utilities, and files on a portable drive for use on any computer is one which has evolved considerably in recent years.

Programs in this category (also known as ''portable applications'') are typically 'lite' versions of their parent software, but there are many exceptions.

To be considered portable, for purpose of this list, a software program must:

# Not require any kind of formal installation onto a computer's permanent storage device to be executed, and can be stored on a removable storage device such as USB flash drive, enabling it to be used on multiple computers.
# Settings are stored with, and can be carried around with, the software (i.e., they are written to the [[USB]] drive). If the registry is used to store settings, the application's configuration isn't portable, and must be set up on every PC it is used on
# Leaves a zero (or near-zero) &quot;[[Memory-footprint|footprint]]&quot; on any PC it is run on after being used. i.e., All temporary files/registry settings should be removed once the program has exited, and files created by the user can be saved directly to the same removable media as the application is stored on.

Generally, smaller [[utility]]/[[toolkit]] software is inherently fairly portable; though larger applications are sometimes changed in order to allow a portable versions to be released (e.g., [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]@USB and [[OperaTor]]).
