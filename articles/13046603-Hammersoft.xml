The '''United States gubernatorial elections of 2009''' were held on November 3, 2009 in the states of [[New Jersey]] and [[Virginia]] as well as in the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|U.S. commonwealth]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] on November 7, 2009. Both state governorships were previously held by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] elected in [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2005|2005]] and as a result of the 2009 elections both are presently held by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]; the local [[Covenant Party (Northern Mariana Islands)|Covenant Party]] maintained control of the governorship of the Marianas. These elections formed part of the [[United States general elections, 2009|2009 United States elections]].

Due to the passage of [[Northern Mariana Islands Senate|Senate]] Legislative Initiative 16-11, this will be the last year in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in which a gubernatorial election will occur on a pre-midterm [[off-year election]] year. The next CNMI gubernatorial election will be in 2014.&lt;ref name=saipantribune6&gt; {{cite news|first=Haidee V.|last=Eugenio |title= CNMI holds first runoff election|url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=95301&amp;cat=1 |work=[[Saipan Tribune]] |publisher=|date=2009-11-23 |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=abcradio&gt; {{cite news|first=Gemma|last=Casas|title= Northern Marianas' election race heats up |url=http://www.radioaustralianews.net.au/stories/200911/2744614.htm?desktop |work=[[Radio Australia]] |publisher=|date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tim Kaine ([[Virginia]])===

{{Main|Virginia gubernatorial election, 2009}}

Virginia's term-limits law allows governors to run for more than one term; however, the terms cannot be consecutive.  Thus,  incumbent Governor [[Tim Kaine]] could not stand for re-election.

Candidates for the Democratic nomination included [[Terry McAuliffe]], former Chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]'s former campaign manager; State Senator [[Creigh Deeds]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/33942374.html |title=Deeds Weighs In On Recount Process |publisher=Charlottesvillenewsplex.tv |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and State Delegate [[Brian Moran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsleader.com/article/20081109/NEWS01/811090337/1002/news01 ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deeds won the Democratic primary on June 9, 2009 with approximately 49% of the vote; beating out Terry McAliffe with 26% and Brian Moran with 23%.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2009/B19D959E-A4DD-4C27-BC08-30C8F2FF2F92/Unofficial/2_s.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican nominee was [[Virginia Attorney General]] [[Bob McDonnell]]. This was the sixth consecutive Virginian gubernatorial election where an elected Attorney General has run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdbj7.com/Global/story.asp?S=9313545&amp;nav=menu368_2_4_20 |title=Attorney General Bob McDonnell hopes VA will elect a Republican governor - WDBJ7 Roanoke News and Weather NRV Lynchburg Danville &amp;#124; |publisher=Wdbj7.com |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2009, [[Bob McDonnell]] defeated [[Creigh Deeds]] to become Governor-elect of [[Virginia]]. His margin of victory was a landslide 59% to 41%.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/11/03/democrats-republicans-prepare-possible-legal-battle-new-jersey-race/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jon Corzine ([[New Jersey]])===

{{Main|New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009}}

Democratic Governor [[Jon Corzine]] was eligible to run for a second term and did so. He was considered vulnerable given a number of recent scandals and low approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newjersey/ny-bc-nj--e-mails-corzines0531may31,0,7109047.story ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Former [[Glen Ridge, New Jersey|Glen Ridge]] Mayor [[Carl Bergmanson]], failed 2008 congressional candidate Roger Bacon, and failed 2008 Senate candidate Jeff Boss also sought the Democratic nomination. Corzine won the Democratic primary on June 2.

U.S. Attorney [[Christopher J. Christie|Chris Christie]] was the Republican gubernatorial nominee.  Christie defeated former [[Bogota, New Jersey|Bogota]] Mayor [[Steve Lonegan]] and veteran [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assemblyman]] [[Rick Merkt]] in the Republican primary on June 2.  

[[Christopher Daggett|Chris Daggett]], who was Commissioner of the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] under Governor [[Thomas Kean, Sr.]] and regional administrator of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] under President [[Ronald W. Reagan]], ran as an independent. Daggett raised enough money to file for public funds and appear in both debates.

On November 3, 2009, Republican Christie unseated Democratic incumbent Governor Corzine. His margin of victory was 49% to 45%, Daggett's role as a &quot;spoiler candidate&quot; (some polls had him taking 10 percent of the vote) never materialized.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;/&gt;

===Benigno R. Fitial ([[Northern Mariana Islands]])===

{{Main|Northern Mariana Islands gubernatorial election, 2009}}

Governor [[Benigno R. Fitial]], a member of the local [[Covenant Party (Northern Mariana Islands)|Covenant Party]], was eligible to run for a second term and did so. [[Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Heinz Hofschneider]] won the Republican nomination in June, defeating former Republican Governor [[Juan N. Babauta]], who was defeated in his 2005 re-election by Fitial. [[Ramon &quot;Kumoi&quot; Guerrero]] and [[Juan &quot;Pan&quot; Guerrero]], two former members of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Senate]], both ran as independents.

The CNMI election was held on Saturday, November 7, 2009.&lt;ref name=mvarietyOct13&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma Q.|last=Casas |title=Registered voters up by 15% |url=http://www.mvarietynews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20909:registered-voters-up-by-15&amp;catid=1:local-news&amp;Itemid=2 |work=[[Marianas Variety]]|publisher=|date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; No candidate received a majority, so Governor Fital and Rep. Hofschneider advanced to a runoff election on November 23. Fital won with a 370 vote margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Haidee V.|last=Eugenio |title=Fitial seals victory with 370 lead |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&amp;newsID=95662 |work=[[Saipan Tribune]]|publisher=|date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
