'''MythDora''' is a specialized [[operating system]] based on [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[MythTV]]. Since 2009, the version number comes from the version of Fedora used followed by the version of [[MythTV]] used. For example, the current version 12.23 uses Fedora 12 and MythTV 0.23. Like [[KnoppMyth]], MythDora is designed to simplify the installation of [[MythTV]] on a [[home theatre PC]].  MythDora has since version 10.21 had  [[Live CD]] support.

In addition to MythTV and its plugins, Mythdora includes extra Linux packages that are necessary for MythTV to run, and drivers for hardware commonly encountered in machines intended to run MythTV. Also included in Mythdora are several video game [[emulators]], and extra tools and scripts. These aid with the initial configuration of the system and allow the user to perform such tasks as [[booting|rebooting]] the machine and backing up program data, directly through the MythTV interface.
