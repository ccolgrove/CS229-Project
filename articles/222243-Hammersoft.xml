'''MÃ©xico''' ({{IPA-es|Ëmexiko||es-mx-MÃ©xico.ogg}}), officially: ''Estado Libre y Soberano de MÃ©xico'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of MÃ©xico}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of the [[United Mexican States]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of Mexico State|125 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Toluca|Toluca de Lerdo]].

The State of Mexico is often abbreviated to &quot;'''Edomex'''&quot; from '''''Estado de MÃ©xico''''' in Spanish). It is located in [[South-Central Mexico]]. It is bordered by the states of [[QuerÃ©taro]] and [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] to the north, [[Morelos]] and [[Guerrero]] to the south, [[MichoacÃ¡n]] to the west, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Puebla]] to the east and surrounds the [[Mexico city|Federal District]].

The stateâs origins are in the territory of the [[Aztec Empire]], which remained a political division of [[New Spain]] during the colonial period. After [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]], [[Mexico City]] was chosen as the capital of the new nation, its territory was separated out the state. Years later, parts of the state were broken off to form the states of Hidalgo, Guerrero and Morelos. These territorial separations have left the state with the size and shape it has today, with the [[Toluca Valley]] to the west of Mexico City and a [[panhandle]] that extends around the north and east of this entity.

The name of the state is simply âMÃ©xicoâ according to the [[Constitution of Mexico|Political Constitution of the Mexican United States of 1917]], but to distinguish from both the city and the country it is most often called âEstado de MÃ©xico.â

==Origin and etymology==
{{main|Name of Mexico}}
''MÄxihco'' was originally the [[Nahuatl]] name for the eponymous [[Valley of Mexico]] wherein the cities of the [[Mexica]] (the proper name for the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]]) were located. As such, the district that became Mexico City was properly known as [[Mexico-Tenochtitlan]] in the years shortly before and after Spanish conquest. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]], the term ''MÃ©xico'' came to be used for Tenochtitlan/Mexico City and all the pre-conquest lands it controlled, including several other aforementioned [[Territorial evolution of Mexico|Mexican states]] originally incorporated in the boundaries of the MÃ©xico state. 

There are two possible origins for [[Name of Mexico|the name âMexico.â]] The first is that it derives from metztli (moon) and xictla (navel) to mean from the navel of the moon. This comes from the old [[Aztec]] idea that the craters on the moon form a rabbit figure with one crater imitating a navel. The other possible origin is that it is derived from âMextictliâ an alternate name for the god [[Huitzilopochtli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;origenfun&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elclima.com.mx/origen_y_fundacion_del_estado_de_mexico.htm |title= Origen y fundaciÃ³n del Estado de MÃ©xico  |publisher=Club Planeta |language=Spanish |trans_title=Origin and foundation of the State of Mexico |accessdate=July 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[AnÃ¡huac]]'' was the proper term for all territories dominated by the Aztec Empire, from ''Cem AnÃ¡huac'', &quot;the entire earth&quot; or &quot;surrounded by waters&quot; e.g. the waters of [[Lake Texcoco]] which were considered to be the center of the Aztec world;&lt;ref&gt;[http://168.96.200.17/ar/libros/dussel/artics/nahua.pdf A Nahuatl Interpretation of the Conquest]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anahuaccancun.edu.mx/identidad/index.php Universidad AnÃ¡huac]&lt;/ref&gt; and as such was proposed as an early name for the entire nation of [[Mexico]] prior to independence, to distinguish it from the (preexisting) administrative division of [[New Spain]] that became the State of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XIXA/mier/ Â¿Puede ser libre la Nueva EspaÃ±a?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Prehistoric to pre-Hispanic period===
[[File:Hueso sacro de Tequixquiac.JPG|thumb|left|'''Sacrum bone''' found in Tequixquiac is considered a work of prehistoric art.]]
[[File:Mexico SunMoonPyramid.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Teotihuacan site]]

The earliest evidence of human habitation in current territory of the state is a [[quartz]] scraper and [[obsidian]] blade found in the [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya area]], which was an island in the former [[Lake Chalco]]. They are dated to the [[Pleistocene]] era which dates human habitation back to 20,000 years. These first peoples were hunter-gatherers. Stone age implements have been found all over the territory from mammoth bones, to stone tools to human remains. Most have been found in the areas of [[Los Reyes Acozac]], [[Tizayuca]], [[Tepexpan]], [[San Francisco Mazapa]], [[El Risco]] and [[Tequixquiac]]. Between 20,000 and 5000 BCE, the people here eventually went from hunting and gathering to sedimentary villages with farming and domesticated animals. The main crop was corn, and stone tools for the grinding of this grain become common. Later crops include beans, chili peppers and squash grown near established villages. Evidence of ceramics appears around 2500 BCE with the earliest artifacts of these appearing in Tlapacoya, [[Atoto]], [[Malinalco]], [[Acatzingo]] and [[Tlatilco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/ |title= Historia |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico  |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=July 8, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In prehistoric State of Mexico, the [[Tepexpan Man]] is an important finding for Mexcian and foreign anthropologists; it is an important key to understand what was the [[Valley of Mexico]] area like, 5000 years ago, as well as helping establish the occupation chronology of the region. Currently some scholars attribute an age of 11 thousand years, others 8 thousand, and some have suggested 5 thousand years old. This individual, originally identified as a male, recent research confirm a female identity, although this is still subject of discussion.&lt;ref name=   WikiEDO &gt; {{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Estado de Mexico |url=  http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_de_M%C3%A9xico#Origen |publisher=   |location= |language= Spanish|trans_title=State of Mexico  |year= |accessdate= Nov. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sacrum bone found in Tequixquiac is considered a work of prehistoric art. The town was inhabited in 35,000 BCE by primitive men who had crossed the [[Bering Strait]] from Asia. These people were nomadic, hunting large animals such as mammoths and gathering fruits as evidenced by archaeological evidence found at the site. One of the most salient discoveries of primitive art in America was found in here, called the '''Tequixquiac Bone''',&lt;ref name=Rescate   &gt; {{cite web |first=   |last=  |title=  Rescate del pasado |url=  http://www.deporte.org.mx/biblioteca/M68/Disco1/libro/capitulo_2.pdf |publisher=Deporte.org.com   |location= |language= Spanish|trans_title=Rescue of the past  |year= |accessdate=Sept. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= WikiEDO  /&gt;  which had no known purpose, but reflected the ideological sense of the artist who carved the piece of bone from a [[camelid]] around 22,000 years BCE. The first native settlers of Tequixquiac were the Aztecs and Otomi, who decided to settle here permanently for the abundance of rivers and springs. They were engaged mainly in agriculture and the breeding of domestic animals.&lt;ref name=Bone  &gt; {{cite web |first=   |last=  |title= Tequixquiac |url=  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequixquiac|publisher=English Wikipedia|location= |language= |trans_title=  |year= |accessdate=Sept. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest major civilization of the state is [[Teotihuacan]], with the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon being built between 100 BCE and 100 CE. Between 800 and 900 CE, the [[Matlatzinca]]s established their dominion with [[Teotenango]] as capital. This city is walled with plazas, terraces, temples, altars, living quarters and a [[Mesoamerican ball game]] court.In the 15th century, the Aztecs conquered the Toluca and Chalco valleys to the west and east of the [[Valley of Mexico]] respectively. Part of the Toluca Valley was held by the [[P'urhÃ©pecha|PâurhÃ©pechas]] as well. Other dominions during the pre-Hispanic period include that of the [[Chichimeca]]s in [[Tenayuca]] and of the [[Acolhua]]s in [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Huexotla]], [[Texcotizingo]] and Los Melones. Other important groups were the [[Mazahua]]s in the [[Atlacomulco]]  area. Their center was at MazahuacÃ¡n, next to [[JocotitlÃ¡n]] mountain. The [[Otomi people|Otomi]]s were centered in [[Jilotepec]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Colonial period===
[[File:FacadeAcolman2.JPG|thumb|Monastery of Acolman]]
The origin of the modern state is the reorganization of Aztec lands starting after the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire. These lands were initially called the âaudenciaâ of Mexico and included Mexico City, much of modern states of Guerrero, Morelos and Hidalgo. As the Spanish expanded their control west and south, the entirety was called âNew Spainâ with former Aztec lands being called âMexico.â The organization of New Spain would change over the course of the colonial period, but the territory of the Aztecs would keep the name âMexicoâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;origenfun&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

After the Conquest in 1521, [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]]â cousin [[Juan Altamirano]] was given dominion of the Toluca Valley. Other conquistadors such as Antonio Caicedo, Juan de Jaramillo, Cristobal Hernandez and Juan de Samano received [[encomienda]]s  in the state.  [[Franciscan]] missionaries came soon after such as [[Martin de Valencia]], Juan de Tecto, Juan de Ahora, and Pedro de Gante, who established missions and the first school called San Antonio de Padua.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In 1535, the areas around Mexico City were divided into a number of âalcaldÃ­as mayorsâ called [[Chalco]] y [[Amecameca|Ameca]], Tlayacapan y Coatepec, [[Otumba de GÃ³mez FarÃ­as|Otumba]], [[Ecatepec de Morelos|Ecatepec]], [[Sultepec]], [[Zacualpan, Mexico State|Zacualpan]], [[Temascaltepec]], Malinalco, [[Metepec]] and [[Ixtlahuaca]] with Toluca and [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]] recognized as cities. Other orders followed such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s, the [[Augustinian]]s and the [[Jesuit]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

During the colonial period, most of the areaâs economy was based on agriculture with some mining in the areas of Temascaltepec, Sultepec, [[Valle de Bravo]], [[Tlatlaya]], [[Amatepec]] and Zacualpan and the production of [[pulque]] in Otumba and Texcoco. In addition certain areas were known for crafts such as wool processing in Texcoco and Sultepec, soap in Toluca, saddles in Almoloya de JuÃ¡rez, and [[rebozo]]s in various areas. However, the vast majority of the areaâs population was extremely poor due to exploitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Independence===
[[File:Batalla del Monte de las Cruces-30 oct 1810-MÃ©xico.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Battle of Monte de las Cruces]]
During the Mexican War of Independence, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] marched into what is now Mexico State from [[MichoacÃ¡n]] in 1810, passing from the northwest to Toluca on his way to Mexico City. East of Toluca, he fought royalist forces at the [[Battle of Monte de las Cruces]] on 30 October 1810.. While Hidalgo won the battle, he chose not to proceed to Mexico City and then turned towards [[Celaya]]. During the rest of the War, most battles were fought between local insurgent leaders such as Manuel de la Concha and Castillo Bustamante and royalist forces. Battles were fought in [[Sultepec]], [[Amanalco]], Temascaltepec, [[Lerma, Mexico State|Lerma]], [[Tenango del Valle|Tenango]], [[Tenancingo, Mexico State|Tenancingo]] and [[Tecualoya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

After the War, the State of Mexico was created by the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]], with the first state congress convening in March of that year in Mexico City. This state still encompassed the vast territory of the old [[Aztec Empire]]. The first head of the state was [[Melchor MÃºzquiz]]. The vast territory of the state was divided into eight districts:[[Acapulco]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Huejutla]], MÃ©xico, [[Taxco]], Toluca, [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] and [[Tulancingo]]. Mexico City was the capital of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; However, soon after, the federal government choose Mexico City as the capital of the new nation. Under the guidelines of the 1824 Constitution, the capital was appropriated as federal land, with the federal government acting as the local authority. The choice was made official on 18 November 1824 and Congress delineated a surface area of two leagues square (8,800 ac) centered on the [[ZÃ³calo|Zocalo]]. This area was then separated from the State of Mexico, forcing the state's government to move from the [[Palace of the Inquisition (Museum of Mexican Medicine)|Palace of the Inquisition (now Museum of Mexican Medicine)]] in the city to [[Texcoco, Mexico State|Texcoco]]. This area did not yet include the population centers of the towns of [[CoyoacÃ¡n]], [[Xochimilco]], [[San Mateo Mexicaltzingo|Mexicaltzingo]] and [[Tlalpan]], all of which remained as part of the State of Mexico. As the âfederal districtâ of Mexico City grew in size, these and other territories were taken from the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMex2003&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Alvarez|first=Jose Rogelio|encyclopedia=Enciclopedia de Mexico|title=Distrito Federal|year=2003|publisher=Sabeco International Investment Corp.|volume=IV|language=Spanish|isbn=1-56409-063-9|pages=2293â2314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The capital of the state was moved permanently to Toluca in 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/ |title= nomenclatura |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico  |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Mexico |accessdate=July 8, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggles between the liberals (federalists) and the conservatives (centralized power) in the 19th century affected the state, especially in those areas which would later break away to from the states of Hidalgo, Morelos and Guerrero. During the [[Mexican-American War]], the Americans occupied Toluca and Mexico City with the state government temporarily located in the unoccupied Sultepec.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

By 1852, the state had lost a significant amount of territory to the creation of the state of Guerrero, which promoted the reorganization of the municipalities here. During the [[Reform War]], General JosÃ© MarÃ­a Cobos took and sacked a number of municipalities in the territory remaining. During this war, a number of major figures such as [[Melchor Ocampo]], [[Santos Delgollado]] and [[Leandro Valle]] were executed by firing squad in the Toluca Valley regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In 1869, the areas north east and south of Mexico City were converted to the states of Hidalgo and Morelos respectively. The state promulgated a new constitution in 1869, which established the state as consisting of the districts of Chalco, Cuautitlan, Ixtlahuaca, Jilotepec, Lerma, Otumba, Sultepec, Temascaltepec, Tenango del Valle, Tenancingo and Texcoco, which is the territory the state has today.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;
The period before the [[Mexican Revolution]] was relatively prosperous for the state, especially under governor [[JosÃ© Vicente Villada]], who promoted public education, government reform, the establishment of a teachersâ college for women and promoted the Instituto Cientifico y Literario (later UAEM). Mines in various parts of the state were at maximum production.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Mexico Megalopolis.png|thumb|Spread of Greater Mexico City into Mexico and other states]]
Battles were fought in the state during the Mexican Revolution, especially by [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] in the southwest part of the state, with [[Genovevo de la O]] and [[Francisco de Pacheco]] entering with their armies in 1912. Fighting intensified after [[Victoriano Huerta]] took power in 1913. In 1915, Toluca was the site of the Convencion de Generales y Gobernadores Revolucionaries (Convention of Generals and Revolutionary Governors) on two occasions. In 1917, the state had another new constitution, which divided the state into sixteen districts and 118 municipalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

The extension of the [[Greater Mexico City|Mexico City Metropolitan]] area began in 1940 with the creation of the industrial zone of [[Naucalpan]]. The increase of the metro areaâs population, commerce and industry has continued to this day.The Consejo del Area Metropolitana was created in 1988 to coordinate concerns and action of the Greater Mexico City area in both the Distrito Federal and the State of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

From 1824 to 1941, the state had no seal. Governor [[Wenceslao Labra]] proposed one in 1940, which was adopted the following year. It was designed by Pastor VelÃ¡zquez with the motto of âPatria, Libertad, Trabajo y Culturaâ (Country, Liberty, Work and Culture).&lt;ref name=&quot;nomen&quot;/&gt;

In 1956, the Instituto Cientifico y Literario was converted into the [[Universidad AutÃ³noma del Estado de MÃ©xico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

During much of rest of the 20th century, works to divert water from the [[Lerma River]] and other locations to Mexico City were built as well as highways through the state to connect Mexico City with the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In 1990, the Commission Coordinadora para la RecuperaciÃ³n EcolÃ³gica de la Cuenca del Alto Lerma (Coordinating Commission for the Ecological Recuperation of the Upper Lerma River Basin) was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

==Geography, climate and nature==
[[File:ShoreMoonLake.JPG|thumb|Lake of the Moon in the crater of the Nevado de Toluca]]
The state is located in the center of the country, consisting mostly of the eastern side of the AnahuÃ¡c Mesa. Most of the state consists of the Toluca Valley, with the eastern panhandle mostly defined by the Chalco Valley. The state has a territory of 22,499.95km2 and borders the states of [[QuerÃ©taro]], Hidalgo, Guerrero, Morelos, [[Puebla]], [[Tlaxcala]] and [[MichoacÃ¡n]]. The state surrounds the Federal District of Mexico City on three sides (west, north and east).&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The state is divided into five natural regions: the Volcanos of the Valley of Mexico, the hills and plains north of the state, the western mountains, the Balsas Depression and  the mountains and  valleys of the southeast.&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalizacion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/ |title= RegionalizaciÃ³n  |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico  |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Regions |accessdate=July 8, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural geography of the state varies. The eastern portion is dominated by the Sierra Nevada, which divides the state from Puebla. In this mountain chain are the [[PopocatÃ©petl]] and [[IztaccÃ­huatl]] volcanos. The Sierra de Monte Alto and Sierra de Monte Bajo divide the west side of the Federal District from the state and contain peaks such as Cerro de la Bufa and Monte de las Cruces. The Sierra de XinantÃ©catl is to the south of the Toluca Valley. At northern edge of this mountain range is the [[Nevado de Toluca]] volcano. In the northwest of the state is the Sierra de San AndrÃ©s Timilpan. Most of the rock and soil formation in the state is of volcanic origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/ |title= Medio Fisico |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico  |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Environment |accessdate=July 8, 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About seventy percent of the state has a temperate moist climate, which consists of the highlands of the Toluca Valley and the areas around Texcoco in the north, the Toluca Valley and the areas around Texcoco.  Average year-round temperature varies between 12C and 18C with annual precipitation above 700 millimeters. Higher elevations, about 13% of the state, in the center and east of the state have a semicold climate with average temperatures below 16C. Hotter climes are in the relative lowlands in the south west with have an average temperature of between 18C and 22C and constitute about eight percent of the territory. The hottest regions occupy five percent of the state in the extreme southwest with temperatures averaging over 22C.  The coldest areas in the highest elevations such as the Nevado de Toluca, Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl. Snow can be found on these elevations year round. There are some arid areas along the borders of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala with annual precipitation between 500 and 700 milliliters.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;climainegi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/mex/territorio/clima.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=15|title= Clima |publisher=[[INEGI]] |language=Spanish |trans_title=Climate |accessdate=July 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the various climates, the state has a wide variety of flora. 609,000 hectares is covered in tree, most of which is in the temperate and cold climates of the state.  In the extreme southwest of the state, rainforests can be found and desert plants in the Hidalgo border area. In the highest altitudes, such as the peak of the Nevada de Toluca, alpine grassland can be found. In the extreme west, there are forests which receive thousands of monarch butterflies each winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The state has 49 environmentally protected areas, with the most important being the [[Nevado de Toluca National Park]]. Other important areas include the state parks of Otomi-Mazahua, Sierra Morelos and Nahuatlaca-Matlatzinca.   The [[Bonsencheve National Park]] extends into Mexico State from MichoacÃ¡n, and is one of the major monarch butterfly sanctuaries. At the far east is the Iztaccihual-Popocatepetl National Park which is shared with neighboring Puebla state.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The natural feature most closely associated with the state is the Nevado de Toluca or XinantÃ©catl volcano which is just south of the capital of Toluca. This is an extinct volcano which rises 4,690 masl, making it the fourth highest peak in Mexico. At the top is a very large crater that contains two lakes called the Laguna del Sol and the Laguna de la Luna. The volcano and its immediate surroundings are part of the Nevado de Toluca National Park and the Los Venado National Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;atractivos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sitiostur&quot;/&gt;

Valle de Bravo along with neighboring Lake Avandaro is a major weekend getaway for many in Mexico City and Mexico State. The town is filled with red tile roofs and stone paved streets and has been named a âPueblo Magicoâ by the federal tourism agency.
