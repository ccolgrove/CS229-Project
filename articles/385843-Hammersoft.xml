== History ==
=== Founding and early years: 1798-1845 ===

[[Image:ULJusticeCen.jpg|thumb|right|260px|U of L Justice Administration Building]]

The University of Louisville traces its roots back to 1798&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/about/history.html|title=UofL History|accessdate=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the Kentucky General Assembly chartered a school of higher learning in the newly established town of Louisville and ordered the sale of 6,000 acres (24&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of [[South Central Kentucky]] land to pay for its implementation. On April 3, 1798, eight community leaders began local [[Fundraising|fund raising]] for the school, then known as the [[Jefferson Seminary]]. It opened 15 years later in 1813 and offered college and high school level courses in a variety of subjects. It was headed by [[Edward Mann Butler]] from 1813 to 1816, who later headed the first public school in Kentucky in 1829 and is considered Kentucky's first historian. Despite its early success, pressure from newly established public schools and media critiques of it as &quot;elitist&quot; would force its closure in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lms.jefferson.k12.ky.us/lms-archives/publicschools.html|title='Public Schools' entry from The Encyclopedia of Louisville ( c2001)|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later, in 1837, the Louisville [[City council]] established the [[Louisville Medical Institute]] at the urging of renowned physician and medical author [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]]. After his dismissal from [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington's]] [[Transylvania University]], Caldwell would lead the LMI into becoming one of the best [[medical school]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. In 1840, the Louisville [[Collegiate institute]], a rival medical school, was established after an LMI faculty dispute. It opened in 1844 on land near the present day [[Health science]]s campus.

=== History as a public municipal university: 1846-1969 ===

[[Image:Speed Engineering School, Louisville, Kentucky (1067).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[J. B. Speed School of Engineering]] on the Belknap Campus]]

In 1846 the Kentucky legislature combined the Louisville Medical Institute, the Louisville Collegiate Institution, and a newly created law school into the University of Louisville, on a campus just east of [[Downtown Louisville]]. The LCI folded soon afterwards. The university would experience rapid growth in the 20th century, adding new schools in the liberal arts (1907), [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] (1915), [[dentistry]] (1918), [[engineering]] (1925), [[music]] (1932) and [[social work]] (1936).

In 1923, the school purchased what is today the Belknap Campus, where it moved its liberal arts programs and [[University of Louisville School of Law|law school]], with the medical school remaining downtown. The school had attempted to purchase a campus donated by the Belknap family in [[The Highlands (Louisville)|The Highlands]] area in 1917 (where [[Bellarmine University]] is currently located), but a citywide tax increase to pay for it was voted down. The Belknap Campus was named after the family for their efforts.

In 1931, U of L purchased the [[Louisville Municipal College]] for Negroes (est. 1879 and now [[Simmons College of Kentucky]]), as a compromise plan to desegregation. As a part of U of L, the school had an equal standing with the school's other colleges. It was dissolved in 1951 when U of L [[desegregation|desegregated]].

During [[World War II]], Louisville was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;louisville-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/alumni/scholarships/alumni.html |title=Alumni Association Scholarships  |publisher=[[Louisville, Kentucky]]: University of Louisville |last= |first= |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 20th century, schools were opened for [[business]] (1953), [[education]] (1968), and [[justice]] administration (1969).

=== History as a public state university: 1970-present ===

[[Image:LBLawLou.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brandeis School of Law]]

Talk of U of L joining the public [[university system]] of Kentucky began in the 1960s. As a municipally funded school (meaning funding only came from the city of Louisville), the movement of people to the suburbs of Louisville created budget shortfalls for the school and forced tuition prices to levels unaffordable for most students. At the same time, the school's well established medicine and law schools were seen as assets for the state system. Still, there was opposition to U of L becoming public, both from faculty and alumni who feared losing the small, close-knit feel of the campus, and from universities already in the state system who feared funding cuts. After several years of heated debate, the university joined the state system in 1970, a move largely orchestrated by then [[List of Governors of Kentucky|Kentucky governor]] and U of L alumnus [[Louie Nunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/ur/ucomm/mags/fall98/archives.html|title=Going State|accessdate=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first years in the public system were difficult, as enrollment skyrocketed while funding was often insufficient. Several programs were threatened with losing accreditation due to a lack of funding, although schools of [[nursing]] (1979) and urban &amp; [[Public administration|public affairs]] (1983) were added.

[[Image:ULreshall.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Stevenson Hall on the Belknap Campus]]

[[John W. Shumaker]] was named U of L's president in 1995. Shumaker was a very successful [[fund raiser]], and quickly increased the school's endowment from $183 to $550 million. He also developed the REACH program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reach.louisville.edu/about/ |title=About REACH |publisher=Reach.louisville.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage retention. In 1997, he hired [[Athletic director|athletics director]] [[Tom Jurich]], who restored the athletics program and raised over $100 million to raze abandoned factories and old parking lots next to campus and replace them with on-campus athletic facilities, which vastly improved the aesthetics of the Belknap Campus. Academically, U of L moved closer to parity with the state's flagship [[University of Kentucky]] as retention rates and research funding increased, and average GPAs and ACT scores were much higher for incoming freshman.

The school's current and 17th president is [[James R. Ramsey]], the former state budget director. Ramsey has continued the endowment and fund raising growth started by Shumaker, but added more emphasis on improving the physical aspects of the Belknap Campus. To this end, he started a million dollar &quot;campus beautification project&quot; which painted six overpasses on the Belknap Campus with a 'U of L theme' and planted over 500 trees along campus streets, and doubled the number of on-campus housing units. The school's federal [[research funding]] has also doubled under Ramsey, and three buildings have been built for nanotechnology and medical research. UofL's [[retention rate]]s have also increased from 30 percent in 1999 to 40 percent in 2006.

=== UPS tuition reimbursement and Metropolitan College ===

In addition to their nationwide partial tuition reimbursement programs, [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] (United Parcel Service) offers U of L (along with [[Jefferson Community and Technical College]]) students who work overnight at [[Worldport (UPS air hub)|Worldport]], the company's worldwide air hub at [[Louisville International Airport]], full tuition reimbursement through a program called Metropolitan College.  This program also offers reimbursement for $65.00 of book costs for each class, and awards bonus checks to students in good standing at the end of each semester and upon reaching certain credit hour milestones. Employees additionally are eligible for full health insurance coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro-college.com/|title=Metropolitan College|accessdate=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently over 75 percent of the workers at the air hub are students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1766263741.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=May+18,+2006&amp;pub=Courier+-+Journal&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=UPS+fuels+economic+gains|title=UPS fuels economic gains|accessdate=2006-06-08|date=2006-05-18|work=Courier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The campuses ==

The university has three campuses:

=== Belknap Campus ===

[[Image:CardParkKY.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Completed in 2001, Cardinal Park is home to 5 Cardinal athletic teams]]

Acquired in 1923, the '''Belknap Campus''' (pronounced &quot;Bel-nap&quot; with the K silent) is the school's main campus. It is located three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) south of downtown Louisville in the [[Old Louisville]] neighborhood. It houses seven of the 12 academic colleges and contains one of the casts of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s ''[[The Thinker]]'' in front of the main administrative building, Grawemeyer Hall. The grounds of the campus were originally used as an orphanage, several of the original buildings used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.louisville.edu/uarc/digre/refuge.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060904105011/http://library.louisville.edu/uarc/digre/refuge.html|archivedate=2006-09-04|title=University of Louisville Buildings Once Housed Homeless Children|accessdate=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belknap Campus has expanded greatly in recent years, with land housing abandoned factories in the area being purchased and redeveloped. Projects built since 1998 include [[Papa John's Cardinal Stadium]] and adjacent Trager Center fieldhouse, Owsley B. Frazier Cardinal Park (which includes Ulmer Stadium for softball, Trager Stadium for field hockey, Cardinal Track and Soccer Stadium, Bass-Rudd Tennis Center, locker rooms, a playground and a cushioned walking path), [[Jim Patterson Stadium]] for baseball, Ralph R. Wright Natatorium, Owsley Brown Frazier [[Sports medicine]] Center, and a lacrosse stadium. With new parking at Papa John's Cardinal Stadium, non-resident parking was moved there and the [[parking lot]]s near campus were redeveloped with new dormitory buildings, including the [http://www.aoinc.com/content/casestudies/cs2.cfm?return=1 Bettie Johnson Apartments], Kurz Hall, Minardi Hall, and {{cite web |url=http://www.louisville.edu/student/communitypark/ |title=Community Park |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070624001533/http://www.louisville.edu/student/communitypark/ |archivedate=2007-06-24}}.

[[Image:ULquad2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|The Quad on the Belknap Campus]]

Other points of interest on the Belknap Campus include the [https://louisville.edu/planetarium/ Rauch Planetarium], the Covi Gallery of the Hite Art Institute, and the final resting place for former U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Louis Brandeis|Louis D. Brandeis]] under the portico in the Brandeis Law School. Surrounded by, but not part of the campus, are the [[Speed Art Museum]], a private institution not affiliated with the University of Louisville, and the [[Confederate Monument in Louisville|Confederate Civil War Monument]], located at the juncture of 2nd and 3rd streets, which honors [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] dead; this was built there before the school grew to surround the land it stands on, which is owned by [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville Metro]]. The Kentucky State [[Data center]], the state's official [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for census data and estimates, is located next to Bettie Johnson Hall.

In 2008 the school purchased two large tracts of land adjacent to the Belknap Campus, {{convert|55|acre|m2}} to the school's northwest and {{convert|30|acre|m2}} south of the Speed School of Engineering. Construction has already began on the northwest segment, with housing for 3,000 students planned. A historic building at 7th Street and Shipp Avenue will be converted into a parking garage for the new residents. No formal plans have yet been made for the southern segment. Private developers are also planning to build an eight-story student apartment building on recently acquired land on Floyd Street just north of Brandeis Street.

The U of L Health Sciences Campus has seen a large amount of new development in the past decade, include the completion of 3 new buildings (Baxter Research Complex, Cardiovascular Research Tower, and the Jackson Street Medical Plaza). Work is ongoing on the Biolab Research Tower, with a January 2009 completion date projected.

In 2007 U of L announced plans to turn the 30 square block [[Haymarket (Louisville)|Haymarket]] site along I-65 in [[Downtown Louisville]] into a medical research plaza with {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2}} of research space. The project is expected to cost $300 million dollars and would be constructed from 2009 to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2007/08/06/story1.html|title=Making hay: Haymarket project would represent nearly $300 million investment on East Jefferson|last=Green|first=Ed|date=2007-08-03|work=Business First of Louisville|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important project adjacent to the Health Sciences Campus was the conversion of the [[Clarksdale Housing Project|Clarksdale Public Housing Project]] into a new mixed income project dubbed [[Liberty Green (Louisville, Kentucky)|Liberty Green]].

=== Shelby Campus ===&lt;!-- This section is redirected to. --&gt;
The {{convert|230|acre|km2|sing=on}} Shelby Campus is located on [[U.S. Route 60|Shelbyville Road]] near [[Kentucky Route 1747|Hurstbourne Parkway]] in Eastern Louisville. This campus was originally the home of Kentucky Southern College, a [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] [[liberal arts]] college that operated from 1961 to 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://special.library.louisville.edu/display-collection.asp?ID=802 |title=UofL - Kentucky Southern College records |publisher=Special.library.louisville.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the college folded, it transferred all its assets and liabilities to U of L. It currently only has three buildings which are used for night classes and seminars, although construction of a $34.6-million Center for Predictive Medicine, a Level 3 biosafety facility is in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://louisville.edu/community/biosafetylab/
 |title= Bio Safety Lab }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Shelby Campus is also home for the building which houses the Information Technology  Resource Center (ITRC) for [[Homeland security]]. The ITRC conducts communications and IT research for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] as well as seminars and training in [[Emergency management|emergency preparedness]] and response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TheiTRC.com/ |title=theitrc.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U of L Shelby campus is undergoing a major renovation, with two new entrances to the campus off Hurstbourne Parkway. The overall goal is to develop {{convert|108|acre|km2}} of the {{convert|230|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus for business, office, technology and research use, now known as the '''ShelbyHurst Research and Office Park'''. The university will spend $7.9 million on the road improvements on the campus. The roadway improvements began in August 2008, with work on a new four-lane boulevard through the campus, bordered by bike lanes, sidewalks, and will be heavily landscaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://php.louisville.edu/news/news.php?news=1204

U of L recently opened another MBA program in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].

The school also operates the [[Moore Observatory]] in [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham County]], which is used for space viewing. There are also plans to purchase several hundred acres in [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham County]] for the school's [[equine]] program.

The University of Louisville library system is a member of the [[Association of Research Libraries]], a fraternity of the nation's top college libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/arl/membership/members.shtml#L|title=Member Libraries|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; UofL's main library branch is the [[William F. Ekstrom Library]], which opened in 1981. The four story building finished an expansion in March 2006, which increased its total size to {{convert|290000|sqft|m2}} and shelving capacity to over 1.3 million books. It is one of only five universities in the U.S. to have a robotic retrieval system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louisville.edu/library/ekstrom/tour/floor1/robot.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080108134648rn_1/louisville.edu/library/ekstrom/tour/floor1/robot.html|archivedate=2009-07-13|title=Robotic Retrieval System |accessdate=2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which robotically places books in humidity-free bins.
