The election was scheduled in two stages to form the Ninth Assembly since the adoption of the [[Constitution of Egypt|1971 Constitution]]. 444 ordinary seats were contested&lt;ref name=&quot;Mubarak sets a date for parliamentary election&quot; /&gt; with 64 additional seats reserved for women,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mubarak sets a date for parliamentary election&quot; /&gt; while the President appointed 10 members,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mubarak sets a date for parliamentary election&quot; /&gt; making a total of 518 seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mubarak sets a date for parliamentary election&quot; /&gt;

Human rights groups said this was the most fraudulent poll ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/11/hosni-mubarak-resigns-analysis &quot;Hosni Mubarak: Egyptian 'pharaoh' dethroned amid gunfire and blood&quot;]. ''The Guardian''. 11 February 2011. &quot;As soon as Bush lost interest, he reverted to form, persecuting independent pro-democracy leaders such as Ayman Nour and the Kefaya movement. Last year's parliamentary poll was the most fraudulent ever, according to human rights groups.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Politics of Egypt}}

This election follows the Muslim Brotherhood completing the five-year parliamentary term in which it held on as the largest-ever minority bloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazmb&quot;/&gt;

==Electoral system==
===Single member plurality===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}

The '''[[plurality voting system]]''' is a [[single-winner voting system]] often used to elect executive officers or to elect members of a legislative assembly which is based on single-member [[constituency|constituencies]]. This voting method is also used in multi-member constituencies in what is referred to as an exhaustive counting system where one member is elected at a time and the process repeated until the number of vacancies is filled.

The election process will run in the three stages [[single member plurality]], with millions of registered voters in the 222 [[constituencies]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Most of the political parties in Egypt have been advocating for a [[Party-list proportional representation|Party-list]] while the NPD insisted on the ''Single member plurality''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Seat allocation===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}

The election is the first election were 64 additional seats reserved for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mubarak sets a date for parliamentary election&quot; /&gt;

==Pre-election seating==
[[File:Egyptian parliamentary election of 2005 with logos.png|thumb|left|Previous election result]]

The previous number of seats in the Assembly was 454 after the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2005|2005 legislative election]] resulted in the following seat distribution in the Eighth Assembly:
*[[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP) - 330
*[[New Wafd Party]]                                                    - 5
*[[Progressive National Unionist Party]]                               - 1
*[[El-Ghad Party]]                                                     - 1
*[[Arab Democratic Nasserist Party]]                                   - 0
*[[Ahrar Party (Egypt)|Liberal Party]] (''Hizb al-Ahrar'')             - 0
*Independents                                                          - 19
*Independents ([[Muslim Brotherhood]] - ''al-ikhwÄn al-muslimÅ«n'')     - 88
*Non-Elected Members                                                   - 10

Initially the NDP scored only 40% of the seats, but many independents switched their political affiliation back to NDP giving it its soaring majority.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Nomination for the poll commenced on November 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=27038 Ikhwanweb :: The Muslim Brotherhood Official English Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] said it would compete in the elections despite calls for a boycott. [[Mohammed Badie]], the new chief of the party, said they would contest 30 percent of the seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/10/201010911379428759.html Brotherhood to run in Egypt polls - Middle East - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also termed the &quot;best-organised counterweight to Mubarak's National Democratic Party.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazmb&quot;&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/2010/11/2010111681527837704.html The Muslim Brotherhood in flux - In Depth - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A former adviser to the Muslim Brotherhood, Abdel Hamid al-Ghazaly, said that while the party had brokered a deal with the governing National Democratic Party during the 2005 parliamentary election, no such deal would be agreed to this year. He also said Egyptians voted Brotherhood in 2005 to show their dissatisfaction with the ruling regime. &quot;They werenât necessarily fond of us. [But] we have no political life whatsoever, thanks to the regime. We canât even be compared with the most backward countries of the world. Participation in this yearâs parliamentary election is the only hope for the Muslim Brothers to get out of the predicament they are in.&quot; A [[National Progressive Unionist Party|Tagammu]] party member, Abul Ez al-Hariri, also suggested the deals that the opposition parties signed resulted in a loss of credibility and consequent inability to play an effective role in politics. &quot;They have become advocates of the regime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/no-ndp-muslim-brotherhood-deal-over-impending-elections-says-former-mb-adviser No NDP-Muslim Brotherhood deal over impending elections, says former MB adviser | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition groups and civil society activists issued a list of demands:
*Amendment of Article 76 of the Constitution to make it easier for party and independent candidates to get on the presidential ballot.
*Amendment of Article 77 to establish term limits for the presidency, which were removed from the Constitution in 1981.
*Amendment of Article 88 to restore full judicial supervision of elections. This would help tame election fraud and vote rigging, which are common in Egyptian elections.
*Amendment of Law 177 of 2005 in order to facilitate the formation of new political parties.
*Amendment of Article 179: Amendments in 2007 to Article 179 included an &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; measure, which allows for arbitrary arrest, searches and wiretapping without warrant, and transfer of any civilian court case of the presidentâs choosing to military tribunals. Unlike the Emergency law, it is a permanent measure and not a temporary measure requiring parliamentary approval.

In the Spring 2010, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] began circulating a petition in the runup to the election calling for 7 specific reforms:
#End the state of emergency.
#Ensure full judicial supervision of elections.
#Provide for domestic and international monitoring of elections.
#Ensure that all candidates have sufficient access to the media, particularly during the presidential election campaign.
#Allow Egyptians abroad to vote through embassies and consulates.
#Work toward a political system built on democracy and social justice.
#Provide the right to nomination for political office without obstacles, in accordance with Egyptâs obligations under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights; limit the president to two terms.
#Allow voting by national identification card. These measures will require amending articles 76, 77, and 88 of the Constitution as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;egyptelections&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|url=http://egyptelections.carnegieendowment.org/2010/09/01/constitutional-and-legal-framework|title=Constitutional and Legal Framework|work=[[Carnegie Endowment]] |location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boycotts==
Mohamed ElBaradei, a potential presidential candidate called for a boycott of the election.

The [[El-Ghad Party]] became the second party to boycott the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/09/20109156120578610.html Egyptian party boycotts elections - Middle East - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Wafd party'' ignored boycott calls saying in its party paper that it would run in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=154599&amp;language=en Al-ManarTV:: EgyptÃ¢â¬â¢s Wafd Party Chooses to Take Part in Upcoming Polls 18/09/2010&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim Brotherhood, however, disavowed boycott calls from other opposition allies, which the party leadership said the decision was made by consensus. Some people lauded the decisition as the &quot;most effective way to counter Egypt's gerrymandered electoral system,&quot; and that there was a &quot;practical advantage&quot; by gaining seats in parliament. Some party members, however, said the decision not to boycott was a mistake, while others said it was a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; and reflective of &quot;internal strife [that] indicates the dearth of creative strategic thinkers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazmb&quot;/&gt;

The Muslim Brotherhood and the Wafd party called for a boycott of the runoff election.&lt;Ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/12/2010121145450744767.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
The election was criticised as being a &quot;sham.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/11/20101117115630882819.html How to win power in Egypt - Features - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===State of Emergency===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
President Mubarak promised in 2005 that he would put in place a counter terrorism law that would obviate the need for the [[state of emergency]] that has been in place continuously since Sadatâs assassination in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time to Pursue Democracy in Egypt&quot;&gt;[http://carnegieendowment.org/files/Dunne_Egypt_FINAL2.pdf Time to Pursue Democracy in Egypt]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he then renewed the state of emergency. The Egyptian government has long claimed that such powers are used only against suspected terrorists and drug dealers but in fact they have also been used against nonviolent political opponents of the regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time to Pursue Democracy in Egypt&quot; /&gt;

===Candidate ban===
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
The ruling National Democratic Party (''NDP'')'s recent decision to ban three of its parliamentary candidates from standing in ''2010 parliamentary election'' has kicked up a storm of speculation&lt;ref name=&quot;NDP's pro-Gamal Mubarak candidates banned from parliamentary polls&quot;&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/ndps-pro-gamal-mubarak-candidates-banned-parliamentary-polls NDP's pro-Gamal Mubarak candidates banned from parliamentary polls]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The three candidates to be banned are Daker Abdel Lah, who had been running for the professional seats in Manshiet Nasser and Gamaliya; Islam Medhat, who had been running for the professional seats in the Abdeen and Moski constituencies; and Ayman Taha, who had been running for seats reserved for workers in the Bolak Abu al-Eila constituency&lt;ref name=&quot;NDP's pro-Gamal Mubarak candidates banned from parliamentary polls&quot; /&gt;.

===Election monitoring===
The election would not to be under the supervision of any national court or international monitors. The General-Secretary of the Policy Committee in the National Democratic Party Gamal Mubarak said: &quot;This issue is governed by the law and the constitution which made it possible for civil society organizations to monitor the elections&lt;ref name=&quot;Â«National Democratic PartyÂ» emphasizes the unity of the parliamentary majority to reap and rejects any international monitoring of the elections&quot; /&gt;&quot;. The Secretary of Education in the National Democratic Party|NDP, [[Mohamed Kamal]], said that the party welcomes the supervision of national organisations, but refuses international monitoring. He also claimed that the abolition of judicial supervision of elections does not affect the integrity of the elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Â«National Democratic PartyÂ» emphasizes the unity of the parliamentary majority to reap and rejects any international monitoring of the elections&quot; /&gt; But there are concerns by the opposition that the persistence of the regime in power, who was not prepared to give up power under any circumstance was a major obstacle in the way of [[democracy]]. Abdel Moneim Sayyid, chairman of [[Al-Ahram]] and a member of the Policy Committee of the National Party, said that &quot;the regime will not relinquish its grip on power even if it means holding fraudulent elections.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Christian Science Monitor: ElBaradei rally Egypt for reform&quot;&gt;[http://www.Shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?ID=216942 The Christian Science Monitor: ElBaradei rally Egypt for reform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Christian Science Monitor: ''Eyeing presidency'', Mohamed ElBaradei rallies Egypt for reform&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0423/Eyeing-presidency-Mohamed-ElBaradei-rallies-Egypt-for-reform/(page)/2 The Christian Science Monitor: ''Eyeing presidency'', Mohamed ElBaradei rallies Egypt for reform]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] expressed concern about the deterioration of [[press freedom]] in lead up to the election. [[Reporters without Borders]] also placed Egypt in the bottom 35 of 175 countries in regards to press freedom. While, local journalists said the government has cracked down harder on the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2010/10/2010101112452847133.html Concerns over Egypt media freedom - Africa - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2nd===
After its accusations of government fraud and vote buying during Sunday's first round of the parliamentary elections, Egypt's largest opposition group, the Muslim Brotherhood, has decided not to take part in this weekend's runoff poll&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim Brotherhood to boycott parliamentary elections runoff&quot;&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/12/egypt-muslim-brotherhood-to-boycott-parliamentary-elections-run-off.html Muslim Brotherhood to boycott parliamentary elections runoff]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The decision comes one day after the Higher Elections Committee announced the first round's official results in which the Islamist group failed to win a single seat, but still had 27 candidates to compete in the runoff&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim Brotherhood to boycott parliamentary elections runoff&quot; /&gt;.

The ruling National Democratic Party won nearly 95% of the 221 seats settled in the first round.

===2011 Presidential elections===
{{Main|Egyptian presidential election, 2011}}

The failure to achieve the 5% threshold by the major opposition parties, whether independently or collectively, has endangered their involvement in the upcoming Presidential Elections in 2011. The amendment of article 76 of the Constitution, which allowed multi-candidate presidential elections, but imposed draconian rules on party nominees, is thought to be in need of alteration to remove the 5% restriction. Without such an alteration, the 2011 presidential elections will be little more than a modified version of the single-candidate poll it has been for the past 5 decades or so.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===2011 Egyptian protests===
{{main|2011 Egyptian protests}}
In 2011, following sentiment during the [[2010-2011 Tunisian uprising]], Egyptians also took to the streets to protest similar conditions such as police brutality, the state of emergency laws in place for decades, unemployment, a desire to raise the minimum wage, lack of housing, food inflation, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, and poor living conditions.  There were also rumours that the President Mubarak's son had fled the country.

Just over a month after having been formed Mubarak asked for the government's resignation on 28 January, 2011 saying he would call for a new government the next day.

After Mubarak's resignation following 18 days of on-going protests, Egypt's military council dissolved parliament, a key demand of the protesters.
