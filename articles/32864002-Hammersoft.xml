==V-Disc Recordings, Jo Stafford==
{{main|V-Disc Recordings, Jo Stafford}}

The [[V-Disc]] program began in June 1941 and continued until May 1949.  It was a way for United States service people stationed overseas to have access to the music that was currently popular &quot;at home&quot;. Musicians and recording artists made these special recordings strictly for those serving in the Armed Forces.  [[Jo Stafford]] produced 20 V-Discs for the entertainment of those in the military during this time; this album is a compilation of the V-Disc recordings she made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgi.ebay.com/V-Disc-Recordings-Jo-Stafford-Very-Good-/110660400864?pt=Music_CDs&amp;hash=item19c3dfb6e0#ht_829wt_1140|title=V-Disc Recordings, Jo Stafford|publisher=eBay|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xqrS3G8I|archivedate=10 April 2011|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sincerely Yours==
{{main|Sincerely Yours (Jo Stafford album)}}

'''''Sincerely Yours''''' is a 2006 compilation album of songs recorded by American singer [[Jo Stafford]]. It was released on May 9, 2006 on the [[Sepia Records|Sepia]] label.  

The &quot;Hollywood House Party&quot; included on the album was a special release of [[Columbia Records]] in 1955. It was recorded at a party Stafford and husband [[Paul Weston]] gave at their home. Columbia had produced several new [[phonograph]]s in 1955; part of their sales promotion for them was to give buyers of units valued at $100 or more the ''Columbia House Party'' album, which was not available any other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belle49.freeserve.co.uk/guy/special.htm|title=U.S.A. Special Issues not sold to the public|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One side of the album featured the party with celebrities at the Weston's California home, while the other featured [[Mitch Miller]]'s New York City party. Those who attended the Weston's Hollywood house party and are heard on this album include [[Liberace]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Frankie Laine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ch0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=jo+stafford+%22house+party%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4rypTeelGcHagQf_j9jzBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jo%20stafford%20%22house%20party%22&amp;f=false|title=New Columbia Phono Line|date=18 June 1955|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/stafford_jo/1281696/album.jhtml|title=Sincerely Yours|publisher=CMT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
