The '''2002â03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team''' represented [[Syracuse University]] in NCAA men's basketball competition in the 2002â03 Division I season. (At that time, &quot;Orangemen&quot; was exclusively used to refer to Syracuse men's teams; women's teams were known as &quot;Orangewomen&quot;.) The Head Coach was [[Jim Boeheim]], serving for his 27th year. The team played its home games at the [[Carrier Dome]] in [[Syracuse, NY|Syracuse]], [[New York]].  The team finished with a 30â5 (13â3) record, while capturing its first modern-era [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Championship]].

The team had just one senior, guard [[Kueth Duany]]. He was joined in the starting lineup by forwards [[Hakim Warrick]] (sophomore), [[Carmelo Anthony]] (freshman), center [[Craig Forth]] (sophomore) and guard [[Gerry McNamara]] (freshman). Other key contributors included guards [[Josh Pace]] (sophomore) and [[Billy Edelin]] (freshman), and center [[Jeremy McNeil]] (junior). 

== Season Recap ==

Things did not start well for Syracuse. Guards [[DeShaun Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2002/08/28/News/Williams.To.Leave.Orangemen-263566.shtml Williams to leave Orangemen â News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Thues]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2002/04/16/Sports/Thues.Transfers.To.Detroit.Mercy-237882.shtml Thues transfers to Detroit Mercy â Sports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; both left the team. Williams transferred to [[Iona College (New York)|Iona]] while Thues left for [[University of Detroit|Detroit]]. Freshman point guard Billy Edelin was suspended for 12 games for participating in a non-sanctioned basketball league. Syracuse then started its season with a loss against Memphis, despite Carmelo Anthony's 27 points, a then-high for a Syracuse freshman debut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazellegroup.com/events/cvc/results/2002/memsyrrecap.htm Memphis Holds Off Syracuse, 70â63&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

But things turned around, as Syracuse went 13â3 in the Big East, with several memorable wins. McNamara would establish himself as a clutch player, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82â80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyorange.com/media/paper522/news/2003/02/17/Sports/Mcnamara8217s.GameWinning.3.Lifts.Su.To.Win.Over.Notre.Dame-371327.shtml The Daily Orange&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In an upset of then-No. 24 Syracuse over then-No. 2 Pittsburgh, McNeil, a career 49.1% free throw shooter, hit two key free throws, and added a game-winning tip in a 67â65 upset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/games/2003-02-01-pitt-syracuse_x.htm USATODAY.com â Syracuse blocks Pittsburgh from first coronation at No. 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orangemen would play five Big 12 teams throughout the year, including games against [[University of Missouri|Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores103/103013/20030113NCAABSYRACUSE--0nr.htm NCAA Division I Menâs Basketball â Missouri vs. Syracuse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in the regular season, and against [[Oklahoma Sooners|Oklahoma]] (Elite Eight), [[Oklahoma State Cowboys|Oklahoma State]] (second round), [[University of Texas|Texas]] (National Semifinal) and then [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] (National Championship game).&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_15_227/ai_100048062 Fresh-squeezed orangeman: Carmelo Anthony carries Syracuse to its first NCAA championship and proves to have the juiciest game of any college freshmanâever | Sporting News, Th...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the championship game against Kansas, with Syracuse leading by three with under 15 seconds left, Warrick missed two free throws that would've sealed the game with Syracuse hanging on to a three-point lead, 81â78. With 1.5 seconds left and the score still the same, Kansas' Michael Lee was open on the baseline for a potential game-tying 3-pointer. But Warrick used his long arms to block Lee's attempt and Syracuse captured its first ever national championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyorange.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=4f0a629b-8546-49b8-889a-e34259bcd484 The Daily Orange&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, the game was played in Super Dome in New Orleans, where Syracuse had lost the National Championship to [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]] in 1987 on a last second shot by [[Keith Smart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/60 ESPN.com â ESPN 25 â 60: Smart's jumper wins NCAA title for Indiana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
