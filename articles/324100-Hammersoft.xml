'''Philip Henry Niekro''' (born April 1, 1939), nicknamed '''&quot;Knucksie&quot;''' because of his usage and skill level with the knuckleball, is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1997.

A native of [[Blaine, Ohio]], Niekro attended [[Bridgeport High School (Ohio)|Bridgeport High School]] in [[Bridgeport, Ohio]], and was a boyhood friend of [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Hall-of-Famer [[John Havlicek]]. Phil and his younger brother, fellow major league pitcher [[Joe Niekro]], learned to throw a knuckleball from their father Joe Niekro, Sr. in their backyard as kids.

With 318 career victories, Niekro is the winningest [[knuckleball]] pitcher of all time, and currently ranks 16th on the all-time wins list.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Major League Baseball leaders in career wins]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the [[National League]] [[Gold Glove Award]] five times. Phil and Joe Niekro are the winningest brother combination in baseball history, with 539 wins combined. Phil Niekro's 121 career victories after the age of 40 is a major league record, and his longevity is attributed to the [[knuckleball]], which, while a difficult pitch for pitchers to master, is easy on the arm and often baffles hitters due to its fluttering trajectory. He is also the uncle of former [[first baseman]] and [[pitcher]] [[Lance Niekro]]. The baseball field in Phil's hometown of Bridgeport, Ohio has been named Niekro Diamond in honor of Phil and Joe Niekro.

== Career with the Braves ==

Niekro pitched for 20 seasons for the [[Atlanta Braves]] (two of those seasons when the team was still in [[Milwaukee]]). He was popular in the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] for remaining loyal to a team that often had a losing record, as well as for his contributions to Atlanta charities. On August 5, {{By|1973}}, Niekro threw a [[no-hitter]] against the [[San Diego Padres]].  The no-hitter was the first for the Braves since they moved to Atlanta. He was often the only star on the Braves teams. In {{By|1979}}, for example, Niekro tied his brother for the league lead with 21 wins while playing for a team that only won 66. During his tenure in Atlanta, Niekro was selected for five [[All-Star]] Teams, won five gold gloves, led the league in victories twice and [[earned run average]] once.

Niekro was also a key to the only two division titles Atlanta won before {{By|1991}}. In {{By|1969}}, he had a 23â13 season with a 2.56 ERA and finished second in Cy Young balloting to [[New York Mets]] sensation [[Tom Seaver]]. In the final days of the season, Niekro started three of seven games, going 3-0 as the Braves won the division. He lost his only appearance in the NLCS, as Atlanta was swept by the Mets. 

In {{By|1982}}, at the age of 43, Niekro led the Braves' pitching staff with a 17â4 season. On October 1, with the Braves clinging to a one-game lead over the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], Niekro beat the [[San Diego Padres]] almost single-handedly by throwing a complete game [[shutout]] and hitting a two run [[home run]]. Niekro started Game One of the subsequent NLCS against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and pitched well, but the game was called on account of rain just before it became official. He pitched six [[inning]]s of Game Two and left with a 3â2 lead. However, the Cardinals scored 2 runs off the bullpen to win the game and eventually sweep the series.

== Career after the Braves ==
{{MLBBioRet

The Braves released Niekro after the 1983 season and he signed with the [[New York Yankees]] and went on to win 16 games and make the last of his five All-Star appearances. It was while pitching for the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] that Niekro gained entry into the [[300 win club]] with a shutout win over the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on October 6, 1985. At 46 years, 188 days, Niekro became the oldest pitcher to pitch a shutout in the major leagues; this record stood for nearly 25 years before [[Jamie Moyer]] (47 years, 170 days) bested the feat in May 2010; for Niekro, this complete-game shutout would be his 300th win. He did not throw his trademark knuckleball until the final hitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_9_62/ai_106226458/pg_6?tag=untagged|title=Road to 300: with Roger Clemens becoming the 21st pitcher to win 300 big league games, here are the stories of seven others who reached the same milestone|author=Quinn, T.J.|publisher=[[Baseball Digest]]|date=2003-09|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two seasons in New York, Niekro pitched for the [[Cleveland Indians]] and [[Toronto Blue Jays]] in 1986 and 1987. The Blue Jays released him after he pitched ineffectively, and the Braves brought him back for one last start to wrap up his career late in the 1987 season. At the age of 48, Niekro was the [[List of oldest Major League Baseball players|oldest player in major league history]] to play regularly until [[Julio Franco]], and his 24 seasons in the major leagues without a World Series appearance is a major league record. His total of 5,404â innings pitched is the most by any pitcher in the post-1920 [[live-ball era]]. He only appeared in the post season twice, making a playoff start in 1969 and again in 1982, both for Braves teams that would go on to lose the series.

== Post-playing career ==

After the end of his professional baseball career, Niekro managed the all-women [[Colorado Silver Bullets]] baseball team. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1997. Niekro tutored his nephew, [[Lance Niekro]] to throw a knuckleball after his unsuccessful stints as a power-hitting first base prospect with the [[San Francisco Giants]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fresnobee.com/sports/grizzlies/v-printerfriendly/story/116797.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Niekro was a good enough tutor to help Lance earn a minor-league contract with the Atlanta Braves preceding the 2009 season.

Currently, Niekro is a member of the Kiz Toys Board of Advisors. Kiz Toys is a toy company based out of [[Cumming, Georgia]], and Niekro advises the company on the KizSport baseball line, reviewing product designs and development on an ongoing basis and offering suggestions on current and future products.

The [[Gwinnett Braves]]' stadium has a restaurant named ''Knucksie's'' after him; it features the Knucksie Sandwich made of barbecue and cole slaw atop a corn muffin, said to be his favorite.

==Quotations==

*&quot;Trying to hit [Niekro] is like trying to eat Jell-O with chopsticks.&quot; â [[Bobby Murcer]], who batted only .208 with no home runs (all 10 of his hits were singles) in 48 career at-bats against Niekro.

On Niekro's knuckleball:

*&quot;It's like watching [[Mario Andretti]] park a car.&quot; â [[Ralph Kiner]]

*&quot;Trying to hit that thing is a miserable way to make a living,&quot; and &quot;I work for three weeks to get my swing down pat and Phil (Niekro) messes it up in one night.&quot; â both quotes by [[Pete Rose]]

*&quot;It giggles as it goes by,&quot; and &quot;When I swing, don't laugh.&quot; â both quotes by [[Rick Monday]]

*&quot;Hitting Niekro's knuckleball is like eating soup with a fork.&quot; - [[Richie Hebner]]
