  Any addition to the list with a hyperlink (e.g., to a wikiarticle) clearly identifying the operation does not need to refer to the formation or unit involved, since the hyperlinked article should include appropriate references.  Likewise, RAF and USAAF listings identified in the already-cited bombing histories do not need an individual citation.  RULE OF THUMB: If the operation isn't important enough to already be identified in a wikiarticle (i.e., first), is it &quot;notable&quot; enough to be listed in this article?
