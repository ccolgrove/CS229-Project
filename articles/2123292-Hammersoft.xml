One of Harris's breakthrough stage performance came in the original cast of [[Paul Rudnick|Paul Rudnick's]] ''[[Jeffrey (film)|Jeffrey]]'', where she was the sole female cast member. Her work in ''Jeffrey'' led to numerous television guest appearances, including a recurring role on the TV series, ''[[Frasier]]'' as Frasier's conniving agent [[Bebe Glazer]]. 

Her own series (including ''[[The 5 Mrs. Buchanans]]'', ''[[Union Square (television)|Union Square]]'', ''[[The Beast (2001 TV series)|The Beast]]'', and ''[[It's All Relative]]'') were unsuccessful, but her guest roles on hit series, including ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[Ellen (television series)|Ellen]]'' were memorable. Among them was her performance on ''[[The X-Files]]'' in the 1993 episode &quot;[[Eve (The X-Files)|Eve]]&quot; as Dr. Sally Kendrick and her &quot;Eve&quot; clones, from which the band ''[[Eve 6]]'' derived its name. In 2006, she starred in the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] [[television miniseries]] ''[[The Lost Room]]'' as Margaret Milne.&lt;ref name=filmreference/&gt;

In 1992 Harris made her Broadway debut in the play ''[[Four Baboons Adoring the Sun]]''. That same year she was nominated for a [[Drama Desk Award]] for her portrayal in the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''Bella, Belle of Byelorussia''. In 1993 she received a second Drama Desk nomination for her performance in [[Paul Rudnick]]'s ''[[Jeffrey (play)|Jeffrey]]''. She won both a Drama Desk and [[Tony Award]] in 2002 as a Featured Actress in a Musical for playing the evil white slaver Mrs. Meers in ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie (musical)|Thoroughly Modern Millie]]''.

Since 2005, Harris has appeared in various stage productions across the United States. In the summer of 2006 she appeared as ''Vera Charles'' in the [[Kennedy Center|Kennedy Center's]] production of ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' opposite [[Christine Baranski]] in the title role. In early 2007, Harriet  appeared as Amanda Wingfield in the production of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'' at the [[Guthrie Theater]]. In the summer of 2007, Harriet appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the [[Revival (play)|revival]] of the [[John Van Druten]] comedy ''[[Old Acquaintance]]'' as ''Mildred Watson Drake'' with [[Margaret Colin]] at the [[American Airlines Theatre]].

In 2007, Harris returned to Broadway and joined the cast of the musical ''[[Cry-Baby (musical)|Cry-Baby]]'', based on the [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] [[Cry-Baby|film of the same name]].  The show previewed at [[Broadway theatre|Broadway's]] [[Marquis Theatre]] on March 15, 2008 and opened on April 24. The production was nominated for Best Musical at the [[62nd Tony Awards|2008 Tony Awards]] and later closed following the matinÃ©e performance on June 22.

==''Desperate Housewives''==
Harris became known to a new generation by playing [[Martha Huber]]'s sister [[Felicia Tilman]] on the hit ABC drama ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' in 2004. The narrative saw Felicia arrive on Wisteria Lane to discover who was behind her sister's murder. She soon came to the conclusion that [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] was responsible, but before she could act out her revenge, she was attacked by his son [[Zach Young]]. To finish the story, Harris returned for the second season in 2005, which followed Felicia as she planned her final acts of  revenge against Paul. She departed at the end of the second series by faking her own murder; thus framing Paul, and sending him to prison.

Harris returned to ''Desperate Housewives'' for the show's seventh season which saw Felicia reprise her role as [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]]'s continued arch-nemesis.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, William.[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kecks-Exclusives-Harriet-1020048.aspx &quot;Keck's Exclusives: Harriet Sansom Harris to Join Mark Moses on 'Desperate Housewives'!&quot;], ''TV Guide'', June 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; She has appeared in 28 episodes to date, with her portrayal of Felicia being prasied by fans and critics alike. Harris departed once again in the second-to-last episode of season seven, which saw Felicia involved in a head-on collision with a semi. Her fate at the end of the episode was left unknown. 

On playing the character Harris commented:
&quot;People do find Felicia evil. I think she's just determined. She's a zealot pursuing an objective that no-one wants her to pursue. And it makes her really eccentric. And even though a man she's pursuing is the one who committed murder, he's only considered creepy by people and Felicia is always considered evil. I think that's so interesting because he's really the bad person. She's just trying to get him caught. But she is extreme. I think she doesn't stop when others would. She keeps on, she keeps pursuing and I think that is a scary thing. She just keeps scraping away until she eventually gets what she wants. And if she doesn't get it one way, she'll go around and do it another way. She's completely unapologetic about it. She doesn't care what anybody else thinks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, Randy.[http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=2162 &quot;Harriet Harris:Stage and TV Actress Discusses Role in 'Mame' and 'Frasier'&quot;] MetroWeekly.com, June 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Harriet calls New York her home, but she frequently travels to California for film and television appearances. She is good friends with stage actress [[Lisa Banes]] and ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'' star [[Christine Baranski]], who she starred with in the 2007 production of ''Mame''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosati, Nancy.http://www.talkinbroadway.com/spot/harris.html &quot;Spotlight on Harriet Harris&quot;] TalkinBroadway.com, accessed August 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
