'''[[Penn State]]''' has had a long tradition with their men's [[volleyball]] program. Founded in 1976 by Tom Tait, Tait coached the team from 1976â1989, and was named a [[USA Volleyball]] All-Time great coach in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.brevard.edu/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Rq6k6Pfe7WU%3D&amp;tabid=158| title = Tom Tait awarded USA volleyball all-time great coach | last =  | first =  | date = 2007-08-07 | publisher = Brevard College | accessdate = 2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Pavlik]] has been the head coach since 1995 after serving as an assistant coach for five years. He has led the team to every [[EIVA]] conference championship since 1995 with the exception of 1998. Under his guidance, Penn State finished as NCAA runner-ups in 1995 and 2006 before winning it all in 2008. He also led the team to an NCAA record of 11 straight (1998â2009) NCAA final four appearances. Pavlik was awarded his first ever AVCA National Coach of the Year in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/spec-rel/052108aab.html| title = Mark Pavlik named AVCA National Coach of the Year | last =  | first =  | date = 2008-05-21 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = 2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
===1982===
Penn State made their first ever [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship|NCAA Championship match]] this year. Current head coach Mark Pavlik was a setter on the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.volleyball.com/questions/default.aspx?mode=blog&amp;id=16&amp;yearnum=2008&amp;monthnum=6| title = Questions with Mark Pavlik | last = Phillips | first = Christine | date = 2008-06-11 | publisher = Volleyball.com | accessdate = 2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State was swept by perennial powerhouse [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]] in the final at [[Rec Hall]], led by future [[Olympic games|Olympic]] gold medalist and Most Outstanding Player [[Karch Kiraly]].

===1994===
1994 was a historic year, as Penn State became the first non-[[California]] university to win the men's volleyball championship. Playing in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], the Lions defeated defending NCAA champion UCLA in a five-set match. After falling behind 2 sets to 1, UCLA looked to have the championship in their hands after being up 11-4 in the fourth set, needing to only get to 15. However, the Lions mounted a stunning comeback and went on a 11-1 run to take set four 15-12 and set five with the same score to win the national championship. It was then-head coach Tom Peterson's last year.

===1997===
Penn State got back to the final four, losing to UCLA in a five-set match in the semifinals. Senior [[Ivan Contreras]] was named the [[AVCA]] National Player of the Year, the first ever east coast player to win the award.

===2006===
After eight straight years of making the NCAA final four and losing in the semifinals, Penn State finally broke through. They defeated top ranked and top-seeded [[UC Irvine]] in the semifinals at [[Rec Hall]] in five games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/spec-rel/050406aab.html| title = Men's volleyball stuns No. 1 UC Irvine | last = | first =  | date = 2006-05-04 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = 2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the successful semifinal result, Penn State lost to UCLA in the national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/spec-rel/050606aaa.html| title = UCLA claims 19th championship with sweep of Lions | last = | first =  | date = 2006-05-06 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = 2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2008 season, Penn State swept UCLA for the first time since 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/010508aaa.html No. 4 Penn State sweeps No. 3 UCLA]&lt;/ref&gt; and also defeated west coast powers Hawai'i,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/010408aaa.html No. 4 men's volleyball downs #11 Hawai'i]&lt;/ref&gt; [[California Baptist University|Cal Baptist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/031408aaa.html Penn State men's volleyball tops Cal Baptist, 3-0]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Long Beach State]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/031608aaa.html Penn State outlasts Long Beach State]&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State only lost one match in the regular season to [[George Mason University|George Mason]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/030708aaa.html| title = Top ranked Penn State falls to George Mason | last =  | first = | date = 2008-03-07 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but got revenge on the [[George Mason Patriots|Patriots]] in the [[EIVA]] tournament finals, securing their bid for their NCAA record 10th consecutive final four appearance. Penn State improved to 55-3 all time in the EIVA championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/042608aaa.html| title = Top ranked men's volleyball advances to NCAA Final Four | last =  | first = | date = 2008-04-26 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State was the top seed in the final four, the first time in the history of the men's volleyball tournament that a non-west coast university was the top seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/spec-rel/042708aaa.html| title = Top ranked men's volleyball number 1 seed in Final Four | last =  | first = | date = 2008-04-27 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final four was held in [[Irvine, California]] at the [[Bren Events Center]] from May 1â3. After defeating [[Ohio State]] in the semifinals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/050108aac.html Penn State tops Ohio State, advances to NCAA championship]&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State met [[Pepperdine University|Pepperdine]] in the final. After dropping the first game, Penn State went on to win the next three to defeat the [[Pepperdine#Athletics|Waves]] in four games. [[Matt Anderson (volleyball)|Matt Anderson]], the AVCA National Player of the Year, was named the Most Outstanding Player and also was an AVCA First Team All-American.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/recaps/050308aaa.html Penn State men's volleyball beats Pepperdine, wins national championship]&lt;/ref&gt; Four other Penn State players were named All-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/m-volley/spec-rel/042808aab.html No. 1 Men's volleyball earns five All-America awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pepperdine head coach [[Marv Dunphy]] said earlier in the NCAA tournament that the 2008 Penn State men's volleyball team was the best men's volleyball team to ever come out of the east or midwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.volleyballmag.com/archive/2008/NittanyLion.php| title = The Year of the Nittany Lion | last =Miazga  | first =Mike | date = 2008-05-04 | publisher = ''Volleyball Magazine''| accessdate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
