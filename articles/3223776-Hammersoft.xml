'''David Wilkinson Jenkins''' (born June 29, 1936 in [[Akron, Ohio]]), is an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]]. He won the men's gold medal for figure skating during the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] in [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]]. David Jenkins had led the world in men's skating for four years, following the four-year lead of his older brother, figure skater [[Hayes Alan Jenkins]].

Jenkins was known as an especially strong jumper for his time.  There exists video of him performing a [[axel jump|triple axel jump]] in a 1957 exhibition, 21 years before that jump was landed for the first time in competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/olympics/index.ssf/2010/02/akron_native_david_jenkins_sti.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1960 Olympics, Jenkins declined to compete at the [[1960 World Figure Skating Championships]].  Instead, he turned professional, taking a leave of absence from his studies at Case Western Reserve Medical School to appear in [[Ice Follies]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;News About Skaters&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, November 1960&lt;/ref&gt;
