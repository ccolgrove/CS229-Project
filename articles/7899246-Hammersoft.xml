==Creation and inception==
[[Image:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Matt Stone (right) and Trey Parker (left) created the show and currently voice the majority of the male characters on the show.]]

Creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] met during a film class as students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], and in 1992, they came with an idea for a show that would eventually become ''South Park''. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended a talking stool (feces) named [[List of other South Park residents#Mr. Hankey|Mr. Hankey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HankeyCommentary&quot;/&gt; Instead, Parker and Stone created two Christmas-related animated shorts films called ''[[Jesus vs. Frosty]]'' and ''[[Jesus vs. Santa]]'', which served as precursors to the ''South Park'' series. The low-budget, crudely made ''Jesus vs. Frosty'' film featured [[prototype]]s of the main characters of ''South Park'', including characters resembling [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]. [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] executive [[Brian Graden]] saw the film and in 1995 commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film that he could send to his friends as a video [[Christmas card]]. Titled ''Jesus vs. Santa'', it resembled the style of the later series more closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Littlefield |first=Kinney |title=Comedy Central scores with poop and circumstance;Television: Trey Parker and Matt Stone subvert prime-time comedy with the animated satire &quot;South Park&quot; |work=[[The Orange County Register]]|location=[[Santa Ana, California]] |date=1998-01-28 |page=F04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video was popular and was widely shared, and when it began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived the idea of a ''South Park''-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it ''The Mr. Hankey Show''. Eventually, Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but as a minor supporting role in a future episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Commentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: &quot;Weight Gain 4000&quot;|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when [[Comedy Central]] expressed interest in the series, and picked up the show. The first episode of the series, &quot;[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]&quot;, debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, as Mr. Hankey would debut in the tenth episode, &quot;[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HankeyCommentary&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: &quot;Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo&quot;|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DMN0201&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Vognar |first=Chris |title=Brats entertainment; &quot;South Park&quot; creators potty hardy on Comedy Central show |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=1998-02-01 |location=[[Pasadena, California]] |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In tradition with the show's [[Cutout animation|animation style]], the characters are composed of simple geometrical shapes and uninflected patches of predominantly [[primary color]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Matt Cheplic | title = 'As Crappy As Possible': The Method Behind the Madness of South Park | publisher = [[Penton Media]] | date = 1998-05-01 | url = http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_crappy_possible_method/ | accessdate = 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avr&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Abbie Bernstein| title = South Park - Volume 2 | publisher = AVRev.com| date = 1998-10-27| url =http://www.avrev.com/dvd-movie-disc-reviews/tv-shows/south-park-volume-2.html| accessdate = 2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters, as they are mostly shown from only one angle, and their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avr&quot;/&gt; Ever since the show's second episode, &quot;[[Weight Gain 4000]]&quot;, all the characters on the show have been animated with computer software, though they are portrayed to give the impression that the show still utilizes the original technique of cutout animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;/&gt;
