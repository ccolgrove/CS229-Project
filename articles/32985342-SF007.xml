'''Hiren's BootCD'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softdistrict.com/new-hirens-boot-cd-download-available/|title=New Hirenâs Boot CD Download Available!|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alternativeto.net/software/hiren39s-bootcd/about|title=Hiren's BootCD for Windows, Linux - AlternativeTo.net|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hiren|title=Hiren's BootCD|url=http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd|work=Hiren &amp; Pankaj's Homepage|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as HBCD) is a [[Bootable CD|bootable software CD]] containing a number of diagnostic programs such as partitioning agents, system performance benchmarks, disk cloning and imaging tools, data recovery tools, MBR tools, BIOS tools, and many others for fixing various computer problems. By many people, HBCD is considered an invaluable tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirenâs Boot CD: Never Leave Home Without It!|url=http://www.windowsdailynews.com/2011/05/20/hirens-boot-cd-never-leave-home-without-it/}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use in troubleshooting and recovery of computers, however due to a questionable past, it has received little press. 

As it is bootable, the [[operating system]] of the computer need not be available for the tools to be usable. All that is required is that the computer is able to run [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]] (but it does not have to have either of these installed at the time of use.) Some of the tools are also available when the operating system is already started. 

==Distribution==
Hiren's BootCD is available as an [[ISO image]] [[ZIP (file format)|zipped]] together with other [[information]] such as its [[changelog]]. The image file can be [[Optical disc authoring|burned]] to a [[Compact Disc|CD]] or on to a [[USB flash drive]] for use on computers that support booting from USB.

==History==
Hiren's BootCD was created by &quot;Hiren&quot; &amp; &quot;Pankaj&quot; and is based on [[Knoppix]] (a bootable Linux operating system) and a collection of other freeware tools. It has found some controversial stigma as a &quot;hacker&quot; tool violating copyright. However, today the majority of its software is freeware or shareware.

===Licensing issues===
Prior to version 11.0, Hiren's BootCD contained a significant number of [[Commercial Software|commercial products]]. In version 10.6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Version 10.6 Release Notes|url=http://www.hirensbootcd.org/hbcd-v106/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, no less than 17 were listed in the release notes. Most notably [[Acronis True Image]], [[Norton Ghost]], [[Acronis|Acronis Disk Director]], and [[Paragon Software Group|Paragon Partition Manager]]. ([[Partition Magic|Partition Magic Pro]] had been replaced already in version 10.5.) To be able to start a commercial application, the user had to promise to be the holder of a license, but no validation of this statement was ever made.

In version 11.0 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Version 11.0 Release Notes|url=http://www.hirensbootcd.org/hbcd-v110/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, only three remained:
# Mini Windows 98
# Mini Windows XP
# A collection of MS DOS utilites
The assumption was most likely that anyone using the tools would have a license for these products. Whether or not that would stand up in court is another matter. In later revisions, Mini Windows 98 was removed, leaving only two commercial products on the CD.

As a response to this, so called &quot;restored editions&quot; of the HBCD have begun to appear soon after the official releases. In addition to the officially released software, these also contain the commercial products present before version 11.0.
