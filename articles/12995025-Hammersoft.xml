==Marcus Aurelius==

Brown's [[Marcus Aurelius]] statue is the most memorable piece of artwork on the entire campus. It stands atop of the hill on [[Lincoln Field]], at the rear of [[Sayles Hall]], facing [[Thayer Street]] through the [[Soldiers Memorial Gate]]. The statue was unveiled on June 1, 1908 by [[Robert Hale Ives Goddard]] on behalf of his deceased brother [[Moses Brown Ives Goddard]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=M0110 From Martha Mitchellâs ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'': Marcus Aurelius]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bronze]] statue is a copy of the famous [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|Equestrian Statue]] located on [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]]. The northern pedestal's face is inscribed with &quot;The Gift of Moses Brown Ives Goddard to Brown University MCMVII&quot;.

==Caesar Augustus==

The [[Caesar Augustus]] statue stands in front of the [[Sharpe Refectory]] in Hughes Court. It was a gift to the university by Moses Brown Ives Goddard in 1906. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=C0030 From Martha Mitchellâs ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'': Caesar Augustus]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an exact [[bronze]] copy of the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican Museum's]] classic [[Augustus of Prima Porta]] statue. The statue's arm broke off due to a [[hurricane]] that struck [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] in [[1938]]. It was originally located in front of [[Rhode Island Hall]] on the main College Green, until it was moved to its current location in 1952.

The pedestal reads &quot;The Gift of Moses Brown Ives Goddard to Brown University&quot;.

==Brown Bear==

The 7 foot [[bronze]] '''Brown Bear''' statue stands at a prominent location above the entrance into the College Green from [[Faunce House]]. It was gifted to the university in 1923, paid for by $10,000 of donations from Brown alumni. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0130 From Martha Mitchellâs ''Encyclopedia Brunoniana'': Bear]&lt;/ref&gt; It was sculpted and cast by New York City animal sculptor Eli Harvey. The statue was originally located at [[Marvel Gymnasium]], but was moved to the main College Green when the gym was shutdown in [[1989]].

The front side of the pedestal reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Given By Alumni And Undergraduates&lt;BR/&gt;
To Brown University&lt;BR/&gt;
To Symbolize Those Qualities Of&lt;BR/&gt;
Strength Courage Endurance&lt;BR/&gt;
Which Go Far To Make Men Invincible&lt;BR/&gt;
MCMXXVIII
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bear stands on a pedestal containing a piece of [[slate]] rock stepped upon by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] in 1636 when claiming the land that would become the city of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. On the back of the statue, below the slate, the pedestal is inscribed with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is a piece of the slate rock&lt;BR/&gt;
on which Roger Williams Landed&lt;BR/&gt;
when he came here in 1636&lt;BR/&gt;
to hold forth his lively experiment&lt;BR/&gt;
of independence with strength &amp; courage.&lt;BR/&gt;
May his spirit live in Brown men.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Little Bear Fountain==

Slightly out of the way from the main campus, the '''Little Bear Fountain''' currently resides next to Brown's [[Faculty Club]]. The fountain was a gift from Theodore Francis Green, who had promoted the bear as Brownâs mascot; it is a [[bronze]] replica of one which Green found presiding over a fountain in [[Breslau]], [[Poland]]. Over the years, the statue was painted with [[lacquer]], masking much of the artistic detail of the bear. It was recently restored to its original condition. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newmansltd.com/restoration/projects/brownLittleBear/ &quot;Little Bear&quot; Fountain Restoration Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The water features of the statue, however, are disabled.
