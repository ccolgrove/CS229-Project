'''Redondo Beach''' is one of the three [[Beach Cities]] located in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 66,748 at the 2010 census, up from 63,261 at the 2000 census. The city is located in the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] region of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|greater Los Angeles area]].

Redondo Beach was originally part of the 1785 [[Rancho San Pedro]] [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant that later became the South Redondo area.  The city's territory has an unusual shape including an area along the beach (South Redondo Beach) and another strip inland from Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach (North Redondo Beach). The primary attractions include [[Redondo Beach pier|Municipal Pier]] and the sandy beach, popular with tourists and a variety of sports enthusiasts. The [[Redondo Beach (Los Angeles Metro station)|western terminus]] of the [[LACMTA Green Line|Metro Rail Green Line]] is in North Redondo Beach.

==Lifestyle==
[[File:RedondoBeach-1890a.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Redondo Beach, 1890]]
Redondo Beach is the focus of many who want to be in the sun and near the ocean. Although a vibrant community in its own right, much of the Redondo Beach lifestyle is a blend of the neighborhoods, activities and people of the three [[Beach Cities]] of [[Southern California]]'s [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]]. Like its sister cities of [[Hermosa Beach, California|Hermosa Beach]] and [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], Redondo's key lifestyle draw is the vast beach that links these three cities. 

===Beach lifestyle===
[[File:RedondoBeach-1906.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Redondo Beach, 1906]]
A wide sand beach starts below the bluffs of [[Palos Verdes]] in the south (after [[Torrance, California|Torrance]] Beach) and carries north to the [[Redondo Beach pier|Redondo Pier]]. A paved path, called [[The Strand (bicycle path)|The Strand]] runs from Torrance through South Redondo, north to [[Santa Monica]]. A typical day on this path will see thousands of people on foot, bicycle, skateboard, roller-blade, wheelchair and stroller enjoying the sun and surf. The continuous path is broken only by the massive Redondo Beach King Harbor Marina and Pier complex, where it veers away from water and onto dedicated lanes of surface streets for about a mile before again turning to the ocean in Hermosa Beach. Continuing north from Manhattan Beach, this path stretches well into Marina Del Rey and beyond with few breaks.

[[Surfing]] is a key element of the South Bay lifestyle year-round; it is common to see locals catching waves on both Christmas and New Year's Day. Powerful winter storms in the Pacific ocean can turn typically placid and rolling South Bay waves into large and occasionally dangerous monsters, a natural draw for the local surfing population. Local wave heights in December 2005 were some of the largest on record and were reported to top {{convert|15|ft|m}} to {{convert|20|ft|m}} in some instances; at least one surfer required resuscitation when he was thrashed against the ocean bottom after trying a particularly large wave.

[[Beach Volleyball]] is another important aspect of Redondo Beach's lifestyle. The wide and flat sand beaches provide the perfect venue for the sport and permanent poles and nets are placed and maintained by the city year-round. Professional tournaments managed by the [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]] take place in neighboring Hermosa and Manhattan Beach. Redondo Beach is home to Gold Medalist [[Kerri Walsh]] and AVP Pro [[Casey Jennings]].

The [[Redondo Recreation Indoor Men's Volleyball League]] at Aviation Gym on Wednesday nights is one of the premier indoor recreational volleyball leagues in [[Southern California]] where one could play high level volleyball.  Former college and professional volleyball athletes participate in this league year round in about four seasons per year.

Currently Redondo Beach is growing in popularity to filming production.  In 2006 &quot;[[Medium Productions|Medium]]&quot; crews were seen shooting at a local coffee shop.  Fox's ''[[The O.C.]]'' has also been seen filming at [[Redondo Union High School]], Redondo Beach Pier, and local parks.

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:South Bay Galleria.JPG|thumb|right|150px|thumb|South Bay Galleria, a shopping mall on the border of Lawndale]]
[[File:RedondoBeachNorthSouthBorders.gif|right|150px|thumb|Redondo Beach's borders]]

Redondo Beach is often divided into two logical North/South areas with 190th, Anita, and Herondo streets forming its east-west boundary line. South Redondo plays host to the [[Redondo Beach pier|pier]] and marina/harbor complex and directly borders active Hermosa Beach; life on the ocean side of [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]] (PCH) can be frenetic with restaurants and boating activities keeping people active and engaged at all times. Inland of PCH is largely residential.

Bordering North/South Redondo at the Marina is a massive power plant, which has been the source of substantial political debate in the city over the last decade, largely centered over what to do with the land once the plant becomes inactive over the next 25 years (subject to change and compromise). This power plant sports a {{convert|586|ft|m|abbr=on}} Ã {{convert|95|ft|m|abbr=on}} whale mural by world-famous artist [[Wyland]] titled &quot;Gray Whale Migration&quot;.

The small business district near the pier and marina was revived in the 1990s by beachgoers and new residents wanted to sell beachwear and surfing accessories. That district was once focused on fishing and canning when the pier was used to transport fish-based foodstuffs and canned fish to American and Asian consumers, but that industry had an economic downfall in the 1970s and 1980s.

South Redondo is a bit more on the gentrified, quiet side. Its wide streets, wide sand beaches and laid-back feel make it a prime destination for those seeking a &quot;bike to the grocery store&quot; community. Several close-knit neighborhoods exist; South Broadway hosts street parties in the summer where children play on jumping gyms and the local Fire Department judges the best dessert contest while kids climb their pumper truck.

North Redondo begins north of 190th Street.  As a result of Redondo Beach's geography, North Redondo is primarily an inland experience as the beachfronts form most of Hermosa Beach and part of Manhattan Beach. While primarily residential, North Redondo contains some of the city's major industry and commercial space, including the inland aerospace and engineering firms that are part of Southern California's long space legacy.  It is also home to the South Bay Galleria Shopping Center and a revitalized Artesia Boulevard.  North Redondo is the home of the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center, one of the South Bay's premier cultural facilities, and home to the Civic Light Opera of the South Bay Cities. North Redondo is home to nearly two-thirds of the children in Redondo Beach.
Many original homes still stand in Redondo Beach neighborhoods, but these small Arts and Crafts style homes are quickly being bought, demolished and rebuilt to match the tastes of the modern, more affluent buyer that makes South Bay their home. Zoning allows properties within two to three blocks of the beach to be developed as large two to three-unit luxury townhomes; inland areas are more likely to have single-family homes. There is a citywide height limit of {{convert|32|ft|m|abbr=on}} for new homes; unlike Manhattan Beach, Redondo allows rooftop living spaces and decks.

Redondo Breakwall is a well known surf spot in the south bay.

===Other activities===

A revitalized downtown area affectionately termed &quot;Riviera Village&quot; (named so after the Hollywood Riviera, which is the area it is in) provides locals an opportunity to eat, shop and commune in a quiet atmosphere. Since 2004 several new or newly renovated restaurants have made a positive impact on local options for an on-the-town experience. Downtown also supports a number of independent boutiques and shops specializing in clothing and fashion, as well as at least three wine-tasting galleries. This downtown area is in South Redondo west of PCH between Avenue I and Palos Verdes Blvd.

The Marina, Harbor and [[Redondo Beach pier|Pier]] complexes are large, planned centers of activity that host Korean seafood restaurants, touristy bars, smaller shops and a games arcade. The pier is a common spot for anglers to cast for a local catch; many residents of inland Los Angeles drive to Redondo Beach to take advantage of the long and unique shape of this pier. The adjacent Marina, located just north of the Pier, is home to another half-dozen restaurants, a seafood shop, and a pub with almost 100 beers on tap. The large, monolithic concrete structures that make up the pier and harbor area stand in stark contrast to the venerable cozy feel of the rest of the South Bay's neighborhood-style street front architecture; the city continues to consider options for the area as new entertainment and dining chooses to locate in other areas of the Beach Cities.

===Cost of living===
The beach lifestyle comes at a price: According to public data from the [[Los Angeles Times]], real estate prices increased almost 20% per year between 1999 and 2005. Properties within short walking distance of the ocean routinely sell for well over $1 million. Those with direct, unhindered views routinely ask in excess of $2 million. ''[[Money Magazine]]'' ranks communities in the area as some of the most expensive places to live in the U.S.  The average three-bed, two-bath home costs about $1,000,000 in South Redondo as of 2006 and  $875,000 in North Redondo. The 2007 &quot;credit meltdown&quot; has affected home values in the area to a lesser extent than the rest of [[Southern California]].

Before the beach city housing boom in the 1990s, Redondo Beach's population mirrored much of older communities around Los Angeles. Redondo Beach had generally large numbers of [[Asian Americans]] and [[Pacific Islanders]] (esp. [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] and [[Samoans]]) for cities with an excess of 50,000 residents. The city has a sizable [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community, due to the fact that numerous participants in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]' relocation programs chose the South Bay area of Los Angeles. Nearby is the [[El Nido, Los Angeles County, California|El Nido]] section, briefly was a [[Chicano]] area before the 1970s. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In the early 1900s, the developing community attracted immigrants, often fishermen and maritime workers of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent, whom used to have neighborhoods on the city's southern end known as &quot;Clifton&quot; (the county area was incorporated into Redondo Beach in 1976). The community also had its share of Asian American and [[Latino]] (Mexican or other [[Latin American]]) residents. [[African Americans]] encountered few problems on moving into the mixed-race community, especially after the 1950s.
