'''Zinf''' is a [[free software|free]] [[audio player (software)|audio player]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It runs on [[Unix-like]] operating systems and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Zinf is a continuation of the [[FreeAmp]] project and uses the same source code.&lt;ref name=&quot;v3&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.v3.co.uk/vnunet/downloads/2128655/zinf | title= Zinf 2.2.1: A free audio player with streaming audio support | publisher=''v3.co.uk'' | author= Paul Rowlingson | date= January 19, 2004 | accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;afterdawn&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/3086.cfm | title= No more FreeAmp - Meet the Zinf | publisher=''Afterdawn'' | author= Lasse Penttinen | date= July 1, 2002 | accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical features==
Zinf can play sound files in [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]], and [[WAV]] formats, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;thefrench&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://telechargement.zebulon.fr/zinf-audio-player.html | title= Zinf Audio Player 2.2.1 | publisher=''Zebulon.fr'' (French) | date= July 29, 2004 | accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports [[Skin (computing)|skins]] and is part of the [[MusicBrainz]] [[computer network|network]]. The player features an optimized version of the Xing [[MPEG]] decoder, a powerful music browser and playlist editor, and a built in [[download]] manager which supports downloading files from sites using the RMP ([[RealJukebox]]) download process.  Zinf was also notable for handling all audio files based on their [[metadata]] (Author, Album, Song Title), and hiding more-technical details like actual locations and file names&lt;ref name=&quot;tonspion&quot;/&gt; (but these features are now standard in many players).

==Naming==
'''Zinf''' is a [[recursive acronym]] that stands for &quot;Zinf Is Not FreeAmp!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tonspion&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tonspion.de/neues/mp3.php/243807 | title= Winamp-Alternativen: Zinf | publisher=''[[Tonspion]]'' (German) | date= October 16, 2003 | accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the name '''FreeAmp''' had to be discontinued due to [[trademark]] issues, as &quot;AMP&quot; is a trademark of PlayMedia Systems, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.audio.freeamp.devel/6 FreeAmp becomes Zinf!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Computerra&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.computerra.ru/softerra/technologizm/24396/| title= ÐÑÐ´Ð¸Ð¾Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð¸Ð³ÑÑÐ²Ð°ÑÐµÐ»Ñ ZINF | publisher=''[[Computerra]]'' (Russian) | author= Sergei Yaremchuk | date= February 27, 2003 | accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History/Funding==
The FreeAmp project was originally funded by [[EMusic]], who paid the salaries of 3 developers working on the player.  Later, [[Relatable]] joined EMusic to help support continued development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamingmedia.com/article.asp?id=6341 EMusic and Relatable Team to Offer Open Source Audio]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, after 2 years of funding the project EMusic pulled their support, and subsequently fired the developers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.musicbrainz.org/pipermail/musicbrainz-users/2001-January/000139.html Important project update]&lt;/ref&gt; The Zinf project was unable to find another sponsor, and development slowed greatly.  The most recent release was made in early 2004.  As of 2008, nearly all development of Zinf has ceased.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Adoption==
Once a popular open-source Linux audio player, it has now been largely surpassed by newcomers such as [[Audacious Media Player|Audacious]], [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]], [[Exaile]], [[Banshee (music player)|Banshee]] and (more recently) [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]]. This is largely because Zinf has not seen an official new release since early 2004, and many new features that are now standard in rival players have not been implemented; such as cover art and lyric support.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}   

It is also worth noting that sometime in 2010 the zinf.com website was bought by a domain squatter for the purpose of capitalizing on the site's traffic for monetary gains.  A new link called &quot;QnA&quot; and &quot;Ads&quot; are now visible on the zinf.com website that is nothing more than a redirect to the squatter's money generation site.  The binaries for the player are now a likely source of spyware/adware although at the time of this writing that has not happened.  But history has shown that these types of buyouts always end in the binary of an application being modified for the worse rather than the better.   This was a part of the XMMS.org takeover which is described here: http://tobias.hieta.se/2010/04/28/what-ever-happened-to-xmms-org
