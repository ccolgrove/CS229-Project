'''TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec''' is a [[French language]] [[public television|public]] [[education]]al [[television network]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Quebec]]. Known legally as ''' SociÃ©tÃ© de tÃ©lÃ©diffusion du QuÃ©bec''' ''(Quebec Television Broadcasting Corporation)'', it is a provincial [[crown corporation]] owned by the Government of Quebec. The network's main studios and general offices are located in [[Montreal]], at the corner of [[Saint Catherine Street|Saint Catherine]] and Fullum Streets in [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]].

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec is equivalent to [[Ontario]]'s [[TVOntario]] and [[TFO]], [[British Columbia]]'s [[Knowledge (TV channel)|Knowledge]] and [[Saskatchewan]]'s [[Saskatchewan Communications Network|SCN]], and similar to the US [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] network, in that it is somewhat modest in scope, runs mostly educational or cultural programming, and does not try to compete with privately owned television networks or with the [[TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]] television network owned and operated by the [[government of Canada|federal government]]. The network also runs commercials during its programming, not unlike its federal counterparts Radio-Canada and [[CBC Television]]. The latter, by contrast, does strongly compete with private networks and overlaps with their programming categories.

All programming on TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec is in [[French language|French]], though there are a few shows and movies that are presented in the original language (predominantly English), with French subtitles.

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec operates local offices in [[Val-d'Or]], [[Trois-RiviÃ¨res]], [[Rimouski]], [[Gatineau]], [[Sept-Ãles, Quebec|Sept-Ãles]], [[Quebec City]], [[Sherbrooke]], [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] and [[Carleton-sur-Mer, Quebec|Carleton]].

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec is one of the partners in the [[TV5 QuÃ©bec Canada]] and [[TV5MONDE]] consortiums. They also had a 25% stake in the French-Canadian arts specialty channel, [[ARTV]], which they sold to the CBC in 2010.

==History==
[[Image:Radio-Quebec.png|right|150px|thumb|Logo while under the name '''Radio QuÃ©bec''']]
The genesis of TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec was created on April 20, 1945, when the [[Legislative Assembly of Quebec]], under the mandate of Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], passed a law allowing Quebec to create and run a public broadcasting network, as a provincial counterpart to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].

A public broadcasting scheme in Quebec was formerly established on February 22, 1968, when the [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.]] administration created a new public broadcasting agency, &quot;Radio-QuÃ©bec&quot;, under the auspices of the [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Ministry of Education]]. Shortly afterward, the first Radio-QuÃ©bec program, a radio program on the history of Canada called ''En montant la riviÃ¨re'', was produced. Produced later that year was its first television program, ''[[Les Oraliens]]'', where space aliens taught kids how to properly pronounce French words and phrases.

In 1969, a new law was passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]], creating ''lâOffice de radio-tÃ©lÃ©diffusion du QuÃ©bec'' (&quot;Quebec Office of Radio and Television Broadcasting&quot;), where Radio-QuÃ©bec was placed.

Radio-QuÃ©bec began broadcasting on its own in 1972 as a cable channel, which broadcasted evenings on [[Community channel (Canada)|community channels]] in MontrÃ©al and Quebec City, then expanded in 1973 to Hull, Gatineau and Sherbrooke. As a cable network, Radio-QuÃ©bec was generally on the air weeknights from 8PM to 10PM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php?topic=161389.0 Radio-Info: &quot;Retro: Southern Quebec Fri, Jan 24, 1975&quot;, January 26, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; The network of over-the-air transmitters was launched on January 19, 1975 with the sign-ons of '''CIVM-TV''' in Montreal and '''CIVQ-TV''' in Quebec City, making its programming available to an even wider audience. In its early days after the terrestrial network began, Radio-QuÃ©bec would provide week-delay videotapes of its programming line-up to cable systems in communities not served by a Radio-QuÃ©bec station. Some Radio-QuÃ©bec programs were also seen on most Radio-Canada stations, not only in Quebec, but throughout Canada as well; this arrangement continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php/topic,156292.0.html Western British Columbia ''TV Guide'' listings at Radio-Info.com: &quot;Retro: Vancouver/Victoria/Seattle Wed, Nov 9, 1977&quot;, November 6, 2009]; listings for CBUFT included ''Les Oraliens'' and ''[[Les 100 tours de Centour]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Radio-QuÃ©bec opened its third station, '''CIVO-TV''' in [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], serving the greater [[Ottawa]] areaâthe station was built after acquiring the license and facilities of a failed [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] affiliate, [[CFVO-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.php?url=http%3A//www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/television/histories.php%3Fid%3D180%26historyID%3D195 Canadian Communications Foundation: CFVO-TV]. Note: This article contradicts with the [http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.php?url=http%3A//www.broadcasting-history.ca/listings_and_histories/television/histories.php%3Fid%3D107%26historyID%3D125 CCF's page for TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec], which states that the closedown of CFVO-TV and its conversion to CIVO-TV happened in 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio-QuÃ©bec was off the air during most of 1978, due to a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] of its employees in a labour dispute.

In 1979, Radio-QuÃ©bec's agency was restructured as a provincial crown corporation, ''SociÃ©tÃ© de radio-tÃ©lÃ©vision du QuÃ©bec'' (&quot;Quebec Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation&quot;). The network had also adopted the slogan, ''L'autre tÃ©lÃ©vision'' (&quot;The other television&quot;).

On January 1, 1985, Radio-QuÃ©bec began providing its programming to its stations and cable systems via satellite, using [[Anik (satellite)|Anik C-3]]. Also that year, the CRTC granted Radio-QuÃ©bec permission to show commercials during some of its programming, initially for a two-year trial run. This authorisation would eventually become permanentâby the 2002-2003 fiscal year, TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec's revenues from advertising would account for 45.8% of its total revenue.

In 1994, the Quebec government announced budget cuts for Radio-QuÃ©bec, in which its budget was reduced by $10 million. In 1995, Radio-QuÃ©bec president Jean Fortier announced that the network was virtually bankrupt. As a result, over 150 staffers were laid off (out of over 750 people employed), with plans for further layoffs to trim the employee count to 300 staffers. Programming produced in-house would either be cancelled or transferred to independent companies. In addition, the network would adopt the current &quot;TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec&quot; name the following year, in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-0-72-1968-12712-11/index_souvenirs/arts_culture/radio_quebec_uhf Radio-QuÃ©bec diffusÃ©e sur UHF - Souvenirs - Les Archives de Radio-Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with the crown corporation renamed as &quot;SociÃ©tÃ© de tÃ©lÃ©diffusion du QuÃ©bec&quot;. Plans for the new TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec to carry strictly educational programming was also called for, but was never carried out, opting to retain its mixed educational-entertainment schedule.

The monetary shortfall would be short-lived, as, by 1997, TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec would eventually resume productions on its own and increase its amount of original programming.

==Programming==

Over 40% of TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©becâs programming is children's programming. In 2005, ''Ramdam'' was a popular show for 2 to 11 year-olds. Other children's shows have included ''Cornemuse'', ''[[Zoboomafoo]]'', and [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Dora the Explorer|Dora l'exploratrice]]'' and ''[[Bob the Builder|Bob le bricoleur]]''. Animated shows include ''IDragon'', ''[[Les MÃ©lodilous]]'', ''Le Petit tracteur rouge'', and ''Toupie et Binou''. For 6 to 8 year-olds, shows have included ''Macaroni tout garni'', Nickelodeon's ''[[Rocket Power]]'', ''Esprits-fantÃ´mes'', and ''Le Petit roi Macius''. ''Ramdam'' and ''BanzaÃ¯'' are both aimed at pre-teens (9 to 12), and ''ADN-X'' is a teens show that provides practical solutions to everyday problems.

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec's cultural programming reflects Quebec's diverse cultural expression in fiction, songs, music, cinema, visual art, and drama. TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec shows such as ''Belle et Bum'', ''Mâas-tu lu?'' and ''Pulsart'' help to promote Quebec artists and creators and their works. ''Belle et Bum'' is a music show that invited 160 performers or groups in 2005â2006, who performed 230 songs by Quebec songwriters or composers. ''M'as-tu lu?'' is a book show that covers books of all genres and for all audiences; in 2005â2006, 260 books were presented, 124 of which were by Quebec authors. ''Pulsart'' is a magazine show on cultural activities taking place all over Quebec.

A new weekly cultural magazine-style show,'' Libre Ã©change'', deals with a ranges of different creative arts, including dance, cinema, literature, sculpture, painting, television, music, and theatre. As well, a new series of &quot;living portraits&quot; will profile notable living creators such as authors, filmmakers, architects and thinkers.

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec presents a range of films, including &quot;[[auteur theory|auteur]]&quot; films by notable [[Film director|director]]s, feature-film length [[documentary film|documentaries]], [[premiere|premiere showings]], and [[Cinema of Quebec|Quebec films]]. All films are shown without commercial interruptions. During the last five years, TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec showed over 959 hours of documentaries, which made up 18% of its programming. Documentary topics included socio-political, cultural, historic, scientific, and travel. Between 2000 and 2006, 137 documentaries and 39 series were produced.

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec also hosts debate and discussion-oriented shows that allow for an exchange of ideas and perspectives on social and political issues. ''Points chauds'' is a show on international political issues. ''MÃ©chant contraste!'' is a pan-Quebec magazine show on social, political, and economic issues. ''Dussault-DÃ©bat'' is a debate show.

As a community service, TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec has a number of shows that present a regional perspective, such as ''MÃ©chant contraste!'', ''Ã la di Stasio'', ''les Francs Tireurs'', ''M'as-tu lu?'', ''Une pilule'', and ''Pulsart''. TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec also has an Internet strategy, as part of its educational and cultural mission. In 2003, the extremis.tv website won a GÃ©meaux prize for the best Internet site. In 2004, du missionarctique.tv won the same award. The website for the teen-oriented show ''ADN-X'' has interactive activities including a comic strip-creating activity.

===Programming in English===
The only TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec program that was entirely in English was ''Quebec School Telecasts'', a weekday, hour-long block of English-language instructional programming. The series was first telecasted on [[CBC Television]] outlets in Quebec in the early-1960s. Radio-QuÃ©bec picked up the program in 1981; it was telecasted on Radio-QuÃ©bec and the later TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec until the early-2000s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In 1985, Radio-QuÃ©bec and [[TVOntario]] signed an exchange arrangement, in which English-language TVO programming would be seen on Radio-QuÃ©bec, and Radio-QuÃ©bec's French-language programming would be seen on TVOâit is unknown if either network actually carried the other network's programming.

==TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec HD and digital conversion==
[[Image:Tele Quebec HD.png|right|175px|thumb|TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec HD logo]]
On June 12, 2008, TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec launched an HD simulcast of its MontrÃ©al station CIVM-TV called '''TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec HD'''. It signed on over the air on channel 27 ([[Virtual channel|PSIP]] 17.1) from [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in Montreal in January [[2009 in Canadian television|2009]], making CIVM-DT the first educational television station in [[Canada]] to broadcast digitally. After the [[DTV in Canada|analogue shutdown and digital conversion]] in [[Canada]], scheduled for August 31, 2011, CIVM-DT will move to channel 26.

A digital terrestrial television transmitter requested and authorized for construction in Quebec City for CIVQ-TV did not sign on until August 2010,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} weeks before the September 25, 2010 deadline to sign on or file an extension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/db2008-268.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-268, 25 September 2008, SociÃ©tÃ© de tÃ©lÃ©diffusion du QuÃ©bec, CIVM-DT MontrÃ©al - New transmitter in QuÃ©bec]&lt;/ref&gt; That transmitter broadcasts from [[Edifice Marie-Guyart]] in downtown Quebec City on channel 25 ([[Virtual channel|PSIP]] 15.1). After the digital conversion in 2011, CIVQ moved its digital signal to channel 15.

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec intended on converting all of its transmitters to digital by the digital transition deadline of August 31, 2011, including its transmitters that are not required to transition by this deadline.

It can also be seen nationwide on [[Bell TV]] Channel 138 and [[Shaw Direct]] Channel 722. On terrestrial cable, however, it is generally seen only in Quebec and in communities in Ontario and New Brunswick which are within the broadcast range of a TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec transmitter. Outside of this area, few cable systems, such as [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS]] in [[Winnipeg]], carry TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec in their digital tiers.

TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec (and its predecessor, Radio-QuÃ©bec) was also assigned channel 2 in [[RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup]], channel 10 in Lithium Mines and channel 21 in [[Mont-Laurier, Quebec|Mont-Laurier]]. As of 2009, service has yet to begin in these communities; in addition, it had later lost its channel 2 slot at RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup, after that channel was reallocated to Quebec City ([[CFAP-DT|CFAP-TV]]) and Rimouski ([[CJBR-DT|CJBR-TV]]).
