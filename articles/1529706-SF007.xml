}}'''Microsoft GIF Animator''' is a historical computer software program for [[Microsoft Windows]] to create simple animated [[GIF]] files based on the GIF89a file format. It was freely downloadable from the Microsoft Download Center but is now only available through [[MSDN]] and on third party download sites. It was also bundled with Microsoft Image Composer and [[Microsoft FrontPage]].

Animations can be looped, spun, and faded in and out; users can set the size and transparency of images. Automatic and custom palette creation are supported.
