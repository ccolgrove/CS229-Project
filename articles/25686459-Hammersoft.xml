'''Elegant Glass''' is high quality glassware created in the United States during the Depression Era. It was sold for high prices in department stores and given as wedding gifts&lt;ref name=&quot;dep-v-eleg&quot;&gt;&quot;Elegant Glass is Not Depression Glass | Just Glass Online.&quot; Designer Glassware, Vintage Art Glass, Depression Glass &amp; Collectible Glass | Just Glass Online. Stephen Thornton Internet Consulting Services. Web. 8 January 2010. &lt;http://www.justglass-online.com/collectibles/elegant-glass-is-not-depression-glass.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. When new, Elegant Glass would cost more than its oft-confused counterpart, [[Depression glass]], because it was at least partially handmade, had a cleaner finish, and more vibrant colors. From the 1920s through the 1950s, Elegant Glass was an alternative to fine china. Most of the Elegant Glassware manufacturers closed by the end of the 1950s, and cheap glassware and imported china took its place.

==Manufacturing process==
Elegant Glass was at least partially hand made during production&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Depression Glass, Elegant Glass and Depression Glass Manufacturers | Just Glass Online.&quot; Designer Glassware, Vintage Art Glass, Depression Glass &amp; Collectible Glass | Just Glass Online. Stephen Thornton Internet Consulting Services. Web. 7 January 2010. &lt;http://www.justglass-online.com/depression-glass/depression-glass-elegant-glass-and-depression-glass-manufacturers.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Elegant Glass manufacturers produced vibrant colors that varied far more than Depression Glass&lt;ref name=&quot;dep-v-eleg&quot;/&gt;.  Shades of red, blue, green, amber, yellow, smoke, amethyst, and pink were produced.  An easy way to compare the difference in color quality is to take a look at a piece of cobalt Elegant Glass and place is along side a piece of cobalt Depression Glass.  The intensity of the former piece is quite evident. Pressed Elegant Glass was fire polished to get rid of the flaws in the glass. The normal flaws found in pressed glass â straw marks, raised seams, etc. were removed. The base of bowls, platters, etc. was ground so it would sit evenly on a table. Many patterns of Elegant Glass were embellished with acid etching, cutting, enamel decoration, gold encrustation, platinum and gold trim&lt;ref name=&quot;dep-v-eleg&quot;/&gt;.

==Sale and marketing==
Elegant Glass was sold in the finer stores (never given away). It was also marketed as wedding patterns. It was offered as an alternative to china and crystal which were still imported due to manufacturing costs and were incredibly expensive. Many consumers purchased Elegant Glass and placed it on display, only using it for very special occasions&lt;ref name=&quot;dep-v-eleg&quot;/&gt;.

==Products==
Elegant glass patterns had a wide range of items available including:

===Tableware===
