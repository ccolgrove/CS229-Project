'''''Capra''''' is a [[genus]] of [[mammals]], the '''goats''' or '''wild goats''', composed of up to nine [[species]] including the [[wild goat]], the [[markhor]] and several species known as ''ibex''. 

The [[domestic goat]] (''Capra aegagrus hircus'') is a [[domesticated]] [[subspecies]] of the [[wild goat]] (''Capra aegagrus'').

Wild goats are animals of mountain habitats.  They are very agile and hardy, able to climb on bare rock and survive on sparse vegetation. They can be distinguished from the genus ''[[Ovis]]'', which includes sheep, by the presence of scent glands close to the feet, in the groin and in front of the eyes, and the absence of other facial glands, and by the presence of a beard in the males, and of hairless [[callus]]es on the knees of the forelegs.&lt;ref name=Parrini2009&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parrini, F.

The [[Mountain goat|Rocky Mountain goat]] is in a separate genus, ''[[Oreamnos]]'', and is not dealt with here.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Capra ibex ibex â 03.jpg|thumb|right|Male Nubian ibex]]
All members of the ''Capra'' genus are [[bovid]]s (members of the family [[Bovidae]]) and caprids (subfamily [[Caprinae]]). All these are [[ruminant]]s, meaning they chew the cud, and have a four-chambered stomach which plays a vital role in digesting, regurgitating and re-digesting their food.

The genus has sometimes been taken to include  ''[[Ovis]]'' (sheep) and ''Ammotragus'' ([[Barbary Sheep]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, W. F. H. 1972. Order Artiodactyla. Part 15. Pp. 1-84, in ''The mammals of Africa: An identification manual'' (J. Meester and H. W. Setzer, eds.) [issued 2 May 1972]. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C., not continuously paginated. (quoted in {{MSW3 Grubb|id=14200767}})&lt;/ref&gt; but these are usually regarded as distinct genera, leaving ''Capra'' for goats and ibexes.  In this smaller genus, some authors have recognized only two species, the [[Markhor]] on one side and all other forms included in one species on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Haltenorth, T. 1963.

''Handbuch der Zoologie'', '''8'''(32):1-167 (quoted in {{MSW3 Grubb|id=14200767}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today nine species are usually accepted&lt;ref&gt;Nathalie Pidancier, Steve Jordan, Gordon Luikart, Pierre Taberlet: Evolutionary history of the genus Capra (Mammalia, Artiodactyla): Discordance between mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome.

* '''[[Markhor]]''' (''Capra falconeri'')

The [[goats]] of the genus ''Capra'' have complex systematic relationships, which are still not completely resolved.  Recent studies based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] suggest that the Siberian ibex and the Nubian ibex represent distinct species, which are not very closely related to the physically similar Alpine ibex.  The Alpine ibex forms a group with the Spanish ibex. The West Caucasian tur appears to be more closely related to the wild goat than to the East Caucasian tur. The [[markhor]] is relatively little separated from other forms â previously it had been considered to be a separate branch of the genus.&lt;ref&gt;''Phylogenetic Reconstructions in the Genus Capra  (Bovidae, Artiodactyla) Based on the Mitochondrial DNA Analysis''.  Russian Journal of Genetics, 2007, Vol. 43, No. 2, pp. 181â189. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t66k1n07tqn8l564/ online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all wild goat species are [[allopatric]] (geographically separated) â the only geographical overlaps are the wild goat (''Capra aegagrus'') with the East Caucasian tur (''Capra cylindricornis''), and the markhor (''Capra falconeri'') with the Siberian ibex (''Capra siberica''). In both cases the overlapping species do not usually interbreed in the wild â however, in captivity all ''Capra'' species can interbreed, producing fertile offspring.&lt;ref&gt;V. G.

==Domestication and uses==
{{main|Domestic goat}}
[[Image:Goats as weed control.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Goats used for natural weed control]]
Along with [[sheep]], goats were among the first [[domesticated animals]]. The domestication process started at least 10,000 years (calibrated calendar years) ago in what is now northern [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Melinda A. Zeder, Brian Hesse: ''The Initial Domestication of Goats (''Capra hircus'') in the Zagros Mountains 10,000 Years Ago''. Science 24 March 2000:
Vol. 287. no. 5461, pp. 2254 - 2257 [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/5461/2254 online abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Easy human access to goat hair, [[meat]], and [[milk]] were the primary motivations. Goat skins were popularly used until the [[Middle Ages]] for water and [[wine bottles]] when traveling and [[camping]], and in certain regions as [[parchment]] for writing.

==In ancient history==

[[File:Cabra-Benaocaz-MINdsc04854.jpg|thumb|Capra in [[Andalusia]]]]

Evidence of the ibex is widely present in the [[archaeological]] record, particularly in the [[Near East]] and Mediterranean regions. Ibex motifs are very common on [[cylinder seal]]s and pottery, both painted and embossed.
Excavations from [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] at [[Knossos]], for example, have yielded specimens from about 1800 [[Before Christ|BC]], including one [[cylinder seal]] depicting an ibex defending itself from a [[hunting dog]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes ''Knossos fieldnotes'', Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; From the similar age a gold [[jewelry]] ibex image was found at the [[Akrotiri]] archaeological site&lt;ref&gt;M. Uda, G. Demortier, I. Nakai, ''X-rays for archaeology'', 2005, Springer, 308 pages
ISBN 1402035802&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Santorini]] in present day Greece.

An [[Iron Age]] ''Capra ibex'' specimen was recovered at the [[Aq Kupruk]] Archaeological site in present day [[Afghanistan]], illustrating either domestication or hunting of the ibex by these early peoples.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--Not so very early in this context: goats were domesticated long before the Iron Age.--&gt; However, archaeological records of ibex can be difficult to separate from those of domestic [[goats]].&lt;ref&gt;Pam J. Crabtree, Douglas V. Campana, Kathleen Ryan, ''Early Animal Domestication and Its Cultural Context'', 1989, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology ISBN 0924171960&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associations in history==
It has been proven, after much historical dispute, that rock carvings and the horns of ibex were once used as a charm to encourage childbearing or to give thanks for a child by those that were involved in the [[Buddhist|Buddhism]] religion around the periods of 1000 B.C. to 300 A.D. As commented on by historian and archaeologist, A. H. Francke: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our Christian evangelist at [[Khalatse]] had become a father a few weeks before, and the people of the village had made presents of &quot;flour-ibex&quot; to him and his wife. He gave me one of those figures, which are made of flour and butter, and told me that it was a custom in Tibet and Ladakh, to make presents of &quot;flour-ibex&quot; on the occasion of the birth of a child. This is quite interesting information. I had often wondered why there were so many rock carvings of ibex at places connected with the pre-Buddhist religion of Ladakh. Now it appears probable that they are thank offerings after the birth of children. As I have tried to show in my previous article, people used to go to the pre-Buddhist places of worship, in particular, to pray to be blessed with children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Francke, A. H. (1914). ''Antiquities of Indian Tibet''. Two Volumes. Calcutta. 1972 reprint: S. Chand, New Delhi. pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
