The '''[[1985 NFL season|1985]] [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] season''' was the team's 48th year with the [[National Football League]] and the 40th season in [[Los Angeles]]. The Rams played in the NFC Championship Game but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears. Eric Dickerson rushed for 1,234 yards in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] while missing the first two games while in a contract dispute. He missed the [[Pro Bowl]] for the first time in his short NFL career. He did, however, go on to rush for a playoff record 248 yards against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in post-season play.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Dickerson: Pro Football  Hall of Fame, http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?PLAYER_ID=55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular season==
The Los Angeles Rams got off to a surprisingly successful start in 1985, winning their first seven games.  However, the team struggled somewhat during the second half of the season.  After suffering humiliating losses to the 1-9 [[Atlanta Falcons]] and the 4-8 [[New Orleans Saints]], the Rams upset their main rival, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] on the road in a prime time Monday-Night match-up, despite being 10-point underdogs going into the game.  This crucial victory helped the Rams redeem their season and the team went on to clinch their first NFC West division title in six years, finishing the regular season with an 11-5 record.

Running back [[Eric Dickerson]] led the Rams to a victory by scoring two touchdowns and recording a playoff record 248 rushing yards. After the first half ended with a 3-0 Los Angeles lead, Dickerson scored on a 55-yard touchdown run early in the third period. On the ensuing kickoff, Kenny Duckett fumbled, and the ball was recovered by [[Vince Newsome]] to set up kicker [[Mike Lansford]]'s second field goal. In the fourth period, [[Tony Hunter (American football)|Tony Hunter]] recovered a fumbled punt to set up Dickerson's 40-yard rushing touchdown.  The Rams' defense dominated the Cowboys' offense all afternoon as the Cowboys never got inside the Rams' 20-yard-line.

The Bears defense dominated the game by limiting Rams running back [[Eric Dickerson]] to 46 yards rushing, and holding quarterback [[Dieter Brock]] to just 10 completions out of 31 pass attempts for 66 passing yards. Los Angeles only gained 130 yards of total offense. The Rams had a chance to get back in the game as they got inside the Bears' 15 yard line in the waning moments of the first half, but poor play calling and clock management, as well as a controversial call by the officials on the last play of the half, resulted in the clock running out.  Officials' ability to review plays (via instant replay) was not made available until the following season.
