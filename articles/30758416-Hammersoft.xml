The '''Italian regional elections of 1980''' were held on [[June 8]]. The fifteen ordinary regions, created in 1970, elected their '''third''' assemblies.

==Electoral system==
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system of [[Italy]], and it was adopted for the regional vote too. Each [[Italian province]] corresponded to a constituency electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Droop quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at regional level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

==Results==
Summary of the results of all the lists reaching at least a tenth of the suffrages.

The election confirmed that the post-war growing march of the [[Italian Communist Party]], which previously seemed unlimited, had been stopped. The Christian Democrats obtained a [[plurality]] in [[Piedmont]], even if the ruling [[left (politics)|leftist]] alliance maintained its overall [[majority]]. Conversely, even if remaining the first party in [[Liguria|Ligury]], the Communists lost this region because the local [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] chose to change side, joining a [[centrism|centrist]] alliance with the DC and its minor allies. In [[Latium]], where an assembly majority change, happened in 1977, had restored a centrist administration, the final ouster of the Communists from the government was confirmed by the polls.
