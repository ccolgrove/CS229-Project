'''''Goosebumps Series 2000''''' was a part of the [[Goosebumps]] series by [[R. L. Stine]]. It was a continuation of the original Goosebumps series. All of the books in the series are now out of print. 

== Cover design ==
The cover design of the Series 2000 books was different from the original books. The cover art was by [[Tim Jacobus]], the artist who also did the cover art of the original series. There was no back tagline anymore, and the paragraphs at the back were excerpts from the book rather than a short summary of the story as the original books' back covers had. There was another difference with back covers too, as there was written &quot;Welcome to the new millennium of fear&quot; and the &quot;Reader Beware, You're In For A Scare!&quot; of the original series was changed to &quot;2000 Times The Scares!&quot;.

The main subject of the covers, the title, the [[umbrella title]], and R. L. Stine were printed in raised print, something only [[Goosebumps Horrorland]] has other than Series 2000.

== Sequels to Goosebumps books ==
In Series 2000, there are sequels to some of the original books. Below is a list of those books:

* ''Bride of the Living Dummy'' (sequel to ''Night of the Living Dummy III'')
* ''Return to HorrorLand'' (sequel to ''One Day at HorrorLand'')
* ''Return to Ghost Camp'' (sequel to ''Ghost Camp'')

=== Sequels to the books in Series 2000 ===
Some books in the series were themselves sequels to other Series 2000 books. ''Slappy's Nightmare'' was a sequel to ''Bride of the Living Dummy''.

== Episodes in the TV series ==
The first two books, ''Cry of the Cat'' and ''Bride of the Living Dummy'', were adapted for the [[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps television show]], with ''Cry of the Cat'' being the only ''Goosebumps 2000'' adaptation that was a two-part episode.
