She taught music at the [[Concord Academy]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], and at the [[Shady Hill School for Girls]] in Philadelphia.

Many of her over 600 compositions were written for the choirs at her school. She wrote &quot;[[The Little Drummer Boy]]&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Carol of the Drum&quot;), in 1941.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; It became famous when recorded by the [[Harry Simeone Chorale]] in 1958: the recording sailed to the top of the ''Billboard'' charts and Simeone  insisted on a writer's royalty for his arrangement of the song.
Another famous hymn by Katherine Davis is the [[Thanksgiving]] hymn &quot;Let All Things Now Living&quot; which uses the melody of the traditional Welsh folk song [[The Ash Grove]].

She was a member of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] and was granted an honorary doctorate from [[Stetson University]], in [[DeLand, Florida]]. Katherine K.
