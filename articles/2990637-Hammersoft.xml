==Biography==
Leon Ware started his career as a songwriter  in the spring of 1967 as a songwriter. He co-wrote along  with Ivy Hunter and Steve Bowden for  the [[Isley Brothers]] recording of &quot;Got to Have You Back,&quot;  In 1971, Leon would collaborate with Ike &amp; Tina Turner,  co-writing six songs on their [[United Artists Records|United Artist]] album  called Nuff Said.  Released Fall 1971,  the album reached the Top 40 of the R&amp;B charts and also appeared in the pop charts.  Later that year, Ware began collaborating with [[Arthur &quot;T-Boy&quot; Ross]], the younger brother of  [[Diana Ross]]. One of the songs they wrote was '[[I Wanna Be Where You Are]]'. Recorded by [[Michael Jackson]] in November, 1971 for his 1972 [[Got to Be There|Got To Be There]] album. The single exploded in the spring of 1972  peaking at number two on the R&amp;B charts and number 16 on the pop charts. This success would lead to a record contract with [[United Artists Records]] with the release of his self-titled debut album '[[Leon Ware (album)|Leon Ware]]. By 1973 Leon had songwriting credits on albums by the [[Donny Hathaway]], [[Jackson 5]],  [[Average White Band]], [[The Miracles]] and others. In the spring of 1974. Quincy Jones tapped Leon as songwriter and performer for two songs on his [[Body Heat (Quincy Jones album)|Body Heat]] album. The  single &quot;If I Ever Lose This Heaven,&quot; which he co wrote with Pam Sawyer and also sang on the album with [[Minnie Riperton]] and [[Al Jarreau]], was an R&amp;B singles chart entry in September. Nearly a year later, it was covered by the [[Average White Band]] reaching the Top 40 of both the pop and R&amp;B charts in 1975.  Ware collaborated again with [[Minnie Riperton]]  on two songs for her [[Adventures in Paradise (Minnie Riperton album)|Adventures in Paradise]] album &quot;Inside My Love,&quot;  released as a single in the summer of 1975. The song became a Top 40 R&amp;B hit and also reached the pop charts.  Also in 1975, Ware and T-Boy Ross had started working on demos for Ware's second album to be released on [[Motown Records|Motown]] and a demo to secure T-Boy Ross a record deal. One of those demo recordings,  &quot;[[I Want You (Marvin Gaye song)|I Want You]] was heard by Motown boss [[Berry Gordy]] decided it would be a good fit for [[Marvin Gaye]]. Gaye would hear the rest of the demo of the demo tracks for what would become Gaye's album [[I Want You (Marvin Gaye album)|I Want You]]. Ware would co produce and co write the album along with T-Boy Ross. Released in March 1976, the album exploded on the charts going number one on the R&amp;B charts and the Top Ten of the pop charts. Having given away the material for his album, Ware began again on a solo effort for Motown. The result would be Ware's second album, &quot;[[Musical Massage]].  Released in September 1976, it  did not chart at all due to no promotion by  [[Motown Records|Motown]].

For the rest of the 70's into the 1990s, Ware would continue writing songs for others such as [[Teena Marie]], [[Jeffrey Osborne]], [[Loose Ends]], [[James Ingram]], [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Bobby Womack]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]. He would also release nine solo albums between 1979 and 2008 with varying degrees of success.  By the late '80s and 1990s, Ware continued to work on various sessions as a musician, arranger, and producer. One of his co-written songs, &quot;Independence&quot;, the title track of a 1993 album by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] was a hit, particularly in Europe. Another sesssion was [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]]'s debut album, [[Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite]] which was one of the first albums to usher in [[New Soul]] genre.  Also, his work was discovered as a source of sampling by rappers and hip-hop artists.

As of 2009, Ware was recovering from treatment for [[prostate cancer]], and credited his friend and fellow songwriter [[Adrienne Anderson]] with directing him to appropriate medical care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soulandjazzandfunk.com/news.asp?pNum=35 Interview With Leon Ware]: &quot;Still Riding High&quot;, published March 6, 2009; www.souljazzandfunk.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ware is featured on the debut album of Irish electo band [[Zombie Computer (Band)|Zombie Computer]]. He features on the title track âIndian Summerâ with a beautifully written and performed spoken word piece which is complemented by Zombie Computerâs melodic &amp; rhythmic sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.breakingtunes.com/zombiecomputer&lt;/ref&gt;
