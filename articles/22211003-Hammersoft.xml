[[Image:Beter Bed01.JPG|thumb|right|Corporate headquarters of Beter Bed Holding in Uden]]
'''Beter Bed [[Naamloze vennootschap|N.V.]]''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] retail company. Through its [[subsidiary|subsidiaries]] Beter Bed Holding N.V. trades in [[bedroom furniture]], [[mattress]]es and related products. In this line of business Beter Bed N.V is market leader in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.bedden-site.nl/beter-bed| title =Beter bed; marktleider op het gebied van slaapkamers| accessdate =2009-03-28| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 5 December 1996 Beter Bed's shares are being traded on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title =Beter Bed haalt met beursgang 125 miljoen op | newspaper = [[De Volkskrant]]   | language = Dutch| pages =  | year =  | date = 1996-11-26  | url = http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article786161.ece  |  accessdate =2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Beter Bed does not belong to the group of companies that compose the [[AEX index]] but are part of the group that compose the [[AScX index|Amsterdam Small Cap Index]].

The [[corporate headquarters]] are in [[Uden]], in the Dutch [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of [[North Brabant]]. Beter Bed Holding N.V. is the mother company of several different brands of [[chain store]]s, totalling 1072 shops in a number of [[Europe]]an countries. These companies  operate in various [[market segment]]s, from [[Cash and carry (wholesale)|cash and carry]] products to exclusive bedroom furniture, each chain maintaining  its own unique retail concept. The development and production of [[Orthopedic surgery|orthopedic]] mattresses is directed by the subsidiary DBC.

Beter Bed N.V. employs 2,227 [[full-time]] [[employee]]s in seven countries.

== History ==
Beter Bed was founded in 1981 in Uden by the brothers Mark and Pieter Diks. They raised capital from their father, Jan Diks, co-owner of [[Dico (company)|Dico]], managed to secure a modest bank loan and opened their first shop in Uden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/global/1999/1101/0222056a_2.html|title=20 For 2000| accessdate =2009-05-02|publisher=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards three shops, specialising in bedroom furniture, had been opened. At that time shops specialising in bedroom furniture and accompanying  products were a new and unfamiliar phenomenon since this market segment was dominated by large [[department store]]s and specialist shops concentrating on general interiors. The concept of providing high quality goods and a wide range of products at a low price proved to be successful and was a blueprint for all future activities of Beter Bed. During the second half of the 1980s the company began to grow.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeterBed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl/page.php?sm_id=42
|title=Beter Bed - History| accessdate =2009-03-27| format =|publisher=Beter Bed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1986 ''Bedden en Bedden B.V.'', a factory for the production of [[Medium-density fibreboard|MDF panels]], was established in Uden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl/page.php?sm_id=42
|title=Beter Bed - History| accessdate =2010-10-15| format =|publisher=Beter Bed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s two more production facilities were added to the company by acquiring two factories in Poland, ''Ecowood'' (1994) and ''Interwood'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.fembusiness.nl/web/Bedrijven/Bedrijf.htm?dbid=66&amp;typeofpage=66521| title =Beter Bed| accessdate =2009-03-29| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Initial public offering|flotation]] of Beter Bed Holding N.V. took place in December 1996. [[Share (finance)|Shares]] of Beter Bed Holding N.V. are traded at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. In the same year another company was added to the holding by the acquisition of ''DormaÃ«l'', a company that operates in the higher segment of the bedroom furniture market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Beter Bed neemt Dormael over | newspaper = [[NRC Handelsblad]]   |  pages =  | year =  | date = 1996-12-20  | url =http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/1996/November/20/Economie/20/Beter+Bed+neemt+Dormael+over  |  accessdate =2009-03-29| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year ''Beter Baby'' was founded, with the goal to gain market shares in the trade with bedroom furniture for babies and small children. At the same time Beter Bed N.V. acquired ''DFC Comfort'' ensuring the sole right of representation for orthopedic mattresses and pillows by this company within the [[Benelux]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BeterBed&quot; /&gt;

In order to comply with the planned [[Economic expansion|expansion]] and the resulting requirements the company moved to a new location in January 1997, consisting of a larger administrative building and a [[distribution center|distribution centre]] with a surface of 16,000&amp;nbsp;mÂ², after a construction time of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last= Beter Bed | title = Jaarverslag 1997  | year = 1998  | pages = 11 | place = Uden | publisher = Beter Bed Holding N.V.|language= Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 1990s the subsidiary ''Bedden Dump'' was founded. Originally set up to sell items taken from the Beter Bed range via temporary shops, it was decided in 2002 to expand this formula into a [[discount store|discount chain]] for bedroom furniture according to a cash and carry concept, targeting the lower market segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/bbh2002uk.pdf |title=Beter Bed Holding N.V. Annual Report 2002| accessdate =2009-03-27| format =pdf |publisher=Beter Bed Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 this company was renamed ''BeddenReus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/Annual%20report%202006.pdf|title=Beter Bed Holding N.V. Annual Report 2006| accessdate =2009-04-04| format =pdf |publisher=Beter Bed Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the company expanded into [[Germany]] by opening the first two shops in [[Essen]] and [[Dortmund]]. Also in 1998 Beter Bed N.V. acquired the German company ''Matratzen Concord'' whose headquarters were based in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Beter Bed aast op Duitse matrassenspeciaalzaak | newspaper = De Volkskrant | language = Dutch | pages = | year = | date = 1998-12-29  | url = http://www.volkskrant.nl/archief_gratis/article786161.ece | accessdate =2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time ''Matratzen Concord'' began its expansion into [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] (1998), as well as the Netherlands (1999), [[France]] and [[Italy]] (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.com/upload/doc/Annual%20results%201999.pdf|title=Beter Bed Holding N.V. Annual Report 1999| accessdate =2009-04-16| format =pdf |publisher=Beter Bed Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1998, Mark and Pieter Diks, the holding's founding brothers, sold a large amount of their shares in the company, reducing their commitment to 18%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beter Bed News&quot; /&gt;

The holding's structure began to change in 1999. One of the founding brothers, Pieter Diks, sold his remaining shares and retired from the management. Mark Diks again reduced his share in the company in May 2000 but remained in the management team for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://archief.fembusiness.nl/2000/10/21/nummer-43/Mark-Diks.htm| title =Mark Diks| accessdate =2009-03-29| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2000 the production facility ''Bedden und Bedden'' was sold off&lt;ref name=&quot;Beter Bed News&quot; /&gt; and the subsidiary ''DormaÃ«l'' was converted into a [[franchising]] formula. Following a [[management buyout]] ''Beter Baby'' was sold off. In August 2000, it was announced that the [[Blokker (store chain)|Blokker]] family had acquired 15% of Beter Bed's shares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beter Bed News&quot; /&gt;

Mark Diks resigned as CEO and became a member of the supervisory board of the holding in January 2001. Since January 2001 the office of CEO has been held by Frans Geelen,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beter Bed News&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.hebels.nl/newsperc/ajbnws.htm| title =Beter Bed News| accessdate =2009-04-16| language =}}&lt;/ref&gt; having joined Beter Bed in  August 2000 and after having served as a member of the [[board of directors]] of [[C&amp;A|C&amp;A Europe]] since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.nu.nl/economie/1948232/topman-beter-bed-vertrekt.html| title =Topman Beter Bed vertrekt | accessdate =2009-04-16| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 all activities of the subsidiary ''DFC Comfort'' were discontinued and a new company ''DBC International'' was founded. ''DBC International'' is active in the development, [[marketing]] and [[sales|selling]] of mattresses developed under its own direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/bbh2001uk.pdf |title=Beter Bed Holding N.V. Annual Report 2001| accessdate =2009-03-27| format =pdf |publisher=Beter Bed Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2001 Beter Bed N.V. had a total of 555 shops.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2001&quot; /&gt;

In the first half of 2002 [[Collective investment scheme|investment fund]] NeSBIC attempted to [[takeover|take over]] Beter Bed N.V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Intended offer on Beter Bed by NeSBIC Buy Out Fund | work = | publisher = bencis capital partners| date = 2002-02-05  | url = http://www.bencis.nl/web/site/default.aspx?m=news&amp;ca=d&amp;id=20| format =  | accessdate = 2009-04-16| language =}}&lt;/ref&gt; by offering â¬16 for every share sold to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NeSBIC neemt Beter Bed over | work = | publisher = RTL Z | date = 2002-02-05  | url = http://www.rtl.nl/(/financien/rtlz/nieuws/)/components/financien/rtlz/2002/02_februari/5-beter_bed.xml  | format =  | accessdate = 2009-03-29| language =Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Pensioenfonds van Shell zit te azen op 'Beter Bod' | newspaper = [[De Telegraaf]]| language = Dutch| pages =  | year =  | date = 2002-02-23 | url = http://krant.telegraaf.nl/krant/archief/20020223/teksten/fin.bod.beter.bed.pensioenfonds.html  |  accessdate =2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the inadequate offer and simultaneous insecurity with regards to the financial backing, the project ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = van den Oever  | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title = Beter Bed: Tijd om op te staan | work = | publisher = FEM Business | date = 2006-05-08 | url = http://archief.fembusiness.nl/2006/08/05/nummer-31/Beter-Bed-Tijd-om-op-te-staan.htm | doi =  | accessdate = 2009-03-29| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the same time the remaining founder, Mark Diks, sold his remaining shares&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = | first = | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = IEX.nl Voorkennis?: Mark Diks dumpt 37% Beter Bed | work =  | publisher = iex.nl| date = 2002-04-15 | url = http://www.iex.nl/columns/columns_artikel.asp?colid=6785 | doi =  | accessdate = 2009-09-14| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently withdrew from the supervisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = van Lent | first = Daan| authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = âIk zit iedere zaterdag op mijn tractorâ | work =  | publisher = FEM Business | date = 2005-03-05 | url = http://archief.fembusiness.nl/2005/03/05/nummer-9/Ik-zit-iedere-zaterdag-op-mijn-tractor.htm | doi =  | accessdate = 2009-04-04| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Matratzen Concord'' closed all its shops in Italy and France in 2003 due to disappointing sales figures and the lack of short-term prospects.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/bbh2003uk.pdf |title=Beter Bed Holding N.V. Annual Report 2003| accessdate =2009-03-27| format =pdf |publisher=Beter Bed Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beter Bed's strategy changed during this period, returning to its core activities, the trading and selling of bedroom furniture and accessories and turning away from producing its own goods. As a consequence, in May 2005 the last remaining factory in Poland, ''Interwood'', was sold, the second factory in Poland, ''Ecowood'', had already been closed down in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/ANNUAL%20REPORT%202005.pdf|title=Beter Bed Holding N.V. Annual Report 2005| accessdate =2009-03-27| format =pdf |publisher=Beter Bed Holding}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2004 some but not all of the DormaÃ«l shops had gone into [[receivership]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Leveranciers van Beter Bed Holding laken de doorstartformule | work = | publisher = De Nationale Franchise &amp; Formulebrief | date = 2004-09-10  | url = http://www.denationalefranchisegids.nl/firstfranchise/Nieuwsbrief_10_september_2004.htm| accessdate = 2009-03-29 | language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in June 2005 the first shops of ''Slaapgenoten,'' a company created by merging most of the remaining shops of the company ''DormaÃ«l'', founded in 2000 as a franchise formula, were opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2005&quot;/&gt; However, some of these still operate under the name of DormaÃ«l. In September of the same year the Spanish chain ''El Gigante del ColchÃ³n'' was acquired by Beter Bed N.V. At the time ''El Gigante del ColchÃ³n'' had 20 shops in the region of [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Beter Bed neemt Spaanse beddenketen over | publisher = Euronext  | date = 2005-09-15  | url = http://www.euronext.com/trader/companynews/companyNews-2495-NL-NL0000339703.html?selectedMep=2&amp;docid=148371 | accessdate = 2009-03-29| language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2008 the company had grown to 47 shops&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Release Beter Bed&quot; /&gt; covering the whole of [[Catalonia]] and expanded into the region of [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2008&quot; /&gt;

In December 2005 all activities of the subsidiary ''Beter Bed Deutschland'' were terminated. The locations were integrated into ''Matratzen Concord.''&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2005&quot; /&gt;

In October 2006 a second strategy for selling mattresses in Germany was introduced with the founding of the new subsidiary ''MAV Matratzen-Abverkauf.'' Two shops were opened in 2006. At the end of 2008 the company had grown to 30 shops.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2008&quot; /&gt; The activities of ''MAV Matratzen-Abverkauf'' are concentrated in the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] while, at the same time, expanding southwards into [[Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mav-matratzen.de|title=MAV Matratzen-Abverkauf| accessdate =2009-03-27| language =German| format =|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the first shops of ''Matratzen Concord'' were opened in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Beter Bed komt naar BelgiÃ« | work = | publisher = express.de | date = 2007-08-24  | url =http://www.express.be/sectors/nl/retail/beter-komt-belgie/78971.htm| accessdate = 2009-05-21 | language =Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of June 2009 the number of shops there has grown to five&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Release Beter Bed&quot; /&gt; with the intention to open more in the future.

In the second half of 2008 the first ''Matratzen Concord'' shop was opened in [[Warsaw]] under the name of ''Materace Concord.'' The opening of further shops in Poland is planned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://materace-concord.pl/Lokalizacje.html| title = Materace Concord - Lokalizacje| accessdate =2009-03-27| language =Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second shop opening in the first half of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://materace-concord.pl/Sklepy.html| title = Materace Concord - Sklepy| accessdate =2009-09-13| language =Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2009, CEO Frans Geelen announced his intention to resign from the office as chairman of the board of directors by April 2010 the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  | title = Press Release Beter Bed  | publisher = Beter Bed  | date = 2009-04-14  | url = http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/press%20release%2014-4-2009.pdf  | accessdate = 2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2009, it was revealed that Ton Anbeek, at the time CEO at [[Koninklijke Auping bv]], would succeed Frans Geelen as of 1 March 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  | title = Press Release Beter Bed  | publisher = Beter Bed  | date = 2009-10-09  | url = http://www.beterbedholding.nl//upload/doc/press%20release%20%209-10-2009.pdf | accessdate = 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the appointment being ratified during an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of Beter Bed on 5 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =   | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders 5 November 2009  | work =  | publisher = Beter Bed Holding  | date = 2009-11-05  | url = http://www.beterbedholding.com//upload/doc/voting%20results%20EGM%205-11-2009.pdf  | format = pdf  | doi =   | accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
Whereas in 2001 the [[goal|objectives]] of Beter Bed N.V. were simply defined as aiming at fast and profitable expansion in the fragmented European bedroom furniture market whereby the various subsidiaries were supposed to endeavour to become market leaders in those countries they were active in on the one hand, and by developing [[Store brand|own brand]] products which were to be sold by the company's own retail chains as well as through other distribution channels on the other hand,&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2001&quot; /&gt; the objectives since 2009 have become more specific and detailed. The company now aims to strengthen further its alleged market leadership in Europe by positioning itself in such a way to make use of any possibility of [[economic growth|growth]]. Also, even though a temporary decrease in [[net profit]] is considered to be possible under exceptional circumstances, one of the goals is still to increase [[net profit]]. This is to be realised by adjusting various priorities. Furthermore, the target of an [[Earnings before interest and taxes|EBIT]] of 12,5% is to be retained as an objective, although the company admits that this will be unlikely in the near future if market conditions were to remain as they had been in 2008. Finally, in view of the uncertain market conditions Beter Bed N.V. considers an impeccable [[balance sheet]] and a strong [[cash flow]] to be vital to the strength and effectiveness of the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2008&quot; /&gt;

== Strategy ==
Beter Bed Holding's strategy for the realisation of the objectives is to ensure [[like for like]] growth in [[revenue]] at comparable shops and low investments per shop accompanied by flexibility in relation to [[renting|rental]] contracts. Secondly, the existing concept for shops is to be expanded, particularly outside the Netherlands. Additionally, the sales organisation is to be optimised and the sales methods improved through [[in-house]] [[training]]. Also, by utilising the company's [[Information technology|IT]] systems to its full capability information can be provided to which should enable Beter Bed N.V. to respond quickly to new [[Market trend|trends]] and opportunities and to make capacity adjustments in the event of changed market conditions. Finally, own product concepts are to be further to be developed by utilising technological developments in the field of mattress production and by responding to local trends in [[demand (economics)|demand]] of these products.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 2008&quot; /&gt;
