Royal Brougham Way to the north, and [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] [[railroad tracks]] to the east. The museum is located near the western terminus of [[Interstate 90]]. 

==Museum overview==
Seattle Mariners former chairman and CEO John Ellis announced on June 14, 1997 the creation of a Mariners Hall of Fame. It is operated by the Seattle Mariners organization. It honors the players, staff and other individuals that greatly contributed to the history and success of the Mariners franchise. It is located at the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest in [[Safeco Field]]. Inductees include [[Alvin Davis]], [[Dave Niehaus]], [[Jay Buhner]] and [[Edgar MartÃ­nez]].

==Inductees==
===Alvin Davis===
{{main|Alvin Davis}}

Davis, who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, played college baseball at [[Arizona State]]. He broke into the majors with the Mariners in {{mlby|1984}} and remained there until {{mlby|1992}}. Well liked by Mariners fans, Davis held most of the franchise's offensive team records until the advent of [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], Edgar Martinez and [[Alex Rodriguez]]. He burst onto the major league scene in {{mlby|1984}}, homering in his first two big-league games and collecting three doubles in his third. Davis reached base in each of the first 47 games of his career, and was chosen for his only [[All-Star Game]] as a rookie. Named the Mariners MVP, he was also voted the American League's [[Rookie of the Year Award]] after batting .284 with 27 home runs and 116 RBI.

Davis, who was nicknamed '''Mr. Mariner''', was inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame in 1997.

===Dave Niehaus===
{{main|Dave Niehaus}}
Dave Niehaus was the team's lead announcer from its first game in 1977 until his death on November 10, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;passing&quot;&gt;{{cite |title=Loss of a legend: Dave Niehaus, voice of Mariners, dies at 75 |publisher=KOMO News |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |url=http://www.komonews.com/sports/107096913.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite working for a franchise who from its first year in 1977 until 1991 was without a winning season, his talent was recognizable, and Niehaus was considered one of the few attractions for Mariner fans.&lt;ref name=passing /&gt; Even in the period before the team's memorable [[1995 in baseball|1995]] season, the Mariners were regularly one of the leading major-league teams in terms of the percentage of radios in use.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Niehaus was and will continue to be immensely popular in Seattle; he was twice named Washington Sportscaster of the Year. The team chose him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the opening of its new ballpark, Safeco Field, on July 15, 1999. In [[2000 in baseball|2000]], he was the second figure to be inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame. In [[2008 in baseball|2008]], Niehaus was named the winner of the [[Ford C. Frick Award]], which recognizes career excellence in baseball broadcasting and is considered the highest baseball broadcasting honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;passing&quot; /&gt;

On November 10, 2010, Dave was the first member to pass away. He died of a heart attack at his home in [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]]. He is survived by his wife, three children, six grandchildren, and countless friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;passing&quot; /&gt;

===Jay Buhner===
{{main|Jay Buhner}}
He was traded from the [[New York Yankees]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] along with two career minor leaguers (Rich Balabon and Troy Evers) in exchange for [[Ken Phelps]]. This trade is often considered one of the worst made by the Yankees of that period, and the best in Mariner history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.yesnetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060808&amp;content_id=1406631&amp;oid=36019&amp;vkey=4 |title=Not Every Trade Worked | accessdate = 2007-04-07 |author=Jonah Keri }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade was once noted humorously on the television program ''[[Seinfeld]]'', in the episode &quot;[[The Caddy (Seinfeld episode)|The Caddy]],&quot; in which the Yankees' owner, [[George Steinbrenner#Steinbrenner caricatured in Seinfeld|George Steinbrenner]], appears at the home of [[George Costanza]]'s parents to inform them â mistakenly â that their son is dead. All [[Frank Costanza|Mr. Costanza]] can say is, &quot;What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?! He had 30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year! He's got a rocket for an arm... You don't know what the hell you're doing!&quot; The clip was played at [[Safeco Field]] when Buhner was inducted into the Mariners' Hall of Fame in {{mlby|2004}}.

Buhner retired at the end of the {{mlby|2001}} season as one of the most popular players in Mariners history. The Mariners have not issued his #19 jersey since he retired. According to Mariners team policy, he did not become eligible to have his number retired until {{mlby|2006}}. The Mariners require a player to have spent at least five years with the team and be elected to the Hall of Fame or narrowly miss election after spending his entire career with the team.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

He holds the Seattle Mariners career record for [[strikeouts]], with 1375, and has the lowest career stolen base percentage since {{mlby|1954}} (6 [[stolen base]]s against 24 times [[caught stealing]] for a success rate of 20%; baseball did not keep track of times caught stealing until 1954). He was also known throughout baseball for his ability to vomit on command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bob Finnigan|title=After 14 years with M's, Buhner retires|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=mariners18&amp;date=20011218|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=December 18, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Edgar MartÃ­nez===
{{main|Edgar MartÃ­nez}}
[[image:EdgarMartinez2009.jpg|thumb|Edgar MartÃ­nez in 2009]]
His 18 seasons with the Mariners netted him 7 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances, along with two [[batting average|batting titles]] and five [[Silver Slugger]] awards. He finished first or second in on-base percentage ([[On-base percentage|OBP]]) in 6 different years, and in the top 5 in the same category in 10 different years. Over the seven year span of 1995-2001 he was considered one of the most consistent right-handed hitters in the game. During this time he hit .329 with a .445 on-base percentage and a .574 slugging percentage for an OPS ([[On-base plus slugging|On-base Plus Slugging]]) of 1.019.  In 1996, he became only the fifth player in the 20th century to hit 50 doubles in two consecutive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Edgar_Martinez_1963|title=The Ballplayers - Edgar Martinez |accessdate=2008-11-29|work=BaseballLibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the Mariners' all-time leader in hits (2,247), doubles (514), walks (1,283), and games played (2,055). He is also among the top 10 in other categories including at-bats (7,213), runs (1,219), home runs (309), RBI (1,261), total bases (3,718) and extra base hits (838). 

He is best remembered for his performance in the [[1995 American League Division Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]] in which he hit .571 and was on base 18 times in 5 games. In game 4 of that series, he hit a three run homer, then a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] home run that gave the Mariners a 10-6 lead en route to an 11-8 victory. His RBI total in that game set a single-game postseason record. The win knotted the best-of-five series at two games apiece and forced a decisive game 5. Down 5-4 in the 11th inning of that decisive game, MartÃ­nez hit a two-run double (called [[The Double (Seattle Mariners)|&quot;The Double&quot;]] by Mariners fans) off Jack McDowell, winning the game for the Mariners, 6-5. 

Baseball lore says that Edgar MartÃ­nez &quot;saved baseball in Seattle&quot; with that double. While his series-winning hit did help build the groundswell that the Washington State Legislature eventually had to respond to (by enacting legislation to fund [[Safeco Field]]), it was one of many moments in a &quot;miracle run&quot; by the Mariners in September and October 1995 that changed public sentiment towards the team and towards public financing of a baseball-only stadium as a partial replacement for the [[Kingdome]]. 

During his career, MartÃ­nez was a Mariner fan favorite, playing his entire career with the team, and always being willing to sign autographs for fans.  In October 2004, following his retirement, S. Atlantic Street in Seattle along Safeco Field's south facade was renamed Edgar MartÃ­nez Drive.

The Mariners have not issued MartÃ­nez' #11 jersey since he retired. Under Mariners' team policy, he will not be eligible to have his jersey formally retired until 2010 (when he is eligible for the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] for the first time, see below). However, it is highly unlikely that any Mariner will ever wear that number again.

He was inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame on June 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2003539505_webedgar24.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=The Seattle Times: Mariners: Edgar MartÃ­nez to be inducted into Mariners' Hall of Fame | first=Larry | last=Stone | date=January 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
