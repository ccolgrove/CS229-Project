'''Chirk Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell y Waun}}) is a [[castle]] located at [[Chirk]], [[Wrexham (county borough)|Wrexham]], [[Wales]].

The castle was built in 1295 by [[Roger Mortimer de Chirk]], uncle of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]] as part of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I's]] chain of fortresses across the north of [[Wales]]. It guards the entrance to the [[Ceiriog Valley]].  It was the administrative centre for the [[Marcher Lords]]hip of [[Chirkland]]

The castle was bought by [[Thomas Myddelton]] in 1595 for Â£5,000 (approx. Â£11 million as of 2008). His son, [[Thomas Myddelton (younger)|Thomas Myddelton of Chirk Castle]] was a [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] during the [[English Civil War]], but became a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] during the [[Cheshire Rising]] of 1659. Following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], his son became [[Sir Thomas Myddelton, 1st Baronet]] of Chirke.

During the 1930s the Castle was home to [[Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden]], a prominent patron of the arts and champion of [[Culture of Wales|Welsh culture]]. The [[Myddelton Baronets|Myddelton family]] resided at Chirk Castle until 2004. [[Lieutenant-Colonel (UK)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[Ririd Myddleton]] was an [[Equerry|extra equerry]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] from 1952 until his death in 1988.

The castle is presently in the ownership of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] and is open to the public between February and October. Access is by road; it is a stiff 45 minute walk from the railway station to the castle itself.The state rooms, towers and dungeons are staffed by well informed guides. The property is also notable for its gardens, with clipped yew hedges, herbaceous borders, rock gardens and terraces and surrounded by 18th century parkland.
