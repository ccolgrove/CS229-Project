In 1978, Molina starred with [[Leonard Rossiter]] in the sitcom ''[[The Losers (TV series)|The Losers]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;RT&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewishohn|first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Lewisohn|coauthors=|title=Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy|year=2003|publisher=''[[BBC Worldwide]]''|location=London|isbn=0-563-48755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina made his film debut with a minor role in the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' as [[Indiana Jones]]' ill-fated guide, [[Sapito]], during its iconic opening sequence. However, his big break came with ''[[Letter to Brezhnev]]'' in 1985, which he followed up with a starring role in ''[[Prick Up Your Ears]]'' in 1987, playing [[Joe Orton]]'s lover (and eventual murderer) [[Kenneth Halliwell]]. He was originally cast as [[Arnold Rimmer]] in the TV sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', but he was replaced by [[Chris Barrie]].

Molina starred in the first two series of ''[[El C.I.D.]]'' but left to concentrate on his film work. Subsequent films included ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'', ''[[Dudley Do-Right]]'', ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'', ''[[Not Without My Daughter]]'', and ''[[Enchanted April]]''. With a flawless mid-western American accent, Molina starred alongside [[Betty White]] in the US television series ''[[Ladies Man (1999 TV series)|Ladies Man]]'', which ran from 1999â2001.

He has worked twice with [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], first in ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and then ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''. In 2002, Molina gained wide recognition for his portrayal of [[Diego Rivera]] alongside [[Salma Hayek]] in the biopic ''[[Frida]]'', a role which garnered him [[BAFTA]] and [[Screen Actors Guild|SAG]] award nominations. In 2003, he played himself alongside [[Steve Coogan]] in ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]''. In 2004, Molina gained further commercial recognition when he was cast as the villain [[Doctor Octopus]] in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', which went on to become one of the highest-grossing films of that year. He later reprised his role of Doctor Octopus in the video game adaption of ''Spider-Man 2'' and archive footage of Molina as Doctor Octopus is seen in the opening of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In 2006, Molina portrayed [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s film version of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[As You Like It]]'' and appeared in [[Ron Howard|Ron Howard's]] [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|adaptation]] of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.

On 1 April 2010, he opened at Broadway's [[John Golden Theater]] in the role of artist [[Mark Rothko]] in [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]]'s drama ''[[Red (play)|Red]]'' opposite [[Eddie Redmayne]] for a limited engagement through 27 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lalayn Baluch |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24136/west-to-appear-in-donmars-life-is-a-dream |title=The Stage / News / West to appear in Donmar's Life is a Dream |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had played the role to much critical success at the [[Donmar Warehouse]] in London in December 2009.
