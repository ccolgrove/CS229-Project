'''Aponeuroses''' (plural of '''aponeurosis''': Î±ÏÎ¿, &quot;away&quot; or &quot;of&quot;, and Î½ÎµÏÏÎ¿Î½, &quot;sinew&quot;) are layers of flat broad tendons.  They have a shiny, whitish-silvery color, are [[histologically]] similar to [[tendon]]s, and are very sparingly supplied with [[blood vessels]] and [[nerves]]. When dissected, aponeuroses are papery, and peel off by sections. The primary regions with thick aponeurosis are in the [[Anatomical terms of location|ventral]] [[abdominal]] region, the dorsal [[lumbar]] region, and in the [[palmar]] and plantar region.

Their primary function is to join muscles and the body parts the muscles act upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000006884|aponeurosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anterior abdominal aponeuroses==
The anterior abdominal aponeuroses are located just on top of the [[rectus abdominis muscle]]. It has for its borders the [[external oblique]], [[pectoralis muscle]]s, and the [[latissimus dorsi]].

==Posterior lumbar aponeuroses==
The [[Posterior lumbar aponeuroses]] are situated just on top of the epaxial muscles of the thorax, which are [[multifidus spinae]] and [[Sacrospinalis]].

==Palmar and plantar aponeuroses and extensor hood==
The [[palmar aponeuroses]] occur on the palms of the hands. The [[extensor hood]]s are aponeuroses at the back of the fingers.
&lt;br /&gt;The [[plantar_aponeurosis|plantar aponeuroses]] occur on the plantar aspect of the foot. They extend from the calcaneal tuberosity then diverge to connect to the bones, ligaments and the dermis of the skin around the distal part of the metatarsal bones.

==Anterior and posterior intercostal membranes==
The anterior and posterior intercostal membranes are aponeuroses located between the ribs and are continuations of the external and internal intercostal muscles, respectively. 

==Scalp aponeuroses==
The aponeurosis (or [[galea aponeurotica]]) is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue which runs from the [[frontalis muscle]] anteriorly to the [[occipitalis]] posteriorly.  

==Pennate muscles &amp; Aponeuroses==
[[Pennate muscle]]s, in which the muscle fibers are oriented at an angle to the line of action, typically have two aponeuroses.  Muscle fibers connect one to the other, and each aponeurosis thins into a [[tendon]] which attaches to bone at the origin or insertion site.

==Elastic Energy Storage==
Like [[tendon]]s, aponeuroses attached to pennate muscles can be stretched by the forces of muscular contraction, absorbing energy like a spring and returning it when they recoil to unloaded conditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://jp.physoc.org/content/587/17/4309.full&lt;/ref&gt;
