The '''University of Cambridge''' (informally '''Cambridge University''' or '''Cambridge''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Cambridge]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|second-oldest]] university in both the United Kingdom and the English-speaking world (after the [[University of Oxford]]), and the seventh-oldest globally. In [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominals]] the university's name is abbreviated as ''Cantab'', a shortened form of ''Cantabrigiensis'' (an adjective derived from ''Cantabrigia'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinised]] form of ''Cambridge'').

The university grew out of an association of scholars in the city of Cambridge that was formed in 1209, early records suggest, by scholars leaving [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] after a dispute with townsfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/records.html|title=A Brief History: Early records|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=17 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two &quot;ancient universities&quot; have many common features and are often jointly referred to as ''[[Oxbridge]]''. In addition to cultural and practical associations as a historic part of British society, they have a long [[Oxbridge rivalry|history of rivalry]] with each other.

Academically Cambridge ranks as one of the top universities in the world: first in the world in both the 2010 and 2011 ''[[QS World University Rankings]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011&lt;/ref&gt; sixth in the world in the 2011 ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]'', and fifth in the world (and first in Europe) in the 2011 ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]''. Cambridge regularly contends with Oxford for first place in [[League tables of British universities|UK league tables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/tol_gug/gooduniversityguide.php |title=University Rankings League Table 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2009 |work=Good University Guide |work=The Times |location=UK  | first1=Roland | last1=Watson | first2=Francis | last2=Elliott | first3=Patrick | last3=Foster}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Graduates of the University have won a total of 61 Nobel Prizes, the most of any university in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the marketing consultancy World Brand Lab rated Cambridge University as the 50th most influential brand in the world, and the 4th most influential university brand, behind only [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[Stanford University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbrandlab.com/world/2009/top500_3.htm|title=World's 500 Most Influential Brands (2009)|publisher=World Brand Lab|accessdate=27 January 2010|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2011, Cambridge ranked third, after Harvard and MIT, in The Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, which reflect the reputation of universities for educational and research excellence based on a survey of academics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/reputation-rankings.html|title=Top Universities by Reputation (2011)|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=11 March 2011|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge is a member of the [[Coimbra Group]], the [[G5 (education)|G5]], the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]], the [[League of European Research Universities]] and the [[Russell Group]] of research-led [[British universities]]. It forms part of the [[Golden Triangle (UK universities)|'Golden Triangle']] of British universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2005/050707/full/nj7047-144a.html| title=Golden opportunities|accessdate=19 October 2010|publisher=Nature| date=6 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Cambridge's status was enhanced by a charter in 1231 from King [[Henry III of England]] which awarded the ''[[ius non trahi extra]]'' (a right to discipline its own members) plus some exemption from taxes, and a [[Papal bull|bull]] in 1233 from [[Pope Gregory IX]] that gave graduates from Cambridge the right to teach everywhere in Christendom. {{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

After Cambridge was described as a ''[[studium generale]]'' in a letter by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] in 1290,&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, M.B. [http://books.google.com/books?id=7og8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 ''The original statutes of Cambridge University: The text and its history.''] Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1970, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed as such in a bull by [[Pope John XXII]] in 1318, it became common for researchers from other European [[medieval universities]] to come and visit Cambridge to study or to give [[lecture]] courses.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

 &lt;/div&gt;

===Foundation of the colleges===
Cambridge's colleges were originally an incidental feature of the system. No college is as old as the university itself. The colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels. The hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, but they have left some indicators of their time, such as the name of Garret Hostel Lane.

[[Hugh Balsham]], [[Bishop of Ely]], founded [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] in 1284, Cambridge's first college. Many colleges were founded during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but colleges continued to be established throughout the centuries to modern times, although there was a gap of 204 years between the founding of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]] in 1596 and [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing]] in 1800. The most recently established college is [[Robinson College, Cambridge|Robinson]], built in the late 1970s. However, [[Homerton College, Cambridge|Homerton College]] only achieved full university college status in March 2010, making it the newest full college (it was previously an &quot;Approved Society&quot; affiliated with the university).

In [[medieval]] times, many colleges were founded so that their members would [[Prayer|pray]] for the [[soul]]s of the founders, and were often associated with chapels or [[abbey]]s. A change in the collegesâ focus occurred in 1536 with the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]. King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] ordered the university to disband its Faculty of Canon Law&lt;ref&gt;Helmholtz, H.R. (2004) ''Roman Canon Law in Reformation England'' (Cambridge: University Press) pp.35,153&lt;/ref&gt; and to stop teaching &quot;[[scholastic philosophy]]&quot;. In response, colleges changed their curricula away from canon law and towards the [[classics]], the Bible, and [[mathematics]].

As Cambridge moved away from Canon Law so too did it move away from Catholicism. As early as the 1520s, the continental rumblings of [[Lutheranism]] and what was to become more broadly known as the [[Protestant Reformation]] were making their presence felt in the intellectual discourse of the university. Among the intellectuals involved was the theologically influential [[Thomas Cranmer]], later to become [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. As it became convenient to Henry VIII in the 1530s, the King looked to Cranmer and others (within and without Cambridge) to craft a new religious path that was different from Catholicism yet also different from what Martin Luther had in mind.

Nearly a century later, the university was at the centre of another Christian schism. Many nobles, intellectuals and even common folk saw the ways of the [[Church of England]] as being all too similar to the Catholic Church and moreover that it was used by the crown to usurp the rightful powers of the counties. [[East Anglia]] was the centre of what became the [[Puritan]] movement and at Cambridge, it was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine's Hall, Sidney Sussex and Christ's College.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Roger, Mobility &amp; Migration, East Anglian Founders of New England, 1629â1640, Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1994, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; They produced many &quot;non-conformist&quot; graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or pulpit, the approximately 20,000 Puritans who left for New England and especially the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during the [[Great Migration (Puritan)|Great Migration]] decade of the 1630s. [[Oliver Cromwell]], Parliamentary commander during the English Civil War and head of the English Commonwealth (1649â1660), attended [[Sidney Sussex]].

===Mathematics===
From the time of [[Isaac Newton]] in the later 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained a strong emphasis on [[applied mathematics]], particularly mathematical physics. Study of this subject was compulsory for graduation, and students were required to take an exam for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the main first degree at Cambridge in both arts and science subjects. This exam is known as a [[Tripos]]. Students awarded [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] after completing the mathematics Tripos were named [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]]. The [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] was competitive and helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]]. However, some famous students, such as [[G. H. Hardy]], disliked the system, feeling that people were too interested in accumulating marks in exams and not interested in the subject itself.

Pure mathematics at Cambridge in the 19th century had great achievements but also missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. Pure mathematical research at Cambridge finally reached the highest international standard in the early 20th century, thanks above all to [[G. H. Hardy]] and his collaborator, [[J. E. Littlewood]]. In geometry, [[W. V. D. Hodge]] brought Cambridge into the international mainstream in the 1930s.

Although diversified in its research and teaching interests, Cambridge today maintains its strength in mathematics. Cambridge alumni have won six [[Fields Medal]]s and one [[Abel Prize]] for mathematics, while individuals representing Cambridge have won four Fields Medals.&lt;ref&gt;The six alumni are [[Michael Atiyah]] (Abel Prize and Fields Medal), [[Enrico Bombieri]], [[Simon Donaldson]], [[Richard Borcherds]], [[Timothy Gowers]], [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] and the four official representatives were [[John G. Thompson]], [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]], [[Richard Borcherds]], [[Timothy Gowers]] (see also {{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FieldsMedal.html|title=Fields Medal|publisher=Wolfram MathWorld|accessdate=3 December 2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; The University also runs a special
[[Part III of the Mathematical Tripos|Master of Advanced Study]] course in mathematics.

===Contributions to the advancement of science===
Many of the most important scientific discoveries and revolutions were made by Cambridge alumni. These include:
* Understanding the [[scientific method]], by [[Francis Bacon]]
* The [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and the development of [[calculus]], by [[Sir Isaac Newton]]
* The development of thermodynamics, by [[Lord Kelvin]]
* The discovery of the electron, by [[J. J. Thomson]]
* The [[Atomic nucleus|splitting of the atom]], by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and of the nucleus by [[Sir John Douglas Cockcroft|Sir John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]]
* The unification of electromagnetism, by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]
* The discovery of hydrogen, by [[Henry Cavendish]]
* Theory of Evolution by natural selection, by [[Charles Darwin]]
* Mathematical synthesis of [[Darwinian selection]] with [[Mendelian genetics]], by [[Ronald Fisher]]
* The [[Turing machine]], a basic model for [[Theory of computation|computation]], by [[Alan Turing]]
* The structure of [[DNA]], by [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[Francis Crick]], [[James D. Watson]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]], the later three awarded the Nobel Prize.(Rosalind Franklin didn't receive the Nobel Prize as it was not given posthumously)
* Pioneering [[quantum mechanics]], by [[Paul Dirac]]

===Women's education===
Initially, only male students were enrolled into the university. The first colleges for women were [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]] (founded by [[Emily Davies]]) in 1869 and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham College]] in 1872 (founded by [[Anne Clough]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), followed by [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]] in 1885 (founded by [[Elizabeth Phillips Hughes]] as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women), [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]] (later renamed Murray Edwards College) in 1954, and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish College]]. The first women students were examined in 1882 but attempts to make women full members of the university did not succeed until 1947. Women were allowed to study courses, sit examinations, and have their results recorded from 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the twentieth century, this allowed the &quot;[[steamboat ladies]]&quot; to receive ''[[ad eundem gradum|ad eundem]]'' degrees from the [[University of Dublin]].

From 1921 women were awarded diplomas which &quot;conferred the Title of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts&quot;. As they were not &quot;admitted to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts&quot; they were excluded from the governing of the university. Since students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women. Starting with Churchill College, all of the men's colleges began to admit women between 1972 and 1988. One women's college, Girton, also began to admit male students from 1979, but the other women's colleges did not follow suit. As a result of [[St Hilda's College, Oxford]], ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining United Kingdom University with colleges which refuse to admit males, with three such institutions (Newnham, Murray Edwards and Lucy Cavendish).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1520628/St-Hilda%27s-to-end-113-year-ban-on-male-students.html|title=St Hilda's to end 113-year ban on male students|work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=8 September 2008  | first=Nicole | last=Martin | date=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |title=Single-sex colleges: a dying breed? |publisher=HERO |month=June |year=2007 |accessdate=20 April 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080612072113/http://www.hero.ac.uk/uk/studying/archives/2007/single_sex_colleges__a_dying_breed__Jun.cfm |archivedate = 12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the academic year 2004â5, the university's student gender ratio, including post-graduates, was male 52%: female 48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/special/19/|title=Special No 19|work=Cambridge University Reporter|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myths, legends and traditions===
{{main|University of Cambridge legends}}
As an institution with such a long history, the University has developed a large number of myths and legends. The vast majority of these are untrue, but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.

A discontinued tradition is that of the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]], the âprizeâ awarded to the student with the lowest passing grade in the final examinations of the Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]]. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's. Since 1909, results were published alphabetically within class rather than score order. This made it harder to ascertain who the winner of the spoon was (unless there was only one person in the third class), and so the practice was abandoned.

Each Christmas Eve, BBC radio and television broadcasts [[Nine Lessons and Carols|The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols]] by the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge]]. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas tradition since it was first transmitted in 1928 (though the festival has existed since 1918). The radio broadcast is carried worldwide by the [[BBC World Service]] and is also syndicated to hundreds of radio stations in the USA. The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1703517.stm|title=Choir that sings to the world|publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 September 2008 | date=24 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/advent/carolsfromkings.shtml|title=Carols from King's|publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge is a [[collegiate university]], meaning that it is made up of self-governing and independent colleges, each with its own property and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines, and within each faculty, school or department within the university, academics from many different colleges will be found.

The faculties are responsible for ensuring that lectures are given, arranging seminars, performing research and determining the syllabi for teaching, overseen by the General Board. Together with the central administration headed by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Vice-Chancellor]], they make up the entire Cambridge University. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the University (the [[Cambridge University Library]]), by the Faculties (Faculty libraries such as the Squire Law Library), and by the individual colleges (all of which maintain a multi-discipline library, generally aimed mainly at their undergraduates).

===Colleges===
{{main|List of colleges of the University of Cambridge}}
The colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisionsâsmall-group teaching sessions, often with just one studentâwithin the colleges. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and [[fellow]]s, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university regulations.

[[Image:Cambridge University colleges timeline.svg|thumb|left|440px|Timeline of the colleges compared with some events in British history.]]
Cambridge has 31 colleges, of which three, [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards]], [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] and [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]], admit women only. The other colleges are mixed, though most were originally all-male. [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin]] was the first college to admit both men and women, while [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill]], Clare, and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates, in 1972. In 1988 [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene]] became the last all-male college to accept women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,976477,00.html | title = Obituary â Professor Sir Bernard Williams|work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =8 May 2009 | date = 13 June 2003  | first=Jane | last=O'Grady}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]] and [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin]] admit only postgraduates, and [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge|Hughes Hall]], [[Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge|Lucy Cavendish]], [[St Edmund's College, Cambridge|St Edmund's]] and [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson]] admit only [[mature student|mature]] (i.e. 21 years or older on date of matriculation) students, including graduate students. All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students with no age restrictions.

Colleges are not required to admit students in all subjects, with some colleges choosing not to offer subjects such as architecture, history of art or theology, but most offer close to the complete range. Some colleges maintain a bias towards certain subjects, for example with Churchill leaning towards the sciences and engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/the_college/info/|title=Information about Churchill College|publisher=Churchill College|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's]] aim for a balanced intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/stcatharines/|title=About St. Catharine's College|accessdate=8 September 2008|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs to students (accommodation and food prices) vary considerably from college to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.homerton.cam.ac.uk/pdf/accom_guide.pdf|title=Homerton College Accommodation Guide|publisher=Homerton College|accessdate=13 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=112|title=Trinity College Accommodation Guide|publisher=Trinity College|accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others maintain much more informal reputations, such as for the students of King's College to hold left-wing political views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/prospective/prospectus/alternativeprospectus.pdf|format=PDF|title=Alternative Prospectus|publisher=Cambridge University Students' Union|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Robinson College]] and [[Churchill College]]'s attempts to minimise its environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuecs/current_projects/LT/downloads/07-08/VARSITY_LTarticle08.JPG|title=Survey ranks colleges by green credentials|publisher=Varsity|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several theological colleges in Cambridge, separate from Cambridge University, including [[Westcott House, Cambridge|Westcott House]], [[Westminster College, Cambridge|Westminster College]] and [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge|Ridley Hall Theological College]], that are, to a lesser degree, affiliated to the university and are members of the [[Cambridge Theological Federation]].

===Teaching===
Students are taught by a mixture of lectures, organised by the university departments, and supervisions, organised by the colleges.  (For science subjects, there are also laboratory sessions, organised by the departments.)  The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject.  Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students (usually between one and three) meet with a member of the teaching staff or a doctoral students.  Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of the supervision, which they will discuss with the supervisor during the session, along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week's lectures. The assignment is often an essay on a subject set by the supervisor, or an problem sheet set by the lecturer.  Depending on the subject and college, students might receive between one and four supervisions per week.  This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Cambridge and Oxford (where &quot;supervisions&quot; are known as &quot;tutorials&quot;)

The concept of grading students' work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named [[William Farish (professor)|William Farish]] at the University of Cambridge in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Postman|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Postman|title=[[Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology]]|year=1992|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-679-74540-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools, faculties and departments===
In addition to the 31 colleges, the university is made up of over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates and other institutions. Members of these are usually also members of one of the colleges and responsibility for running the entire academic programme of the university is divided amongst them.

[[Image:The Old Schools.JPG|thumb|upright=0.90|left|alt=The Old Schools |The entrance to the administrative centre of the university, the Old Schools.]]

A &quot;School&quot; in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory bodyâthe &quot;Council&quot; of the schoolâcomprising representatives of the constituent bodies. There are six schools:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/deptdirectory/moreinfo.html|title=About the Schools, Faculties &amp; Departments|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arts and Humanities
* Biological Sciences
* Clinical Medicine
* Humanities and Social Sciences
* Physical Sciences
* Technology

Teaching and research in Cambridge is organised by faculties. The faculties have different organisational sub-structures which partly reflect their history and partly their operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. In addition, a small number of bodies entitled 'Syndicates' have responsibilities for teaching and research, e.g. [[UCLES|Cambridge Assessment]], the [[Cambridge University Press|University Press]], and the [[Cambridge University Library|University Library]].

===Academic year===
The academic year is divided into three academic terms, determined by the Statutes of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=University of Cambridge Term dates |work=University of Cambridge |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/termdates.html |accessdate=19 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas Term]] lasts from October to December; [[Lent term|Lent Term]] from January to March; and [[Easter term|Easter Term]] from April to June.

Within these terms undergraduate teaching takes place within eight-week periods called [[Full Term]]s. These terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hepi.ac.uk/downloads/33TheacademicexperienceofstudentsinEnglishuniversities2007.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Academic Experience of Students in English Universities (2007 report)|publisher=Higher Education Policy Institute|last=Sastry |first=Tom|coauthors=Bekhradnia, Bahram |date=25 September 2007|pages=footnote 14|accessdate=4 November 2007|quote=Even within Russell Group institutions, it is remarkable how consistently Oxford and Cambridge appear to require more effort of their students than other universities. On the other hand, they have fewer weeks in the academic year than other universities, so the extent to which this is so may be exaggerated by these results.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter and Long Vacations).

===Central administration===
====Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor====
The office of [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor]] of the University, for which there are no term limits, is mainly ceremonial and is held by [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville]], following the retirement of the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on his 90th birthday in June, 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the official Nomination Board to succeed him,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2011051901]&lt;/ref&gt; and Abdul Arain, owner of a local grocery store, [[Brian Blessed]] and [[Michael Mansfield]] were also nominated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cambridgetab.co.uk/news/booming-blessed-to-bloom-as-chancellor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/17/abdul-arain-shopkeeper-cambridge-university-chancellor |title=Cambridge university chancellor race gets tasty as grocer joins in |accessdate=2011-06-26 |author=Caroline Davies |date=17 June 2011 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CamElectionNews&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/2011/06/21/election-for-the-office-of-chancellor/ |title=Election for the Office of Chancellor  |accessdate=2011-06-26  |date=21June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Cambridge Chancellor election, 2011|election]] took place on 14 and 15 October 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;CamElectionNews&quot;/&gt; David Sainsbury won the election taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, winning on the first count.  

The current [[Vice-Chancellor]] is [[Leszek Borysiewicz]]. While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor is the ''de facto'' principal administrative officer of the University. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by its own members,&lt;ref&gt;''Statute and Ordinances'', Historical Note: &quot;The University is ... consisting of a Chancellor, Masters and Scholars who from time out of mind have had the government of their members&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; with very little external representation on its governing body, the Regent House (though there is external representation on the Audit Committee, and there are four external members on the [[Cambridge University Council|University's Council]], who are the only external members of the Regent House).&lt;ref&gt;Grace 2 of 5 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Senate and the Regent House====
[[Image:CamLight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|alt= Light show on the Senate House, for the 800th anniversary of the foundation of the university| Light show on the Senate House, for the 800th anniversary of the foundation of the university.]]
The Senate consists of all holders of the [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree or higher degrees. It elects the Chancellor and the High Steward, and elected two members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] until the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]] was abolished in 1950. Prior to 1926, it was the University's governing body, fulfilling the functions that the [[Regent House]] fulfils today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/works/senate.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regent House is the University's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the University and the Colleges, together with the Chancellor, the [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]], the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes and Ordinances, 2007â2008&lt;/ref&gt; The public representatives of the Regent House are the two [[Proctor]]s, elected to serve for one year, on the nomination of the Colleges.

====Council and the General Board====
Although the [[Cambridge University Council|University Council]] is the principal executive and policy-making body of the University, therefore, it must report and be accountable to the [[Regent House]] through a variety of checks and balances. It has the right of reporting to the University, and is obliged to advise the Regent House on matters of general concern to the University. It does both of these by causing notices to be published by authority in the ''[[Cambridge University Reporter]]'', the official journal of the University. Since January 2005, the membership of the Council has included two external members,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2004-05/weekly/5984/1.html|title=Annual Report of the Council for 2003â04|work=Cambridge University Reporter|date=15 December 2004|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Regent House voted for an increase from two to four in the number of external members in March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Grace 2 of 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acta in the ''Reporter'', No 6107, publishing Results of Ballot&lt;/ref&gt; and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2007-08/weekly/6119/2.html|title=Statutes approved: Notice|work=Cambridge University Reporter|date=23 July 2008|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Senate House Passage in the snow.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Senate House Passage]] in the snow with Senate House on the right and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]] on the left.]]
The General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the academic and educational policy of the University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/current/weekly/6071/17.html|title=Developing governance by building on good practice: a green paper issued by the University Council|work=Cambridge University Reporter|date=25 April 2007|accessdate=8 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is accountable to the Council for its management of these affairs.

Faculty Boards are responsible to the General Board; other Boards and Syndicates are responsible either to the General Board (if primarily for academic purposes) or to the Council. In this way, the various arms of the University are kept under the supervision of the central administration, and thus the Regent House.

===Finances===
Cambridge is by far the wealthiest university in the UK and in the whole of Europe, with an endowment of Â£4.3 billion in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft.com&quot;&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f1126d04-c0fc-11df-99c4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1Yv4QeQ8w&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_universities_by_endowment&lt;/ref&gt;  This is made up of around Â£1.6 billion tied directly to the university and Â£2.7 billion to the colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft.com&quot;/&gt; As of 2011, Oxford had an endowment valued at around Â£3,3 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft.com&quot;/&gt; The university's operating budget is well over Â£1 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;The University of Cambridge. An 800th Anniversary Portrait, p295&lt;/ref&gt;
Each college is an independent charitable institution with its own endowment, separate from that of the central university endowment.
If ranked on a US university endowment table on most recent figures, Cambridge would rank fourth in a ranking compared with the eight Ivy League institutions (subject to market fluctuations).&lt;ref name=&quot;ft.com&quot;/&gt;

Comparisons between Cambridge's endowment and those of other top US universities are, however, inaccurate because being a state-funded public university (although the status of Cambridge as a public university can not be compared with US or European public universities as, for example, the state do not &quot;own&quot; the university), Cambridge receives a major portion of its income through education and research grants from the British Government. In 2006-7, it was reported that approximately one third of Cambridge's income comes from UK government funding for teaching and research, with another third coming from other research grants. Endowment income contributes around Â£130 million. The University also receives a significant income in annual transfers from the [[Cambridge University Press]], which is the oldest, and second largest university press in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/44%20Oxford%20and%20Cambridge%20summary.pdf|title=Oxford and Cambridge: How different they are?|work=report|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefactions and fundraising====
In 2000, [[Bill Gates]] of [[Microsoft]] donated US$210&amp;nbsp;million through the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] to endow the [[Gates Scholarships]] for students from outside the UK seeking postgraduate study at Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=17501190|title=Bill Gates, The Honorary Knight|date=26 January 2004 |publisher=Information Week|accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]], which taught the world's first computing course in 1953, is housed in a building partly funded by Gates and named after his father, William Gates.{{Citation needed|date= November 2008}}

In 2005, the Cambridge 800th Anniversary Campaign was launched, aimed at raising Â£1&amp;nbsp;billion by 2012âthe first US-style university fund-raising campaign in Europe. This aim was reached in the financial year 2009-2010, with raising Â£1.037 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaign.cam.ac.uk/?dp=2010061001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
===Libraries and museums===
[[Image:CamUniLibrary.JPG|thumb|upright=0.99|left|alt= The Cambridge University Library | The Cambridge University Library.]]
The university has 114 libraries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/facilities.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cambridge University Library]] is the central research library, which holds over 8&amp;nbsp;million volumes and, in contrast with the Bodleian or the British Library, many of its books are available on open shelves, and most books are borrowable. It is a legal deposit library, therefore it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland. It receives around 80,000 books every year, not counting the books donated to the library. In addition to the University Library and its dependent libraries, every faculty has a specialised library, which, on average, holds from 30,000 to 150,000 books; for example the History Faculty's [[Seeley Historical Library]] posess more than 100.000 books. Also, every college has a library as well, partially for the purposes of undergraduate teaching, and the older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example Trinity College's [[Wren Library, Cambridge]] has more than 200,000 books printed before 1800, while the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]] posess one of the greatest early medieval Anglo-Saxon manuscript collections in the World, with over 600 manuscripts. The total number of books owned by the university is about 12&amp;nbsp;million.

Cambridge University operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanic garden:

[[Image:Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, Cambridge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|right|alt= Museum of Archeology and Anthropology | The Museum of Archeology and Anthropology]]
* '''The [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]''', is the art and antiquities museum
* '''The [[Kettle's Yard]]''' is a contemporary art gallery
* '''The [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge]]''' houses the University's collections of local antiquities, together with archaeological and ethnographic artifacts from around the world
* '''The [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology]]'''
* '''The [[Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge]]'''
* '''The [[Whipple Museum of the History of Science]]'''
* '''The [[Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences]]''' is the geology museum of the University
* '''The [[Scott Polar Research Institute]]''' comprises the Polar Museum, dedicated to the Arctic and Antarctic exploration
* '''The [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden]]''' is the botanic garden of the university, created in 1831

===Research===
{{see also|Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge}}
Cambridge University has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines, and spends around  Â£650 million in a year for research. All research and lectures are conducted by University Departments. The colleges are in charge of giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several University sites around the city, and major expansion continues on a number of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/building/|title=Planning and Building|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge is a member of the [[Russell Group]], a network of research-led British universities; the [[Coimbra Group]], an association of leading European universities; the [[League of European Research Universities]]; and the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]]. It is also considered part of the [[Golden Triangle (UK universities)|&quot;Golden Triangle&quot;]], a geographical concentration of UK university research.

Building on its reputation for enterprise, science and technology, Cambridge has a partnership with [[MIT]] in the United States, the [[CambridgeâMIT Institute]].

===Admissions===
====Procedure====
The application system to Cambridge and Oxford involves additional requirements, with candidates typically called to face-to-face interviews.

How applicants perform in the interview process is an important factor in determining which students are accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;intguide&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/publications/interviews.pdf|format=PDF|title=Cambridge Interviews: the facts|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most applicants are expected to be predicted at least three A-grade [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or equivalent overseas qualifications, such as getting at least 7,7,6 for higher-level subjects at IB. The A* A-level grade (introduced in 2010) now plays a part in the acceptance of applications, with the university's standard offer for all courses being set at A*AA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/#alevels&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7946675.stm|title=Cambridge entry level is now A*AA|publisher=BBC News  | date=16 March 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a very high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, the interview process is crucial for distinguishing between the most able candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;intguide&quot; /&gt; In 2006, 5,228 students who were rejected went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 63% of all applicants rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/special/11/table3_1.pdf|title=Special No 11|work=Cambridge University Reporter|accessdate=8 September 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview is performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;intguide&quot; /&gt; For exceptional candidates, a ''Matriculation Offer'' is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or aboveâ[[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] is unusual in making this offer to about one-third of successful candidates, in order to relieve very able candidates of some pressure in their final year.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Applicants who are not successful at their college interview may be placed in the [[Winter Pool]] which is a process where strong applicants can be offered places by other colleges.

Graduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department relating to the applicant's subject. This effectively guarantees admission to a collegeâthough not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/gsprospectus/applying/next.html|title=Board of Graduate Studies admissions flowchart|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=8 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access====
Public debate in the United Kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit based and fair; whether enough students from [[State school#United Kingdom|state schools]] are encouraged to apply to Cambridge; and whether these students succeed in gaining entry. In 2007â08, 57% of all successful applicants were from [[State school#United Kingdom|state schools]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc08&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8083423.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Education &amp;#124; State school participation rate |publisher=BBC News  |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly 93 percent of all students in the UK attend state schools). However, the average qualifications for successful applicants from state schools are slightly lower than the average qualification of successful applicants from private schools.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on [[Oxbridge]]'s reputation for many years, and the University has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for Cambridge to help redress the imbalance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf|title=Report by the Sutton Trust|publisher=Sutton Trust|accessdate=8 September 2008|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624211305/http://www.suttontrust.com/reports/Stateschooladmissionstoourleadinguniversities.pdf |archivedate = 24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200203/ai_n9019732|title=A bias against excellence|work=The Spectator |location=UK |accessdate=8 September 2008 | first=Rachel | last=Johnson | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, and such applicants now form only a significant minority (43%)&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc08&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7036891.stm|title=Call for more university links|publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 September 2008 | date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the intake. In 2005, 32% of the 3599 applicants from independent schools were admitted to Cambridge, as opposed to 24% of the 6674 applications from state schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2005-06/special/11/table1-1.pdf|title=Special No 11|accessdate=8 September 2008|work=Cambridge University Reporter|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the University of Cambridge received a gift of Â£4m to improve its accessibility to candidates from maintained schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/article/default.aspx?objid=45639|title=Cambridge University given Â£4&amp;nbsp;million to support widening access|publisher=Cambridge Network|accessdate=8 September 2008|date=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge, together with Oxford and [[Durham University|Durham]], is among those universities that have adopted formulae that gives a rating to the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] performance of every school in the country to &quot;weight&quot; the scores of university applicants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article6350374.ece Timesonline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the University's central Student Union, and individual college student unions (JCRs) run student led Access schemes aimed at encouraging applications to the University from students at schools with little or no history of Oxbridge applications, and from students from families with little or no history of participation in university education.

In 2005, it was reported that Cambridge produces more PhDs per year than any other British university (over 30% more than second placed Oxford).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,,1575165,00.html|title=University figures show sharp research divide|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=8 September 2008|date=22 September 2005  | first=Donald | last=MacLeod}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a [[Thomson Scientific &amp; Healthcare|Thomson Scientific]] study showed that Cambridge has the highest research paper output of any British university, and is also the top research producer (as assessed by total paper citation count) in 10 out of 21 major British research fields analysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scientific.thomson.com/press/2006/8319732/|title=Thomson Scientific ranks UK research|publisher=Thomson Scientific|accessdate=8 September 2008|date=4 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published the same year by Evidence showed that Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university (coming first in three out of four broad discipline fields).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thes.co.uk/search/story.aspx?story_id=2033320|title=Report in the Times Higher Education Supplement|publisher=Times Higher Education Supplement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is also closely linked with the development of the high-tech [[business cluster]] in and around Cambridge, which forms the area known as [[Silicon Fen]] or sometimes the &quot;Cambridge Phenomenon&quot;. In 2004, it was reported that Silicon Fen was the second largest [[venture capital]] market in the world, after [[Silicon Valley]]. Estimates reported in February 2006 suggest that there were about 250 active [[startup company|startup companies]] directly linked with the university, worth around US$6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurs.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/news.htm|title=Cambridge University press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cambridge was ranked sixth in the world by the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]. In 2011 it came first, for a second time, in both the [[QS World University Rankings]] and the annual World's Best Universities by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World University Rankings&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2011-2012/top-400.html |title=World University Rankings|year=2010-11 |publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011|title=QS World University Rankings 2010 Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, according to University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urapcenter.org/2010|title=URAP â University Ranking by Academic Performance}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the 2nd university in UK and 11th university in the world. In the 2009 [[Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings|title=THE-QS World University Rankings 2009 Results}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in 2010 [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] and [[QS World University Rankings]] parted ways to produce separate rankings), Cambridge was ranked 2nd amongst world universities, behind [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. It came in first in the international academic reputation peer review, first in the [[natural science]]s, second in [[life sciences|biomedicine]], third in the [[humanities|arts &amp; humanities]], fourth in the [[social sciences]], and fourth in technology. The Independent Complete University Guide ranked Cambridge 2nd to Oxford in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = University League Table 2011&quot;. thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk. May&amp;nbsp;20, 2010. |url= http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/single.htm?ipg=8726.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] compiled by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], Cambridge was placed 5th amongst world universities and was ranked 1st in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2011|title= Academic Ranking of World Universities }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 ''[[Newsweek]]'' ranking which combined elements of the THES-QS and ARWU rankings with other factors that purportedly evaluated an institution's global &quot;openness and diversity&quot; suggested that Cambridge was ranked 6th in the world overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/|title=The Top 100 Global Universities|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=8 September 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522052332/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 Sunday Times University Guide, Cambridge was ranked first for the 11th straight year since the guide's first publication in 1998. In the 2008 Times Good University Guide, Cambridge topped 37 of the guide's 61 subject tables, including Law, Medicine, Economics, [[Mathematics]], Engineering, [[Physics]], and [[Chemistry]] and has the best record on research, entry standards and graduate destinations amongst UK universities. Cambridge was also awarded the University of the Year award.

In the 2009 The Times Good University Guide Subject Rankings, Cambridge was ranked top (or joint top) in 34 out of the 42 subjects which it offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/tol_gug/gooduniversityguide.php|title=The Times Good University Guide Subject Rankings|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=26 November 2008  | first1=Roland | last1=Watson | first2=Francis | last2=Elliott | first3=Patrick | last3=Foster}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall ranking placed Cambridge in 2nd behind Oxford. The 2009 Guardian University Guide Rankings also placed Cambridge 2nd in the UK behind Oxford.

In the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] newspaper's 2012 rankings, Cambridge pulled ahead of Oxford to secure 1st place in the league table. Cambridge had overtaken Oxford in philosophy, law, politics, theology, maths, classics, anthropology and modern languages in the Guardian subject rankings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shepherd&quot;/&gt;

===Publishing===
The University's publishing arm, the [[Cambridge University Press]], is the oldest printer and publisher in the world, and it is the second largest university press in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/press/timeline.asp|title=Press Release|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public examinations===
The university set up its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858. Today, the syndicate, which is known as [[Cambridge Assessment]], is Europe's largest assessment agency and it plays a leading role in researching, developing and delivering assessments across the globe. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Graduation===
[[Image:Cambridge University graduation enter Senate House.jpg|thumb|left|Graduands enter the [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]] at a graduation ceremony]]
At the University of Cambridge, each graduation is a separate act of the university's governing body, the [[Regent House]], and must be voted on as with any other act. A formal meeting of the Regent House, known as a [[Congregation (university)|''Congregation'']], is held for this purpose.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Graduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academical dress that they were entitled to before graduating: for example, most students becoming Bachelors of Arts wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a postgraduate degree (e.g. PhD or Master's) wear the academical dress that they were entitled to before graduating, only if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree is from another university, they wear the academical dress of the degree that they are about to receive, the BA gown without the strings if they are under 24 years of age, or the MA gown without strings if they are 24 and over.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Graduands are presented in the Senate House college by college, in order of foundation or recognition by the university (except for the royal colleges),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/ceremony/ Degrees: The Ceremony]&lt;/ref&gt; as follows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2000-01/weekly/5852/37.html June 2001 graduation list]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cam degree ceremony.jpg|thumb|150px|University officials leading the graduands into the Senate House]]
During the congregation, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their college, who takes them by the right hand, and presents them to the vice-chancellor for the degree they are about to take. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting &quot;____&quot; with the name of the degree:
 
:&quot;'''Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum _____; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.'''
:(Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.)&quot;

and female graduands with the following:

:&quot;'''Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hanc mulierem quam scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneam ad gradum assequendum ____; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.'''
:(Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this woman whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.)&quot;

After presentation, the graduand is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statementâthe ''Trinitarian formula'' (in italics) may be omitted at the request of the graduand:

:&quot;'''Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum ____'', in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti''.'''
:(By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of ____'', in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit''.)&quot;

The now-graduate then rises, bows and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door, where he or she receives his or her certificate, into Senate House passage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/univ/degrees/ceremony/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|[http://www.cam.ac.uk/societies/ University website list of societies]}}

===Sports===
Cambridge maintains a long tradition of student participation in sport and recreation. [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]] is a particularly popular sport at Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges, notably the [[bumps race]]s, and against Oxford, the [[Boat Race]]. There are also [[Varsity match]]es against Oxford in many other sports, ranging from [[cricket]] and [[rugby union|rugby]], to [[chess]] and [[tiddlywinks]]. Athletes representing the university in certain sports entitle them to apply for a [[Cambridge Blue]] at the discretion of the ''Blues Committee'', consisting of the captains of the thirteen most prestigious sports. There is also the self-described &quot;unashamedly elite&quot; [[Hawks' Club|Hawksâ Club]], which is for men only, whose membership is usually restricted to Cambridge Full Blues and Half Blues.

===Student organisations===
The Cambridge University Student Union&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/ Cam.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; is the overall Student Union organisation. However, the [[Cambridge Union]] serves as a focus for debating. Drama societies notably include the [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club|Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC)]] and the comedy club [[Footlights]], which are known for producing well-known show-business personalities. Student newspapers include the long-established ''[[Varsity (newspaper)|Varsity]]'' and its younger rival, ''[[The Cambridge Student]].'' In the last year, both have been challenged by the emergence of ''[[The Tab]]'', Cambridge's first student [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. The student-run radio station, [[Cam FM]], provides members with an opportunity to produce and host weekly radio shows and promotes broadcast journalism, sports coverage, comedy and drama.

The Cambridge University [[Chamber Orchestra]] explores a range of programmes, from popular symphonies to lesser known works. Membership of the orchestra is composed of students of the university and it has also attracted a variety of conductors and soloists, including [[Wayne Marshall (conductor)|Wayne Marshall]], [[Jane Glover]], and [[Nicholas Cleobury]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Cambridge is also home to a number of recreational outdoor societies, such as the [[Cambridge University Punting Society]].

Over the course of its history, Cambridge University has built up a sizeable number of alumni who are notable in their fields, both academic, and in the wider world. Depending on criteria, affiliates of the University of Cambridge have won between 85 and 88 [[Nobel prize]]s, more than any other institution according to [[Nobel laureates by university affiliation|some counts]]. Former undergraduates of the university have won a grand total of 61 Nobel prizes, 13 more than the undergraduates of any other university. Cambridge academics have also won 8 [[Fields Medal]]s and 2 [[Abel Prize]]s (since the award was first distributed in 2003).

Perhaps most of all, the university is renowned for a long and distinguished tradition in mathematics and the sciences.

Among the most famous of Cambridge natural philosophers is [[Sir Isaac Newton]], who spent the majority of his life at the university and conducted many of his now famous experiments within the grounds of Trinity College. [[Sir Francis Bacon]], responsible for the development of the [[Scientific Method]], entered the university when he was just twelve, and pioneering mathematicians [[John Dee]] and [[Brook Taylor]] soon followed.

Other ground-breaking mathematicians to have studied at the university include [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]], [[John Edensor Littlewood|Littlewood]] and [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], three of the most renowned [[pure mathematics|pure mathematicians]] in modern history; [[Sir Michael Atiyah]], one of the most important mathematicians of the last half-century; [[William Oughtred]], the inventor of the [[logarithmic scale]]; [[John Wallis]], the inventor of modern [[calculus]]; [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]], the self-taught genius who made incomparable contributions to [[mathematical analysis]], [[number theory]], [[infinite series]] and [[continued fractions]]; and, perhaps most importantly of all, [[James Clerk Maxwell]], who is considered to have brought about the second great unification of Physics (the first being accredited to Newton) with his classical [[electromagnetic theory]].[[Image:Charles Darwin by G. Richmond.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Charles Darwin]]]]

In biology, [[Charles Darwin]], famous for developing the theory of [[natural selection]], was a Cambridge man. Subsequent Cambridge biologists include [[Francis Crick]] and [[James Watson]], who worked out a model for the three-dimensional structure of [[DNA]] whilst working at the university's [[Cavendish Laboratory]] along with leading X-ray crystallographer [[Maurice Wilkins]] and [[Rosalind Franklin]]. More recently, [[Ian Wilmut|Sir Ian Wilmut]], the man who was responsible for the first cloning of a mammal with [[Dolly the Sheep]] in 1996, was a graduate student at Darwin College. Famous naturalist and broadcaster [[David Attenborough]] graduated from the university, while the ethologist [[Jane Goodall]], the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees did a PhD in Cambridge without having a first degree.

The university can be considered the birthplace of the computer, with mathematician [[Charles Babbage]] having designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. [[Alan Turing]] went on to devise what is essentially the basis for modern computing and [[Maurice Wilkes]] later created the first programmable computer. The [[webcam]] was also invented at Cambridge University, as a means for scientists to avoid interrupting their research and going all the way down to the laboratory dining room only to be disappointed by an empty coffee pot.

[[Image:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]], generally regarded as the father of [[nuclear physics]], spent much of his life at the university, where he worked closely with the likes of [[Niels Bohr]], a major contributor to the understanding of the structure and function of the [[atom]], [[J. J. Thompson]], discoverer of the [[electron]], [[Sir James Chadwick]], discoverer of the [[neutron]], and [[John Cockcroft|Sir John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], the partnership responsible for first splitting the atom. [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], leader of the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the [[atomic bomb]], also studied at Cambridge under Rutherford and Thompson.

Astronomers [[Sir John Herschel]] and [[Sir Arthur Eddington]] both spent much of their careers at Cambridge, as did [[Paul Dirac]], the discoverer of [[antimatter]] and one of the pioneers of [[Quantum Mechanics]]; [[Stephen Hawking]], the founding father of the study of [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] and the university's long-serving [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]]; and [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Lord Martin Rees]], the current [[Astronomer Royal]] and Master of Trinity College.

[[File:John Maynard Keynes.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[John Maynard Keynes]]]]
Other significant Cambridge scientists include [[Henry Cavendish]], the discoverer of [[Hydrogen]]; [[Frank Whittle]], co-inventor of the jet engine; [[Lord Kelvin]], who formulated the original [[Laws of Thermodynamics]]; [[William Fox Talbot]], who invented the camera, [[Alfred North Whitehead]], Einstein's major opponent; [[Jagadish Chandra Bose|Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose]], the man dubbed &quot;the father of radio science&quot;; [[Lord Rayleigh]], one of the most pre-eminent physicists of the 20th century; [[Georges LemaÃ®tre]], who first proposed the [[Big Bang]] Theory; and [[Frederick Sanger]], the last man to win two Nobel prizes.

In the humanities, Greek studies were inaugurated at Cambridge in the early sixteenth century by [[Desiderius Erasmus]] during the few years he held a professorship there; seminal contributions to them were made by [[Richard Bentley]] and [[Richard Porson]].  [[John Chadwick]] was associated with [[Michael Ventris]] in the decipherment of Linear B.  The eminent Latinist [[A. E. Housman]] taught at Cambridge but is more widely known as a poet.  [[Simon Ockley]] made a significant contribution to Arabic studies.

Distinguished Cambridge academics in other fields include economists such as [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Alfred Marshall]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Joan Robinson]], [[Piero Sraffa]], and [[Amartya Sen]], another former Master of Trinity College.
