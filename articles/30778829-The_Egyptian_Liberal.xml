==History==
The group began in the late 1980s among small circles of students influenced by [[Trotskyism]]. Adopting the current name by April 1995, the RS grew from a few active members, when the Egyptian left was very much underground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a couple of hundred by the [[Second Intifada|Second Palestinian Intifada]]. Despite not being able to freely organise under [[Egyptian President|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate=1 March 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group's membership still increased due to their participation in the Palestinian solidarity movement. The intifada was seen to have a radicalising effect on Egyptian youth, which in turn helped to re-establish [[grass roots]] activism, which had long been repressed under the Mubarak regime.&lt;ref name=Revolutionary/&gt;

The RS' relationship with the outlawed [[Muslim Brotherhood]] is also distinct from earlier leftist organisations in Egypt which held similar positions to that of the [[Egyptian Communist Party]], which generally equated [[Islamism]] with [[fascism]]. The RS however, advanced the slogan &quot;Sometimes with the Islamists, never with the [[State (polity)|state]]&quot;. The slogan was coined by [[Chris Harman]] of the [[Socialist Workers Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], in his book, ''The Prophet and the Proletariat'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated into [[Arabic]], and widely distributed by the RS in 1997. The RS has thus been able to campaign alongside the Brotherhood at times, for example, during the pro-intifada and anti-war movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The RS, along with the rest of the Egyptian [[far left]] and the [[April 6 Youth Movement]], played a key role in mobilising for January 25, 2011, marking the first day of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|Egyptian Revolution]]. The various forces previously met and developed strategies, such as demonstrating in different parts of [[Cairo]] simultaneously, before marching on [[Tahrir Square, Cairo|Tahrir Square]], to avoid a concentration of security forces.&lt;ref name=conversation/&gt;

The RS later issued a statement calling on Egyptian workers to instigate a [[general strike]] in the hope of finally ousting Mubarak:

:''The regime can afford to wait out the sit-ins and demonstrations for days and weeks, but it cannot last beyond a few hours if workers use strikes as a weapon. Strike on the railways, on public transport, the airports and large industrial companies! Egyptian workers, on behalf of the rebellious youth and on behalf of the blood of our martyrs, join the ranks of the revolution, use your power and victory will be ours!

:''Glory to the martyrs!
:''Down with the system!
:''All power to the people!
:''Victory to the revolution! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Gigi Ibrahim]], an RS activist, claimed the revolution had been brewing since the Second Intifada of 2000.&lt;ref name=gigi/&gt;

==Post Mubarak==
In the aftermath of Mubarak's resignation as President, the RS is calling for [[permanent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the [[proletariat|working class]], particularly of Cairo, [[Alexandria (Egypt)|Alexandria]] and [[Mansoura]] were the key players in ousting Mubarak, rather than the Egyptian youths' use of [[social networking]] sites, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], as has been widely reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2011, RS activist and journalist [[Hossam el-Hamalawy]] was among many protesters who stormed and seized offices of the [[State Security Investigations Service]] in [[Nasr City]]. The building had been used prior to the revolution to detain and [[torture]] many activists. El-Hamalawy was able to visit the cell where he had been imprisoned, later writing on his Twitter feed that he could not stop crying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The RS calls for the dismantling of the ruling [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Military Council]], the [[Egyptian Army|army]] and [[Law enforcement in Egypt|police force]], and for Mubarak and his former regime, including [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] and [[Sami Hafez Anan]], (who currently form part of the Military Council) to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The RS along with many other Egyptian leftist organisations are also seeking to establish a new [[vanguard party|workers party]] in the wake of Mubarak's downfall.&lt;ref name=conversation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of such a party in Egypt is still illegal under the current government with the new [[Political Parties Law]] issued on March 29, 2011,  where the establishment of [[Social class|class]]-based parties is strictly prohibited. [[Kamal Khalil]] - a leading RS member - responded by saying they are not concerned of the legality of the party: &quot;We don't want a party based on paper, we want a party based in factories and workplaces&quot;.&lt;ref name=labor/&gt;

On May 10th, 2011, the RS along with four other left-wing Egyptian groups united to form a &quot;socialist front&quot; called the [[Coalition of Socialist Forces]], which includes the [[Popular Democratic Alliance Party]], [[The Socialist Party of Egypt]], the [[Egyptian Communist Party]] and the [[Workers Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Positions on international issues==
In 2006, [[Sameh Naguib]] - a leading RS member - labeled [[Hezbollah]]'s defeat of the [[Israeli Defense Forces|Israeli Defence Forces]] in the [[2006 Lebanon War|Lebanon War]] &quot;a very important victory for the [[anti-war movement]] worldwide&quot;, claiming it prevented or delayed [[US]] and [[Israel]]i plans to attack [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On March 2, 2011, during the US [[2011 Wisconsin budget protests|Wisconsin budget protests]], the RS sent a message of solidarity to the US [[International Socialist Organization]], urging them to build &quot;a revolutionary socialist alternative&quot; against &quot;[[Zionism]] and [[imperialism]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The RS were amongst many socialists who condemned the [[Robert Mugabe]] regime of [[Zimbabwe]] for arresting and torturing [[militant]]s, amongst who were members of Zimbabwe's [[International Socialist Organisation (Zimbabwe)|International Socialist Organisation]], for hosting a meeting discussing the revolutions in [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisia]] and [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]]. They said &quot;[t]he masses in Tunisia and Egypt have proven that no matter how long [[Autocracy|autocratic regimes]] last, the revolution's earthquake can break the walls and dams. Be sure that the earthquake is coming and that Mugabe will fall--&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On March 20, 2011, during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan uprising]], the RS condemned the [[UN Security Council]], the [[European Union]] and the [[Obama Administration]] on their decision to implement a [[No-Fly Zone]] and [[Peacekeeping|foreign military intervention]] in [[Libya]] as &quot;part of the counter-revolution.&quot; They accused them of remaining silent &quot;for decades while [[Gaddafi]], and his like among the [[Arab world|Arab regimes]], suppressed their people with the utmost brutality and piled up wealth... so long as these regimes implemented the recommendations of the [[International Monetary Fund]] for the abolition of any [[Welfare|social support]] for the poor... as long as companies kept open their doors to global [[capitalism]]...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
