==Name origin==
'Point Breeze' was originally the name given to a spot on the west side of the [[Schuylkill River]]. Point Breeze Avenue then became the road that cut southwest to provide access to the spot from what was at the time Philadelphia proper. The avenue cuts diagonally through the neighborhood's rectilinear street grid.

==Social issues==
The Point Breeze neighborhood suffered from abandonment and population decline throughout the mid 20th century. Today it is a neighborhood under revitalization from efforts steered by South Philadelphia H.O.M.E.S. Inc. and the Point Breeze Community Development Coalition Inc., in addition to such organizations as Neighbors in Action, Universal Companies, Point Breeze Business Association, Point Breeze Pioneers greening group and other prominent Philadelphia organizations.  The families, business owners and friends of Point Breeze are gradually working toward a safer, greener community.  With the assets of Point Breeze Ave., Chew Playground and Wharton Park, combined with the location nearly 1.5&amp;nbsp;mi south of [[Rittenhouse Square]], this area is bound to become a great community for Philadelphia residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philaplanning.org/cpdiv/NTI_Yr2_FactSheets/PointBreeze.html Fact Sheet - Point Breeze&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
