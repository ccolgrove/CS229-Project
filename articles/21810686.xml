'''Louis Joseph Freeh''' (born  January 6, 1950) was the 5th [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Director]] of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], serving from September 1993 to June 2001.

Freeh began his career as an agent of the FBI, and was later an assistant [[United States Attorney]] and a [[United States district court]] judge, the position he held when appointed FBI director. He is now a lawyer and consultant in the private sector. He acquired Italian citizenship on October 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ambwashingtondc.esteri.it/Ambasciata_Washington/Archivio_News/Freeh_Cittadinanza.htm | title=Louis Freeh acquires Italian citizenship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Born January 6, 1950 in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], Louis Freeh was educated by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Rutgers University]] in 1971. He received a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Rutgers School of Law-Newark]] in 1974 and an [[LL.M.]] degree in criminal law from [[New York University School of Law]] in 1984. Freeh was an FBI [[Special Agent]] from 1975 to 1981 in the New York City field office and at F.B.I. Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In 1981, he joined the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York]] as an assistant U.S. attorney. Subsequently, he held positions there as Chief of the Organized Crime Unit, Deputy U.S. Attorney, and Associate U.S. Attorney. He was also a first lieutenant in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fbi.gov/libref/directors/freeh.htm | title=Federal Bureau of Investigation-Directors, Then and Now | date = | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher = Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060607173306/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/directors/freeh.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, President [[George H. W. Bush]] appointed Freeh a judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], a position he held until he was appointed FBI director by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993. As a youth, Freeh became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1963 and in 1995 was awarded the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] by the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/02-529.pdf |title = Distinguished Eagle Scouts |publisher = Scouting.org|accessdate = 2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;freeheagle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |title=The FBI Encyclopedia |publisher=McFarland &amp; Co |location=Jefferson, NC |year=2003 |isbn=0786417188 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeh and his wife, Marilyn, have 6 sons. He is a devout [[Roman Catholic]], although is not a member of the [[Opus Dei]] prelature (as rumors have stated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicleague.org/research/opusdei_factandfiction.htm | title=Opus Dei: Fact and Fiction | date=June 11, 2006 | publisher=Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0510.baumann.html | title=Let There Be Light: A look inside the hidden world of Opus Dei | author=Paul Baumann | date=October/November 2005 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=Washington Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Bureau and the Mole'', a book by [[David A. Vise]], Freeh's son was enrolled at the private [[The Heights School (Maryland)|The Heights School]] in [[Potomac, Maryland]], which Vise describes as &quot;an Opus Dei academy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bureauandthemole.com/from_book.php | title=Excerpt frcom The Bureau and the Mole | publisher=The Bureau and the Mole | accessdate=2006-09-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060818042638/http://www.bureauandthemole.com/from_book.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his sons are now enrolled in [[Archmere Academy]], a Catholic school in [[Claymont, Delaware]]. One of his sons currently attends [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, DC]].

===&quot;Pizza Connection&quot; case===
A notable case Freeh was associated with was the &quot;[[Pizza Connection Trial|Pizza Connection]]&quot; investigation, in which he was lead prosecutor. The case, prosecuted in the mid-1980s, involved a [[drug trafficking]] operation in the United States by [[Sicily|Sicilian]] organized crime members who used [[pizza parlor]]s as fronts. After a 14-month trial, 16 of 17 co-defendants were convicted. The &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; case was, at the time, the most complex criminal investigation ever undertaken by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fbi.gov/libref/directors/freeh.htm | title=Federal Bureau of Investigation-Directors, Then and Now | author = FBI | date = | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher = FBI |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060607173306/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/directors/freeh.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major events during Freeh's tenure as F.B.I. Director==
Shortly before and during Freeh's tenure, the FBI was involved in a number of high-profile incidents and internal investigations.

===Civil liberties===
Among other [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials (including Attorney General Reno), Freeh was named a co-defendant in ''[[Zieper v. Metzinger]]'', a 1999 federal court case. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] assisted the plaintiffs who sued due to the FBI's conduct in investigating &quot;Military Takeover of New York City&quot;, a short (fictional) film made in October 1999 that discussed riots and a military takeover of [[Times Square]] on New Year's Eve, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15610lgl19991222.html | title=ACLU's Complaint in Zieper v. Metzinger | date=December 22, 1999 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2000, he reached an agreement with Rep. [[JosÃ© Enrique Serrano|JosÃ© Serrano]], then [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] senator [[Manuel RodrÃ­guez Orellana]] and then Puerto Rico Senate Committee on Federal Affairs chairman [[Kenneth McClintock]], the islands' current Senate President, to release FBI files on Puerto Rican political activists. Nearly 100,000 pages have been released and are being catalogued by the Office of Legislative Services of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oslpr.org/english/master.asp?NAV=FBI | title=FBI Puerto Rico Political Persecution Files center at PR Office of Legislative Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In testimony to the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], Freeh said that the widespread use of effective [[encryption]] &quot;is one of the most difficult problems for law enforcement as the next century approaches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cpi.seas.gwu.edu/library/current_news/crypwar.html | title=What is Really at Stake? | date=February 8, 2000 | author=Chris Hekimian | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=Cyberspace Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered the loss of [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]]ping to law enforcement as a result of encryption to be dangerous and said that the &quot;country [would] be unable to protect itself&quot; against terrorism and serious crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://osaka.law.miami.edu/~froomkin/articles/clipper.htm | title= The Metaphor is the Key: Cryptography, The Clipper Chip, and the Constitution | year=1995 | author=A. Michael Froomkin | publisher=University of Miami School of Law | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruby Ridge===

{{Main|Ruby Ridge}} 

An investigation of the August 1992 incident at [[Ruby Ridge, Idaho]], in which an FBI sharpshooter killed the wife of [[Randy Weaver|a wanted suspect]], was ongoing when Freeh became Director. A [[paramilitary]] FBI unit, the [[Hostage Rescue Team (FBI)|Hostage Rescue Team]], was present at the incident; Freeh later said that had he been director, he would not have involved the HRT. FBI sniper [[Lon Horiuchi]] was later charged with [[manslaughter]]; Freeh said that he was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; at the charges, filed by a [[Boundary County, Idaho|county]] prosecutor and later dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9708/21/ruby.ridge.late/ | title=Both sides decry new Ruby Ridge charges | date=August 21, 1997 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=CNN |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080115082342/http://www.cnn.com/US/9708/21/ruby.ridge.late/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/0211/chapter5.htm | title=A Review of Allegations of a Double Standard of Discipline at the FBI (Chapter 5) | date=November 15, 2002 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tech.mit.edu/V115/N50/freeh.50w.html | title=Freeh Says FBI Actions at Ruby Ridge Were 'Flawed' | date=October 20, 1995 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=The Washington Post and &quot;The Tech&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freeh was not [[censure]]d for alleged managerial failures in the investigation of the incident, although a Justice Department inquiry had made such a recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A1EFC3A580C758CDDA10894D9404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fF%2fFreeh%2c%20Louis%20J%2e | title=Freeh Was Spared Censure For Handling of Ruby Ridge | date=August 6, 2001 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=The New York Times | first=David | last=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waco===

{{Main|Waco Siege}} 

An investigation of the events of April 19, 1993 when Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) Special Agents served a warrant on the [[Branch Davidian]] compound at [[Waco, Texas]] was ongoing during Freeh's tenure. While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and [[Janet Reno]], then-[[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]]. Reno, who had herself been blamed for mishandling of the confrontation and investigation, sent [[United States Marshal|U.S. Marshal]]s to FBI headquarters to seize Waco-related evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/090399waco-fbi.html | title=Tension Between Reno and Freeh Reaches Breaking Point on Waco | date=September 3, 1999 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khobar Towers bombing===

{{Main|Khobar Towers}} 

Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, members of a terorrist group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the [[King Abdul Aziz Airbase]]. Inside the building were almost exclusively members of the [[U.S. Air Force]] who were there to patrol the southern Iraqi [[no-fly zone]] enacted after the [[Gulf War]]. In the attack, 19 U.S. military personnel were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack on Americans abroad since the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]]. Louis Freeh said in his book ''My FBI'' that he felt the deepest about the Khobar Towers investigation, and it was not until Louis Freeh's last day in office, June 21, 2001, a federal [[grand jury]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] returned a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the Khobar Towers attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freeh |first=Louis |title=My FBI|origyear=2005 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-32189-9 |chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just before some of the counts would have expired due to a five-year statute of limitations. In the book Freeh maintains that he was obstructed by the Clinton Administration for political reasons in investigating the bombing and bringing the terrorist to justice.

===Centennial Olympic Park bombing===

{{Main|Centennial Olympic Park bombing}} 

The [[U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information]] heard testimony from Freeh regarding the leaking of [[Richard Jewell]]'s name to the media in connection with the bombing at the [[1996 Olympic Games]]. Freeh testified that he did not know how the name of Jewell, who had been falsely accused in the bombings, had been leaked to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/19/fbi.media.leaks/ | title=FBI chief can't explain media leaks in Olympic bombing | date=December 19, 1996 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montana Freemen===

{{Main|Montana Freemen}} 

Freeh and the FBI were praised for the handling of the 81-day [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] between law enforcement agents and the Montana Freemen, a fringe political group. Director [[Abraham Foxman]] of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which had issued reports critical of the Freemen and encouraged their prosecution, commended the &quot;peaceful conclusion&quot; to the standoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adl.org/presrele/Militi_71/2760_71.asp | title=ADL APPLAUDS FBI FOR PEACEFUL END TO FREEMEN STANDOFF | date=June 14, 1996 | publisher=Anti-Defamation League | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unabomber===

{{Main|Unabomber}} 

[[Theodore Kaczynski]], the &quot;Unabomber,&quot; was apprehended in 1996 after his [[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|manifesto]], ''Industrial Society and its Future'', was published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]''. Freeh and Attorney General Reno recommended publication, acceding to Kaczynski's offer to &quot;renounce terrorism&quot; if it were. A tip from the bomber's brother David, who recognized the writing style, assisted the FBI in his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9509/unabomber/09-19/am/ | title=Post, Times publish Unabomber's manifesto | date=September 19, 1995 | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.decsn.htm | title=Unabomber Manuscript is Published | date=September 19, 1995 | publisher=The Washington Post | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Hanssen===

{{Main|Robert Hanssen}} 

Robert Hanssen, a 25-year veteran of the FBI, was arrested in 2001 and charged with spying for the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]], beginning in 1985. Freeh called the security breach &quot;exceptionally grave&quot; and appointed a panel, led by former FBI and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[William H. Webster|William Webster]], to review the damage done by Hanssen's espionage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99997,00.html | title=Their Man in Washington | author = Frank Pellegrini | publisher=Time Magazine | accessdate=2006-06-11 | date=February 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wen Ho Lee===

{{Main|Wen Ho Lee}}

In 1999, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] scientist Wen Ho Lee was fired from his job; in 1999 he was arrested and held without trial for 278 days while his handling of sensitive nuclear information was investigated. Freeh accused him of downloading a &quot;portable, personal trove&quot; of U.S. nuclear secrets. Lee pled guilty to one of the fifty-nine counts brought against him, after which he was freed from jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/09/26/national/main236342.shtml | title=Justice Dept. Says Lee's No Hero | date=September 26, 2000 | accessdate=2006-06-11 | publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Justice Department report of the investigation of Lee said that Director Freeh was not fully informed about the investigation until over a year after it began, and that the F.B.I. as a whole &quot;bungled&quot; the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A623-2001Aug26&amp;notFound=true | title=Report Details More FBI Blunders in Wen Ho Lee Probe | date=August 27, 2001 | publisher = The Washington Post | accessdate=2006-06-11 | first=Dan | last=Eggen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese political and campaign fundraising controversies===

{{Main|1996 United States campaign finance controversy|Timeline of Cox Report controversy}}

In February 1997, the media announced that Freeh personally blocked the sharing of intelligence information regarding [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s alleged plot to influence U.S. elections with the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D17F93A5F0C768EDDAA0894DF494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fF%2fFreeh%2c%20Louis%20J%2e | title=F.B.I.

In his memo he wrote: &quot;It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an Independent Counsel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Freeh Says Reno Clearly Misread Prosecutor Law&quot;, Neil A. Lewis, New York Times June 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Reno rejected his request.

===Other cases===
Other cases handled by the FBI during Freeh's tenure included the death of White House counsel [[Vince Foster]] (in 1993), allegations of incompetence at the FBI crime laboratory, investigation of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] (1995) and the capture and prosecution of [[Timothy McVeigh]], and investigation of the crash of [[TWA Flight 800]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

==Criticism==
In 2000, the editorial staff of ''[[Business Week]]'' called for the resignation of Director Freeh, citing the [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]] communications monitoring system, the Waco cover-up, and [[insubordination]] to Attorney General Reno as reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2000/nf20000918_906.htm | title=The Case against Louis Freeh | date=September 18, 2000 | publisher=Business Week | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A National Geographic television special titled &quot;The FBI&quot; stated that Mr. Freeh was averse to the usage of computers.  He had his removed from his office, did not use E-mail, and more importantly, did nothing to update the old and poorly working FBI computer system.

==Resignation==
In June 2001, he resigned amid criticism that the FBI needed stronger leadership, particularly after allegations of spying by [[Robert Hanssen]]. Upon his resignation, he was praised by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], who called him &quot;a model law enforcement officer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/05/11/national/main290728.shtml | title=Another Blow To The Bureau | date=May 13, 2001 | publisher=CBS News | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was replaced by [[Thomas J. Pickard]] who served for 71 days, who was in turn replaced by [[Robert Mueller]].

==Post-FBI==
Freeh approached acting New Jersey Governor [[Donald DiFrancesco]], and offered to serve, without salary, as the state's anti-terrorism &quot;czar&quot;. Di Francesco approached both major-party candidates for governor to secure their approval; [[Bret Schundler]], the Republican candidate, agreed &quot;in principle&quot;. However, Democrat [[Jim McGreevey]], who won the gubernatorial election, turned down Freeh in favor of [[Golan Cipel]]. It was later discovered that McGreevey and Cipel had been involved in a sexual relationship. McGreevey was heavily criticized for giving the post to Cipel rather than Freeh or another experienced individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trentonian.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12710180&amp;BRD=1697&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=44551&amp;rfi=6 | title=Freeh snubbed in favor of Cipel  | date=August 17, 2004 | publisher=The Trentonian | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2001, Freeh was appointed to the [[board of directors]] of credit card issuer [[MBNA]]; he also served as the bank's [[general counsel]], as well as corporate secretary and ethics officer. Likewise, [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] elected him to its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-care-hospitals/20050913/NYTU18113092005-1.html | title=Bristol-Myers Squibb Names Louis J. Freeh to Board of Directors | date=September 13, 2003 | publisher=PR Newswire | accessdate=2006-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
