'''''Monkey Dust''''' is a British [[satire|satirical]] cartoon, notorious for its [[dark humour]] and handling of taboo topics such as murder, suicide and [[paedophilia]]. There were three series broadcast on [[BBC Three]] between 2003 and 2005. Following co-creator [[Harry Thompson]]'s death, no further series were made.

==Episodes==
Each episode featured animation by several different companies including [[Slinky Pictures]], [[Nexus Productions]], [[Sherbet Animation]] (of which [[Mr Bingo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modularpeople.com/03/mod_people/designers/mrbingo/mrbingo.htm Mr Bingo at Modular People] }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a part) and [[Caroline Mabey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The episodes are untitled but instead are known by the characters introduced or the one-off sketches included. The principal writers and creators of the series were [[Harry Thompson]] and [[Shaun Pye]], although other contributors were responsible for a significant proportion of the work; sometimes collaborating with Thompson and/or Pye; sometimes contributing fully formed sketches to the show. A short overview of the main characters, called a [[nocturne]], set in the various characters' bedrooms with no dialogue and a depressing accompanying song, usually precedes the final section.

==Music==
The animation in each episode is accompanied by contemporary music which helps the transition between scenes. Numerous songs by [[Goldfrapp]], [[Boards of Canada]] and [[Black Box Recorder (band)|Black Box Recorder]]. The theme music for all three series is by [[Eels (band)|Eels]] (&quot;That's Not Really Funny&quot; from ''[[Souljacker]]'').

The inclusion of music from Goldfrapp during the first series would have pre-dated the commercial release of their debut album, but production on the series took so long that by the time of airing, Goldfrapp were about to release their second album and the songs included in ''Monkey Dust'' were fairly well known. Thompson and Pye comment on this in the Series 1 [[Audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary]].

Also [[River Styx (musician)|River Styx]] contributed a song he wrote and produced in collaboration with singer Rosamund Daegenhardt. It appeared in series 3, episode 6.

The background music for the Saint Stephens Hospital sketches in series three is &quot;Ivory Blush&quot; by K-West. [http://www1.playdedgood.com/pages/viewcd/viewcd.cfm?cdnum=16]

==Release==
On 8 November 2004, the first series of ''Monkey Dust'' was released in the UK on [[DVD]]. Several musical substitutions had to be made from the television airing (where the [[BBC]] is allowed to play any commercial release without permission), as artists such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]] would not allow their work to be used on the DVD. Cover versions of the original songs were used instead.

The second and third series were broadcast on [[BBC Two]] and [[BBC Three]] respectively. Only the first series of Monkey Dust was commercially released on DVD, however in September 2009 eight episodes from across series 2 and 3 (along with four episodes from the already released series 1) were made available for download from iTunes.
