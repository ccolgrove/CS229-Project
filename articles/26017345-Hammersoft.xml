'''Melo''' is the capital city of the [[Cerro Largo Department]] of north-eastern [[Uruguay]]. It is located at the centre of the department, on the intersection of [[Route 7 (Uruguay)|Route 7]] with [[Route 8 (Uruguay)|Route 8]], {{convert|60|km}} south of [[AceguÃ¡, Uruguay|AceguÃ¡]] and the border with [[Brazil]]. Other primary roads to the city are Route 26 and Route 44. The stream [[Arroyo Conventos]] (a tributary of [[TacuarÃ­ River]]) flows by the west limits of the city. The status of Melo was elevated to &quot;City&quot; category on 22 May 1895 by decree Ley No. 2.3279.

==History==
It was founded on June 27, 1795 by AgustÃ­n de la Rosa, an officer to the [[Spanish Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerrolargo.gub.uy/es/web/imcl/cronica History of Melo - from the book of Camilo UrueÃ±a GonzÃ¡lez -&quot;CrÃ³nicas de Cerro Largo&quot; 1945 - Official website of Cerro Largo]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Given its proximity to some [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonies in Brazil, the &quot;Melo Village&quot; (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], &quot;''Villa de Melo''&quot;), as it was once named, it was invaded by Portuguese forces in 1801, 1811, and 1816. With Uruguayan independence, Melo was officially declared capital of the department of Cerro Largo.

In 1845, the city square was renamed in honor of [[Manuel Oribe]], a former [[President of Uruguay]] and a political leader of the ''White Party'' (Partido Blanco), which brought to light the relations of this corner of the country with that National Movement (the vast majority of its inhabitants have belonged to that same political community).

The historian J.C. Chasteen has discussed the place of Melo in the history of [[Uruguay]] in his book &quot;Heroes on Horseback: A Life and Times of the Last Gaucho Caudillos&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Charles Chasteen, 'Heroes on Horseback: A Life and Times of the Last Gaucho Caudillos', University of New Mexico Press. ISBN 0826315984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Near Melo is situated the old ''[[Posta del Chuy]]'', a stone inn near an ancient bridge over the Chuy del TacuarÃ­ creek.

The Conventos Stream, which was once used for boat races carried out by the ''Club Remeros Melo'', has become severely polluted over time and was consequently forbidden to public access. Melo is still an old-fashioned city with low buildings, and a hellhole of stultifying boredness, daily irrigated by cheap Brazilian liquor.

Melo was visited by the Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1988. This formed the background to the 2006 film &quot;[[El BaÃ±o del Papa]]&quot; (&quot;The Pope's Toilet&quot;) about an enterprising citizen with the ill-fated idea of making money by building a toilet and charging the hordes of Brazilians expected to visit Melo to see the Pope.
