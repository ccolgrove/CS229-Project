<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="2812641" ns="0" title="Leonard Nimoy discography"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">In December 1966, when it became apparent that the original [[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]] was developing a strong following in spite of low [[Nielsen ratings]], [[Dot Records]] approached the producers of the show.

The result was the signing of [[Leonard Nimoy]] to that label. Dot Records was a [[subsidiary]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], and both Paramount and [[Desilu]] - the studio producing ''Star Trek'' - were acquired by [[Gulf and Western Industries|Gulf+Western]], first Paramount in 1966 and Desilu in 1967. So after the [[merger]] of the two companies Nimoy wound up working for Paramount both as an actor (from 1966 to 1971) and singer (from 1967 to 1970), doing two television series ([[Star Trek]] and [[Mission: Impossible]]) and five albums (the Paramount record label holdings now belong to [[Universal Music Group]], although the masters were lost in the Universal Studios Fire of 2008{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}).

Later he did a few [[spoken word]] albums.
