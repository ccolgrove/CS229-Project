'''MoinMoin''' is a [[wiki software|wiki engine]] implemented in [[Python (programming language)|Python]], initially based on the PikiPiki wiki engine. The MoinMoin code is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] v2, or (at the user's option) any later version (except some 3rd party modules that are licensed under other Free Software licenses compatible with the GPL)&lt;ref&gt;http://moinmo.in/GPL&lt;/ref&gt;.

A number of organizations use MoinMoin to run public [[wikis]], including notable free software projects [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache]], [[Debian]], [[FreeBSD]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical details==
MoinMoin's storage mechanism is based on [[Flat file database|flat files]] and folders, rather than a [[database]]. This makes it easy to manipulate the content in a text editor on the server if necessary, including managing revisions if the wiki gets attacked by spammers. A storage [[abstraction layer]] is currently being worked on, which will allow the server administrator to select between flat file-storage or a relational database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://the-space-station.com/2008/09/07/my-work-on-moinmoins-new-storage-engine-gsoc-2008 New storage possibilities] article from its developer&lt;/ref&gt;

MoinMoin supports [[plugins]] and can be extended via Macros and Actions. It also uses the idea of separate parsers (e.g. for parsing the wiki syntax) and formatters (e.g. for outputting [[HTML]] code) with a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like interface between the two. The idea is that if you want to be able to output [[DocBook]] instead of HTML, you only need to write a docbook-formatter that implements the formatter interface, and all parsers that use the interface will automatically be supported.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

MoinMoin supports [[CamelCase]] linking as well as free links (non-CamelCase linking). The [[CamelCase]] is activated by default and MoinMoin does not allow disabling CamelCase links except on a one-off basis. The workaround to do this is to use a different parser&lt;ref&gt;http://moinmo.in/ParserMarket/NoCamelCase2&lt;/ref&gt; but this option does not work with the WYSIWYG editor.&lt;ref&gt;http://moinmo.in/ParserMarket/NoCamelCase2#Discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

MoinMoin also has extensive support for Access Control Lists ([[Access control list|ACL]]) that greatly increase its usability in a [[content management system]] (CMS). It also has GUI editing capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinFeatures#Advanced_Features]&lt;/ref&gt;

MoinMoin is able to either use a built-in search engine (rather slow, but no dependencies) or a [[Xapian]] based indexed search engine (faster, and can also search old revisions and attached files).&lt;ref&gt;http://moinmo.in/HelpOnSearching&lt;/ref&gt;

MoinMoin also allows synchronization of contents from instance to instance&lt;ref&gt;[http://moinmo.in/WikiSynchronisation WikiSynchronisation] from the MoinMoinWiki.&lt;/ref&gt; via [[XML-RPC]] and therefore allows distributed offline editing.

The original MoinMoin &quot;DesktopEdition&quot; is significantly easier to use because it uses a built-in web server to display pages, requiring only Python to be installed on the host machine. Since version  1.6.0, the &quot;DesktopEdition&quot; has been integrated into the standard release.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Also in this release a different markup syntax was introduced, which had not been changed much since the early releases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}
