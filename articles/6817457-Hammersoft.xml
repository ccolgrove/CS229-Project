The '''2006â07 Celtic League''' (known as the '''2006â07 Magners League''' for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]] season and the first with [[Magners]] as title sponsor. The season commenced on September 1 and was completed on May 12.

The teams competing remained the same as the previous season with four Irish provinces; [[Munster Rugby|Munster]], [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]] and 2005-06 champions [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]], three Scottish regions; [[Edinburgh Rugby]], [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Border Reivers]] and [[Glasgow Warriors]] and four Welsh regions; [[Llanelli Scarlets]], [[Cardiff Blues]], [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] and [[Newport Gwent Dragons]].

The league was won for the second time in three seasons by the Ospreys, with a final-day win over the Borders, playing their last ever match, as the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] have announced that the Borders will not exist next season [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/scottish/6498449.stm]

==Pre-season==
Ulster began the season as the reigning champions whilst Munster are [[Heineken Cup]] champions of the 2005-06 season. Prior to the season commencing it was announced by the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]] that some of their internationals were to be rested during part of the season as the Rugby World Cup takes place at the end. This would include the first four matches of the season, to allow for recovery from the June internationals. Those who did not play much during the internationals may return sooner.&lt;ref name=&quot;irishinternationals&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Irish stars could be back sooner | work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/ulster/5292952.stm | accessdate=3 September 2006 | date=2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major signings during the off-season include [[Justin Marshall]] for the Ospreys&lt;ref name=&quot;ospreys&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Marshall completes Ospreys switch | work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/4941160.stm | accessdate=3 September 2006 | date=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jones (rugby player)|Stephen Jones]] for the Scarlets.&lt;ref name=&quot;scarlets&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Jones secures return to Scarlets | work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/4941160.stm | accessdate=3 September 2006 | date=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free weekend scheme, where each team that did not compete in a match on a weekend due to the odd number of teams in the league would receive 4 points, was scrapped.&lt;ref name=&quot;points&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Points changes for Magners League | work=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/5280012.stm | accessdate=3 September 2006 | date=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
