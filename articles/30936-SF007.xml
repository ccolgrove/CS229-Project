'''TiVo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|t|iË|v|oÊ}} {{respell|TEE|voh}}) is a [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) developed and marketed by [[TiVo, Inc.]] and introduced in 1999.  TiVo provides an on-screen guide of scheduled [[broadcast programming]] [[television program]]s, whose features include &quot;Season Pass&quot; schedules which record every new episode of a series, and &quot;WishList&quot; searches which allow the user to find and record shows that match their interests by title, actor, director, category, or keyword. TiVo also provides a range of features when the [[TiVo DVR]] is connected to a home network, including film and television show downloads, advanced search, personal photo viewing, music offerings, and online scheduling.

Since its launch in the [[United States]], the TiVo has also been made available in [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  Newer models, however, have adopted the [[CableCARD]] standard, which is only deployed in the United States, and which limits the availability of certain features.

Due to the device's popularity, &quot;TiVo&quot; has become both a [[genericized trademark]] for DVR and a slang verb meaning &quot;to record on a DVR.&quot;

==History and development==
TiVo was developed by Jim Barton and Mike Ramsay through a [[corporation]] they named &quot;Teleworld&quot; which was later renamed to [[TiVo, Inc.]] Though they originally intended to create a home network device, it morphed into a device that records digitised video onto a hard disk. They began the first public trials of the TiVo device and service in late 1998 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

After exhibiting at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 1999, Mike Ramsay announced to the company that the first version of the TiVo digital video recorder would ship &quot;In Q1,&quot; (the last day of which is March 31) despite an estimated four to five months of work remaining to complete the device. Because March 31, 1999 was a [[blue moon]], the engineering staff code named this first version of the TiVo DVR &quot;Blue Moon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=429445&lt;/ref&gt;

The original TiVo DVR digitized and compressed analog video from any source (antenna, cable or direct broadcast satellite). TiVo also integrates its DVR service into the set-top boxes of satellite and cable providers.  In late 2000, Philips Electronics introduced the DSR6000, the first DirecTV receiver with an integrated TiVo DVR.  This new device, nicknamed the &quot;DirecTiVo,&quot; stored digital signals sent from [[DirecTV]] directly onto a [[hard disk]].

In early 2000, TiVo partnered with electronics manufacturer Thomson Multimedia (now [[Technicolor SA]]) and broadcaster [[British Sky Broadcasting]] to deliver the TiVo service in the UK market. This partnership resulted in the Thomson PVR10UK, a stand-alone receiver released in October 2000 that was based on the original reference design used in the United States by both Philips and Sony. TiVo ended UK unit sales in January 2003, though it continued to sell subscriptions and supply guide data to existing subscribed units until June 2011. TiVo branded products returned to the UK during 2010 under an exclusive partnership with cable television provider [[Virgin Media]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Media Selects Tivo&quot; /&gt;

TiVo was launched in Australia in July 2008 by Hybrid Television Services, a company owned by Australia's Seven Media Group and New Zealand's TVNZ. TiVo also launched a special 2009 Christmas TiVo DVR that has a 320Gb hard Drive and comes with the HNP free.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mytivo.com.au/whatistivo/tivomodels/&lt;/ref&gt; TiVo Australia also launched [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] on demand and as of early December launched a novel service called Caspa on Demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mytivo.com.au/whatistivo/moviestvmusic/entertainmentondemand/&lt;/ref&gt;  TiVo also went on sale in New Zealand on the 6 November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sticking point for TiVo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/2762085/Sticking-point-for-TiVo |title=Sticking point for TiVo |author=Pullar-Strecker, Tom |date=18 August 2009 |work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]] |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TiVo Digital Video Recorder==
{{main|TiVo digital video recorders}}
[[Image:Series 2 tivo front.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Front view of a TiVo Series2 5xx-generation unit]]
[[Image:Series 2 tivo back.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Back view of a TiVo Series2 5xx-generation unit]]
A TiVo DVR serves a function similar to a videocassette recorder, in that both allow a television viewer to record programming for viewing at a later time. Unlike a VCR, which uses removable magnetic tape cartridges, a TiVo DVR stores television programs onto non-removable hard disk storage.

What distinguishes TiVo from other DVRs is the sophisticated software written by TiVo Inc. that automatically records programsânot only those the user specifically requests, but also other material the user is likely to be interested in. TiVo DVRs also implement a patented feature TiVo calls &quot;trick play,&quot; which allows the viewer to pause live television, and rewind and replay up to a half hour of recently viewed television. More recent TiVo DVRs can be connected to a computer local area network, which allows the TiVo device to download information and even video programs, music and movies from the Internet.

===Functions===
TiVo polls its network, receiving program information including description, regular and guest actors, directors, genres, whether programs are new or repeats, and whether broadcast is in HD. Information is updated daily from Tribune Media Services.

Users can select individual programs to record or a &quot;Season Pass&quot; to record an entire season (or more). There are options to record First Run Only, First Run &amp; Repeats, or All Episodes. An episode is considered &quot;First Run&quot; if aired in two weeks of the original air date.

When user's requests for multiple programs are conflicting, the lower priority program in the Season Pass Manager is either not recorded or clipped where times overlap. The lower priority program will be recorded if it is aired later. TiVo DVRs with two tuners record the top two priority programs.

[[Image:TiVOThumpsUp.jpg|thumb|200px|A user rating a program.]]
TiVo pioneered recording programs based on household viewing habits;{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} this is called TiVo Suggestions. Users can rate programs from three &quot;thumbs up&quot; to three &quot;thumbs down.&quot; TiVo user ratings are combined to create a recommendation, based on what TiVo users with similar viewing habits watch. For example, if a user likes ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' and ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', then another TiVo user who watched just the ''[[American Idol]]'' might get a recommendation for the other two shows.

A limited amount of space is available to store programs. When the space is full, the oldest programs are deleted to make space for the newer ones; programs that users flag to not be deleted are kept and TiVo Suggestions are always lowest priority.  The recording capacity of a TiVo HD DVR can be expanded with an external hard drive, which can add 65 additional hours of HD recording space or up to 600 hours of standard definition recording capacity.

When not recording specific user requests, the current channel is recorded for up to 30 minutes. (Dual tuner models keep two channels.) This allows users to rewind or pause anything that has been shown in the last thirty minutes: useful when viewing is interrupted. Shows already in progress can be entirely recorded if less than 30 minutes have been shown.  Unlike VCRs, TiVo can record and play at the same time. A program can be watched from the beginning even if it's in the middle of being recorded, which is something that VCRs cannot do. Some users take advantage of this by waiting 10â15 minutes after a program starts (or is replayed from a recording), so that they can fast forward through [[Television advertisement|commercials]]. In this way, by the end of the recording viewers are caught up with live TV.

Unlike most DVRs, TiVo DVRs are easily connected to [[home network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivo.com/mytivo/howto/getconnected/howto_connect_dvr_internet.html How to connect your TiVo DVR to your network and the Internet]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing users to schedule recordings on TiVo's website (via TiVo Central Online), transfer recordings between TiVo units (Multi-Room Viewing (MRV)) or to/from a home computer (TiVoToGo transfers), play music and view photos over the network, and access third-party applications written for TiVo's Home Media Engine (HME) API.

TiVo has added a number of broadband features, including integration with Amazon Video on Demand, Jaman.com&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivo.com/abouttivo/pressroom/pressreleases/2008/pr2008-10-23.html TiVo Joins with Jaman to Deliver the Best of the Big Screen to Living Rooms Across the Country]&lt;/ref&gt; and Netflix Watch Instantly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivo.com/abouttivo/pressroom/pressreleases/2008/pr2008-10-30.html TiVo and Netflix Announce Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; offering users access to thousands of movie titles &amp; TV shows right from the comfort of their couch.  Additionally, broadband connected to TiVo boxes can access digital photos from Picasa Web Albums or Photobucket.  Another popular feature is access to Rhapsody music through TiVo, allowing users to listen to virtually any song from their living room.  TiVo also teamed up with One True Media to give subscribers a private channel for sharing photos and video with family and friends.  They can also access weather, traffic, Fandango movie listings (including ticket purchases), and music through Live365. In the summer of 2008 TiVo announced the availability of YouTube videos on TiVo.

On June 7, 2006, TiVo began offering TiVoCast, a broadband download service which initially offered content from places such as Rocketboom or, The New York Timesânow there are over 70 TivoCast channels available for TiVo subscribers.

TiVo is expanding media convergence. In January 2005, TiVoToGo, a feature allowing transfer of recorded shows from TiVo boxes to PCs, was added. TiVo partnered with Sonic in the release of MyDVD 6.1, software for editing and converting TiVoToGo files. In January, 2007, TiVoToGo was extended to the [[Macintosh]] with Toast Titanium 8, Roxio software for assembly and burning digital media on CD and DVD media. Other means of manipulating files are described at the [http://www.zatznotfunny.com/ttg.htm TiVoToGo Unleashed] tutorial. In August 2005, TiVo rolled out [http://www.tivo.com/desktop &quot;TiVo Desktop&quot;] allowing moving MPEG2 video files from PCs to TiVo for playback by DVR.

'''Parental Features'''

TiVo KidZone is designed to give parents greater control over what their children see on TV. This feature allows parents to choose which shows their children can watch and record.  It also helps kids discover new shows through recommendations from leading national children's organizations. TiVo KidZone provides a customized Now Playing List for children that displays only pre-approved shows, keeping TV as safe as possible.

===Subscription service===
The information that a TiVo DVR downloads regarding TV schedules as well as software updates and any other relevant information is available through a monthly service subscription in the US.  A different model applies in Australia where the TiVo media device is bought for a one off fee, without further subscription costs.

'''Lifetime Subscription'''
There are multiple types of Product Lifetime Service. For satellite enabled TiVo DVRS the lifetime subscription remains as long as the account is active and does not follow a specific piece of hardware. This satellite lifetime subscription cannot be transferred to another person. Toshiba and Pioneer Tivo DVD recording equipped units include a &quot;Basic Lifetime Subscription&quot; which is very similar to full lifetime, except only 3 days of the TV guide is viewable and search and internet capabilities are not available, or at least limited. All units (except satellite but including DVD units) are able to have &quot;Product Lifetime Subscription&quot; to the TiVo service which covers the life of the TiVo DVRânot the life of the subscriber. The Product Lifetime Subscription accompanies the TiVo DVR in case of ownership transfer. TiVo makes no warranties or representations as to the expected lifetime of the TiVo DVR (aside from the manufacturer's Limited Warranty). In the past TiVo has offered multiple &quot;Trade Up&quot; programs where you could transfer the Product Lifetime Subscription from an old unit to a newer model with a fee. A Tivo can be used without a service agreement, but it will act more like a VCR in that you can only do manual recordings. And the Tivo can't be connected to the Tivo service for time or software updates or changes or Tivo will shut down the recording function. 

====Service availability====
The TiVo service is  available in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] (except [[QuÃ©bec]]), [[Mexico]], [[Australia]], [[Spain]] and [[Taiwan]] at present. Over the years since its initial release in the [[United States]], TiVo Series 1 &amp; 2 DVRs have also been modified by end users to work in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[South Africa]].

TiVo went on sale in New Zealand in the first week of November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sticking point for TiVo&quot;/&gt;

=====United Kingdom=====
The TiVo service was launched in the United Kingdom in the autumn of 2000. It sold only 35,000 units over the next 18 months. Thomson, makers of the only UK TiVo box, abandoned it in early 2002 after [[BSkyB]] launched its [[Sky+]] integrated 'set-top' decoder and DVR which dominated the market for DVRs in homes subscribing to BSkyB's paid-for satellite TV service. Many manufacturers, including Thomson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvruk.co.uk/article.cfm?attributes.article=596 ''Freeview/Freeview Playback/Satellite/Cable'', PVR UK website, Undated].Accessed: 04-30-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeview.co.uk/products/dtrrange-page ''Latest Range'' Freeview website, Undated].Accessed:04-30-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have launched integrated decoder boxes/DVRs in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] for other digital platforms, including [[Freesat|free satellite]], [[Freeview (United Kingdom)|terrestrial]], [[Virgin Media|cable]] and [[Tiscali TV (UK)|IPTV]].

A technical issue caused TiVo Suggestions to stop recording for S1 UK TiVo customers in late September 2008, but this was fixed in late January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/showthread.php?t=406543 ''TiVo Suggestions in the UK - Update'', TiVo Community Forum, 09-29-2008].Accessed: 01-11-2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since December 2010 UK TiVo's that were not already on an active monthly subscription or lifetime subscription could no longer be re-activated. BSkyB who were operating the support for TiVo no longer had full access to the TiVo systems to activate accounts.

The TiVo S1 subscription service was maintained for both lifetime and monthly subscriptions until 1st June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.tivo.com/2011/02/1123/ ''TiVo Blog'']&lt;/ref&gt;.
A community project known AltEPG was established in March 2011 with the aim of providing a replacement for the discontinued subscription service. This project now provides programme guide data and software upgrades for S1 TiVos. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altepg.com ''The alternative EPG project for UK Tivos'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2009, cable TV provider [[Virgin Media]] entered into a strategic partnership with TiVo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virgin Media Selects Tivo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressoffice.virginmedia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=205406&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1359213&amp;highlight=|title=Virgin Media Selects Tivo For Next Generation Tv Platform|publisher=Virgin Media|date=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the mutually exclusive agreement, TiVo developed a converged television and broadband interactive interface to power Virgin Media's next generation, high definition set top boxes. TiVo will become the exclusive provider of middleware and user interface software for Virgin Media's next generation set top boxes. Virgin Media will be the exclusive distributor of TiVo services and technology in the United Kingdom. Virgin Media released its first TiVo co-branded product in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a290840/virgin-medias-tivo-platform-to-go-live.html|title=Virgin Media's TiVo platform to go live|publisher=Digital Spy|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2011, Virgin Media enabled access to a third tuner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a309547/virgin-media-unlocks-third-tivo-tuner.html|title=Virgin Media unlocks third TiVo tuner|publisher=Digital Spy|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 2011, cable operator [[Virgin Media]] released their third quarter 2011 results indicating a significant growth of 222,000 TiVo customers as of 26 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.virginmedia.com/imagelibrary/downloadmedia.ashx?MediaDetailsID=1239|title=Virgin Media's Q3 2011 Results|publisher=Virgin Media|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware anatomy===
:{{Main|TiVo DVRs}}
[[Image:Tivo-remote.jpg|thumb|200px|The TiVo &quot;peanut&quot; remote]]
The TiVo DVR was designed by TiVo Inc., which currently provides the hardware design and [[Linux]]-based TiVo software, and operates a subscription service (without which most models of TiVo will not operate). TiVo units have been manufactured by various [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s, including [[Philips]], [[Sony]], [[Hughes Electronics|Hughes]], [[Pioneer (company)|Pioneer]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Humax]], which license the software from TiVo Inc.  To date, there have been four &quot;series&quot; of TiVo units produced.

TiVo DVRs are based on [[PowerPC]] (Series1) or [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] (Series2) processors connected to [[MPEG-2]] encoder/decoder chips and high-capacity [[Advanced Technology Attachment|IDE/ATA]] hard drives. Series1 TiVo units used one or two drives of 13â60 GB; current Series2 units have drives of 40â250 GB in size. TiVo has also partnered with [[Western Digital]] to create an external hard-drive, the My DVR Expander, for TiVo HD and Series3 Boxes. It plugs into the TiVo box using an [[Serial ATA#eSATA|eSATA]] interface. It expands the High-Definition boxes by up to 67 hrs of HD, and around 300 hrs. of standard programming. Other TiVo users have found many ways to expand TiVo storage, although these methods are not supported by TiVo, and may void the warranty.

Some recent models manufactured by Toshiba, Pioneer, and Humax, under license from TiVo, contain [[DVD-R]]/[[DVD-RW|RW]] drives. The models can transfer recordings from the built-in hard drive to DVD Video compliant disc, playable in most modern DVD systems.

All standalone TiVo DVRs have [[Coaxial cable|coax]]/RF-in and an internal cable-ready tuner, as well as analog video inputâcomposite/RCA and S-Videoâfor use with an external cable box or satellite receiver. The TiVo unit can use a serial cable or IR blasters to control the external receiver. They have coax/RF, composite/RCA, and S-Video output, and the DVD systems also have component out. Audio is RCA stereo, and the DVD systems also have digital optical out.

Until 2006, standalone TiVo systems could only record one channel at a time, though a dual-tuner Series2DT (S2DT) box was introduced in April 2006.  The S2DT has two internal cable-ready tuners and it supports a single external cable box or satellite receiver.  The S2DT is therefore capable of recording two analog cable channels, one analog and one digital cable channel, or one analog cable and one satellite channel at a time, with the correct programming sources.  Note, however, that the S2DT, unlike earlier units, cannot record from antenna.  This is due to an [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] mandate that all devices sold after March 2007 with an [[NTSC]] tuner must also contain an [[ATSC tuner]].  TiVo therefore had to choose between adding ATSC support, or removing NTSC support.  With the S2DT they opted to remove NTSC; the Series3 supports NTSC and ATSC, along with digital cable channels (with CableCards).

The Series2 DVRs also have [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports, currently used only to support network (wired [[Ethernet]] and [[WiFi]]) adapters. [http://www.tivo.com/adapters] The early Series2 units, models starting with 110/130/140, have USB1.1 hardware, while all other systems have USB2.0.  There have been four major generations of Series2 units.  The TiVo-branded 1xx and 2xx generations were solid grey-black.  The main difference was the upgrade from USB1.1 to USB2.0.  The 5xx generation was a new design.  The chassis is silver with a white oval in the faceplate.  The white oval is backlit, leading to these units being called 'Nightlight' boxes.  The 5xx generation was designed to reduce costs, and unfortunately this also caused a noticeable drop in performance in the system menus as well as a large performance drop in network transfers.  The 5xx generation also introduced changes in the [[booting|boot]] [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]] that make them unhackable without serious soldering.  The 6xx generation resembles the previous 5xx model, except that it has a black oval.  The 6xx is a new design and the only model available today is the S2DT with dual-tuners and a built-in 10/100baseT Ethernet port as well.  The 6xx is the best performing Series2 to date, outperforming even the old leader, the 2xx, and far better than the lowest performing 5xx.

Some TiVo systems are integrated with [[DirecTV]] receivers. These &quot;DirecTiVo&quot; recorders record the incoming [[satellite]] MPEG-2 digital stream directly to hard disk without conversion. Because of this and the fact that they have two tuners, DirecTiVos are able to record two programs at once. In addition, the lack of digital conversion allows recorded video to be of the same quality as live video. DirecTiVos have no MPEG encoder chip, and can only record DirecTV streams. However, DirecTV has disabled the networking capabilities on their systems, meaning DirecTiVo does not offer such features as multi-room viewing or TiVoToGo. Only the standalone systems can be networked without additional unsupported [[Hack (technology slang)|hacking]].

DirecTiVo units (HR10-250) can record HDTV to a 250 GB hard drive, both from the DirecTV stream and [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] via a standard [[ultra high frequency|UHF]]- or [[very high frequency|VHF]]-capable antenna. They have two virtual tuners (each consisting of a DirecTV tuner paired with an ATSC over-the-air tuner) and, like the original DirecTiVo, can record two programs at once; further, the program guide is integrated between over-the-air and DirecTV so that all programs can be recorded and viewed in the same manner.

In 2005 DirecTV stopped marketing recorders powered by TiVo and focused on its own DVR line developed by its business units. DirecTV continues to support the existing base of DirecTV recorders powered by TiVo.

On July 8, 2006, DirecTV announced an upgrade to version 6.3 on all remaining HR10-250 DirecTiVo receivers, the first major upgrade since this unit was released.  This upgrade includes features such as program grouping (folders), a much faster on-screen guide, and new sorting features.

In September 2008, DirecTV and TiVo announced that they have extended their current agreement, which includes the development, marketing and distribution of a new HD DIRECTV DVR featuring the TiVo service, as well as the extension of mutual intellectual property arrangements.

Since the discontinued Hughes Electronics DirectTV DVR with TiVo model HR10-250, all newer TiVo units have been fully HDTV capable. Other TiVo models will only record analog standard definition TV. The Series-3 &quot;TiVo HD, and TiVo HD XL&quot; DVRs and the Series-4 &quot;TiVo Premiere and TiVo Premiere XL&quot; DVRs are capable of recording HDTV both from antenna (over the air) and cable (unencrypted QAM tuner or encrypted with a Cable Card) in addition to normal standard definition TV from the same sources. Unlike the HR10-250, neither the Series-3 nor Series-4 units can record from the DirecTV service (conversely the HR10-250 cannot record from digital cable). Other TiVo models may be connected to a high definition TV, but are not capable of recording HDTV signals (although they may be connected to a cable HDTV set-top box and record the down-converted outputs).

In 2008, some cable companies started to roll out [[switched digital video]] (SDV) technology, which initially was incompatible with the Series-3 and TiVo HD units. TiVo Inc worked with cable operators on a tuning-adapter with USB connection to the TiVo to enable SDV.  Some [[Multiple system operator|MSOs]] now offer these adapters for free to their customers with TiVo DVRs.

===Drive Expansion===
TiVo has partnered with [[Western Digital]] to create an external hard-drive, the My DVR Expander eSATA Edition, for TiVo HD and Series3 systems. The external drive plugs into the TiVo box using an [[Serial ATA#eSATA|eSATA]] interface. The first version of the eSATA drive shipped was a 500 GB drive that shipped in June 2008.  In June 2009 the 1 TB version of the drive began shipping.  The 1 TB version expands the TiVo HD and Series3 systems capacity by up to 140 hours of HD content or 1,200 hours of standard programming.  

TiVo was not designed to have an external drive disconnected, once it has been added.  This is due to how data (recordings) are stored.  TiVo stores recordings by spreading data across both the internal and external disk drives.  As a result, it is not possible to disconnect the external drive without deleting content recorded after the external drive was added. If disconnected, any recordings made will not be usable on either the internal or external drives.  However, the external drive may be removed (along with content) without losing settings.  

Various capacities of external drives have been shipped since the product was initially released.  There were reports of product reliability issues,&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.tivo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/308 TiVo support for DVR Expander problems]&lt;/ref&gt; and a brief period of unavailability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tivo.com/dvr-products/tivo-accessories/extra-dvr-storage/index.html#A00096 TiVo Website showing 1TB drive and stock status]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The Western Digital 1 TB and 500 GB My DVR Expander eSATA Edition and My DVR Expander USB Edition drives have been discontinued and replaced with the Western Digital My Book AV DVR Expander 1 TB drive. This drive has gotten a facelift from the previous generation, which now sports a glossy finish, and a tiny white led power indicator, along with a push button power switch in the back. The biggest change is that this drive now includes both eSATA and USB in one device. This device is DirectTV, Dish Network, TiVo, Moxi, Pace, and Scientific Atlanta (Cisco) certified.

===Hacking===
Many people and groups{{who|date=September 2010}} have organized to [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hack]] the TiVo box, some to improve the service and others to provide service in countries where the TiVo is not currently being sold. TiVo Inc. has generally remained on good terms with these projects, although it has lately tried to clamp down on many of the &quot;back doors&quot; in the software, citing threats to their corporate interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Many users have installed additional or larger hard drives in their TiVo boxes to increase their recording capacity. Others have designed and built [[Ethernet card]]s, a [[Web-interface|web interface]] ([[Tivoweb|TiVoWeb]]), and figured out how to extract, insert and transfer video among their TiVo boxes.

TiVo enthusiast groups located in countries where the TiVo is not sold have been able to reverse engineer the television subscription service schedule files needed by the TiVo and the protocol used during the transmission of those files to the TiVo.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} This allows the TiVo to be supplied with television scheduling data not available by subscription from the U.S.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} In some countries, these groups operate a simulated TiVo central server to make and distribute the necessary files for programs broadcast within their country. In other countries, each individual TiVo owner operates a simulated server and makes his own files using software that obtains free television scheduling data from the Internet. The ability to supply television scheduling data to the TiVo without paying a subscription fee threatens TiVo Inc.'s subscription-based business model in the U.S., therefore, these groups usually have strict controls over who can access the necessary software or join their group.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Improved encryption found in more recent versions of the TiVo hardware and software has made it more difficult to create the necessary files or to simulate interaction with the TiVo server.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Tivo still uses the same encoding, however, for the media files (saved as .TiVo files).  These files are just MPEG files encoded with the user's MAK.  Luckily, coders have built programs such as tivodecode and tivodecode Manager to strip the MAK from the file, allowing the user to watch or send the recordings to friends.  These projects are open source and for the most part are hosted on SourceForge.

==Market share==

While its former main competitor in the US, [[ReplayTV]], had adopted a commercial-skip feature, TiVo decided to avoid automatic implementation fearing such a move might provoke backlash from the television industry. ReplayTV was sued over this feature as well as the ability to share shows over the Internet, and these lawsuits contributed to the bankruptcy of [[S3 Graphics|SONICblue]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2003/03/58160 Bankruptcy Blues for PVR Maker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; their owner at the time. Their new owner, DNNA, dropped both features in the final ReplayTV model, the 5500. 

Other distributors' competing DVR sets in the US include [[Comcast]] and [[Verizon]], although both distribute third-party hardware from manufacturers such as [[Motorola]] and the former [[Scientific Atlanta]] unit of [[Cisco Systems]] with this functionality built-in. Verizon uses boxes fitted for [[FiOS]], allowing high-speed internet access and other features.

As of October 2011, TiVo has 2 million subscribers in the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;nt2009-11-24&quot;&gt;[http://newteevee.com/2009/11/24/how-low-can-tivo-subs-go/ How Low Can TiVo Subs Go?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tir2009-11-24&quot;&gt;[http://investor.tivo.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=106292&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=1359102 TiVo Inc.

As of July 2011, TiVo's market share shrunk to 1.93 million subscribers but their cable operator registered a small incremental increase (10k subscribers) from the previous quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://http://investor.tivo.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=106292&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=1600085|title=TiVo's Q2 2012 Results|publisher=TiVo|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Privacy concerns===
TiVo collects detailed usage data from units via broadband internet.  As units are downloading schedule data, they transmit household viewing habits to TiVo Inc.  Collected information includes a log of everything watched (time and channel) and remote keypresses such as fast forwarding through or replaying content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.uml.edu/~dm/pubs/TiVo%20report.htm TiVo's Data Collection and Privacy Practices&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many users were surprised when TiVo released data on how many users rewatched the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|exposure of Janet Jackson's breast]] during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-1041_3-5154219.html TiVo watchers uneasy after post-Super Bowl reports - CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  TiVo records usage data for their own research and they also sell it to other corporations such as advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/technology/26adco.html?ex=1311566400&amp;en=143cb4893c1c45a9&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss TiVo Is Watching When You Donât Watch, and It Tattles]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] and TiVo have also previously collaborated to track viewing habits.  Now TiVo has their own service.

TiVo has three levels of collection data.  By default you are in Opt-out status where all usage data is currently aggregated by ZIP code and that they don't track individual viewing habits.  Certain optional features and promotions require you to Opt-In, where they will collect individual information for targeted show suggestions or advertising.  Users can request that TiVo block the collection of Anonymous Viewing Information and Diagnostic Information from their TiVo DVR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tivo.com/abouttivo/policies/tivoprivacypolicy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition by content providers===
One major concern of the media is the fact that advertisements in television programs can be bypassed by using a TiVo DVR. The media industry is highly dependent on sponsorship via advertisements and will lose revenue if viewers adopt TiVo-like systems in large numbers.  Knowing this, some countries have taken protectionist measures especially when the media is already struggling due to poor viewing figures.  The government of Singapore has banned TiVo, citing the potential adverse impact on the local media industry if TiVo usage were to increase. The government is, however, facing difficulty regulating the use of TiVo in Singapore as individuals are bringing in the sets from overseas. TiVo has created a number of ad solutions intended to reach the viewer that fast forwards through ads.

This has not been an issue in Australia where the exclusive rights to TiVo are held by Hybrid Television Services, owned by the [[Seven Media Group]] and [[TVNZ]].  Seven Media Group is one of Australia's largest free-to-air broadcasters as [[Seven Network]], and as part of the local market adaptations to TiVo prior to launch, ad-skipping was disabled.  Users can still fast forward through ads.

====Content flagging====
In September 2005, a TiVo software upgrade added the ability for broadcasters to &quot;flag&quot; programs to be deleted after a certain date. Some customers had recordings deleted, or could not use their flagged recordings (transfer to a computer or burn to DVD), as they could with unflagged material. The initial showing of this for random shows was a bug in the software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/TiVo+copy+protection+bug+irks+users/2100-1041_3-5863529.html TiVo copy protection bug irks users - CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It later was enabled on [[pay-per-view]] and [[video-on-demand]] content.

====Pop-up advertisements====
During early 2005, TiVo began test market &quot;pop-up&quot; advertisements to select subscribers, to explore it as an alternative source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2005/03/27/tivo-testing-banner-ads-during-fast-forwarding|title=TiVo testing banner ads during fast-forwarding?|author=Peter Rojas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was that as users fast-forward through certain commercials of TiVo advertisers, they would also see a [[pop-up ad|static image ad]] more suitable and effective than the broken video stream.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstadopter.com/fa/archives/000780.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;http://news.cnet.com/TiVo-tests-pop-up-style-ads/2100-1041_3-5644197.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At its announcement, the concept of extra advertisements drew heavy criticism from subscribers. Some lifetime subscribers were upset that they had already paid for a service based upon their previous ad-free experience, while others argued that they had purchased the service for the specific purpose of dodging advertisements. In 2007, TiVo made changes to its pop-up ad system to only show pop-up ads if the user fast-forwards through a commercial that has a corresponding pop-up ad.&lt;ref name=&quot;betanews&quot;&gt;http://www.betanews.com/article/TiVo_Fast_Forward_Popup_Ads_Return/1168964730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===GNU General Public License and &quot;Tivoization&quot;===
{{Main|Tivoization}}
In 2006, [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) decided to combat TiVo's technical system of blocking users from running modified software.  This behavior, which FSF dubs &quot;[[tivoization]]&quot;, was tackled by creating a new version of the [[GNU General Public License#Version 3|GNU General Public License (GPL v3)]] prohibiting this activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/brussels-rms-transcript#tivoisation|title=Richard Stallman explains the new GPL provisions to block &quot;tivoisation&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The operating system kernel included in the TiVo is distributed under the terms of the GPL, and the FSF's goal is to ensure that all recipients of software licensed under the new GPL are not restricted by hardware constraints on the modification of distributed software. This new license provision was acknowledged by TiVo in its April 2007 [[SEC filing]]: &quot;''we may be unable to incorporate future enhancements to the GNU/Linux operating system into our software, which could adversely affect our business''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.informationweek.com/industries/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199900263|title=InformationWeek: TiVo Warns Investors New Open Source License Could Hurt Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the [[Linux kernel]] has not been changed to use GPL v3.
