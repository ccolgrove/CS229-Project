The facility, formerly a base of the [[Turkish Air Force]], is named after the Air Force [[fighter pilot]] [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|Capt.]] [[Cengiz Topel]], whose [[F-100 Super Sabre]] was shot down on August 8, 1964 during [[Cyprus Navy and Marine Police#Combat actions of 1964|Turkey's military intervention in Cyprus]]. He ejected safely over land, but was promptly captured after landing and lynched by members of the [[Cyprus National Guard]]. He was the first Turkish pilot ever [[killed in action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/lefke/topel.htm |publisher=What's on North Cyprus |title=Cengis Topel Memorial - Gemikonagi, Near Lefke, North Cyprus |accessdate=2009-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Topel Airport was originally a Turkish Air Force facility. Following the re-establishment of the aviation branch of the Turkish Navy in 1968, the first naval helicopter pilots were trained by the [[Turkish Army Aviation]] Command's flight school  at the [[GÃ¼vercinlik Army Air Base]] in [[Etimesgut]], [[Ankara Province]]. The unit, formed in 1972 at the same base, was transferred on May 19, 1973 from Ankara to Cengiz Topel Air Base due to its location close to [[GÃ¶lcÃ¼k Naval Base]] in Kocaeli Province following a protocol signed with the Turkish Air Force two weeks before. That day, Turkish Navy's first rotorcraft unit was renamed 351st Naval Helicopter Squadron.&lt;ref name=&quot;dzkk&quot;/&gt;

The 301st Naval Air Squadron, formed in 1971 at [[Etimesgut Air Base]] in Ankara Province as the fixed wing aviation unit of the Navy, was transferred on August 4, 1972 to [[BandÄ±rma Air Base]] to join the 6th Air Force Wing. With its four [[maritime patrol aircraft]] and twelve [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) aircraft of type [[S-2 Tracker]], the unit was then relocated to Cengiz Topel Air Base on July 14, 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;dzkk&quot;/&gt;

The base, in joint use since 1973 by the air force and the navy, was transferred to the Turkish Navy Command on July 14, 1976 following the order of the [[Turkish General Staff]]. Finally, the Naval Air Station Command was established on August 4, 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;dzkk&quot;/&gt;

The base was assigned to [[NATO]] on October 28, 1981. In 1983, helipeds in [[Istanbul]] and [[Ãanakkale]] were put in service so tha helicopters of the air station could use them also.&lt;ref name=&quot;dzkk&quot;/&gt;
