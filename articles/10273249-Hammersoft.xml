==Background==
The Armenians of [[SÃ¼leymanlÄ±|Zeitun]] had historically enjoyed a period of high autonomy in the Ottoman Empire until the nineteenth century. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the central government decided to bring this region of the empire under tighter control and attempted to do this by settling Muslims in the villages around Zeitun and inciting them against the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hagop Barsoumian|Barsoumian, Hagop]]. &quot;The Eastern Question and the Tanzimat Era&quot; in ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II'', p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy ultimately proved ineffective and in the summer of 1862 the Ottomans sent a military contingent of 12,000 men to Zeitun to reassert government control. The force, however, was held at bay by the Armenians and, through French mediation, the first Zeitun resistance was brought to a close. 

The Ottoman government was nevertheless upset with the results of the mediation. In the following decades, it once more resolved to bring the area under control by provoking the Zeitun's Armenians: newly stationed government troops harassed the population and frequent calls for their massacre were issued by a number of Turks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

It was also at this time that the ruler of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], decided finally to eliminate one of the only strongholds of Armenian autonomy during the [[Hamidian massacres|Armenian massacres of 1895-1896]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume III&quot;/&gt; 

As the governor of the province was removed and replaced by Avni Bey, a man who held a deep-seated hatred for Armenians, orders were given on October 24, 1895 by Ottoman authorities to use the troops to begin razing several of the Armenians villages near Zeitun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Resistance==

The Armenian citizens of Zeitun, under the leadership of the Hunchakian Party, heard of the ongoing massacres in nearby regions, and thus started to prepare themselves for an armed resistance. Between 1,500 to 6,000 men, armed with [[flintlock]] guns and [[Martini-Henry]] rifles, were sent to the battlefield and sixteen Armenians were selected to head an administrative body during the siege.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBH&quot;/&gt; With this, the Ottoman military commander sent a wire to Abdul Hamid and told him that the Armenians had started an uprising and were proceeding to massacre Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadrian&quot;&gt;Dadrian. ''History of the Armenian Genocide'', p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman forces possessed an overwhelming numerical and technological advantage: the entire force consisted of 24 battalions (20,000 troops), twelve cannons, 8,000 men from the Zeibek Division from [[Smyrna]], and 30,000 Kurdish and [[Circassians|Circassian]] irregulars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadrian&quot;/&gt; 

The Armenians started by conquering the nearby Ottoman garrison, taking 600 Ottoman soldiers and officers as prisoners and placing them under the surveillance of Armenian women.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBH&quot;/&gt; The prisoners tried to flee, but failed and were killed. Ottoman troops were repeatedly defeated in their engagements with the Armenian militia. During the negotiations which later settled the conflict, an Ottoman military commanders expressed his admiration to Aghasi, one of the leaders of the resistance, for the Armenians' accurate marksmanship and their determination to resist.&lt;ref&gt;Dadrian. ''History of the Armenian Genocide'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution==
With the intervention of the six major European powers, the Armenians of Zeitun ended the resistance. The Hunchak activists were allowed to go into exile, the tax burden was eased, and a Christian sub-governor was appointed. Due to the freezing temperatures, thousands of Turks died and many others died in hospitals from wounds sustained in battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadrian&quot;/&gt; The figures on casualties are heavily conflicting but all agree that the Ottoman forces suffered greatly. The British Consulate reported on January 6, 1896 that &quot;at least 5,000 have been killed though common report swells the number to 10,000.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadrian2&quot;&gt;Dadrian. ''History of the Armenian Genocide'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian Consulate based in [[Aleppo]] stated that the Armenians killed 1,300 Turks in the final battle alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadrian2&quot;/&gt; The British consul estimated that combat and non-combat fatalities among all Armenians neared the figure of 6,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dadrian2&quot;/&gt; Pierre Quillard, a French writer, estimated that Ottoman losses totaled no less than 20,000 men.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBH&quot;/&gt;

The Armenians lived in relative peace until 1915, when they [[Zeitun Resistance (1915)|were massacred and deported]] from Zeitun.&lt;ref&gt;Arkun, Aram. &quot;Zeytun and the Commencement of the Armenian Genocide,&quot; in ''A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire'', eds.
