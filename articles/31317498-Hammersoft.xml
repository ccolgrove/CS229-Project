The current flag of Billings, Montana, adopted in 1986, is a âCanadian-like&quot; triband of very dark blue and white with the city logo/seal on the white panel. This seal/logo shows the Billings skyline with its skyscrapers in blue-on-white line draw with red sun disc and large rim, lined in blue with red capitals reading &quot;Star of the Big Sky Country&quot;.

Superimposed on the bottom of this design a red panel with &quot;Billings&quot; in commissioned lettering, with larger, swash initial &quot;B&quot; and &quot;S&quot; between which tails, on white, &quot;Montana&quot; in tiny blue capitals. 

In 2004 NAVA conducted an internet survey of 150 city flags across the US and Billings' current flag ranked 106th place out of 150 flags, 3.35 points on a 0-10 scale/D+&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nava.org/Flag%20Design/City%20Survey%202004/acf_press_release.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
