SpongeBob then finds it and uses his reef blower to blow it into Squidward's yard. He also blows sand onto Squidward. When he tries to blow it away, the shell goes back into his yard, along with the sand. He then sucks the sand into his reef blower, causing it to malfunction, spurting out its gears. SpongeBob then tries to start his reef blower, but it won't work, so he pulls the cord back really far. After letting go go,  he grabs back on and is pulled back, causing the whole ocean to be sucked up.

It's mass chaos at the Krusty Krab when Plankton, Mr. Krabs' physically tiny business rival (and a determined, unsuccessful one at that), tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula for his own restaurant, the Chum Bucket. But as usual, Mr. Krabs stops him. That night, Plankton tries to con SpongeBob into giving him the formula. Spongebob refuses. Plankton has to go to his last resort - controlling SpongeBob's mind. Plankton gets just inches away from getting the secret formula by trying to make him drop a Krabby Patty into a machine that traps any item put into it and tells him the exact ingredients. But SpongeBob, when he is about to drop the Krabby Patty into the machine, begins to cry, describe how delicious the burger is, and reveals the ingredients using his own words, Plankton becomes extremely tempted to eat the Krabby Patty. But Plankton ends up accidentally trapping himself into in his own machine before he can succeed in eating the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob then leaves the Chum Bucket, and Plankton yells in horror.

A customer asks for a [[pizza]] from the Krusty Krab, so Mr. Krabs takes a Krabby Patty turning it into a pizza. SpongeBob and Squidward then are sent to deliver it. Squidward tells SpongeBob to back up the delivery boat, but instead, he panics (as he never passed his driving test), and throws the boat into reverse, speeding backwards into the distance. Unfortunately, the boat runs out of gas and the two cannot find their way back to Bikini Bottom while on foot. The two go on a very tiresome journey, but after using SpongeBob's pioneering skills (where Squidward uses a reference to the television series, [[The Beverly Hillbillies]] calling SpongeBob; Jethro every time he refers to the pioneers), including nutty hitchhiking, moss to civilazation, and riding a rock, they finally reach the customer's house. But the customer is not pleased at all that he did not get the soda he insists he ordered with his pizza (to which he did order the soda, but at the time Mr. Krabs placed the phone down). He gets really unnecessarily mad with SpongeBob and he refuses to pay for the pizza, making the sponge cry. Feeling sorry for a heartbroken SpongeBob, Squidward slams the pizza in the customer's face and they both return to the Krusty Krab after the &quot;successful&quot; delivery. But, Squidward soon discovers that there was a shortcut from the Krusty Krab to the customer's house, and that the two had taken a different route (and an unnecessarily long one).

A horde of hungry [[Nematode]]s come to town and, after eating several indigestible objects, become thirsty and &quot;drink&quot; Spongebob's house. When this happens, SpongeBob plans to move back with his parents, though with a lot of reluctance because he'll miss his old house and friends dearly. Squidward is, unsurprisingly, excited about the idea of SpongeBob leaving, and even parties, but Patrick does everything he can to keep him from leaving whether it be building a new house or offering him to be a &quot;[[roommate|rock mate]]&quot;. This proves to be short-lived, due to Patrick's loud snoring at night and dreaming about a fear of spiders (while sleepwaking, he beats Spongebob with his rock). The next day, SpongeBob's parents arrive to take him to their home. Squidward dances with joy on the spot where SpongeBob's house used to be. As a last memento, SpongeBob puts what he thinks is a pebble in the ground where the house used to be. SpongeBob cries and a tear drops from his nose completely drenching the seed. The seed grows into a new house for SpongeBob. The ground starts to shake, and his house grows back, with Squidward being stuck underneath of it. SpongeBob decides to live in his pineapple house again now that it's restored.

SpongeBob and Patrick discover that their favorite actors/superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, live in Shady Shoals, a retirement home on the other side of Bikini Bottom. They try to convince the crime-fighting duo to come out of retirement through several different tactics. As a last resort, SpongeBob pretends to be robbed by Patrick, and then paint their Invisible Boatmobile (which was literally invisible until it was painted). Enraged by the constant annoyance that the sponge-starfish duo create, the duo attack SpongeBob and Patrick with several [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]], with the final one being the summoning of all the elderly people residing in the retirement home (who were once the &quot;creatures of the deep&quot; who assisted Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy on a regular basis). They form an angry mob, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick, making the sponge and starfish wrongly assume that the mob considers them heroes, and throw them away. Ultimately, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy decide to come out of retirement, though they decide to still reside in the retirement home.

However, Squidward proves to be a terrible chef, burning everything he touches, including [[milkshake]]s. Mr. Krabs goes to SpongeBob's house and gives him the ingredients to a Krabby Patty. After three days of frustration, he successfully makes a Krabby Patty. SpongeBob returns to the Krusty Krab when Bubble Bass orders another Patty and he claims that there are still no pickles. But SpongeBob discovers that Bubble Bass hid the pickles (all of the ones from both of the Krabby Patties that SpongeBob served him in this episode) under his tongue, apparently just to humiliate SpongeBob. Bubble Bass runs out of the Krusty Krab.

While doing so, they accidentally start up the rocket, causing Sandy to wake up and attempt to stop the duo. SpongeBob and Patrick fly into space, but they crash-land back into Bikini Bottom. But thinking that they're on the moon, SpongeBob forgets about Sandy and says that she's going to hate them for stealing her rocket, they capture many of Bikini Bottom's inhabitants, thinking it will impress Sandy, because they wrongly assume that they are &quot;aliens&quot; disguised as the Bikini Bottomites, and that they can't trust them. After capturing a lot of them, SpongeBob and Patrick begin to believe each other to be &quot;aliens&quot;, and Patrick, during an attempt to capture SpongeBob (who was about to capture Patrick), accidentally captures himself with a net, and SpongeBob puts him in the rocket. SpongeBob believes himself to be finished with his mission to capture as many &quot;aliens&quot; as possible, as there isn't any more room in the rocket to contain any more. SpongeBob travels into space (taking all of his hostages with him) and lands on the Moon, thinking he has returned to Bikini Bottom. But the rocket seems to have run out of fuel, and SpongeBob sees the moon, but looks up and sees Earth.

SpongeBob tells Squidward it is &quot;'Employee of the Month' Day&quot;, however Squidward tells SpongeBob that the award is a scam to make him work harder for no money (this is true), but SpongeBob denies this and says that Mr Krabs gives it to him because he works harder. Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob (who had won the Employee of the Month award 26 months in a row) that Squidward may win the award. SpongeBob tries to work harder so he could win, but instead flings the patties in the fan, spraying meat at Squidward (Probably because his worrying of not becoming Employee of the month). Squidward tells SpongeBob that the award is a joke, and when SpongeBob boasts that he is better than Squidward, the latter angrily vows that he will be the new Employee of the Month. They both decide to wake up earlier than each other. SpongeBob tries to destroy Squidward's alarm clock so he won't wake up, but Squidward has 58 more in his closet. They set up traps on each other the next day, but give in and run to The Krusty Krab. They overwork excessively and make so many Krabby Patties that they fill and destroy the Krusty Krab. Numerous customers think that they are free, after the explosion  but SpongeBob and Squidward are more concerned with who won the Employee of the Month award than stopping them.

Sandy is [[Homesickness|homesick]]. At the treedome, Sandy pulls a lever and the treedome closes. SpongeBob attempts to cheer her up by organizing a Texas-themed surprise party at the Krusty Krab. However, when they go to get Sandy, she is leaving Bikini Bottom to go to [[Texas]] and they desperately try to get her to stay. 

When SpongeBob and Patrick insult [[Texas]], they anger Sandy and she chases them. SpongeBob and Patrick take this to their advantage by leading her to the Krusty Krab in the process. She sees the awkward attempts at organizing a Texas-themed party (which involves some unwitting misinterpretations of Texan culture) which Sandy laughs at. But Sandy feels proud of them for at least trying to make her feel good, and finally feels at home with her Bikini Bottom friends because they care about her.

Wanting to build a new restaurant called &quot;The Mega Bucket&quot; on the beach of Goo Lagoon, Plankton teaches SpongeBob how to be aggressive, tricking him into believe that others will like it when he is being aggressive to them. After making everyone leave the beach, SpongeBob learns of Plankton's true motives. SpongeBob, out of guilt, brings everyone back by being &quot;positively assertive&quot; (nice). Plankton is sickened by all of this kindness, so he leaves.

Squidward realizes that he must set things right to ease his conscience. After much effort, Squidward manages to apologize to SpongeBob, only to find that the whole thing was an April Fool's joke set up by SpongeBob.

While at the Fry Cook Museum, SpongeBob pulls a legendary spatula out of a bucket of grease, summoning King Neptune. He isn't pleased to find that SpongeBob is the one destined to be his eternal fry cook. After some goading by Patrick, King Neptune challenges SpongeBob to prove his ability, risking his freedom to cook. SpongeBob takes him up on the offer, but quickly loses the race to make a total of one thousand burgers. Feeling victorious, Neptune passes his burgers out to all the spectators, only to find that they taste terrible (even he is disgusted by one of his own burgers). Tasting SpongeBob's burger, King Neptune declares him the winner. But SpongeBob doesn't want to accept the king's request to leave his friends behind, so SpongeBob has King Neptune employed at The Krusty Krab and teaches him to make Krabby Patties.

Mr. Krabs comes into the Krusty Krab warning everybody of the fishing hooks arriving into the waters surrounding Bikini Bottom. Patrick encourages SpongeBob to play on them, thinking they are not dangerous and are covered with free cheese. When SpongeBob refuses still, Patrick tells him to &quot;Lighten up, will ya!&quot; and when Patrick attempts to take more Cheese he is pulled up to the surface. SpongeBob cries sadly until he runs into Patrick again. Patrick says he jumped off and floated down before he reached the surface and it is fun. SpongeBob warms up to play &quot;Hooky&quot; with Patrick. Mr. Krabs discovers that SpongeBob has taken a break from the Krusty Krab to go play with them. When he finds SpongeBob and Patrick out on the hooks, he scolds them from doing it again. The next day, Patrick continues to play on the hooks and SpongeBob soon joins him. He finds the hook has snagged his pants and begs for Mr. Krabs' help, for which Mr. Krabs advises him to take off his pants. He finally gives in, running home embarrassed and [[nude]]. After SpongeBob runs, Patrick returns from playing, only to be returned inside a can of [[tuna]] (He humorously asked &quot;Does somebody have a [[can opener]]?&quot;).
