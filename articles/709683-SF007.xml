Issues with [[ease of use]], [[Robustness (computer science)|stability]], and [[computer security|security]] of the company's software are common targets for critics. In the 2000s, a number of [[malware]] attacks have targeted security flaws in [[Microsoft Windows]] and other programs. Microsoft is also accused of locking vendors and consumers into their products, and of not following and complying with existing standards in its software.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecis-ms-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf |title=Microsoft A History of Anticompetitive Behavior and Consumer Harm |accessdate=2009-05-25 |date=2009-03-31 |format=PDF |publisher=European Committee for Interoperable Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|title=Writing history with Microsoft's Office lock-in}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total cost of ownership]] comparisons of [[Linux]] as well as [[Mac OS X]] to Windows are a continuous [[Studies related to Microsoft|point of debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cioupdate.com/article.php/10493_1477911 |title=Linux TCO: Less Than Half The Cost of Windows |accessdate=2009-05-29 |last=Orzech |first=Dan |date=2009-04-29 |work=CIO Updates }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has been the subject of numerous [[lawsuits]] by several governments and other companies for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the [[European Union]] found Microsoft guilty in the [[European Union Microsoft competition case]]. Additionally, [[EULA]]s for Microsoft programs are often criticized as being too restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/420|accessdate=2009-07-16|first=Scott|last=Granneman|title=Surprises Inside Microsoft Vista's EULA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vendor lock-in==
From its inception, Microsoft defined itself as a platform company and understood the importance of attracting third-party programmers. It did so by providing development tools, training, access to proprietary [[application programming interface|API]]s in early versions, and partner programs. Although the resulting ubiquity of Microsoft software allows a user to benefit from [[network effect]]s, critics decry what they consider to be an &quot;[[embrace, extend and extinguish]]&quot; strategy by Microsoft of adding proprietary features to open standards, thereby using its market dominance to gain ''de facto'' ownership of standards &quot;extended&quot; in this way.&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDExecExtinguish&quot;&gt;{{cite news |

Microsoft software is also presented as a &quot;safe&quot; choice for IT managers purchasing software systems. In an internal memo for senior management Microsoft's head of [[C++]] development, Aaron Contorer, stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.com.com/2100-1016-5197411.html|title=EU report takes Microsoft to task|accessdate=2006-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The [[Windows API]] is so broad, so deep, and so functional that most [[independent software vendor|Independent Software Vendors]] would be crazy not to use it. And it is so deeply embedded in the source code of many Windows apps that there is a huge switching cost to using a different operating system instead... It is this switching cost that has given the customers the patience to stick with Windows through all our mistakes, our buggy drivers, our high TCO ([[total cost of ownership]]), our lack of a sexy vision at times, and many other difficulties [...] Customers constantly evaluate other desktop platforms, [but] it would be so much work to move over that they hope we just improve Windows rather than force them to move. In short, without this exclusive franchise called the Windows API, we would have been dead a long time ago.}}

More recently, Microsoft had their [[OOXML]] specification approved by the [[ISO]] standards body in a manner consistent with previous attempts to control standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groklaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071023002351958 |title=How to Get Your Platform Accepted as a Standard - Microsoft Style |author=Pamela Jones |publisher=[[Groklaw]] News |date=2008-02-17 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright enforcement==
When Microsoft discovered that its first product, [[Altair BASIC]], was subject to widespread [[Copyright infringement of software|illegal copying]], Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]] wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] that openly accused many hobbyists of stealing software. Gates's letter provoked many responses, with some hobbyists objecting to the broad accusation, and others supporting the principle of compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

This disagreement over whether software should be proprietary continues into the present day under the banner of the [[free software]] movement, with Microsoft characterizing free software released under the terms of the GPL as being &quot;potentially viral&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/25/open_source_terror_stalks_microsofts/|title=Open source terror stalks Microsoft's lawyers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[GNU General Public License]] itself as a &quot;[[viral license]]&quot; which &quot;infects&quot; proprietary software and forces its developer to have to release proprietary source to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/34292.html|title=The EULA, the GPL and the Wisdom of Fortune Cookies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Halloween documents]], internal Microsoft memos which were leaked to the open source community beginning in 1998, indicate that some Microsoft employees perceive [[free software|&quot;open source&quot; software]] â in particular, [[Linux]] â as a growing long-term threat to Microsoft's position in the software industry. The Halloween documents acknowledged that parts of Linux are superior to the versions of Microsoft Windows available at the time, and outlined a strategy of &quot;de-commoditize[ing] protocols &amp; applications.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZDExecExtinguish&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GroklawAlepin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DobbsExtinguish&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IWKerberos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/ Halloween Document 8&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Microsoft stated in its 2006 Annual Report that it was a defendant in at least 35 patent infringement lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/ar06/staticversion/10k_fr_not_16.html MSFT Annual Report 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company's litigation expenses for April 2004 through March 2007 exceed $4.3 billion: over $4 billion in payouts, plus $300 million in legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Patent Payouts | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/patent-tax.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern of critics is that Microsoft may be using the distribution of [[shared source|shared source software]] to harvest names of developers who have been exposed to Microsoft code, as some believe that these developers could someday be the target of lawsuits if they were ever to participate in the development of competing products. This issue is addressed in published papers from several organizations including the [[American Bar Association]] and the [[Open Source Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.abanet.org/intelprop/spring2004/course_materials/02_webbink.pdf|title=Open Source Software - A Legal Framework ([[PDF]] format)|accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/shared_source.php|title=Shared Source: A Dangerous Virus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, Microsoft was accused of maintaining &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;secret&quot; APIs: interfaces to its operating system software that it deliberately keeps undocumented to gain a competitive advantage in its application software products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper

In response to court orders, Microsoft has published interfaces between components of its operating system software, including components like Internet Explorer, [[Active Directory]], and [[Windows Media]] that sell as part of Windows but compete with application software.

==Licensing agreements==
{{Main|Windows refund}}

A common complaint&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestpricecomputers.ltd.uk/products/nowindows.htm |title=Buying without Windows-Don't want Windows? |publisher=Best Price Computers Ltd |date=February 2007 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/121046/computing_without_windows.html |title=Computing Without Windows |author=Desmond, Michael |publisher=PC World Communications, Inc. |date=May 31, 2005 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] comes from those who want to purchase a computer without a copy of Windows pre-installed, because they already own another copy of Windows available to install (ex: pre-ordered an upcoming version of Windows) or intend to use another operating system instead (such as [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenSolaris]] or any other [[Free software|libre-free]] [[open source]] [[Operating System|OS]]). Since free operating systems provide strong competition to Windows, which is a non free OS, Microsoft tries to force users not to choose an operating system by creating a market where most computers shipped from [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s come with Windows preinstalled, and by secretly agreeing with OEMs by means of rebates, to make it very hard to receive a Windows refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lists.essential.org/info-policy-notes/msg00005.html |title=why PC manufacturers don't sell non MS products? | date=February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/10/23/13219/110 |title=Microsoft's Dirty OEM-Secret | date=October 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many computer manufacturers have begun to offer specific product ranges with [[Linux]] pre-installed (these include [[HP]], [[Lenovo]], [[Dell]], [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Micro-Star International|MSI]], [[Intel]], and others), finding such a computer from a major OEM may prove challenging. While vendors sell certain models bundled with Linux, these are often limited to high-end [[workstation]]s and [[Enterprise architecture|enterprise]] servers, or budget, domestic models. Dell, for example, sells Linux pre-installed on home systems, but it is only offered on a limited number of models and configurations and Dell also explicitly warns prospective buyers that &quot;The main thing to note is that when you choose open source you don't get a Windows operating system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dell.com/ubuntu/ |title=Dell Home &amp; Home Office {{!}} Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So while in theory computers with free operating systems can be obtained, nonetheless, most large computer vendors continue to [[Product bundling|bundle]] Microsoft Windows with the majority of the personal computers in their ranges. The Findings of Fact in the [[United States Microsoft antitrust case]] established that &quot;One of the ways Microsoft combats piracy is by advising OEMs that they will be charged a higher price for Windows unless they drastically limit the number of PCs that they sell without an operating system pre-installed. In 1998, all major OEMs agreed to this restriction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm |title=U.S. v. Microsoft: Court's Findings of Fact}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been called the &quot;Windows tax&quot; or &quot;Microsoft tax&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070525-windows-tax-is-50-according-to-dell-linux-pc-pricing.html  |title=Dell goes Ubuntu; &quot;Windows tax&quot; is $50 according to pricing |author=Jeremy Reimer |date=May 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/159/1017159/cost-of-windows-tax-calculated |title=Cost of Windows tax calculated |author=Charlie Demerjian |date=3 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some smaller OEMs and larger retail chains have taken advantage of the paucity of non-Windows offerings by major suppliers by specializing in Linux-based systems. Some Linux distributors also run 'partnership' programs to endorse suppliers of machines with their system preinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webapps.ubuntu.com/partners/system/ |title=Find Ubuntu partners around the world |work=Ubuntu Partners |publisher=Canonical Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sun Microsystems]], which supports OpenSolaris distribution, runs a partnership program with [[Toshiba]] which provides Toshiba laptops with OpenSolaris preinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.opensolaris.com/toshibanotebook/ |title=Toshiba OpenSolaris Laptops}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows tax can also be avoided by assembling a computer from separately purchased parts, thus not buying it from an OEM. This however requires extra effort and technical knowledge, and is even more difficult in case of a [[laptop]]. Another option is buying a preassembled [[white box (computer hardware)|white box]] machine.

An end user can return [[Windows refund|Windows for a refund]] by refusing to agree to the Microsoft [[Software license agreement|End User License Agreement]]. The Microsoft EULA specifically mentions that if you do not agree to the license you can return the product for a full refund. Vendors may have a policy of charging for the provision of the refund such that the balance received by the customer is as low as $10,&lt;ref name=&quot;win-refund&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7040 |title=Getting a Windows Refund in California Small Claims Court |accessdate=2008-08-03 |publisher=Linux Journal | author=Steve Oualline |date=30 July 2003 | quote=Thanks to good records and a Small Claims judge, Steve Oualline got a $199 refund for his unused copy of Microsoft Windows XP.

==Acquisitions==
Microsoft has [[mergers and acquisitions|acquired]] [[List of acquisitions by Microsoft|several companies]] and products during its history, including some that competed with earlier Microsoft products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/acquisitions/history.mspx|title=Microsoft's list of companies it has acquired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such acquired assets include [[MS-DOS|DOS]] (Seattle Computer Products QDOS), [[Microsoft FrontPage|FrontPage]] (Vermeer Technologies Incorporated FrontPage), [[MSN TV|WebTV]] (now MSN TV), [[Hotmail]], [[Direct3D]], [[Internet Explorer]] (Spyglass, Inc. Mosaic), [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] (Visio Corporation Visio), [[Windows Virtual PC]] ([[Connectix]] Virtual PC), and [[Windows Defender]] (GIANT Company Software, Inc. GIANT AntiSpyware). Microsoft rebrands the primary products of the companies it acquires, and in many cases offers them for free or bundles them with their operating system. Former [[Sun Microsystems]] chief executive [[Scott McNealy]] occasionally remarked that Microsoft never produced technology except by buying it: &quot;R&amp;D [research and development] and M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] are the same thing over there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

==Litigation==
{{Main|Microsoft litigation}}
Microsoft's market dominance and business practices have attracted widespread resentment, which is not necessarily restricted to the company's competitors. In a 2003 publication, [[Dan Geer]] argued the prevalence of Microsoft products has resulted in a [[Monoculture (computer science)|monoculture]] which is dangerously easy for viruses to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccianet.org/papers/cyberinsecurity.pdf draft 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor practices==
[[Image:Microsoft sign closeup.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to Microsoft's Redmond campus]]
While Microsoft's permanent workers enjoy some of the best corporate treatment, a large part of Microsoft's labor pool exists outside this privileged class.  This includes the use of [[permatemp]] employees (employees employed for years as &quot;temporary,&quot; and therefore without medical benefits), use of [[forced retention]] tactics, where departing employees would be sued to prevent departure, as well as more traditional cost-saving measures, ranging from cutting medical benefits, to not providing towels in company locker rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm|title=Troubling Exits At Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a &quot;Velvet Sweatshop&quot;, a term which originated in a Seattle Times article in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Andrews | first=Paul | title=A 'Velvet Sweatshop' or a High-Tech Heaven? | date=23 April 1989 | publisher=The Seattle Times | url=http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1980s/89/890423.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Editor's note, MSJ August 1997 | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0897/ednote0897.aspx | accessdate=September 27, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the idea is that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. For example, the [[kitchenette]]s have free beverages and many buildings include exercise rooms and showers. However, the accusation is that they try to keep employees at the company for unreasonably long hours and working too much. This is detailed in several books about Microsoft, including &quot;[[Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire]].&quot;

A US state lawsuit was brought against Microsoft in 1992 representing 8,558 current and former employees that had been classified as &quot;temporary&quot; and &quot;freelance&quot;, and became known as ''Vizcaino v. Microsoft''. In 1993, the suit became a US Federal Class Action in the United States District Court Western District Of Washington At Seattle as No. C93-178C. The Final Settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; came in 2005. The case was decided on the (IRS-defined) basis that such &quot;permatemps&quot; had their jobs defined by Microsoft, worked alongside regular employees doing the same work, and worked for long terms. After a series of court setbacks including three reversals on appeal, Microsoft settled the suit for US $93 million.

A side effect of the &quot;permatemp&quot; lawsuit is that now contract employees are prevented from participating in team morale events and other activities that could be construed as making them &quot;employees&quot;. They are also limited to one year contracts and must leave after that time for 100 days before returning under contract.

Microsoft is the largest American corporate user of H-1B guest worker visas and has joined other large technology companies like Google in recently lobbying for looser [[H-1B visa]] restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/473893dc-ccde-11db-a938-000b5df10621.html Gates warns on US immigration curbs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070607-senators-companies-with-mass-layoffs-shouldnt-hire-more-foreign-workers.html Senators: Companies with &quot;mass layoffs&quot; shouldn't hire more foreign workers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/23/AR2007022301697.html How to Keep America Competitive, by Bill Gates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising and public relations==
Microsoft contributes money to several think tanks, including the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]] and the [[Alexis de Tocqueville Institution]]. Critics allege that while giving the appearance of neutral third parties these organizations work to [[fear, uncertainty, and doubt|undermine]] Microsoft's competitors, for example stating &quot;open-source software may offer [a] target for terrorists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.com.com/Linux+makes+a+run+for+government/2100-1001_3-950083.html|title=Linux makes a run for government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39155268,00.htm|title=Report on Linux origins falls at the starting gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_20/b3681219.htm|title=Microsoft's All-Out Counterattack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) of the [[United Kingdom]] ordered Microsoft to stop a run of print ads that claimed that the total cost of ownership of Linux servers was ten times that of Windows Server 2003. The comparison included the cost of hardware, and put Linux at a disadvantage by installing it on more expensive but poorer-performing hardware compared to that used for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=38475|title=Non-broadcast Adjudication|accessdate=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3400131|title=Microsoft Ordered to Pull Anti-Linux Ad|accessdate=2006-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 24, 2007, [[Rick Jelliffe]] [http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/01/an_interesting_offer.html made claim on his blog] that a Microsoft employee offered to pay him to make corrections in [[Wikipedia]] articles concerning [[Office Open XML]]. Microsoft spokesperson Catherine Brooker expressed the belief that the article had been &quot;heavily written&quot; by IBM employees who supported the rival OpenDocument format, though she provided no specific evidence. [[Internet]] entrepreneur and [[Wikimedia]] founder [[Jimmy Wales]] described Microsoft's offer as unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16775981/|title=Microsoft offers cash for Wikipedia edit|author=Brian Bergstein|authorlink=Brian Bergstein|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blacklisting of journalists==
{{quote|In the 1980s, the company was notorious for keeping [[Richard Nixon|Nixonian]] lists regarding journalists on a [[whiteboard]] showing which were &quot;Okay,&quot; &quot;Sketchy,&quot; or &quot;Needs work.&quot; Some believed that those in the last category would be the target of the company in an effort to get them fired. I myself was on a Microsoft [[blacklist]] for some totally unknown reason and was not allowed any information about an early version of Windows, apparently because I was considered uncooperative. I only found out about this because of documents unearthed during the discovery process of the Comes v. Microsoft lawsuit in Iowa. [...] threats from the company did manage to get me removed as a licensed columnist in PC Magazine Italy.| [[John C. Dvorak]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2325778,00.asp Microsoft, the Spandex Granny - Columns by PC Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|[I was] blacklisted by Microsoft for writing a story based on an internal memo penned by [[Mark Lucovsky]] (now with Google, ironically) that acknowledged 63,000 bugs were still left in Windows 2000 when the product [was] shipped. I was barred from executive interviews at the Windows 2000 launch as a result of my story. My &quot;punishment&quot; lasted for a few years. Certain Windows execs refused to speak to me or meet with me for ages because of that story. I believed, and still believe, that I was just doing my job as a reporter.| [[Mary Jo Foley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windows-now.com/blogs/robert/archive/2006/09/20/Mary-Jo-Foley-Exit-Interview.aspx Mary Jo Foley: The Exit Interview - Robert McLaws: Windows Vista Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Censorship in China==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Internet censorship in the United States]] --&gt;
Microsoft (along with [[Google]], [[Yahoo]], [[Cisco]], AOL, [[Skype]], and other companies) has cooperated with the Chinese government in implementing a system of [[Internet censorship in mainland China|Internet censorship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/ | title=Corporate Complicity in Chinese Internet Censorship | accessdate=2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Human rights advocates such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and media groups such as [[Reporters Without Borders]] criticized the companies, noting for example that it is &quot;ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/08/09/china13940.htm|title=China: Internet Companies Aid Censorship|accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worker productivity software==
Microsoft has also come under criticism for developing software capable of analyzing the output of remote sensors in order to measure the competence and productivity of workers based on their physical responses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article3193480.ece Times online] Article: Microsoft seeks patent for office 'spy' software Alexi Mostrous and David Brown January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gay reference controversy ==

Microsoft has recently come under some criticism for its attitude to [[homosexuality]] and Xbox Live. Users may not use the string &quot;gay&quot; in a gamertag (even in a non-homosexual context, for example as part of a surname), or refer to homosexuality in their profile (including self-identifying as such), as the company considers this &quot;content of a sexual nature&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; to other users and therefore unsuitable for the service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/390593/thegayergamer-gets-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-explains Kotaku - &quot;theGAYERGamer&quot; Gets Xbox Live Ban, Microsoft Explains - Xbox Live&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5010324/microsoft-explains-gaywood-ban Kotaku - Microsoft Explains &quot;Gaywood&quot; Ban - Controversy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumerist.com/5160187/identifying-yourself-as-a-lesbian-gets-you-banned-on-xbox-live Consumerist - Identifying Yourself As A Lesbian Gets You Banned On XBOX Live - Gay&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  After banning 'Teresa', a lesbian gamer who had been harassed by other users for being a homosexual, this policy gained wide condemnation.
A senior Xbox Live team member, Stephen Toulouse, has clarified the policy, stating that &quot;Expression of any sexual orientation [...] is not allowed in gamertags&quot; but that they are &quot;examining how we can provide it in a way that wont [sic] get misused&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5160677/microsoft-looking-to-change-xbox-live-sexual-discrimination Kotaku - Microsoft Looking To Change Xbox Live Sexual &quot;Discrimination&quot; - Xbox 360&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=530 &quot;Xbox LIVE policy and Gamertags/Profiles Redux&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  GLAAD weighed in on the controversy as well, supporting the steps that Microsoft has taken over the years to engage the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://glaadblog.org/2009/02/26/xbox-live-homophobia-and-online-gaming-policy/ &quot;XBox Live, Homophobia, and Online Gaming Policy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website concerns==
Polish users of Microsoft's Business Productivity Infrastructure website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/businessproductivity/default.mspx |title=Microsoft: Optimize Your Business Productivity Infrastructure, English version |accessdate=2009-08-25 |work=Website |publisher=Microsoft Corporation  }}&lt;/ref&gt; have noticed a white model's face has been [[Photoshopping|photoshopped]] over the head of the African American model at center in the photograph on the main page of the [[Polish language]] version of the website.  The website [http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com Photoshop Disasters] covered the story on 25 August 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/2009/08/microsoft-poland-at-least-they-left.html |title=Photoshop Disasters: &quot;Microsoft Poland: At Least They Left The Asian Guy In&quot; |accessdate=2009-08-26 |work=Website |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=2009-08-25  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1:00 A.M. GMT on 25 August, this has been changed and the image on the Polish website now reflects the image on the English website.  Microsoft later issued an apology regarding the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ciol.com/Global-News/News-Reports/Microsoft-apologizes-for-web-photo-racism/26809124128/0/ |title=Microsoft apologizes for web photo racism |accessdate=2009-08-26 |work=Website |publisher=CIOL News |date=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spokesman Lou Gellos stated that Microsoft was &quot;looking into the details of this situation.&quot;  The apology was later restated on Microsoft's official Twitter page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/3546312485 |title=The Official Microsoft Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;: &quot;Marketing site photo mistake - sincere apologies - we're in the process of taking down the image.&quot;

The reasons for the original change still remain unknown.
