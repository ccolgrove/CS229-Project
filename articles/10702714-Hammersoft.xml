The '''2007â08 Celtic League''' (known as the '''2007â08 Magners League''' for sponsorship reasons) was the seventh [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]] season and the second with [[Magners]] as title sponsor. The season began on 31 August 2007 and finished on the weekend beginning 10 May 2008. Some disruption to fixtures occurred as a result of the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], which took place during September and October 2007.

The teams competing were the same as the previous season with one exception; only two Scottish teams participated, as the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] scrapped the [[Border Reivers (rugby)|Border Reivers]] region at the end of the [[2006â07 Celtic League|2006â07]] season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/scottish/6498449.stm Scottish union axes Borders team]&lt;/ref&gt; As in previous seasons, the league was played on a home and away basis, with teams earning four points for a win, and a bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match. The losing team may also earn a bonus point if they lose by seven points or less. The losing bonus point system is intended to ensure that both teams compete fully in all matches.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The ten teams competing were the four Irish provinces: [[Munster Rugby|Munster]], [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]] and [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]]; two Scottish regions: [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and [[Glasgow Warriors]]; and four Welsh regions: [[Scarlets|Llanelli Scarlets]], [[Cardiff Blues]], [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] and [[Newport Gwent Dragons]].

==Pre-season==
Following the end of the [[2006â07 Celtic League]] season, a number of controversial events occurred in Celtic rugby. Mike Phillips moved from the Cardiff Blues to the Ospreys, in a move that would earn him Â£180,000 a year. The Border Reivers was officially closed as a rugby club, and Edinburgh Rugby were almost expelled from the competition, because of a row with the Scottish Rugby Union.

As a result of increased revenue from governing bodies and TV rights, most clubs were able to expand their squads with the signing of several new players.
