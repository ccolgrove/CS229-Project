'''Hawaiian Gardens''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is the smallest city in the county (approximately 1.0&amp;nbsp;miÂ²) and was incorporated on April 9, 1964. The population was 14,254 at the 2010 census, down from 14,779 at the 2000 census.  

The town's unusual name originated in a 1920s refreshment stand that was decorated with palm fronds and bamboo. It was the then-rural area's main landmark for many years, and its name stuck as the small town grew up around it. As one of seven Los Angeles County cities that allow casino gambling, more than $9.2 million (65%) of the city's revenue comes from the Hawaiian Gardens Casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hgcity.org/Budgets/0607BudgetWhole.pdf |title=Budget Summary |accessdate=2006-12-31 |author=City of Hawaiian Gardens |date=13 |year=2006 |month=7 |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
