The 1899 football season at VMI was cut short by an outbreak of typhoid fever on the campus. As reported by one account: &quot;VMI had time to crush only Washington and Lee 39â0 before the 1899 season was abruptly ended by an outbreak of typhoid fever which closed the Institute for six weeks.&quot;&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite web|title=George C.
