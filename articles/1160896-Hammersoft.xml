'''Zurich Financial Services AG''' ({{SWX|ZURN}}) is a major [[financial services]] group based in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].

==History==
The Company was founded in 1872 as subsidiary of the ''Schweiz Marine Insurance Company'' under the name ''Versicherung Verein'' (''Insurance Club'').&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.zurich.com/main/about/whoweare/history/chronology.htm Zurich Financial Services: Timeline] (Note: Could not review this reference on May 10, 2011 due to the linked page requiring a login id and password.) &lt;/ref&gt; The Company changed its name to ''Zurich Marine and Accident Insurance'' in 1875&lt;ref name=history/&gt; and to ''Zurich General Accident and Liability Insurance'' in 1894.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 1982 the Company acquired Altstadt Compagnie d'Assurances SA in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zurich.ch/site/fr/zurich/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the Company acquired ''British American Financial Services'', a business owned by [[British American Tobacco|BAT Industries]] comprising [[Eagle Star Insurance|Eagle Star]] (acquired in 1984), [[Allied Dunbar]] (acquired in 1985) and the [[Farmers Group, Inc.]] (acquired in 1988), for $18.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/17/business/fi-43588 Zurich to pay BAT $18.6bn for finance units]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the structure of business, which had previously involved dual holding companies (Allied Zurich plc in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and Zurich Allied AG in [[Switzerland]]), was unified to form one holding company - ''Zurich Financial Services''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zurich.com/main/media/newsreleases/2000/english/article81.htm Unification of companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Zurich]] launched its biggest global campaign, and while some of the messaging is about the health of the company's balance sheet (when it recovered, it focused on its core business and avoided risky growth strategies), the effort was developed mainly to assuage consumers' mistrust of the insurance companies in general.

In June 2010 Zurich announced it is creating 240 jobs in Ireland, according to Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Batt O'Keeffe TD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insideireland.ie/index.cfm/section/news/ext/zurichinsurance001/category_key/1086 Zurich creates 240 jobs in Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 Zurich Financial Services Group (Zurich) announced that it signed definitive agreements with Banco Santander SA (Santander) to enter into a long-term alliance of 25 years in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
