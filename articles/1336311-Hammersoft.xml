'''1233 ABC Newcastle''' (call sign: '''2NC''') is an Australian radio station. It is the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] station of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] local radio network, and is licensed to, and serving Newcastle and surrounding areas. It operates on the [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] band at 1233 [[kilohertz]]. Formerly known by its callsign 2NC, the NC in the callsign is short for '''''N'''''ew'''''c'''''astle, while the 2 represents the state of [[New South Wales]]. The station was established in 1930.

==History==
2NC was the very first regional radio station in Australia outside a capital city. It was set up by Adrian Jose.  The first broadcast occurred 19 December 1930, and played the Newcastle Symphony Orchestra playing the [[William Tell Overture]]. [[James Fenton]] acting as the [[prime minister of Australia]] gave a speech.  Local Newcastle content was limited to an hour a week and included news, market reports and church services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/03/07/2183117.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The station was heard in New Zealand.  Its original frequency was 1245&amp;nbsp;kHz or wavelength of 241 meters.  The power was 2&amp;nbsp;kW with a modulation of 85%.  The transmitting equipment was established by Keith Thow of [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19301231.2.27.5|newspaper=Evening Post|volume=CX|issue=155|date=31 December 1930|Page=4|title=2NC, Newcastle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The transmitting antenna is at [[Beresfield, New South Wales|Beresfield]].  It was designed to have a range of 25 miles, covering a population of 200,000.&lt;ref name=nrs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19300918.2.165.3|newspaper=Evening Post|volume=CX|issue=69|date=18 September 1930|Page=23|title=Newcastle Relay Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1931 [[2YB]] in [[New Plymouth, New Zealand]] was interfering with 2NC causing a [[heterodyne]] whistle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?d&amp;d=EP19310401.2.118.1|newspaper=Evening Post|volume=CXI|issue=77|date=1 April 1931|Page=19|title=Radio COntrol, The BBC Suggested As a Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early local content included the Newcastle Steel Works Band, the Newcastle Choral Society and the Newcastle Revellers.&lt;ref name=nrs/&gt;
