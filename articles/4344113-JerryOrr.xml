It took place from December 2002 to February 2003, although within this period the effectiveness of the call to strike varied. The main impact of the strike derived from the stoppage of the oil industry, in particular the state-run [[PDVSA]], which provides a majority of Venezuelan export revenue. The strike was preceded by the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'Ã©tat attempt]] in April 2002, and a one-day strike in October 2002.

==Buildup==
After April's [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'Ã©tat attempt]] conflict simmered throughout the rest of 2002. On 14 August the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]], in what appeared a politically motivated decision, absolved four military officers involved in the April coup. This set the scene for further actions by the military.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Fue Ã©sta una clara decisiÃ³n polÃ­tica y no jurÃ­dica del mÃ¡ximo tribunal, que abriÃ³ la puerta para una nueva aventura militar.&quot; (Lopez Maya 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human rights group [[PROVEA]] denounced the decision as a denial of justice &quot;only explicable by the politicisation of the court&quot;. &quot;Negar la posibilidad de  un  juicio cuando es pÃºblico y notorio  la  existencia  de   indicios de  comisiÃ³n del  delito de rebeliÃ³n militar serÃ­a un acto de impunidad de suma gravedad, sÃ³lo explicable por la politizaciÃ³n del TSJ de  la cual,  como hemos dicho,  el oficialismo es uno de sus principales responsables&quot; (PROVEA, 14 August 2002, cited in Lopez Maya 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October a one-day general strike (''paro'') took place (two general strikes had taken place in December 2001 and in April 2002&lt;ref&gt;''BBC'', 9 April 2002, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1918189.stm Venezuelan general strike extended]&lt;/ref&gt;), aimed at forcing the resignation of ChÃ¡vez or at least the calling of new elections.&lt;ref&gt;(Lopez Maya 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October 14 military officers who had been suspended for participating in the ''coup'', led by General Enrique Medina GÃ³mez, occupied the Francia Plaza in [[Altamira (Caracas)|Altamira]]. a wealthy Eastern Caracas neighbourhood, and declared it a &quot;liberated territory&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;LÃ³pez Maya, p 17; McCaughan, p 121.&lt;/ref&gt; They said they would not leave until ChÃ¡vez had resigned, and called on their colleagues in the military to take up arms against him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anunciaron que sÃ³lo abandonarÃ­an la plaza cuando cayera  ChÃ¡vez y llamaron a sus compaÃ±eros de armas a alzarse contra el gobierno.&quot; (Lopez Maya 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early November, there was a major clash of government and opposition demonstrators in downtown Caracas; and, in the middle of the month, a shootout which resulted in three deaths occurred in Caracas' Bolivar Plaza between the Metropolitan Police and the National Guard.&lt;ref&gt;LÃ³pez Maya, pp 17â18; McCaughan, p 120 has additional information on the conflict in and around the Metropolitain Police, who were controlled by the anti-ChÃ¡vez mayor of Caracas, [[Alfredo PeÃ±a]]. Sometime in November, ChÃ¡vez replaced the commissioner of the force, Henry Vivas, with Gonzalo SÃ¡nchez Delgado; whereupon the mayor ordered the police not to obey him.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil lockout/strike==
===Launch===
The [[Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica (Venezuela)|Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica]], led by the business federation [[FedecÃ¡maras]] and the trade union federation [[ConfederaciÃ³n de Trabajadores de Venezuela]] (CTV), called for a fourth ''paro cÃ­vico'', which turned out to be the most serious, and is known as the 2002â2003 oil lockout/strike, to begin on 2 December 2002. The opposition also called a recall-referendum-petition-signature-gathering day for 4 December.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McCaughan, ''The Battle of Venezuela''. London, 2004. p 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the strike had a mixed response, with affluent eastern Caracas seeing most shops closed, while downtown and western Caracas was busy; many business owners either supported ChÃ¡vez or put their business above politics. Early attempts to block a crucial navigation channel in [[Lake Maracaibo]], in order to paralyse the oil industry, were foiled by the navy. The [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] voted to hold a non-binding recall referendum on 2 February, but the [[Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica (Venezuela)|Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica]] chose to ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Bart (2008), ''Hugo! The Hugo Chavez Story From Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution'', London: [[The Bodley Head]], p374&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December the captain of a large oil tanker named for the beauty queen [[PilÃ­n LeÃ³n]] anchored in the Lake Maracaibo shipping channel and refused to move. The rest of PDVSA 13-ship fleet was quickly similarly grounded. Combined with the PDVSA management walkout, this effectively paralysed the Venezuelan oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2008:375)&lt;/ref&gt;

The key element of the ''paro'' was the stoppage of production at the state oil company [[PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA), which was effected by management's locking workers out of facilities, along with the shipping shutdown. Many low and mid-level employees ignored the strike and reported for work, INTESA, the information and technology enterprise that was formed to run electronic operations at ''Petr&amp;oacute;leos de Venezuela'', was at this time 60 per cent owned by a United States company, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which is &quot;closely linked to the U.S. government&quot;, with &quot;former chiefs of staff, ex-CIA agents, and high-level government employees comprising its board of directors.&quot; (Golinger, &quot;Machine&quot;, p 135.) Golinger reports that during the work stoppage, INTESA refused requests by ''Petr&amp;oacute;leos de Venezuela'' president Ali Rodriguez to provide him the computer access codes so that ''Petr&amp;oacute;leos'' employees could operate the company's machinery. Eventually, ''Petr&amp;oacute;leos'' employees had to enter INTESA headquarters and seize equipment to reestablish opertations. Source: Golinger, &quot;Machine&quot;, pp 135, 6, on INTESA; and Golinger, &quot;Media&quot;, p 100, on the management's activities.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous strikes, this oil strike included not only the PDVSA management but also substantial parts of its operational staff, including virtually all of its marine flotilla captains. Within days the company was paralyzed.

Petroleum production soon fell to one-third normal; Venezuela had to begin importing oil to meet its foreign obligations; and domestically, gasoline for cars became virtually unobtainable, with many filling stations closed and long queues at others.&lt;ref&gt;One third normal: McCaughan, p 126; gas shortages: LÃ³pez Maya, p 18. According to a previous version of this article, Venezuela's normal production of oil and oil derivatives before the strike was 2,800,000 barrels (450,000 m&amp;sup3;) per day&lt;/ref&gt; Many privately-owned businesses closed or went on short time, some out of sympathy for the strike, others because of the fuel shortage and economic paralysis. As long waits for [[gasoline]] became common, airlines cancelled many domestic flights, banks limited their opening hours, and many shops were shut despite it being peak Christmas shopping season. The Coordinadora adopted the slogan &quot;2002 without Christmas, 2003 without ChÃ¡vez&quot;.&lt;ref name=J376/&gt; 

The private television networks gave enormous coverage to the near-daily protest rallies and strike activities, as well as daily updates by the Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica. They also &quot;canceled regular advertisements and ran pro-strike, anti-ChÃ¡vez spots around the clock.&quot; [[VenevisiÃ³n]]'s president openly declared solidarity with the strike.&lt;ref name=J376/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golinger, &quot;Machine&quot;, p 133. She also writes, in &quot;Media War Against the People,&quot; (p 101) that &quot;The four primary stations suspended all regular programming throughout the duration of the 64-day strike: no product commercials, no soap operas, no movies, no cartoons, and no sitcoms. They broadcast an average of 700 pro-opposition advertisements each day, paid for by the stations themselves and by the opposition umbrella group, Democratic Coordinator.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A media war between the private networks and the state-run [[Venezolana de TelevisiÃ³n]] resulted, with for example the private networks declaring all universities and schools closed, while on VTV the Minister for Education declared them open.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Golinger]], [[Venezuelanalysis.com]], 25 September 2004, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/710 A Case Study of Media Concentration and Power in Venezuela]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 [[GlobovisiÃ³n]] was assessed $2.3m in back taxes for the opposition advertisements shown during this period.

===Indefinite strike===
Large pro- and anti-ChÃ¡vez marches were held in the first weeks of the strike. On 6 December a Portuguese taxi driver killed three and injured 28 at Plaza Altamira. The opposition blamed ChÃ¡vez, and the killings &quot;energized and radicalized the opposition movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=J376&gt;Jones (2008:376-7)&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December the opposition declared the strike to be of indefinite duration, and said that only ChÃ¡vez' resignation could end it.&lt;ref name=J376/&gt; 

As shortages of gasoline and later basic foods took hold, the government responded by developing an informal emergency import network with the support of other governments in the region.&lt;ref name=J378&gt;Jones (2008:378)&lt;/ref&gt; ChÃ¡vez also took an increasingly hard line with PDVSA in an attempt to break the strike. On 12 December he fired four PDVSA executives leading the strike; he had previously fired them and others in April before the coup, but reinstated them after the coup. He continued to dismiss striking executives and managers on a daily basis; 300 were gone by early January.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2008:378-9)&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to use the navy to take over the key ''PilÃ­n LeÃ³n'' tanker were initially thwarted by a lack of a qualified crew. On 19 December a team of retired seamen took command, and worked for two days to restart the ship, eventually successfully returning it to port. The departing crew &quot;had sabotaged the ship, leaving behind hard-to-notice traps in the computer system and elsewhere that could set off an explosion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2008:379â380)&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, the government restarted oil production by promoting lower-level employees, typically loyal to ChÃ¡vez or at least opposed to using the company as a political weapon. The company was also split into eastern and western parts, with the eastern Caracas headquarters, where striking executives and managers were concentrated, being heavily reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2008:382)&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to restart production were hampered by sabotage, which included changing electronic safety limits and the use of remote computers to interfere with reactivation attempts.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2008:380â381)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collapse===
By New Year, the strike was beginning to unravel, despite the still increasing scarcity of consumer goods. More and more small and medium businesses re-opened; many small businesses had never closed in the first place.&lt;ref name=J384/&gt; &quot;small- and medium-sized businesses reopened their doors, admitting that the strike now threatened to turn into a 'suicide watch' that could well bankrupt their businesses for good.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, p 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coordinadora attempted to promote a tax boycott (which the television networks supported); the government pointed out that tax evasion was a crime.&lt;ref name=J384/&gt; Towards the end of January the Coordinadora began to accept first privately and then publicly the partial re-opening of businesses and schools, and on 27 January the [[Caracas Stock Exchange]] re-opened for the first time in 9 weeks, for a few hours a day.&lt;ref name=J384/&gt; On 23 January a rally of several hundred thousand Chavistas took place.&lt;ref name=J384&gt;Jones (2008:384-5)&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the 11th anniversary of the 4 February 1992 coup attempt, the strike was virtually over outside the oil industry.&lt;ref name=J386&gt;Jones (2008:386)&lt;/ref&gt; The government gradually reestablished control over PDVSA; oil production reached pre-strike levels by April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, p 128, says April, but I seem to recall that this is disputed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the strike, the government fired 18,000 PDVSA employees, 40% of the company's workforce, for &quot;dereliction of duty&quot; during the strike.&lt;ref&gt;McCaughan, p 128; LÃ³pez Maya, p 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrest warrants were issued for the presidents of [[Fedecamaras]] (Carlos Fernandez) and the CTV ([[Carlos Ortega]]). Involvement in government efforts to maintain food and gasoline distribution saw turning points in the careers of leading businessmen [[Ricardo FernÃ¡ndez Barrueco]] and [[Wilmer Ruperti]] respectively.

After the February 2003 collapse of the strike, the [[Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica (Venezuela)|Coordinadora DemocrÃ¡tica]] (CD) was much more willing to participate in the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) &quot;mesa&quot; dialogue process which had been set up following the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'Ã©tat attempt]]. The CD pushed for a binding recall referendum under Article 72 of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]], which was ultimately agreed on 23 May 2003,&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Andrew F. Cooper, and Thomas Legler (2005), &quot;A Tale of Two Mesas: The OAS Defense of Democracy in Peru and Venezuela,&quot; ''Global Governance'' 11(4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OAS, [http://www.oas.org/OASpage/eng/Venezuela/Agreement052303en.htm Agreement Between the Representatives of the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the Political and Social Groups Supporting It, and the Coordinadora Democratica  and the Political and Civil Society Organizations Supporting It], Caracas, 23 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and took place in August 2004.

The strike produced severe economic dislocation. The country's GDP fell 27% during the first four months of 2003, and it cost the oil industry $13.3bn.&lt;ref name=J386/&gt; Open unemployment, which was running about 15% before and after the shutdown, reached 20.3% in March 2003; the volume of crude oil produced was 5% less in 2003 than the previous year; and the volume of refined oil products was 17% less.&lt;ref&gt;LÃ³pez Maya, p 19. Oil figures from OPEC, ''Annual Statistical Bulletin, 2004'', tables 14, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; During the lockout Venezuela had, for the first time in the country's history, defaulted on its international petroleum supply contracts, unable to meet its commitments â including to its principal customer, the United States.&lt;ref name=J376/&gt;

The informal network importing basic goods which the government developed during the strike went on to provide the basis for [[Mission Mercal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldia.es/2003-01-28/venezuela/venezuela0.htm|title=ChÃ¡vez asegura que podrÃ­a empuÃ±ar las armas para defender la revoluciÃ³n|date=28 January 2006|publisher=''El PaÃ­s''|accessdate=19 March 2009|quote=&quot;Ya estamos desarrollando e instalando un sistema integral pleno, nacional, de distribuciÃ³n de alimentos y de medicinas, para que no haya escasez&quot;}}{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the transformation of [[PDVSA]] had lasting political consequences, enabling the government to make much more direct use of PDVSA revenues: 
between 2004 and 2010 PDVSA contributed $61.4 billion to social development funds, with around half of this going directly to various [[Bolivarian Missions]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Venezuelanalysis.com]]'', 5 August 2010, [http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5554 Auditors: Venezuelaâs State Oil Company Recovering from Oil Price Slump]&lt;/ref&gt;
