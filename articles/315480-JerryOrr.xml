A '''jurisdictional strike''' is a term in [[United States]] [[labor law]] that refers to a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a [[trade union|union]] to assert its members' right to particular job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Robert Emmett.

''Roberts' Dictionary of Industrial Relations.'' 4th ed. Washington, D.C.: BNA Books, 1994. ISBN 0871797771&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Taft-Hartley Act|Taft-Hartley amendments]] to the [[National Labor Relations Act]] empowered the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to resolve such jurisdictional disputes and authorized the General Counsel of the NLRB to seek an [[injunction]] barring such strikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot;&gt;Cox, Archibald; Bok, Derek Curtis; Gorman, Robert A.; et al.

ISBN 0023986913&lt;/ref&gt; The NLRB, almost without exception, resolves jurisdictional disputes on the basis of the employer's preference in assigning work, with efficiency, custom and practice, and contractual obligations playing at most a secondary role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox&quot; /&gt;

Jurisdictional strikes occur most frequently in the United States in the construction industry. Construction unions frequently resolve those disputes through a privately created adjustment system.&lt;ref&gt;Palladino, Grace.

In Australia jurisdiction strikes are called [[demarcation disputes]].
