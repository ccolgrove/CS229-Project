The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Tennessee Titans]] season''' is the 50th season for the original [[American Football League]] team, their 40th in the NFL, and 13th in Tennessee. The Titans aimed to equal or improve on their 2008 NFL best 13â3 record; however, they lost the first 6 games of that season. The Titans won 7 out of their next 8 games before a 42â17 loss to the Chargers in Week 16 eliminated the team from playoff contention.

Second-year running back [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]] won the [[List of NFL rushing champions|NFL rushing title]] with 2,006 rushing yards, and set the NFL record for most [[yards from scrimmage]] in a single season, with 2,509.

==Schedule==
The Titans played the [[Buffalo Bills]] on August 8 in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], pitting teams owned by [[Bud Adams]] (Titans) and [[Ralph C. Wilson, Jr.]] (Bills). They are the only surviving members of the ''&quot;[[Foolish Club]]&quot;'', the eight original owners of American Football League franchises. The 2009 Professional Football season will celebrate what would have been the AFL's 50th.  Both the Bills and Titans wore AFL throwbacks, with the Titans in [[Houston Oilers]] uniforms.

Still looking for their first win of the season, the Titans flew to [[Gillette Stadium]], donned Oilers throwback uniforms, and played a Week 6 AFL Legacy game with the [[New England Patriots]] in a rare October snowstorm. Tennessee's struggles continued as Patriots running back [[Laurence Maroney]] got a 45-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] making a 33-yard field goal.  Things got worse for the Titans in the second quarter as quarterback [[Tom Brady]] completed five touchdown passes, two to wide receiver [[Randy Moss]] (40-yard and 28-yard), one to running back [[Kevin Faulk]] (38-yard), and two to wide receiver [[Wes Welker]] (30-yard and 5-yard).  New England would then conclude their scoring in the third quarter with Brady's 9-yard touchdown pass to Moss, followed by backup quarterback [[Brian Hoyer]]'s one-yard touchdown run.

With the loss, not only did the Titans go into the bye week at 0â6 (their first such start since 1984), but they suffered their worst loss in franchise history, eclipsing a 61â7 loss to Cincinnati in 1989, when the team was the Houston Oilers. This was the first 59â0 game since 1976, and only the fourth in NFL history.

Tennessee got off to a fast start in the first quarter with kicker [[Rob Bironas]] booting a 48-yard field goal.
