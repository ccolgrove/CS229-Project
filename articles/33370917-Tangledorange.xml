'''Occupy Atlanta''' is a protest and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] that began on October 6, 2011 in [[Woodruff Park]], located in [[Downtown Atlanta|downtown]] [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]]. It is inspired by the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement that began in New York City on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rankin |first=Bill |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/occupy-atlanta-settles-into-1197017.html |title=Occupy Atlanta settles into Woodruff Park |publisher=ajc.com |date=2011-10-08 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/abraham/2011/10/08/occupy-atlanta-is-occupy-wall-st-in-the-atl/?gta=commentlistpos#commentlistpos |title=Occupy Atlanta is Occupy Wall Street in the ATL &amp;#124; City Brights: Zennie Abraham &amp;#124; an SFGate.com blog |publisher=Blog.sfgate.com |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==No consensus in general assembly for a speech by Congressman John Lewis==
[[Image:OCCUPY ATLANTA.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Tents used in the &quot;occupy&quot; protest]]
On Friday, October 6, 2011, the protestors at Occupy Atlanta did not reach a consensus on allotting time for U.S. Rep. and [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|Civil Rights]] icon [[John Lewis (U.S. politician)|John Lewis]] to address the crowd. The main argument against allowing Rep. Lewis to speak was that no one person is inherently more valuable than anyone else, and that allowing a speech at that time was not part of that day's agenda. Lewis did not ask to speak, but was likely volunteered by members of the crowd. He was invited to speak at time later in the day, during the &quot;other business&quot; part of the process, and this proposition was accepted by the assembly. Lewis was unable to attend because of prior committments, but indicated that he was not offended by the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;salontopic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/10/13/the_man_who_blocked_john_lewis_speaks/ |title=The man who blocked John Lewis speaks |publisher=salon.com |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 9, the group posted an apology on its website and invited Lewis to speak. Lewis was not disappointed he wasn't able to address the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milligan|first=Mandi|title=Occupy Wall Street protests come to Atlanta|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/15630309/occupy-wall-street-protests-come-to-atlanta|accessdate=18 October 2011|newspaper=WGCL|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the incident, Lewis further voiced his support for the movement:
{{cquote|I stand with you. I support you, what you're doing to humanize American corporations, humanize the American government and look out for those who have been left out and left behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katrandjian |first=Olivia |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/occupy-wall-street-protests-spread-country-clear-unified/story?id=14696466 |title=Occupy Wall Street Protests Spread Across the Country With No Clear Unified Message - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2011-10-08 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Occupy Atlanta and foreclosure==
On November 7, 2011, Occupy Atlanta protesters camped out in a home in [[Snellville, Georgia|Snellville]]. It belonged to a police officer, who had contacted Occupy explaining that the house had been foreclosed upon and that he and his family were shortly to be evicted. The protesters left on the 10th after the local sheriff said that the family could be arrested for accessory to trespassing. Occupy Atlanta has stated that they hope this action, and similar ones planned in the future, will bring attention to the [[foreclosure crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/occupy-atlanta-comes-to-1219759.html |date=November 7, 2011 |first=Joel |last=Anderson |title=Occupy Atlanta comes to Snellville to stop foreclosure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=November 10, 2011 |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett/occupy-atlanta-leaves-gwinnett-1222250.html |first=Joel |last=Anderson |title=Occupy Atlanta leaves Gwinnett home after family evicted}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Occupy Cleveland took similar action and succeeded in preventing the eviction of a family from a foreclosed home; the family were given 30 more days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://cleveland.cbslocal.com/2011/11/14/ohio-woman-credits-occupy-cleveland-for-saving-her-home/ |publisher=CBS Cleveland |date=November 14, 2011 |title=Ohio Woman Credits Occupy Cleveland For Saving Her Home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
===52 Arrests on October 26, 2011===
Around 1 AM on Wednesday, October 26, 2011, police blocked off motor vehicle access to Woodruff Park. Mayor [[Kasim Reed]] had revoked the executive order he established that allowed the protesters to lawfully stay in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Washington Post|title=Occupy Atlanta, Baltimore clash with police over use of public space|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/occupy-atlanta-baltimore-clash-with-police-over-use-of-public-space/2011/10/26/gIQADMSiIM_blog.html|accessdate=26 October 2011|work=Washington Post|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters numbering around 120-150 were warned to leave the park or they would be arrested.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Reed characterized the situation as a crisis and over 150 officers&lt;ref&gt;Gwynedd Stuart (October 27, 2011). &quot;[http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/10/27/thoughts-in-the-aftermath-of-the-occupy-atlanta-bust Thoughts in the aftermath of the Occupy Atlanta bust]&quot; ''[[Creative Loafing]]''.

''[[BBC]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[SWAT]] team, and police on horseback and motorcycles were used. At one point during the arrests, protesters not in the park took over the streets. This is when police brought in their motorcycle police to try to break up the crowd that was forming on the streets.  Instead of separating, the crowd of protesters marched towards the oncoming police motorcycles and forced them to turn around and head the other way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacefully&quot;/&gt; Fifty two protesters in the park were arrested. Among the arrested was Georgia state Senator [[Vincent Fort]], who said of Reed, &quot;He's using all these resources....This is the most peaceful place in Georgia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacefully&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Asssociated Press|title=Riot squads clear Wall St. protesters in Atlanta and Oakland; dozens arrested, camps removed|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/atlanta-police-surrounding-wall-street-protesters-order-people-to-leave-park-encampment/2011/10/26/gIQAG9kcHM_story.html?wprss=rss_national|accessdate=26 October 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other incidents===
During the day of Tuesday October 25, &quot;An Associated Press reporter talked to [a] man with the gun slung across his back ... as he walked in the park. He wouldn't give his name, but said he was an out-of-work accountant who doesn't agree with the protesters' views, but was there, armed, because he wanted to protect the rights of people to protest. There's no law that prevents him from carrying the weapon in public, but several police followed him for about 10&amp;nbsp;minutes before moving off.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacefully&quot;/&gt; Also, a homeless shelter that housed more than 100&amp;nbsp;Occupy Atlanta protesters tested positive for [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Christopher|title=Tuberculosis breaks out at city's largest homeless shelter|url=http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/16002316/tuberculosis-breaks-out-at-citys-largest-homeless-shelter|publisher=[[WGCL-TV]]|accessdate=26 November 2011|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
