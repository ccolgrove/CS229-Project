'''Piotr StaÅczak''' (born ca. 1966, [[Potok, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Potok, Poland]] â died 7 February 2009, [[Attock]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab, Pakistan]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[geology|geologist]] who was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorists]] in [[Pakistan]] in February 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/09/pakistani-militants-behead-polish|title=Polish man beheaded in Pakistani militant video|publisher=The Guardian|date=2009-02-09|accessdate=2009-02-09|location=London|first=Saeed|last=Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt; StaÅczak was abducted in the city of Attock in September 2008 after gunmen shot dead his driver, translator and bodyguard with whom he was travelling in a car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7876565.stm BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; His executioners said they murdered him because the Pakistani government failed to release [[Taliban]] prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Officials at the Polish Embassy in [[Islamabad]] saw the video of the execution and confirmed that the person who was executed was Piotr StaÅczak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-02-09-voa33.cfm|title=Suspected Taliban Militants Kill Polish Hostage|publisher=Voice of America|date=2009-02-09|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The taped execution was reminiscent of the beheading in 2002 of [[Daniel Pearl]], at that time the last westerner to be murdered on video in Pakistan. StaÅczak was allegedly offered the opportunity to avoid execution by converting to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=HomePage&amp;id=37d3472e-cfb2-4fe0-a8ef-59bfbbeb2523&amp;Headline=Polish+engineer+killed+for+not+converting+to+Islam &quot;Polish engineer's refusal to convert costs him his life&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; When StaÅczak refused, he was forced to read statements before his murder. The video shows StaÅczak pleading with the Polish government not to send troops to Afghanistan. He urges Poland to cut its ties with Pakistan, which he said had made no effort to secure his release. The footage then shows masked men cutting off StaÅczak's head. His body was later recovered outside a paramilitary camp in [[Razmak]] and returned to Poland aboard a Pakistani Air Force plane. A brief ceremony was held on the tarmac.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/09/pakistani-militants-behead-polish ''The Guardian'' report of StaÅczak's execution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[Politics of Poland|The Polish government]] will issue international arrest warrants for the murderers, in addition to offering a 1 million [[Polish zÅoty|zÅoty]] (about $290,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]) reward for information that would lead to the arrest of the suspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/poland-asks-us-to-help-find-killers-20090211-83qf.html|title=Poland asks US to help find killers|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-02-11|accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warsaw also ''&quot;categorically demands from Pakistan's authorities the capture of the culprits of this crime and their punishment with the full severity this act demands&quot;'', according to a statement released by the Polish Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney&quot;/&gt; Poland requested help from the United States in their efforts to catch the killers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sydney&quot;/&gt;

On July 25, 2009, Pakistani police arrested a former parliamentarian with close links to the Taliban, [[Shah Abdul Aziz (Pakistan)|Shah Abdul Aziz]], in connection with the murder of StaÅczak. A captured member of the Taliban told an anti-terrorism court that he was given orders by Aziz to kill StaÅczak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8169076.stm|title=Arrest after Polish Afghan death|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-07-25|accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2010, President of Poland posthumously awarded him the [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20110030027 Monitor Polski 2011 nr 3 poz. 27]&lt;/ref&gt;.
