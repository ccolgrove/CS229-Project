== History ==

==Company name==
About {{age|1996|12|31}} years ago David and Jeff met an owner-less dog at their cabin in [[Sierra City]].
They decided to adopt him and named him '[[Wolfenstein (series)|Wolfenstein]]' or 'Wolfie' for short.
Later this name would be the inspiration for the company name 'Wolfire':&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When David was thinking of a name for his video game company, Wolfie sprang to mind. If you add an ârâ you get Wolfire. Wolves are cool, and so is fire, so why not Wolfire?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.wolfire.com/2009/04/the-origin-of-wolfire/&lt;/ref&gt; - Jeff Rosen&lt;/blockquote&gt;
