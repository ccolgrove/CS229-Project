==== Inspiron 9300 ====
The Dell Inspiron 9300 was a laptop that had either a 1.6, 1.73, 1.86, 2.0, 2.13 or 2.26&amp;nbsp;GHz Intel [[Pentium M]] processor and a 17&quot; wide-screen (available in WXGA+ with a 1440 by 900 resolution and WUXGA with a 1920 by 1200 resolution). At the time, it also featured [[DDR2]] memory, a new feature for laptops. Compared with the other Inspiron laptops, it is considered to be the &quot;Entertainment Powerhouse&quot;. 

The Inspiron 9300 was based loosely on its more expensive and more powerful big brother, the gaming-oriented Inspiron XPS Generation 2. With the right upgrades, the Inspiron 9300 can deliver most of the gaming power as the XPS Generation 2 at a much reduced cost. These upgrades start with the nVidia GeForce Go 6800 video card (or higher such as a GeForce 7800 GTX in later models), and continue with extra RAM, a 7200 RPM hard drive, and a Pentium M that is faster than the baseline 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz speed. 

* '''Processors:''' Intel Pentium M 730, 740, 750, 760, 770 or 780.

==== Inspiron 9400/E1705 ====
The top-of-the line Inspiron models in 2006, the Inspiron E1705 and Inspiron 9400 (non-US models) are essentially the same laptop but with a few minor differences in configuration. The Inspiron 9400 was basically a more up-to-date, redesigned version of the Inspiron 9300 with a few extra added features such as the [[Dell MediaDirect]] button which was left of the LED indicator lights next to the power button. 

The system had a starting price of $999, since it was meant to be used as a portable media center rather than a gaming laptop, and it was also using a new memory technology called DDR2. The Inspiron E1705 tends to run hot on its underside, which might be the reason the graphics processor on some units overheats and burns out within a year because of inadequate cooling. This problem can sometimes be resolved by re-heating the solder joints under the GPU with the use of a hot air gun. On most accounts of users who have experienced this problem, it occurred after the warranty expired. 

Note that while this model only officially supports 2 x 1 GB dual channel DDR2 it is possible to use 2 x 2 GB for a total of 4 GB. However you'll be limited to 3.2 GB due to a large reserved address space for I/O allocated by the BIOS and this whatever the operating system in use (including 64-bit versions of MS Windows and Linux).

==== Inspiron 6000 ====
[[Image:Dell Front.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Dell Inspiron 6000 with Arctic silver and alpine white design.]]

The base model was shipped in 1st quarter 2005 with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz (upgradeable up to 2.13&amp;nbsp;GHz) Intel Pentium M processor or a 1.3&amp;nbsp;GHz (upgradeable up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz) Intel Celeron M processor, 256 MB RAM (upgradeable to 2 GB), 400/533&amp;nbsp;MHz FSB, Intel 915GM/PM [[chipset]], an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator (with up to 128 MB shared memory), 40 GB [[Ultra ATA]] hard drive (upgradeable), and a 15.4-inch WXGA wide-screen monitor. Both the Celeron M and Pentium M processors can work on the Inspiron 6000, so an Inspiron with the 1.3&amp;nbsp;GHz Celeron M can upgrade all the way to the 2.13&amp;nbsp;GHz Pentium M instead of being limited to the 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz Celeron M upgrade. Like the Inspiron 9300, it featured DDR2 [[RAM]]. In comparison with other Inspiron models, the 6000 was considered the &quot;versatile and affordable&quot; member of the Dell notebook line.

The higher-priced Inspiron 6000D provided a dedicated graphics chip, the ATI Mobility Radeon X300 64 MB PCI Express x16 (upgradeable to 128 MB), which ran at a core speed of 300&amp;nbsp;MHz and DDR memory speed of 216&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The Inspiron 6000 was among the first notebooks to arrive on the market with Intel's new Sonoma technology. According to Dell, the Inspiron 6000 would deliver faster data processing, and users - particularly gamers and graphics pros-would see less audio and video choppiness, quicker task execution, less power consumption, and enhanced battery life as a result. 
The Inspiron 6000 notebook added features and &quot;help&quot; files, making it easier and faster to operate. 

In addition, the Inspiron 6000 offered a number of improvements over the Inspiron 5160 which it replaced in Dell's home/small business line-up. Upgraded features included a 15.4 in wide-screen display (available in [[WXGA (graphics)|WXGA]] with a 1280x800 resolution, [[WSXGA+]] with a 1680x1050 resolution and [[WUXGA]] with a 1920x1200 resolution), a slightly slimmer profile (although 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm wider) and a Manufacturer's bundle- (starter) memory cards that accommodated only a handful of photos.

It was purported to be the high end version of inspiron 5100 and designed to support the Mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor up to 3.2&amp;nbsp;GHz, a high performance mobile processor architecture at the time, that first supported Intel Hyper-threading technology. The hyper-threading features of the processor were available only if the system board came with supporting firmware. Hyper-threading support had to be chosen at time of purchase and could not be enabled later by BIOS upgrades even though the processor supported it. The wireless networking was based on a closed broadcom chipset BCM4306. 

The laptop was infamous for a huge number of design failures, overheating, battery failures, connector loosening, motherboard failures. The owners of Dell Inspiron 5150 initiated a class action lawsuit on Dell resulting in [[Lundell Settlement]]. On December 4, 2006 the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted final approval to the settlement granting relief to the owners of Dell Inspiron 5150.

==== Inspiron 640m/E1405 ====
*''see [[Dell Inspiron E1405]]''
The Inspiron 14&quot; notebook configurable with components similar to the E1505 (excluding the dedicated GPU options) but a bit smaller in total size. The E1405 at the time of release is known for its excellent battery life (which under optimum conditions exceeds five hours with a six-cell battery and well over eight hours with a slightly more expensive, optional nine-cell battery). The main attraction of this laptop is its price. For gamers, the E1405 comes standard with a Mobile Intel(R) 945GM Express Chipset Family, which in most cases will not be enough for most new high end games. Also, it is near impossible to add a new graphics card because this chipset is integrated, therefore you cannot add a new graphics card unless you get a new motherboard. Otherwise most other system specifications are rather basic, if you want serious media on the machine you will have to buy some things, the easiest (and most in-expensive) route is to buy system RAM for the computer. Dell claims that its maximum supported memory is 2 GB, however E1405's have been known to accept up to 4 GB of memory.

=== Desktops ===
==== Inspiron 530 ====
[[File:Dell Inspiron.jpg|thumb|A Dell Inspiron 530.]]
Released on June 26, 2006, the Dell Inspiron 530 is Dell's first desktop to use the Inspiron name. The Inspiron 530 has an Intel Celeron 450, and can be customized up to an Intel Core 2 Quad Q9550. It has 2 GB of DDR2 SDRAM at 800&amp;nbsp;MHz, which can be upgraded up to 8 GB (4gb for systems shipped with core 2 duo processors and g33m02 motherboards, and 8gb for systems shipped with core 2 quad processors and g33m03 motherboards - noted in the system documentation found on http://support.dell.com). The desktop has a 320 GB 7200 RPM Serial ATA hard drive w/DataBurst Cache, which can be upgraded to 750 GB. There are also data recovery versions of the 320 and 500 GB hard drive sizes. The Inspiron 530 is customizable with a variety of DVD+/-RW and Blu-ray Disc drives. The Inspiron 530 has integrated Intel [[GMA 3100]], and can be customized up to an ATI Radeon HD 4670 discrete graphics card. It has integrated 7.1 channel audio and can be customized up to a Sound Blaster X-Fi XtremeGamer sound card. The Inspiron 530 has no initial Wi-Fi card, but can be customized up to a Dell 1505 Wireless-N PCI-e card.  The Inspiron 530 has two variants of motherboards, both made by Foxconn and based on the G33M series. The G33M02 which supports up to Core 2 Duo processors and the DG33M03, which supports up to Core 2 Quad processors.  Inspiron 530 systems sold with Pentium Dual-Core or Core 2 Duo processors can not be upgraded to Core 2 Quad processors without adding at least a 350W power supply and swapping motherboards to the DG33M03 motherboard.  The reason the G33M02 doesn't support Core 2 Quad processors is because it only has 6 voltage regulator ICs, the DG33M03 has 11.

==== Inspiron 530s ====
The Inspiron 530s has the same design as the 530, but it is 41% slimmer. However, because of its design, it is not physically compatible with all desktop hardware, especially graphics cards (Dell only gives you the option of the ATI 2400 XT, which is not a high performance card).  The case used in the 530s can accommodate one 5.25&quot; optical drive, one external 3.5&quot; drive (either a 1.44&amp;nbsp;MB floppy or 19-in-1 card reader), and up to two standard 3.5&quot; hard drives. The motherboard used in the 530s is almost identical to the motherboard used in the 530 edition, except for the fact that this motherboard only supports Dual Core processors, and not any members of the Quad Core series like its twin. While almost any '''low profile''' PCI-E x16 video card will physically fit in the 530s, the custom sized Delta 250W power supply that the 530s is equipped with may seriously limit the potential for using higher end cards.

==== Inspiron 531/531s ====
[[Image:Upgraded Inspiron 531.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Dell Inspiron 531 upgraded for gaming purposes.]]

The Dell Inspiron 531 is Dell's AMD desktop counterpart to the Inspiron 530, and with exception of the CPU and motherboard, is virtually identical. Starting with the Athlon 64 X2 3800+ it can be customized up to an AMD Athlon 64 X2 6000+. The Athlon X2 7000, Phenom, Phenom II and Athlon II series are not supported. It uses 1 GB of DDR2 SDRAM at 667&amp;nbsp;MHz, which can be upgraded up to 8 GB 800&amp;nbsp;MHz under [[DDR2_SDRAM#Overview|JEDEC DDR2 voltage specification]]. The model features the M2N61-AX OEM motherboard made by ASUS &lt;ref&gt;http://www.softwaredriverdownload.com/dell_asus_m2n61-ax_motherboard_spec.html&lt;/ref&gt; and uses nVidia GeForce 6150 integrated graphics with the nForce 430i chipset, and has two PCI slots, one PCI-e X1 and one [[PCI Express|PCI-e X16 1.0a]] slot. Due to the arrangement of the expansion slots, however, use of a double height video card renders the PCI-e X1 slot useless. The motherboard also features four SATA 1.0 Ports, one EIDE (floppy) plug, three USB plugs for front USB, a Firewire plug, and a front audio plug. Cooling is somewhat limited, as the motherboard only provides one 4-pin PWM CPU fan plug, and one 3-pin rear fan plug. Installation of a fan controller will be required to use additional fans. Recently, the 6.05 version of nVidia's System Performance Tools allows minor FSB overclocking, but does not allow voltage or multiplier adjustments, limiting overclocking potential. The case is Micro-ATX sized, lightweight aluminum and features one 92&amp;nbsp;mm Rear fan, one external 3-1/2&quot; drive bay, two 5-1/4&quot; bays and two vertical 3-1/2&quot; internal drive bays. It also features a standard ATX sized 300 watt power supply with four SATA plugs, one 24-pin ATX12V 2.0 plug and one 4-pin P4 plug, oddly excluding any standard 4-pin Molex connectors. The I/O Shield is also part of the case, preventing the installation of third-party motherboards without modifications to the case.

==== Inspiron 537 ====
Released on Dell's website on May 12, 2009 the Inspiron 537 is a mini-tower desktop that replaces the Inspiron 530. The desktop has a black chassis, but the front shell can be customized with one of eight colors. Oddly, this model was replaced by the Inspiron 546, which uses AMD processors, after being available online for less than one month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/home/desktops&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebadging==
In the past Dell has modified some existing Inspiron machines to produce computers of higher or lower quality. Note for example  the first-generation Inspiron XPS and Inspiron 9100 (2004â2006). Both machines (non-base) shared the same options in processors (Intel Pentium 4 HT &quot;Prescott&quot;), RAM (DDR 400&amp;nbsp;MHz), hard-drives (Ultra-ATA 5400/7200 RPM), wireless cards, LCD screens (at 15.4-inches; WXGA, WSXGA+, WUXGA) and graphics cards (ATI Mobility Radeon 9700 64&amp;nbsp;MB/128&amp;nbsp;MB), as well as the same chassis. Dell marketed the XPS as an &quot;ultimate gaming machine&quot;, while marketing the 9100 as a &quot;desktop replacement&quot;. The Inspiron 9100 is a rebadged XPS;  the only difference between the two is the LCD Panel. Although both support a 15.4 Samsung LCD, only later models of the 9100 (3.2&amp;nbsp;GHz) use the identical LCD screen (Dell Part #s 7T774/W3866). The Samsung LCD Panel supports 1920x1200. Previous 2.8-3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz Inspiron 9100 use a lesser panel with resolutions of 1280x800 (Dell Part # Y0316).

== Problems==
=== Overheating ===
Reference: [http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=cc_faq&amp;message.id=329 Dell's Official statement: the Lundell Settlement. Dell Inspiron 5150 only]

In 2003, Dell released several lines of Inspiron notebooks which had cooling problems, causing them to overheat and damage the video card and motherboard, or to shut down automatically. Overheating in Inspiron systems is mainly caused by performance-consuming tasks and software. This problem was determined to be due to the design of the air-flow from the bottom of the system. Affected models include the Dell Inspiron 1100, 1150, 5100 and 5150.
For more information on the 5100/5150 models in particular, see the following link:
[http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/4623835.aspx Dell Inspiron 5100 Overheating Problem].

Dell acknowledged this problem and designed a new fan with a better heatsink and heatpipes to provide better cooling with less noise. Any repairs made at this point will include the redesigned parts.

A [http://www.diefer.de/i8kfan/index.html Windows utility exists] to control most Inspiron fans based on CPU temperature. Users should check the compatibility list before installing it.

On September 20 Inspiron 5150 owners in the US brought a [[Lundell Settlement|class action against Dell]]. The settlement included 100% cash reimbursement for certain repairs, and an extended limited warranty to cover those types of repairs that become necessary for one year. Dell's published statement of the scope of the repairs covered appears [http://www.dellcommunity.com/supportforums/board/message?board.id=cc_faq&amp;message.id=329 here].

Following the lawsuit detailed above, in October 2006 customers who had purchased Dell Inspiron 1100, 1150, 5100 and 5160 notebooks filed a [http://www.lieffcabraser.com/dell-inspiron-3.htm class action lawsuit] against Dell, alleging misconduct in connection with the design, manufacture, warranting, advertising and selling of these computers. A similar action started in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rochongenova.com/dellinformation.aspx Rochon Genova - Dell Notebook Class Action&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The overheating problem on the Inspiron 5150 was due to the position of the fan and fan-vent and the way in which it vents air through the CPU's heatsink.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The fan draws air from underneath the unit and vents it through the rear after passing over the heatsink. However, the unit also sucks up dust from underneath it. Over time a build-up of dust obstructs the airflow, diminishing it perceptibly and reducing cooling; a simple test is to place a hand near the fan vent; when the fan is running at high speed there should be a good flow of warm air. Heat will also build up along the top of the unit near the LCD display and left toward the optical drive. Users may notice this while typing. Performance may also suffer, with jittery game movement and slow Windows performance. Some systems may experience jerky reactions where the unit goes into an almost slow-motion phase for short periods of time. Continued operation in this condition may lead to overheating and could result in permanent damage to the computer. To remedy this the unit must be disassembled, the dust removed, and fan operation checked. An overheating machine commonly has a CPU running 15 to 20Â°C  hotter than a normally functioning unit; a higher increase may damage the casing of the unit.

Overheating has been reduced by using compressed air duster spray. Spraying the keyboard, the Microprocessor Thermal-Cooling Assembly is located under the &quot;I&quot; - &quot;backspace&quot; keys, and side air intakes, located on the far right and left sides, has been effective in reducing the running temperature from a normal [[operating temperature]] of 77-87Â°C to 45-55Â°C under average load.

Alternately some users of the Inspiron 5150 found relief by underclocking their processors.

=== Motherboard ===
[[Image:Inspiron lvc.jpg|right|thumb]]

On a number of Inspiron 5150, and 100L machines, a design flaw in the positioning of a tab on the C panel on the underside of the laptop has led to problems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Any pressure applied to the top left hand corner of the laptop causes this tab to  press against the motherboard and in particular against the &quot;LVC14A&quot; chip. This causes the [[solder]] between this chip and the motherboard to break. This causes sudden shut-downs of the system as a result of any movement of the laptop; in certain cases the laptop will not re-boot at all. Dell has redesigned later models of the 5150 to avoid this problem. Some models reveal cases where someone has manually snapped off the tab from the C panel by hand during the manufacturing process. Dell {{As of|2008|alt=currently}} covers this fault in the [[USA]] under the [[Lundell Settlement]], although it is not known whether [[Dell]] will fix this fault free of charge outside the USA. In January 2007 a similar lawsuit started in Canada{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}, and Dell in the Netherlands has agreed to repair Dutch computers following criticism in the consumer programme Kassa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kassa.vara.nl/portal?_scr=kassa_artikel&amp;number=2017734 |title=Constructiefout Dell laptop Inspiron 5150 |accessdate=2009-02-04 |publisher=Vara |date=2005-12-03 |language=Dutch |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329124427/http://kassa.vara.nl/portal?_scr=kassa_artikel&amp;number=2017734 |archivedate = March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This has also been a problem with the Inspiron 1150, with the same chip giving problems with broken solder. Re-soldering is not recommended, but re-heating the pins can re-establish the connection and solve the power-off problem at the expense of possibly losing the use of the touch-pad mouse.

=== Battery recall of 2006 ===
Dell posted notices to many of their laptop customers on August 14, 2006, saying that the Sony batteries on the following models could combust, or even explode:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7807419 | work=The Economist | title=Too hot to handle | date=August 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 Dell laptop explodes at Japanese conference - The INQUIRER&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Users of many of these computers purchased between April [[2004]] and July 18, 2006 received the recommendation that they should remove the batteries and run their computers on AC power until replacements arrived.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dellbatteryprogram.com/ Dell Battery Return Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Problematic batteries made by Sony led to recall programs at other laptop computer companies as well, including [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5411996.stm Hitachi], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5390948.stm Toshiba], [http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=lenovo&amp;lndocid=BATT-LENOVO Lenovo (IBM)] and [https://support.apple.com/ibook_powerbook/batteryexchange/ Apple].

=== Power supply issues ===
Most Dell laptop computers have a special [[AC adapter|external power supply]] (PSU) which cannot be replaced by a third-party universal supply. The PSU has a chip which produces a special signal identifying the PSU as by Dell and specifying its power, and a special 3-pin connector (minus, plus, and ID). If a power supply not made by Dell is used, and the cable near the connector becomes damaged as is not infrequent after some use, the battery stops charging and the CPU runs slower, although the computer can be used indefinitely so long as it remains plugged in. If this problem is present at startup the message &quot;The AC power adapter type cannot be determined. Your system will operate slower and the battery will not charge&quot; is displayed. This will continue until the external PSU is replaced. A few third-party suppliers make power supplies with specific provision for Dell computers at lower prices than Dell's. It is possible to work round the slowdown, but not the battery charging, by installing a CPU clock utility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpu.rightmark.org/download/rmclock_235_bin.rar A free CPU clock utility which overrides Dell's slowdown with non-Dell PSU]&lt;/ref&gt;  On some models (the 9100 for instance), the problem can be worked around by starting the computer without a battery installed and fitting the battery after the computer has booted.

Another problem arises after much use with the motherboard power connector; springy metal parts which contact the outside of the plug lose their springiness and fail to make contact so that power does not reach the computer. The &quot;official&quot; solution is to replace the connector on the motherboard, which requires partial disassembly of the computer and unsoldering of a part with several pins; many companies charge a considerable sum for the work involved. Various simple alternatives have been suggested; for example a thin &quot;skin&quot; of solder on the outside of the barrel of the connector on the PSU (with care not to overheat the connector's plastic parts; and this thickened connector should not be used with other, not faulty, Dells as it will stretch the springs).

One other problem can happen with the wattage rating of the power supply.  There are 2 Dell power supplies that were used for different Inspiron models which have the same plug assembly and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9.  Some models for example the Inspiron 1100 shipped with a PA-9.  If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system will sometimes boot and sometimes not boot.  If it does not boot then it will light the battery light for a few seconds when the supply is plugged in.  This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal.  Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a volt meter while the supply is plugged into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.

These problems are discussed in detail, and solutions and workarounds suggested, in a discussion on the Tom's hardware site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/9519-28-dell-laptop-power-jack-pinout Tom's hardware: discussion on Dell PSU connector problems, solutions, and workarounds]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hibernation sensor problem===

A problem exists with the hibernation sensor located in some older laptops.  Unlike many laptops that use a mechanical switch to detect when the lid is closed, in these systems the sensor is a magnetic reed switch that is located between the touchpad and the front edge of the laptop.  There is a magnet that is located in the top lid above this switch, and when the lid is closed the magnet triggers the reed switch.  If the magnet loses strength then the system will not go into suspend or hibernation if the lid is closed.  The magnet strength can be checked by running a paper clip along the top edge of the screen.  A worse problem happens if the reed switch fails.  Sometimes the switches will fail in a closed position with the contacts sticking together.  In that case the system will not switch on.  There are several ways to check for this.  First the laptop can be partially disassembled and the mouse assembly can be unplugged from the system board and the system switched on.  If the system boots with the mouse unplugged then it is the switch.  Another way to check for the problem is by running a magnet over the reed switch, there should be a faint click when the magnet triggers the switch.  This does not require disassembly but the magnet must be in the correct position and be strong enough.  Some people have repaired this by cutting the switch off of the assembly, with the downside being the system will no longer suspend if the lid is closed.

===Vertical line LCD problem===
Some 17&quot; Inspiron 8600, 9200, 9300, 6000, 1750, and XPS Gen 2 notebook LCDs have a vertical line manufacturing defect. Symptoms range from individual lines to entire bars of the screen with inverted colors.
Most problems showed after 2â4 years of usage. 
Dell has been very reluctant to replace these panels after guarantee, although there was a direct link to the defective parts from their suppliers. Even warranty customers have had difficulties to get replacement, and replaced screens often develop the defect after a short time.
