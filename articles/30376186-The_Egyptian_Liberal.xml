The '''''Got Talent'' franchise''' is a British [[TV format]] conceived and owned by [[Simon Cowell]]'s [[Syco#Syco TV|SYCOtv]] company. A pilot show was made in Britain, hosted by [[Paul O'Grady]], but after O'Grady's split with [[ITV]], the series was postponed, resulting in ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' - the first full series of the format. It has spawned [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in 39 countries, in what is now referred to as the ''Got Talent'' format, similar to that described by [[FremantleMedia]] of the [[Idol series|Idol format]].{{fact|date=October 2011}}

The ''Got Talent'' franchise is one of the fastest growing international franchises, closing the gap on other successful franchises such as ''[[The Weakest Link]]'',''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'', ''[[List of national variants in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[Idol Series|Idol]]'' franchises, all of which also originated in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4436837.stm | work=BBC News | title=Millionaire dominates global TV | date=12 April 2005 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original series==
{{see also|America's Got Talent|Britain's Got Talent}} 
The ''Got Talent'' franchise was a British invention, with comedian and talk show host [[Paul O'Grady]] producing a pilot for [[ITV]]. O'Grady left the network after disputes with ITV, resulting in [[Simon Cowell]], creator of the show, moving the concept to America while he and ITV searched for a new show host. 

Due to these issues, the ''Got Talent'' franchise ended up debuting first on the [[NBC]] network in the [[United States]] on 21 June 2006, with judges [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Brandy Norwood]], and [[Piers Morgan]]. The show's original series was hosted by [[Regis Philbin]]. Most recently, the judging panel consists of [[Howie Mandel]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], along with Morgan, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]]. The grand prize on ''America's Got Talent'' is $1 million, and, since season 3, a chance to headline a show on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. ''America's Got Talent'' proved extremely successful for NBC, pulling in high ratings in both total viewers and the younger 18-49 demographic. The show's initial success in America is credited with the eventual launch of the British series, and the overall global launch of the ''Got Talent'' franchise.

ITV eventually debuted ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' on 9 June 2007 with Cowell, Morgan and [[Amanda Holden]] as judges, and [[Ant &amp; Dec]] as hosts of the show. Morgan stepped down after series 4 due to commitments hosting ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'' on [[CNN]]. For series 5, Cowell only attended the live shows as he was busy launching ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'' in America, so [[Michael McIntyre]] and [[David Hasselhoff]] joined the panel with Holden. McIntyre confirmed that he would not return for The top prize is at least Â£100,000, and a performance at the [[Royal Variety Show]] in front [[Queen Elizabeth II]], and [[Prince Charles]].
