'''Automatix''' is a tool designed to automate the addition of [[application software|applications]], [[codecs]], [[fonts]] and [[libraries]] not provided directly by the software repositories of [[Debian]]-based distributions (specifically Debian, [[MEPIS]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]).

These distributions do not include certain packages or configuration settings that allow the playing of [[DVD]]s or [[MP3]] files or the viewing of [[Adobe Flash]] content, for example. Packages that allow the playing of MP3s are available to download from official sources but cannot be included on the CD. Packages to enable the playing of DVDs include the [[libdvdcss]] algorithm. Although adding these manually is possible, it can be time consuming. This is a particular problem for distributions aimed at simplifying the desktop Linux experience.

== Design ==

Automatix allows the menu-driven installation of 56 different &quot;capabilities&quot;, including commercial [[closed source]] programs such as the Flash plugin, [[Acrobat Reader]], multimedia [[codec]]s ([[DivX]], MP3, [[Windows Media Audio]]) and fonts, and programming [[compiler]]s.

Automatix was not recommended by the Ubuntu development team, which has criticised its content.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonCustomizations CommonCustomizations - Ubuntu Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some individual Ubuntu developers blamed Automatix 1 for breaking updates from Dapper to Edgy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/10/30/automatix-and-upgrading Scott James Remnant Â» Blog Archive Â» Automatix and Upgrading&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonathancarter.co.za/?p=58 jonathan carter Â» Blog Archive Â» How not to break Ubuntu upgrades&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 November 2006 Ubuntu CTO [[Matt Zimmerman (technologist)|Matt Zimmerman]] said &quot;I cannot recommend the use of this program, and systems where it has been used cannot be supported with a clean and official upgrade path.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2006-November/022185.html Edgy in the news&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2007, Automatix was reviewed by Matthew Garrett, a member of the core Ubuntu development team. In his words, âAutomatix is, in itself, a poor quality package which fails to conform to Debian or Ubuntu policy.â These comments were made in a technical analysis posted on his blog explaining why Automatix is currently not supported by [[Canonical Ltd.]] or the Ubuntu community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjg59.livejournal.com/77440.html mjg59: Anyway, back to pure Linux stuff. A whil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successors ==

Automatix was discontinued in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;www.getautomatix.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2424 {{dead link|url=http://www.getautomatix.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2424|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new project called [[Ultamatix]], compatible with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 9.04, is based on Automatix.
