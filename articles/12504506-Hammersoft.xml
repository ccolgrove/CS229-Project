Background 

Some people call her &quot;The Bronx Bombshell&quot; Some call her &quot;The Real Million Dollar Baby&quot; others Just call her &quot;Moe&quot;......... Iona College Senior, 15-2 (9ko's) was born and raised in the Bronx, New York. Born in 1981, she was raised by a strict Irish father, a now retired NYPD Detective. Maureenâs mother, of Mexican heritage, worked in the airline industry and this afforded ample travel to Maureen. Moe spent much of her youth growing up in the Bronx and in the Guadalajara area of Mexico. In the amateurs, Maureen was known and respected for her boxing. First training out of NYBG with Luigi Olcese, she was eventually brought to Gleasons to train with well respected trainer Hector Roca. It was a gradual process in Sheaâs growth and preparation for the game of professional boxing.

When the international media found out that Swank attended all of Maureenâs amateur bouts, Maureen was thrust into the spotlight. It was Maureenâs boxing, however, that captured the attention.
