The '''ZhengzhouâXi'an High Speed Railway''', also known as the '''Zhengxi Passenger Line''' ({{zh|s=éè¥¿é«ééè·¯|t=é­è¥¿é«ééµè·¯|p=zhÃ¨ngxÄ« gÄosÃ¹ tiÄlÃ¹}}), is a [[high-speed rail]]way line connecting the cities of [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Xi'an]], in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It went into operation on February 6, 2010.

The line is one of the segments of the future [[Xulan Passenger Dedicated Line]], a high-speed mainline from [[Lanzhou]] to [[Xuzhou]], paralleling the existing [[Longhai Railway]] line.

The densely populated corridor between Zhengzhou and Xi'an, both large regional centres, is home to some 100 million people. Its top speed is 350 km/h in operation, the minimum travel time between the two cities is 1 hour and 58 minutes, although in practice the journey takes two and a half hours with a few intermediate stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://finance.ifeng.com/roll/20100201/1782181.shtml |title=ä¸­å½ä¸­éåå»ºçéè¥¿å®¢è¿ä¸çº¿æåè¯è¿è¡ |trans_title=Participation in China's Zhengzhou-Xi'an Railway Passenger successful test run |work=ifeng.com |publisher=Phoenix New Media Group |date=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train currently depart and arrive original stations in Zhengzhou and Xi'an. The trip time can be significantly shorten after the open of Zhengzhou East and Xi'an North stations some time next year. Its trains are numbered G20xx. Westbound trains (Zhengzhou to Xi'an) are odd-numbered, while even numbers denote eastbound trains (Xi'an to Zhengzhou).

The railway has made air service between Zhengzhou and Xi'an uncompetitive. All passenger flights between the two cities were suspended within 48 days of start of regular high-speed rail service.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idINTOE62P04E20100326|title=China express train forces airlines to stop flights|date=03-26-2010|accessdate=03-28-2010|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Construction work began on September 25, 2005, the railway opened for service on February 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2010-02/06/content_9439243.htm| work=China Daily| title=Zhengzhou-Xi'an high-speed train starts operation| date=February 6, 2010| accessdate=February 6, 2010| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news| url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/3844214| work=iStockAnalyst| title=High-speed rail linking central, western China starts operation| date=February 6, 2010| accessdate=February 6, 2010| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news| url=http://english.cctv.com/program/newshour/20100206/102086.shtml| work=CCTV| title=High-speed train debuts in W.

The main line is {{convert|456.639|km|abbr=on}} long, with another {{convert|27.879|km|abbr=on}} extension connecting existing [[Longhai Railway]] from [[Xi'an North Railway Station|Xi'an North]] to [[Xianyang West Railway Station|Xianyang West]]. Ten railway stations were built along the line: Yingyang South (not opened), New Gongyi, Luoyang Longmen, Mianchi South, Sanmenxia South, Lingbao West, Huashan North, Weinan North, Lintong East, and Xi'an North. The [[minimum railway curve radius]] is {{convert|9000|m}} for most of the line and {{convert|7000|m}} for some difficult sections. The distance between two parallel tracks is {{convert|5|m}}.

The line includes the {{convert|8460|m|adj=on}} long [[Zhangmao Tunnel]], {{convert|7851|m|adj=on}} long [[Hanguguan Tunnel]] and the {{convert|7685|m|adj=on}} long [[Qindong Tunnel]]. The line also includes the {{convert|79732|m|adj=on}} long [[Weihe Grand Bridge]], which, upon its completion, was the [[List of bridges by length|longest bridge]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news| url=http://www.railcn.net/news/railway-building/rail27165.html| title=éè¥¿å®¢è¿ä¸çº¿æ¸­åæ¸­æ²³ç¹å¤§æ¡¥æ¶æ¢æ½å·¥åçºªå½| language=Chinese| date=July 3, 2007| work=RailCN.net| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents ==
On November 14, 2009, a track inspection train seriously damaged {{convert|2000|m}} of the tracks near [[Huashan North Railway Station]] during a test run. The damaged section had to be removed and replaced. The railway was originally expected to be opened in December 2009, but the accident delayed the opening of the railway for at least one month.
