The '''[[Northwestern Wildcats]] Women's Lacrosse Team''' is a [[NCAA Division I]] [[college lacrosse]] team representing [[Northwestern University]] as part of the [[American Lacrosse Conference]].  The team began competition at the varsity level in 1982, operated as a club sport from 1993 to 2001, and resumed play at the varsity level in 2002.  They play their home games at [[Lakeside Field]] in [[Evanston, IL]].  From 2005 to 2009, the team won the [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]] five consecutive times and recorded two undefeated seasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/chi-25-nu-lax-chicago,0,7199998.story&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wildcats added a sixth championship in 2011 after losing in the finals the previous year.  The [[midwestern]] team's success is a rarity in a sport that enjoys most of its popularity on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] - the Wildcats are the first and only team from outside the [[Eastern Time Zone]] to win the national title.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/more/05/06/lacrosse0512/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Lacrosse_women.jpg|left|thumb|160px|2005 [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship]] between the [[Virginia Cavaliers]] and [[Northwestern Wildcats]]]]

The Wildcats began playing in 1982 and enjoyed success early, appearing in the NCAA tournament five times before budget cuts forced the team to disband in 1993.  Northwestern hired former [[Maryland Terrapins Women's Lacrosse|Maryland]] player [[Kelly Amonte Hiller]] to be the head coach when the university revived the team in 2002.  Hiller had to [[Thinking outside the box|think outside the box]] in forming her squad; she recruited two freshmen who had never played the game before after seeing them jog around campus&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suntimes.com/sports/colleges/1565585,CST-SPT-nux10.article&lt;/ref&gt; (they went on to be named All-Americans).  Her methods proved successful, however, and the team improved its record every year from its inception until 2005, when the Wildcats went undefeated and won their first national title.  Two years and two more championships later in 2007, they joined Maryland as the only teams to win three consecutive national titles.  The Wildcats would take home championship trophies again in 2008 and after a second undefeated season in 2009.  The streak ended in 2010 when the team lost to Maryland in a championship game that set the attendance record for a women's lacrosse match in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-0531-northwestern-lacrosse--20100530,0,1747565.story&lt;/ref&gt;

During their five-year championship run, the Wildcats had a record of 106-3 and were undefeated at home.

When the team visited the [[White House]] after winning their first championship, they created a minor fashion scandal when some members wore flip-flops.  The publicity inspired the team to auction off their sandals with the proceeds going to the [[Friends of Jaclyn]] charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-07-19-flip-flops_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The team first met Jaclyn Murphy in 2005 when she was recovering from a brain tumor and their support prompted her father to start a charity that matches other college teams with pediatric brain tumor patients.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/16/sports/othersports/16northwestern.html?_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;
