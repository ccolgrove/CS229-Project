== History ==
[[Image:Submersible named Star III in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography.JPG|thumb|left|Star III, in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] 
When the [[Regents of the University of California]] originally authorized the San Diego campus in 1956, it was planned as first imagined by [[Roger Revelle]], Director of Scripps, to start as a graduate school of science and engineering comparable in quality to [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]].&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kerr | first=Clark | title=The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949-1967 Volume I: Academic Triumphs | year=2003 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=jMEZ_47vXkAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA254 | pages=248, 254â260 | location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | accessdate=2009-07-20 | isbn=9780520223677 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of San Diego supported the idea, voting the same year to transfer to the university {{convert|59|acre|ha}} of mesa land on the coast near the Scripps Institute. The Regents requested an additional gift of {{convert|550|acre|ha}} of undeveloped mesa land northeast of Scripps, as well as {{convert|500|acres|ha}} on the former site of [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews|Camp Matthews]], but Revelle jeopardized the site selection by making public La Jolla's exclusive real estate practices antagonistic to minority racial and religious groups, angering local conservatives as well as UC Regent [[Edwin W. Pauley]].&lt;ref name=Kerr/&gt; UC President [[Clark Kerr]] satisfied San Diego city donors by changing the proposed name from University of California, La Jolla, to University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref name=Kerr/&gt; The city voted in agreement to its part in 1958, and the UC approved construction of the new campus in 1960. Because of the clash with Pauley, Revelle was not made chancellorâ[[Herbert York]], first director of [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], was designated instead.&lt;ref name=Kerr/&gt; York worked out the planning of the main campus according to the &quot;[[Oxbridge]]&quot; model, relying on many of Revelle's ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;/&gt;

UCSD was the first general campus of the UC to be designed &quot;from the top down&quot; in terms of research emphasis. [[John Jay Hopkins]] of [[General Dynamics|General Dynamics Corporation]] donated one million dollars to be used for recruiting a founding faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegometro.com/2000/sep/coverstory.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080417234035/http://www.sandiegometro.com/2000/sep/coverstory.html|archivedate=2008-04-17|title=Forty Years of UCSD Perspective|last=Gribble|first=Joanne|date=2000-09|work=San Diego Metropolitan |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Urey]], Nobel winner in Chemistry, was an early recruit to the faculty in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt; (Revelle and [[Hans Suess|Suess]] published the first paper on the [[Greenhouse effect]] the year before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;) [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]] was appointed professor of physics in 1960; she later won the Nobel Prize in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;  The graduate division of the school opened in 1960 with 20 faculty in residence; instruction was offered in the fields of [[physics]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[earth science]]. Classes initially met in the Scripps Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;/&gt; 

By 1963, new facilities on the mesa been finished for the School of Science and Engineering, and new buildings were under construction for Social Sciences and Humanities. Ten additional faculty in those disciplines were hired, and the whole site was designated the First College of the new campus. York resigned as chancellor in 1963 and was replaced by [[John Semple Galbraith]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt; The campus accepted its first undergraduate class of 181 freshman in 1964, and was designated Revelle College the next year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman1&quot;&gt;Stadtman, Verne A. &quot;The University of California, 1868-1968,&quot; pages 407-411&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadtman&quot;&gt;{{Cite document | last=Stadtman | first=Verne A. | title=The Centennial Record of the University of California | year=1967 | publisher=Office of the Regents of the University of California, Office of the Secretary

Political theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]] joined the faculty in 1965. A champion of the [[New Left]], he reportedly was the first protestor to occupy the administration building in a demonstration organized by his student, [[Angela Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barberella&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/aug/23/bourgeois-marxist/|title=The Bourgeois Marxist|last=Barberella|date=2007-08-23|work=San Diego Reader|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Legion]] offered to buy out the remainder of Marcuse's contract for $20,000; the Regents censured Chancellor McGill for defending Marcuse on the basis of [[academic freedom]], but further action was averted after local leaders expressed support for Marcuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gribble&quot;/&gt;

[[Richard C. Atkinson]], chancellor from 1980 to 1995, strengthened UCSD's ties with the city of San Diego by encouraging [[technology transfer]] with developing companies, transforming San Diego into a world leader in technology-based industries. Private giving rose from $15 million to nearly $50 million annually, faculty expanded by nearly 50%, and enrollment doubled to about 18,000 students during his chancellorship. In 1995, the quality of UCSD's graduate programs was ranked tenth in the nation by the National Research Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Public art ===
{{Main|Stuart Collection}}

More than a dozen public art projects, part of the [[Stuart Collection]], decorate the campus. Perhaps the most famous of these is the [[Sun God (statue)|Sun God]], a large winged creature located near the Faculty Club. Other Stuart Collection art includes a collection of [[Stonehenge]]-like stone blocks, a large coiling snake path, a table by [[Jenny Holzer]], a building that flashes the names of vices and virtues in bright neon lights, and three metallic [[Eucalyptus]] trees, the Music Tree, the Literary Tree and the Third Tree commonly referred to as the Silent Tree. One of the newest additions to the collection is Tim Hawkinson's giant teddy bear made of six boulders located in between the newly constructed [[Calit2]] buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calit2&quot;/&gt; Another notable campus sight are the graffiti tunnels of Mandeville Hall, a series of corridors that have been tagged with [[graffiti]] by generations of students over decades of use. Students in the university's visual arts department also often create temporary public art installations as part of their coursework. The university is also sponsoring a $56,000 [[performance art]] project to develop a sense of community at the sprawling campus.&lt;ref&gt;

UCSD has the 5,000 animal [[Birch Aquarium]] and public museum, the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]], several large shake facilities including the world record holding [http://nees.ucsd.edu/ Large High Performance Outdoor Shake Table], multiple open ocean [http://shipsked.ucsd.edu research vessels], and a [http://shipsked.ucsd.edu/Marine_Facility sea port].

==Organization and administration==
UCSD is one of the ten general campuses of the [[University of California]] system which is governed by a publicly appointed 26-member [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] and administered by a president whose office is located in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]. [[Mark Yudof]] became the 19th president of the University system in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/aboutuc/governance.html |title=Governance at UC |publisher=University of California |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of regents appoint [[chancellor (education)|chancellors]] to serve as the chief administrative officer of each individual general campus. [[Marye Anne Fox]] became the seventh chancellor of UCSD in 2004, succeeding [[Robert C. Dynes]] who served as President of the UC system from 2003 until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-chancellor.ucsd.edu/biography.html |title=Governance at UC |publisher=University of California |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chancellor Fox's total compensation was $401,091 for 2007â2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/premium/stats/990/public.php?keyword=marye+anne+fox&amp;radio=Prez&amp;Year=2008&amp;State=&amp;type= |title=Presidents' Pay and Benefits at Public Institutions |publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chancellor has an immediate staff of eight vice chancellors for academic affairs, research, marine sciences, student affairs, planning, external relations, business affairs, and health sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/PPM/docs/10-0.pdf |publisher=University of California, San Diego |title=UCSD Administrative Organization Chart |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university operates on an [[academic quarter (year division)|academic quarter system]] with three primary academic quarters beginning in late September and ending in mid June.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Catalog|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endowment===
UCSD has at least two distinct endowments; one controlled by the Regents and another controlled by a privately appointed non-profit corporation called the UC San Diego Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucsdfoundation.ucsd.edu/about_us.asp |title=About UC San Diego Foundation |publisher=UC San Diego Foundation |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the foundation received $121.8 million in support and managed assets worth $520.7 million in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-er.ucsd.edu/foundationDir/pdf/UCSDFoundation2007-2008.pdf |publisher=UC San Diego Foundation |title=2008 Financial Statement |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, UCSD became the first university in the western region to top $1 billion in their eight-year fundraising campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucsdnews.ucsd.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/06-081BillionFundraisingLM-.asp |title=UC San Diego Becomes Region's First University to Top $1 Billion in a Fundraising Campaign |publisher=Ucsdnews.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student government===
The campus's undergraduate population is represented by a formal [[student government]], known as the Associated Students (ASUCSD) which was founded on 16 December 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://as.ucsd.edu |title=Associated Students of UCSD |publisher=As.ucsd.edu |date=2009-06-08 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASUCSD Minutes, 16 December 1964&lt;/ref&gt; By a student referendum it was abolished in 1972 and later reestablished in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;ASUCSD Minutes, 24 May 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the ASUCSD passed a non-binding resolution calling on the University of California to [[Divestment from South Africa|divest]] from its investments in [[South Africa]] due to the South African governmentâs institutionalized system of [[apartheid]]. The UC subsequently divested from such holdings later that year, a move [[Nelson Mandela]] later pointed to as a catalyst to ending white-minority rule in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msu.edu/~divest/apartheid.html|South African Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt; Each college has its own [[student council]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegefaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = FAQ's about UCSD's Six Colleges | work = Official Web site of the University of California, San Diego | publisher = Regents of the University of California | date = 2009-07-15 | url = http://www.ucsd.edu/prospective-students/undergraduate-college-system/faqs.html#select | accessdate = 2009-07-17}}{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus's graduate population is represented by the Graduate Student Association (GSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsa.ucsd.edu |title=UCSD Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association's membership comprises representatives from each of the graduate departments. The number of representatives is proportional to the number of graduate students within that particular department. Additionally, graduate students who serve as teaching or research assistants are represented by the UC-wide union of Academic Student Employees, [[UAW]] Local 2865.

===Residential colleges===
UCSD's undergraduate division is organized into six [[residential college]]s. The system is modeled on the residential systems at [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[List of colleges of the University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. They each set their own general-education requirements as well as having their own administrative and advising staff and granting unique degrees and separate commencement ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Catalog|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsd.edu/current-students/academics/commencement/ |title=Commencement |publisher=Ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chronological order by date of foundation, the six colleges are:
#[[Revelle College]], founded in 1964 as First College, emphasizes a &quot;Renaissance education&quot; through the Humanities sequence which integrates history, literature, and philosophy. It has highly structured requirements.
#[[John Muir College]], founded in 1967 as Second College, emphasizes a &quot;spirit of self-sufficiency and individual choice&quot; and offers loosely structured general-education requirements.
#[[Thurgood Marshall College]], founded in 1970 as Third College, emphasizes &quot;scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of one's role in society&quot;.
#[[Earl Warren College]], founded in 1974 as Fourth College, requires students to pursue a major of their choice while also requiring two &quot;programs of concentration&quot; in disciplines unrelated to each other and to their major &quot;toward a life in balance&quot;.
#[[Eleanor Roosevelt College]], founded in 1988 as Fifth College, which focuses its core education program on a cross-cultural interdisciplinary course sequence entitled &quot;Making of the Modern World&quot;, has a foreign language requirement, and encourages studying abroad.
#[[Sixth College]], founded in 2002 with a focus on &quot;historical and philosophical connections among culture, art and technology.&quot;

[[Image:Center Hall Front, UCSD.JPG|thumb|left|Center Hall, a lecture hall near the center of campus]]
Students affiliate with a college based upon its particular philosophy and environment as majors are not exclusive to specific colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Catalog|2010|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Muir and Earl Warren enroll the largest number of undergraduate students followed by Thurgood Marshall, Revelle, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/sriweb/enroll/ugcoll.pdf |title=Undergraduates by College |publisher=Student Research and Information, Student Affairs |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each undergraduate college sets the requirements for awarding provost's honors and honors at graduation in addition to departmental honors and [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] honors.

The four year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments at the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt; The university offers 125 bachelors degree programs organized into six disciplinary divisions: Arts, Humanities, Engineering, Science/Math, Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.ucsd.edu/Files/Fastfacts/0708%20ucsd%20fast%20facts.pdf |title=University of California, San Diego Trtiton States 2007-2008 |publisher=Institutional Research, University of California, San Diego |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 38% of undergraduates major in the social sciences, followed by 25% in biological sciences, 18% in engineering, 8% in sciences and math, 4% in humanities, and 3% in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/sriweb/enroll/ugdisc.pdf |title=Undergraduate Enrollment by Major Field of Study |publisher=Student Research and Information, Student Affairs |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each undergraduate colleges sets its own general education requirements (GEs) for graduation in addition to the specific requirements of majors set by individual departments and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Catalog|2010|pp=16â31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Catalog|2010|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Graduate admissions are largely centralized through the Office of Graduate Studies. However, the [[Rady School of Management]], [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and the [[Graduate School of International Relations and Pacific Studies]] (IR/PS) handle their own admissions.

In 2009, UCSD mistakenly sent Admit Day welcome emails to all its 47,000 freshmen applicants, instead of just the 17,000 who had been admitted.&lt;ref&gt;NBC San Diego News.

== Student life ==
[[Image:Price Center, UCSD.jpg|thumb|[[Price Center]]]]
The main student hub is the [[Price Center]] located in the center of campus, just south of [[Geisel Library]]. The Price Center offers a variety of services, places, and spaces, including restaurants, the central bookstore, movie theater, and various student organizations. In the Spring of 2003, a Student Referendum was passed to expand the Price Center to nearly double the original size. The [[Price Center]] East expansion was officially opened to the public on May 19, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/thisweek/2008/05/19_pce-launch.asp |title=Campus Celebrates Opening of Price Center Expansion with Launch Party |publisher=Ucsdnews.ucsd.edu |date=2008-05-19 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also three campus centers that cultivate a sense of community among faculty, staff, and students: the [[multiculturalism|Cross-Cultural]] Center, the [[Gender|Women's Center]], and the [[LGBT]] Resource Center. UCSD was the last UC campus to have such centers. All three centers, especially the Cross-Cultural Center that was created first, were founded in the mid-1990s and were the result of student movements that demanded change despite opposition by the campus administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.ucsd.edu/About.asp |title=UCSD :: Cross-Cultural Center |publisher=Ccc.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a music venue on the campus grounds of some fame called the [[ChÃ© CafÃ©]], a collective organization serving multiple functions as an underground music venue, vegan food collective, center for grassroots organizations such as [[Food Not Bombs]], and similar groups and activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://checafe.ucsd.edu/about.html ChÃ© CafÃ© Collective&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent local San Diego bands such as [[The Locust]] and [[Pinback]], and national tours such as [[Mates of State]] and [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] have given the [[ChÃ© CafÃ©]] some fame and praise as a radical vegan collective despite its small size (it fits a few hundred people) and limited sound equipment.

===International House===
International House is home to about 400 students from more than thirty countries.{{cn|date=April 2011}} The I-House community provides a social atmosphere where opportunities for significant cross-cultural exchange between American and international students is plentiful. International learning is fostered through formal programs including current affairs discussions, cultural nights, and a community newsletter. Upper-division undergraduates from all six colleges, graduate students, faculty, and researchers are eligible to live in International House, located in the Eleanor Roosevelt College townhouses. Demand is very high for this special program and there is a waitlist each quarter. Spaces in International House are not guaranteed and admission requires a separate application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdh.ucsd.edu/housing/location.asp UC San Diego Housing - The Six Colleges and La Jolla Living]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events and traditions===
[[Image:Watermelon Drop UCSD.jpg|left|thumb|The June 2007 Watermelon Drop, an annual tradition at Revelle College]]
The Associated Students also coordinates a wide variety of concerts and events during the year, including All Campus Dance, Bear Gardens, Loft Events, and the Sun God Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concerts.ucsd.edu/pages/about |title=Concerts + Events :: Associated Students :: About |publisher=Concerts.ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sun God Festival]], named after the [[Sun God (statue)|statue]] created by [[art]]ist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], is the best-known of the festivals. The festival has grown in its 28 year history into a 20,000 person event.  The day consists of student org booths and performers, as well as an eclectic mix of musical acts across 3 stages.

Two other popular campus events include the Pumpkin Drop and the Watermelon Drop, which take place during [[Halloween]] and at the end of the third (Spring) [[academic quarter (year division)|academic quarter]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsd.edu/prospective-students/undergraduate-college-system/college-traditions.html |title=College Traditions |publisher=Ucsd.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}{{dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Watermelon Drop is one of the campus's oldest traditions, famously originating in 1965 from a physics exam question centering on the velocity on impact of a dropped object. A group of intrigued students pursued that line of thought by dropping a watermelon from the top floor of Revelle's Urey Hall to measure the size of the resulting splat. A variety of events surround the Watermelon Drop, including a pageant where an occasionally male but generally female &quot;Watermelon Queen&quot; is elected. In 1979 the Queen rode to Urey Hall in a yellow VW Bug with a cut-off top owned by the winner that year, Bill Clabby. The Pumpkin Drop is a similar event celebrated by the dropping of a large, candy-filled pumpkin from 11-story Tioga Hall, the tallest residential building on the Muir college campus.

===Student media===
{{see also|UCSD TV}}
The campus newspaper, operated independent of student funds, is the ''[[UCSD Guardian]]''. The campus also hosts a small independent radio station, [[KSDT Radio|KSDT]], which no longer broadcasts over the airwaves, but still operates online.

One of the more controversial aspects of student life at UCSD is the student-run comedy paper, ''[[The Koala]]'', a satirical paper often criticized for its provocative articles and drawings, which is also funded by the A.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/72.html FIRE - Student Humor Magazine Prosecuted for Parody at UCSD: University Decision Expected This Week&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the student government made national news over a controversy regarding [[pornography]] broadcast over the A.S.-funded [[television]] station, SRTV, by members of ''The Koala''.  More controversy was generated by the program [[Live Hot Puppet Chat]], a midnight sex-advice puppet show also broadcast on SRTV.

In February 2010, members of ''[[The Koala]]'', on their Student Run Television program &quot;Koala TV&quot; publicly supported the &quot;Compton Cookout&quot;, a controversial off-campus party mocking Black History Month that included UCSD fraternity members among the organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gordon| first = Larry| title = UC San Diego condemns student party mocking Black History Month| newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = February 18, 2010| url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ucsd18-2010feb18,0,5698009.story | accessdate = March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCSD does not have an NCAA football team.

Until the 2007-2008 school year, UCSD was the only DII school that did not offer athletic [[scholarship]]s. In 2005, the NCAA created a rule that made it mandatory for DII programs to award athletic grants; a measure was proposed to begin offering $500 &quot;grants-in-aid&quot; to all 600 intercollegiate athletes in order to meet this requirement. In February 2007, a student [[referendum]] was passed with the largest vote in UCSD history, authorizing a $329 annual student fee to fund a raise in coaches' salaries, hire more trainers and provide all athletes with a $500 scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yang Su&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20070203/news_7m3ucsd.html|title=Athletic fee hike approved at UCSD|last=Yang Su|first=Elinor|date=2007-02-03|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006-2007, UCSD's best season since moving to DII, 19 of 23 athletic programs qualified for post-season competition, including 17 to the NCAA Championships. Eight of those teams finished in the top-5 in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsdtritons.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5800&amp;ATCLID=921992 |title=Earl Edwards Named the NACDA Division II West Region Athletic Director of the Year - UCSDTritons.comâOfficial Web Site of UC San Diego Athletics |publisher=Ucsdtritons.com |date=2005-09-02 |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
