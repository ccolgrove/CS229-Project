The '''Libertarian Party of Kansas''' (LPKS) is the [[Kansas]] affiliate of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. Since 2009 the Libertarian Party of Kansas has been the fastest growing political party in the state of Kansas.  The LPKS earned full ballot access in 1993, with Libertarian candidates appearing on every statewide general election ballot since then.

To achieve major party status, their candidate for [[Governor of Kansas]], Andrew Gray, needed to receive 5% or more of the statewide vote in the general election,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20100913031426/http://www.kansascity.com/2010/09/09/2211246/libertarians-aiming-to-tally-enough.html Libertarians aiming to tally enough votes to gain âmajor partyâ status in Kansas]&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/kansas Kansas - Election Results 2010].
