'''The Crimson Armada''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The band initially formed in [[Westerville, Ohio]] in 2007, but after several live shows and demos the band went on hiatus. After pressure from the local music scene, the group reformed a year later. According to [[Allmusic]], the band has found itself &quot;on a meteoric rise through the [[extreme metal]] world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Allmusic /&gt; The band's lyrics contain spiritual themes and the band has claimed to have members who are [[Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com//thecrimsonarmada/blog/451667518 |title=Are We a Christian Band? van THE CRIMSON ARMADA op Myspace |publisher=Myspace.com |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the band's songwriter and lead vocalist Saud Ahmed has stated that the band is not Christian, as the band has never written a song about [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmed|first=Saud|title=SAUDAPOP, is the crimson armada a christian band? i read ur lyrics and a lot of them are very christian oriented but i downloaded the old cd and there is islam on the first song. just wondering.|url=http://saudapop.tumblr.com/post/2461689129/is-the-crimson-armada-a-christian-band-i-read-ur|publisher=[[Tumblr]]|accessdate=23 November 2011|month=January|year=2011|quote=There isnât a single song written in the past or present by the crimson armada that is about jesus [sic]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation and ''Guardians'' (2007-2010)===
The band originally formed in [[Westerville, Ohio]] in 2007 but after releasing several demos and playing some live shows with bands like [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]] and [[It Prevails]], the band went on hiatus in early 2008. At the urging of the local music scene however, The Crimson Armada reformed in 2008 in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;ref name=Allmusic /&gt;  In the summer of 2008, the group inked a deal with [[Metal Blade Records]], and in July, 2009, the band released its debut album, ''[[Guardians (album)|Guardians]]''.&lt;ref name=Allmusic /&gt;&lt;ref name=Myspace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/thecrimsonarmada |title=The Crimson Armada Myspace |accessdate=2011-03-03 |author=The Crimson Armada |date= |work=The Crimson Armada Biography |publisher=[[Myspace]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the album's release, the band went on several tours with acts such as [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]], and [[Mychildren Mybride]]. In the Summer of 2010 the group headed out on the [[Scream the Prayer Tour]].&lt;ref name=HM /&gt;&lt;ref name=Myspace /&gt; They closed out the album's touring cycle in the fall of 2010 the &quot;Monument Tour&quot;.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===''Conviction'' (2011-present)===
In January 2011, The Crimson Armada signed a new record deal with [[Artery Recordings]],&lt;ref name=Blabber&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=152436 |title=THE CRIMSON ARMADA Signs With ARTERY RECORDINGS |author=Blabbermouth.net |date=2011-01-17 |work=Blabbermouth News Archive |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has announced a new album entitled ''[[Conviction (The Crimson Armada album)|Conviction]]'' that is scheduled for release June 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=AbsolutePunk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?s=87914c04a70aec3339d9338fedb3626f&amp;t=2263412 |title=Artery Recordings Summer Release Schedule |author=Alex DiVincenzo |date=2011-04-20 |work=Release Date News |publisher=Absolutepunk.net |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their style changed a lot from their debut album. The guitars are darker, there's an a lot more recognizable song structure in most songs and their new guitarist Brandon McMaster implemented clean vocals, mostly used in or around the choruses of the songs, a well known element from both the [[metalcore]] and the more recent, yet similar, [[post-hardcore]] genre.
The album contains a song featuring Andy Adkins of [[A Plea for Purging]] (vocals) called &quot;Composed Of Stone&quot;, and a song featuring Levi Benton of [[Miss May I]] (vocals) called &quot;Napalm&quot;.

According to ''[[Alternative Press]]'', The Crimson Armada is scheduled to play on April 14 at the 13th Annual [[New England Metal and Hardcore Festival]], a three day festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karan|first=Tim|title=Job For A Cowboy, Bury Your Dead, Biohazard, more playing New England Metal And Hardcore Festival|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/job_for_a_cowboy_bury_your_dead_biohazard_more_playing_new_england_metal_an/|work=News|publisher=Alternative Press|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also set for a summer tour with [[MyChildren MyBride]], [[Impending Doom]], This Or The Apocalypse.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
