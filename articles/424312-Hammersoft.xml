'''Emporia State University''' ('''ESU''') is a university in the city of [[Emporia, Kansas|Emporia]] in [[Lyon County, Kansas|Lyon County]], [[Kansas]], just east of the [[Flint Hills]]. 

== History ==
The university was founded in March 1863 when the Kansas Legislature passed the enabling act to establish the '''Kansas State Normal School'''. The school's first graduating class consisted of two women in 1867, the year the first permanent building was completed.

In 1876, the Kansas Legislature passed the &quot;Miscellaneous appropriations bill of 1876&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=vbUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Concordia+Normal+School%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4uLx0rWpPC&amp;sig=Z7bD4udyJ79_PN0FI4zlPfGgElw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_d9xTO3nLoGKlwer9PiODg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Concordia%20Normal%20School%22&amp;f=false Transactions of the Kansas State Historical Society, Volume 6] By Kansas State Historical Societ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The end result was that [[Leavenworth Normal School|Leavenworth Normal]] and [[Concordia Normal School|Concordia Normal]] were closed so the state funding for normal schools could be directed to Emporia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1918ks/v2/1035.html#103905 A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans] &quot;State Normal School, Concordia&quot; by William E. Connelley, transcribed by Carolyn Ward, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1923, the name of the school was changed to the '''Kansas State Teachers College'''. In July 1974, the name was changed to '''Emporia Kansas State College'''. On April 21, 1977, the college became '''Emporia State University'''. The [[Kansas Board of Regents]] is the governing body for ESU. Since 1863 more than 150,000 students have studied at ESU.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emporia.edu/about/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2006, then ESU president Kay Schallenkamp, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]], resigned to serve as president of [[Black Hills State University]] starting July 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporia.edu/news/archives/2006/MAY2006/schallenkampfarewell.htm Schallenkamp farewell]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2006 the Kansas Board of Regents announced the hiring of Michael R. Lane ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[finance]], [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]], 1975; [[Master of Science|MS]] in [[Financial accountancy|financial accounting]], [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]], 1976; Ph.D in financial accounting, [[Texas A&amp;M University]], 1980&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporia.edu/presprofile/candidates.htm Profile of candidates]&lt;/ref&gt;) as University President effective November 1, 2006.  Lane was previously provost at [[University of Arkansas - Fort Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/15588392.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
