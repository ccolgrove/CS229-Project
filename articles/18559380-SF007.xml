'''Ksplice''' is an open source&lt;ref name=&quot;source&quot; /&gt; extension of the [[Linux kernel]] which allows [[system administrator]]s to apply security [[patch (software)|patch]]es to a running [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] without having to [[booting|reboot]] the [[operating system]]. Ksplice has been implemented for Linux on the [[x86-32]] and [[x86-64]] architectures. It was developed by Ksplice, Inc. until 21 July 2011, when [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] acquired Ksplice, started offering support for [[Oracle Linux]], and dropped support for [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] among other distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/ksplice/index.html|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/ksplice/customer-letter-430127.html |title=Oracle and Ksplice |publisher=Oracle.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/ksplice/customer-letter-430127.html |title=Customer Letter Oracle and Ksplice |publisher=Oracle.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Ksplice takes as input a [[unified diff]] and the original kernel source code, and it updates the running kernel in [[Computer memory|memory]]. Using Ksplice does not require any preparation before the system is originally [[Booting|booted]] (the running kernel does not need to have been specially [[compile]]d, for example). In order to generate an update, Ksplice must determine what code within the kernel has been changed by the source code patch. Ksplice performs this analysis at the [[Executable and Linking Format]] (ELF) object code layer, rather than at the [[C (programming language)|C]] source code layer.

To apply a patch, Ksplice first freezes execution of a computer so it is the only program running. The system verifies that no [[Central Processing Unit|processors]] were in the middle of executing functions that will be modified by the patch. Ksplice modifies the beginning of changed functions so that they instead point to new, updated versions of those functions, and modifies data and structures in memory that need to be changed. Finally, Ksplice resumes each processor running where it left off.

To be fully automatic, Ksplice's design was originally limited to patches that did not introduce [[semantic]] changes to [[data structures]], since most Linux kernel security patches do not make these kinds of changes. An evaluation against Linux kernel security patches from May 2005 to May 2008 found that Ksplice was able to apply all the 64 significant kernel [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] discovered in that interval.  In 2009, major Linux vendors asked their customers to install a kernel update more than once per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nexcess.net/2010/11/30/nexcess-adopts-ksplice-uptrack-rebootless-technology/|title=Nexcess Adopts Ksplice Uptrack âRebootlessâ Technology|publisher=Nexcess |date= |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For patches that do introduce semantic changes to data structures, Ksplice requires a programmer to write a short amount of additional code to help apply the patch.
This was necessary for 12% of the updates in that time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksplice.com/cve-evaluation |title=Performance record |publisher=Ksplice |date= |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ksplice software was started by four MIT students based on Jeff Arnold's master's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/340477/|title=Ksplice provides updates without reboots|publisher=LWN |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jeff Arnold later created Ksplice, Inc. with himself as the president of the company.  Around May of 2009, the company won the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition and the Cyber Security Challenge of [[Global Security Challenge]].

Around August of 2009, the company stopped providing the source code for Ksplice, thus preventing other entities from creating alternative updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://packages.qa.debian.org/k/ksplice.html|title=Debian package changelog|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090605074847/http://www.ksplice.com/software|title=KSplice source code download page, now defunct|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksplice.com/git/|title=KSplice - Index of /git - now without the ksplice source|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Ksplice software was provided under an open source license, Ksplice, Inc. provided a service to make it easier to use the software.   Ksplice, Inc. provided prebuilt and tested updates for the [[Red Hat]], [[Cent OS]], [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] Linux distributions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksplice.com/uptrack/ |title=Ksplice Uptrack |publisher=Ksplice |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The virtualization technologies [[OpenVZ]] and [[Virtuozzo]] were also supported. Updates for Ubuntu Desktop and Fedora systems were provided free of charge, whereas other platforms were offered on a subscription basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksplice.com/pricing|title=Pricing|publisher=Ksplice, Inc.|accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2011, Oracle announced they acquired Ksplice, Inc.  At the time the company was acquired, Ksplice, Inc. claimed to have over 700 companies using the service to protect over 100,000 servers.  While the service had been available for multiple Linux distributions, it was stated at the time Ksplice, Inc. was acquired that &quot;Oracle believes it will be the only enterprise Linux provider that can offer zero downtime updates.&quot; More explicitly, &quot;Oracle does not plan to support the use of Ksplice technology with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/ksplice/customer-letter-430127.html|title=Customer Letter|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was widely misreported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/07/21/2143235/Oracle-Acquires-K-splice-For-an-Undisclosed-Amount |title=Oracle Acquires K-splice For an Undisclosed Amount | accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br-linux.org/2011/oracle-adquire-ksplice-e-interrompe-suporte-para-red-hat-centos-e-suse/ |title=Oracle adquire Ksplice e interrompe suporte para Red Hat, CentOS e SUSE | accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Oracle dropped support for [[SUSE Linux distributions]]; however, the commercial service offered by Ksplice, Inc. never supported SUSE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksplice.com/uptrack/supported-kernels |title=Supported kernels | accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong reaction from the community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/07/21/2143235/Oracle-Acquires-K-splice-For-an-Undisclosed-Amount |title=Slashdot community reaction to Oracle acquirement of K-Splice | accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates a high expectation of a fork of the original source-code, and a new competing product developed to support the remaining kernel variants, with heavy emphasis on the original project's open-source license.
