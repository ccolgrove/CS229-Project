The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[New York Giants]] season''' was the franchise's 84th season in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as the team looked to defend its [[Super Bowl XLII]] title. They improved upon their 10â6 record from [[2007 New York Giants season|2007]], becoming [[National Football Conference East Division|NFC East]] champions and finished with the #1 seed in the NFC playoffs with a 12-4 record. They lost to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the divisional round of the playoffs, however, becoming the second team in as many years to lose as the NFC's top seed (the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], who the Giants beat on their way to the Super Bowl, were the first).

The Giants qualified for the postseason for the fourth consecutive year, marking the first time in club history that they had accomplished that.

===Regular season===
The Giants began their title defense in the traditional [[National Football League Kickoff game|NFL Kickoff game]] like previous champions when they played the [[Washington Redskins]] at [[Giants Stadium]]. Traditionally, this game is usually played on the first Thursday following Labor Day in the United States. This day fell on September 4 in 2008.

On March 26, the [[NFL]], [[NBC]], and the [[Republican National Committee]] agreed in principle to move the kickoff time of the opener to 7:00 pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] instead of 8:30 pm EDT to accommodate the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSN2529053820080326 | accessdate = January 3, 2009 | work=Reuters | title=NFL season opener yields to McCain speech | date=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the third quarter, [[Donovan McNabb]] found [[Brian Westbrook]] for a 40 yard Eagles touchdown that increased their lead to 17â7. Philadelphia would score again in the 3rd with a 34 yard field goal by David Akers. The Giants would score on a 1 yard pass from [[Eli Manning]] to [[Darcy Johnson]] with 20 seconds left in the game, but couldn't recover an onside kick and the Eagles won the game.

Despite falling to 11â2, the Giants clinched the NFC East title when the Dallas Cowboys lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 20â13.

The second-to-last NFL game ever to be played at Texas Stadium was a defensive struggle that featured the Giants' weakest offensive showing of the year. [[Brandon Jacobs]] was sidelined with a knee injury, crippling New York's running game; [[Derrick Ward]] started in his place.

The Cowboys scored first, on a 34-yard touchdown pass from [[Tony Romo]] to [[Patrick Crayton]] early in the second quarter. The Giants answered with a 34-yard [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] field goal on the ensuing drive. The next scoring came in the fourth quarter, when Romo threw fullback [[Deon Anderson]] his first career touchdown. On the Cowboys' next drive, deep in their own territory, [[Mathias Kiwanuka]] sacked Romo and forced a fumble in the end zone, which resulted in a safety. But the Giants could only put up another field goal, and [[Tashard Choice]]'s 38-yard touchdown run with 2:24 to play sealed the victory for the Cowboys. [[Eli Manning]] was sacked a season-high eight times to Romo's four.

The Giants had now lost two consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 1â2 of [[2007 New York Giants season|2007]], and fell to 11â3.

The Giants snapped their two game losing streak and clinched home field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs by defeating the Panthers. With the loss Carolina failed to clinch the NFC South. The Giants had already clinched a first round bye by virtue of Minnesota's loss to Atlanta earlier in the day.

New York won the toss and scored on their opening drive on a 32-yard [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] field goal. Carolina responded by scoring a touchdown on their first drive, a thirteen yard run by [[DeAngelo Williams]].

The Giants scored on their second drive as well, going 74 yards in 13 plays and ending with a [[Brandon Jacobs]] touchdown from the Carolina 2. The Panthers responded with another Williams touchdown run, this time five yards, and a 14â10 lead. After forcing the Giants to punt Carolina scored again, as Williams scored his third touchdown of the game on a one-yard run. The drive went four plays for 65 yards, 60 of which came on a deep pass from [[Jake Delhomme]] to [[Muhsin Muhammad]]. Williams' touchdown came two plays after [[Steve Smith (Carolina Panthers)|Steve Smith]] appeared to have scored on a short pass, but a replay challenge was upheld.

After the teams traded punts the Giants scored with 0:55 remaining in the half as Carney added his second field goal of the game. Then on their second drive of the second half, [[Eli Manning]] threw a short touchdown to [[Kevin Boss]] to cut the deficit to 21â20 with 1:07 remaining in the third quarter. Carolina scored on their very next drive, with Williams scoring for the fourth time on a thirty-yard run.

New York tied the game with 3:24 remaining as Jacobs scored on a one yard touchdown run, after starting the drive in Panther territory. The Giants converted the two point conversion on a pass from Manning to [[Domenik Hixon]]. Carolina then drove down the field and faced fourth and five from the Giants 32 yard line, but [[John Kasay]] missed the potential game-winning field goal from 50 yards out.

On their second possession of the overtime period the Giants started at their own 13 yard line. On the first play of the drive [[Derrick Ward]] ran for 51 yards and pushed the ball into Carolina territory. Ward added a fourteen yard run two plays later and a seventeen yard run the play following that, pushing his rushing total to 215 yards (a career high) and leaving the Giants two yards from the endzone. On the next play Jacobs scored on a run, his third score of the game, and New York won the game.

The Giants rushed for 301 yards in the game compared to 158 for the Panthers. Jacobs added 87 yards to Ward's 215. Williams rushed for 108 yards on 24 carries, including his four touchdowns. Delhomme finished 11â19 for 185 yards and Manning 17â27 for 181 and a touchdown.

Ward's 14.3 yard rushing average was a single game Giants record. Manning became the first Giants quarterback to throw at least 3,000 passing yards in a season for four consecutive seasons.

The Giants lost their final game of the 2008 regular season in Minneapolis, their first loss to the Vikings in the Metrodome since the 2001 season. Minnesota clinched the NFC North division crown with the win. New York rested most of their starters in the second half and [[Brandon Jacobs]], [[Kevin Boss]], [[Aaron Ross (American football)|Aaron Ross]], and [[Barry Cofield]] were held out of the game due to injuries.

After a scoreless first quarter the Vikings jumped out to a 10â0 lead early in the second quarter, with a [[Ryan Longwell]] field goal and a 67-yard touchdown run by [[Adrian Peterson]] coming 3:27 apart. Three field goals by John Carney cut the Vikings' lead to 10â9 at the half.

The Giants took their first lead in the third quarter as [[David Carr]] hit [[Domenik Hixon]] for a 23-yard touchdown pass and extended the lead to nine with 11:25 remaining in the game as Carney added his fourth field goal. Minnesota scored a touchdown on a long pass from [[Tarvaris Jackson]] to [[Bernard Berrian]] on their next drive, cutting the Giants lead to 19â17. The Giants then had a chance to extend the lead and force Minnesota to score a touchdown to win, but Carney missed from 48 yards with 3:17 to go. Jackson then led the Vikings into field goal range and Longwell hit from 50 yards out to win the game as time expired.

[[Eli Manning]], who started for the Giants but was pulled in the third quarter, led the team with 119 yards passing on 11-for-19, and Carr added 110 yards on 8-for-11. Halfback [[Derrick Ward]] rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries, eclipsing 1,000 yards for the season (1,025), joining Jacobs in the 1,000 yard club and making the Giants the fourth team in NFL history (joining the 1971 Dolphins, 1976 Steelers, and 1985 Browns) with two [[List of NFL teams with multiple 1000 yard rushers|1,000-yard running backs]].

Entering the postseason as the NFC's top seed, the Giants began their postseason run at home in the NFC Divisional round against their NFC East rival, the #6 [[Philadelphia Eagles]], in Round 3 of 2008's series.

New York got the early first quarter lead as kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] got a 22-yard field goal.  The Eagles would respond with quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] getting a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Giants would answer in the second quarter as the defense forced McNabb into an intentional grounding penalty from his own endzone, giving them a safety.  Afterwards, Carney would give New York a 34-yard field goal.  However, Philadelphia would get the halftime lead as kicker [[David Akers]] got a 25-yard field goal.

The Giants would regain the lead in the third quarter as Carney made a 36-yard field goal, but the Eagles got the lead again as Akers kicked a 35-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia took control as McNabb completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Brent Celek]], followed by Akers nailing a 20-yard field goal.  New York tried to rally, but the Eagles' defense would shut down any last attempt at a comeback.

With the loss, the Giants' season ended with an overall record of 12â5.
The Philadelphia Eagles became the first team to beat the Giants twice in the same season in Giants Stadium â the Giants were 7â2 at home this season and both losses were to the Eagles. This was the first game in NFL history with a final score of 23â11.
