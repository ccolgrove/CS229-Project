== Division of Architecture ==
The [http://home.ewha.ac.kr/~etech/en/html/0202_a.html Division of Architecture] was founded in 1994 in the College of Natural Sciences as the Department of Architecture. Architecture covers up-to-date design environment from museum to skyscraper to daily surrounding environment, as well as all surrounding facilities including houses, museums, concert halls, schools, and offices. Until 2005, the Department of Architecture was part of the College of Engineering, and since 2006, it expanded to the Division of Architecture as an independent division. The division consists of 2 majors, Architecture Major and Architectural Engineering Major. In the Architecture Major, students study design and planning, and in the Architectural Engineering Major, students study core engineering technology and basic engineering knowledge, which includes structural engineering, environmental technology and construction management.

=== Department of Architecture ===
Architecture is a field of study that deals with the human living space, covering cities, landscapes, and interior designs. This traditional, convergent academic area demands artistic sensibility, humanistic imagination, and scientific rigorousness. The Department of Architecture adopted a 5-year Bachelor of Architecture program in 2003 under the vision of âeducating women architects as value creators,â and has extensively reorganized the curriculum to focus on architectural design and practical training. The curriculum consists of five areas: 
* Architectural Design: the center of the entire course of study
* Communication using Various Media
* Cultural Context including art, history, environment, and cities
* Practical Affairs such as building codes and ethics
* Technologies: engineering knowledge. 
The Department provides students with comprehensive related experience through various special programs including summer internships, field study, special lectures, and exhibitions. Meanwhile, students themselves enjoy a rich campus life by organizing and participating in various degree-related groups of design, traditional architecture, CAD, and architectural volunteer work.

=== Department of Architectural Engineering ===
Architectural engineering involves the application of diverse engineering knowledge and business management techniques for the eco-friendly and economical realization of safe, pleasant, and healthy buildings. The Department of Architectural Engineering operates a 4-year engineering education accreditation program, dividing the subject into the following areas: 
* Building Structure: designing structures to secure the safety of buildings,sustainability of structures, green technology of structures, retrofitting of structural members, Fire safety design of structures
* Bio-mechanical Engineering;safety evaluation of heart valves, fatigue analysis of bio-composites
* Building Environment Planning and Energy Efficient Building M/E system: realizing sustainable development and energy-saving, low-carbon green buildings
