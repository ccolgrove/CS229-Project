'''VMware vSphere''' (formerly [[VMware Infrastructure]] 4) is [[VMware]]'s [[cloud computing]] virtualization [[operating system]]. 

==History==
While [[VMware Infrastructure]] 3.5 was in development, vSphere was conceived as an enhanced suite of tools with [[cloud computing]] utilizing VMware [[VMware ESX|ESX/ESXi]] 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReleaseArticle&quot;&gt;
[http://vsphere-land.com/news/vsphere-release-date.html Release article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloud computing-enabled tool suite was [[spin-off product|spun off]] as '''VMware Infrastructure 4''' (for short, ''VI 4'') parallel to but distinct from VMware Infrastructure 3.5 (''VI 3.5'') that was then ready for release (March 30, 2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReleaseArticle&quot; /&gt;

VMware eventually announced '''vSphere 4''' instead of VI 4 on April 21, 2009 and released it on May 21, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReleaseArticle&quot; /&gt;

VMware released Update 1 for vSphere 4 on November 19, 2009 to add support for [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vSphere 4.0 Update 1 Release Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere4/doc/vsp_esx40_u1_rel_notes.html|title=VMware ESX 4.0 Update 1 Release Notes |date=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VMware's vSphere 4.1 began shipping in August 2010. This update included an updated vCenter Configuration Manager as well as vCenter Application Discovery Manager, and the ability of  vMotion to move more than one [[virtual machine]] at a time from one server host to another.

VMware released Update 1 for vSphere 4.1 on 10 February, 2011 to add support for [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]] 6, RHEL 5.6, [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|SLES]] 11 SP1 for VMware, [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 10.10, and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 10 Update 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;vSphere 4.1 Update 1 Release Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere4/doc/vsp_esx41_u1_rel_notes.html|title=VMware ESX 4.1 Update 1 Release Notes |date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secret installation of vSphere was used by a disgruntled former employee to wipe out a New Jersey based pharmaceutical company's VMware installation in February of 2011, costing a reported $800,000 loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;vSphere Misused&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/194445/fired-techie-created-virtual-chaos-pharma-company|title=Fired Techie Created Virtual Chaos Pharma Company |date=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2011, VMware released its latest version of the suite: VMware vSphere 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-cloud-infrastructure-071211.html |title=VMware vSphereÂ® 5 launched}}&lt;/ref&gt;
