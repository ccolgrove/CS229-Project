'''Ubuntu Netbook Edition (UNE)''', known as '''Ubuntu Netbook Remix''' prior to the release of [[Ubuntu 10.04]],&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Specs/DesktopLucidUNE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-lucid-une&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/11/ubuntu-netbook-remix-to-be-renamed.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a version of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu Linux distribution]] that had been optimized to enable it to work better on [[netbook]]s and other devices with small screens or with the [[Intel Atom]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]].

UNE was available starting with Ubuntu release 8.04 (&quot;[[Hardy Heron]]&quot;). UNE was also an optional preinstalled [[operating system]] (OS) on some netbooks such as [[Dell Inspiron Mini Series|Dell Inspiron Mini]] 10v and the [[Toshiba]] NB100, and also ran on popular models such as the [[Acer Aspire One]] and the [[Asus Eee PC]].

[[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]], the developers of Ubuntu, are collaborating with [[Moblin|Moblin project]] to ensure optimization for lower hardware requirements and longer battery life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moblin&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.ubuntu.com/news/canoical-commits-ubuntu-moblin|title = Canonical announces support for Moblin v2|accessdate = 10 December 2010|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with version 10.10, Ubuntu Netbook Edition used the [[Unity (desktop environment)|Unity]] desktop as its desktop interface. The classic netbook interface was available in Ubuntu's software repositories as an option.&lt;ref name=&quot;LaunchpadUnityHist&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+publishinghistory|title = Publishing history of âunityâ package in Ubuntu|accessdate = 30 August 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWorld03May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/226940/natty_narwhal_the_first_linux_for_newbies.html |title = Natty Narwhal: the First Linux for Newbies?|accessdate = 1 September 2011|last = Noyes|first =  Katherine|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = [[PC World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Ubuntu's desktop edition has moved to the same Unity interface as the netbook edition, starting with [[Ubuntu 11.04]], the netbook edition has been merged into the desktop edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ubuntu1104alpha1&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/alpha1|title = Natty Narwhal Alpha 1|accessdate = 03 December 2010|last = Canonical Ltd|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
UNE could be installed in several ways:
* by first installing the regular Ubuntu package, then adding the UNE repository&lt;ref&gt;https://launchpad.net/~netbook-remix-team/+archive/ppa&lt;/ref&gt; and installing the relevant packages. Starting with Ubuntu 10.04, the packages are available on main repositories.
* by downloading UNE directly from the Ubuntu server, as either a .iso or .img file and writing the file to a USB stick (using Ubuntu Live USB Creator or UNetbootin) or CD.
* an option to install via the [[Wubi (Ubuntu installer)|Wubi installer]] is available for the 10.04 &quot;[[Lucid Lynx]]&quot; release.&lt;ref&gt;https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/mobile-unr-karmic-wubi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unity==
{{Main|Unity (desktop environment)}}
Starting with UNE 10.10, the interface was switched to Unity. Due to the desktop version of Ubuntu also being changed to the Unity interface, the netbook edition was rolled into the general Ubuntu distribution starting with [[Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal]] and the netbook edition was discontinued as a separate distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ubuntu1104alpha1&quot; /&gt;

==Variants==
[[Dell]] Ubuntu Netbook Edition is built specifically for the hardware profile of the [[Dell Inspiron Mini Series|Inspiron Mini]] 9, and is also available for the [[Dell Inspiron Mini Series|Inspiron Mini]] 12. It includes a custom built interface and launcher as well as non-free codecs such as [[MPEG-4]] and [[MP3]]. It began shipping on September 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/conten/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-9?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&lt;/ref&gt;

[[EasyPeasy]] is considered to be among the first UNE-based distributions, with a focus on the usage of [[proprietary software]] like [[Skype]] by default and also integrating a set of different standard applications and drivers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
