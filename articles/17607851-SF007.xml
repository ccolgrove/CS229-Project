'''Portugal''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Portugal.ogg|Ë|p|Ér|tÊ|Ê|É¡|Él}} ({{lang-pt|Portugal}}, {{IPA-pt|puÉ¾tuËÉ£aÉ«|IPA}}), officially the '''Portuguese Republic''' ({{lang-pt|RepÃºblica Portuguesa}}) is a country situated in southwestern [[Europe]] on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Portugal is the westernmost country of Europe, and is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the West and South and by [[Spain]] to the North and East. The Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] are part of Portugal. The country is named after its second largest city, [[Porto]], whose Latin name was ''Portus Cale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author= |url=http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/CVC/bdc/etnologia/opusculos/vol05/opusculos05_28_38.pdf |title=Leite de Vasconcelos, JosÃ©.

The land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continuously settled since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]: occupied by [[Celts]] like the [[Gallaeci]] and the [[Lusitanians]], integrated into the [[Roman Republic]] and later settled by Germanic peoples such as the [[Suebi]] and the [[Visigoths]], in the 8th century the lands were conquered by [[Moors]]. During the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'', Portugal established itself as an independent kingdom from [[Kingdom of LeÃ³n|LeÃ³n]], claiming to be the oldest European [[nation-state]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Jenkins, Spyros A. Sofos, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LNRyNG9NNkcC&amp;lpg=1 &quot;Nation and identity in contemporary Europe&quot;], p.145 Routledge, 1996, ISBN 0-415-12313-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th and 16th centuries, as the result of pioneering the [[Age of Discovery]], Portugal expanded [[Western Civilization|western]] influence and established a [[Portuguese Empire|global empire]] that included possessions in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and [[South America]], becoming one of the world's major economic, political and military powers. The [[Portuguese Empire]] was the first global empire in history,&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Eugene Page, Penny M. Sonnenburg, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; and also the longest lived of the European colonial empires, spanning almost 600 years, from the capture of [[Ceuta]] in 1415, to the handover of [[Macau]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1999. However, the country's international status was greatly reduced during the 19th century, especially following the [[Brazilian Independence|independence of Brazil]], its largest colony.

After the [[1910 revolution]] deposed the monarchy, the democratic but unstable [[Portuguese First Republic]] was established being then superseded by the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|&quot;Estado Novo&quot; authoritarian regime]].  Democracy was restored after the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] and the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974, after which Portugal's last overseas provinces became independent (most prominently [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]); the last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was ceded to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1999.

Portugal is a [[developed country]] with an advanced and high-income economy, with a very high Human Development Index. It has the world's 19th-highest [[quality-of-life index|quality-of-life]], [[WHO's ranking of healthcare systems|one of the top health care systems]], and it's also one of the world's most [[Globalization Index|globalized]] and [[Global Peace Index|peaceful]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2011-GPI-Results-Report-Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]], it is as well a founding member of the [[Latin Union]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], [[OECD]], [[NATO]], [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[Schengen Agreement]].

=== Early history ===

[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[Roman Temple of Ãvora|Temple of Diana]], [[Ãvora]].]]
The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the Roman name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]] and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]] (both part of [[Hispania]]), after 45 BC until 298 AD, settled again by [[Suebi]], [[Buri (Germanic tribe)|Buri]], and [[Visigoths]], and conquered by [[Moors]]. Other minor influences include some 5th century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlement, which were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]], [[Coimbra]] and even [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;Milhazes, JosÃ©. [http://www.rtp.pt/index.php?article=264957&amp;visual=16&amp;rss=0 Os antepassados caucasianos dos portugueses] â [[RÃ¡dio e TelevisÃ£o de Portugal]] in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconquista ===
{{Main|Kingdom of Galicia|County of Coimbra|County of Portugal|Battle of SÃ£o Mamede|Kingdom of Portugal}}
[[File:Castelo de Guimaraes.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Castle of GuimarÃ£es]], [[GuimarÃ£es]] â the city is known as the cradle of Portugal.]]
During the [[Reconquista]] period, Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from the Muslim and [[Moors|Moorish]] domination. In 868, the [[First County of Portugal]] was formed. 
A victory over the Muslims at [[Battle of Ourique]] in 1139 is traditionally taken as the occasion when the [[County of Portugal]] as a fief of the [[Kingdom of LeÃ³n]] was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].

Henry, to whom the newly formed county was awarded by [[Alfonso VI of LeÃ³n and Castile|Alfonso VI]] for his role in reconquering land from the Moors, based his newly formed county in [[Bracara Augusta]] (nowadays [[Braga]]), capital city of the ancient Roman province, and also previous capital  of several kingdoms over the first millennia.

On 24 June 1128, the [[Battle of SÃ£o Mamede]] occurred near [[GuimarÃ£es]]. [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso Henriques]], Count of Portugal, defeated his mother [[Teresa, Countess of Portugal|Countess Teresa]] and her lover [[FernÃ£o Peres de Trava]], thereby establishing himself as sole leader. Afonso Henriques officially declared Portugal's independence when he proclaimed himself [[List of Portuguese monarchs|king of Portugal]] on 25 July 1139, after the [[Battle of Ourique]]. He was recognized as such in 1143 by [[Alfonso VII of LeÃ³n|Alfonso VII]], king of LeÃ³n and Castile, and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]].
[[File:BatalhaFacade1.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Batalha Monastery]], built in 1385, is one of the best and original examples of Late Gothic architecture in Portugal. It is also a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].]]
Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors, as the size of Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, this [[Reconquista]] ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.

In 1348 and 1349, like the rest of Europe, Portugal was devastated by the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/09/13/2031252.htm?site=science/greatmomentsinscience Black Death], Great Moments in Science, ABC Science&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1373, Portugal made an [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|alliance with England]], which is the longest-standing alliance in the world.

In 1383, the king of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], husband of the daughter of the Portuguese king who had died without a male heir, claimed his throne. An ensuing popular revolt led to the [[1383-1385 Crisis]]. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later [[John I of Portugal|John I]]), seconded by General [[Nuno Ãlvares Pereira]] defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. This celebrated battle is still a symbol of glory and the struggle for independence from neighboring Spain.

=== Exploration, colonization and trade ===
{{Main|History of Portugal (1415â1542)}}
[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|165px|[[Vasco da Gama]] lands at [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] ([[Indian Subcontinent]]), on May 20th 1498.]]
In the following decades, Portugal spearheaded the exploration of the world and undertook the [[Age of Discovery]]. [[Infante]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Henry the Navigator]], son of [[JoÃ£o I of Portugal|King JoÃ£o I]], became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavor.

In 1415, Portugal conquered the first of its overseas colonies by conquering [[Ceuta]]. It was the first prosperous Islamic trade center in North [[Africa]]. There followed the first discoveries in the [[Atlantic]]: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.

Throughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese explorers|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#15th century|several common types of tradable commodities at the time]], ranging from [[gold]] to [[slavery|slaves]], as they looked for a route to [[India]] and its [[spices]], which were coveted in Europe.

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of [[Christopher Columbus]], was signed on 7 June 1494, and divided the newly discovered lands outside Europe between Portugal and Spain along a meridian 370 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the west coast of Africa).

In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] finally reached India and brought [[Economic history of Portugal|economic prosperity to Portugal]] and its population of 1.7&amp;nbsp;million residents.

In 1500, [[Pedro Ãlvares Cabral]] discovered [[Brazil]] and claimed it for Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;The standard view of historians is that Cabral was blown off course as he was navigating the currents of the South Atlantic, sighted the coast of South America, thereby accidentally discovering Brazil. However, for an alternative account of the discovery of Brazil, see [[History of Brazil]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Goa]], in [[India]], [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Strait]], and [[Malacca]], now a [[States of Malaysia|state]] in [[Malaysia]]. Thus, the Portuguese empire held dominion over commerce in the [[Indian Ocean]] and South Atlantic. The Portuguese sailors set out to reach Eastern Asia by sailing eastward from Europe landing in such places as [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], the island of [[Timor]], and may have been the first Europeans to discover [[Australia]] and even [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSSYD3449720070321 Map proves Portuguese discovered Australia: new book], in [[Reuters]] (Wed 21 Mar 2007) â (see [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], signed on 22 April 1529 between Portugal and Spain, specified the antimeridian to the line of demarcation specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas.
All these facts made Portugal the world's major economic, military, and political power from the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century.

=== Iberian Union and Restoration ===

The disputed [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|Portuguese discovery of Australia]] is not shown.]]
Portugal's independence was interrupted between 1580 and 1640. This occurred because the last two kings of the [[House of Aviz]] â King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]], who died in the [[battle of AlcÃ¡cer Quibir]] in [[Morocco]], and his great-uncle and successor, King [[Henry I of Portugal|Henry of Portugal]] â both died without heirs, resulting in the extinction of that royal house. Subsequently, [[Philip II of Spain]] claimed the throne and so became Philip I of Portugal. Although Portugal did not lose its formal independence, it was governed by the same monarch who governed [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], briefly forming a [[Iberian Union|union]] of kingdoms, as a [[personal union]].
The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and led to the involvement in the [[Eighty Years' War]] being fought in Europe at the time between [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]]. War led to a deterioration of the relations with [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance|Portugal's oldest ally, England]], and the loss of Hormuz. From 1595 to 1663 the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese [[colonies]] and commercial interests in Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian Sea trade monopoly.

In 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]] between Portugal and Spain on the aftermath of the 1640 revolt, ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which reigned in Portugal until 1910.

Official estimates - and most estimates made so far - place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the XVIII century at 600,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibge&quot;&gt;http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html&lt;/ref&gt; Though not usually studied, this represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies to the Americas during the colonial times. According to historian [[Leslie Bethell]], &quot;In 1700 Portugal had a population of about two million people.&quot; During the eighteenth century hundreds of thousands left for the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese Colony of Brazil]], despite efforts by the crown to place severe restrictions on emigration.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell (1986). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=hhNfVshMw64C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Cambridge history of Latin America: Colonial Latin America]''&quot;.

=== Pombaline era ===
{{Main|History of Portugal (1578â1777)|1755 Lisbon earthquake|SebastiÃ£o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal}}

[[File:Louis-Michel van Loo 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[SebastiÃ£o JosÃ© de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal]].]]
In 1738, SebastiÃ£o JosÃ© de Carvalho e Melo, the talented son of a Lisbon squire, began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese [[Ambassador]] in [[London]] and later in [[Vienna]]. The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs. As the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, SebastiÃ£o de Melo was made Prime Minister.  Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal.  He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in [[India]]; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christian]] sects in Portugal.

But SebastiÃ£o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.

[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|right|thumb|1755 copper engraving showing [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbor after the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].]]Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[Lisbon]] was struck by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] magnitude of 9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and ensuing fires.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://nisee.berkeley.edu/lisbon/index.html Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; SebastiÃ£o de Melo survived by a stroke of luck and then immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: &quot;What now? We bury the dead and feed the living.&quot;

Despite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new downtown of [[Lisbon]] was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions: They represent the world's first quake-proof buildings{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}. SebastiÃ£o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.

Following the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and SebastiÃ£o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[Tavora affair|TÃ¡vora family]] and the Duke of [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. SebastiÃ£o de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the Minister against his enemies. Based upon his swift resolve, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.

[[Image:D. Maria Francisca Benedita, Princesa da Beira e do Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Maria I of Portugal]] as princess of [[Brazil]].]]In 1762 [[SpanishâPortuguese War, 1761â1763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], however by 1763 the status-quo between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.

Following the TÃ¡vora affair, the new Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] knew no opposition. Made &quot;Marquis of Pombal&quot; in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]]'s death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombalâs &quot;enlightenment,&quot; while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91â108, 160â62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness at which he dispatched the [[TÃ¡vora affair|TÃ¡vora family]], and upon her accession to the throne, she did what she had long vowed to do: she withdrew all his political offices. Pombal died peacefully on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.

In the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of Portugal]], while the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a [[colony]] of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].

=== Brazilian independence ===
{{Main|Colonial Brazil|Peninsular War|Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Liberal Revolution of 1820|Brazilian Independence}}
[[File:Brazil states1823.png|thumb|Brazil just before independence in 1822 â [[Cisplatina]] (modern [[Uruguay]]) was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.]]
Portugal began a slow but inexorable decline until the 20th century. This decline was hastened by the independence in 1822 of the country's largest colonial possession, [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]]. In 1807, as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army closed in on Portugal's capital city of [[Lisbon]], the [[Prince Regent]] [[JoÃ£o VI of Portugal]] [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred his court]] to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, the Portuguese Empire changed its name to the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].

Due to the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that JoÃ£o VI would be able to safely return to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.

Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the king attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status as a [[principality]], his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared Brazil's independence from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.

=== Colonial Portuguese Africa ===
{{Main|Angola (Portugal)|Cape Verde|Mozambique (Portugal)|Portuguese Guinea|Ouidah|SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe}}
[[File:Mapa Cor-de-Rosa.svg|220px|thumb|left|The ''[[Pink Map]]'' project: Portugal's claim of sovereingty over the lands between [[Portuguese Angola]] and [[Portuguese Mozambique]].]]
At the height of European [[colonialism]] in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in [[South America]] and all but a few bases in [[Asia]]. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|LourenÃ§o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in [[Africa]] into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.

With the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese Africa territories had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese Africa's cities and towns like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|SÃ¡ da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|MoÃ§Ã¢medes]], [[Lobito]], [[JoÃ£o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto AmÃ©lia]], were also founded. Even before the turn of the century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.

Other episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its &quot;[[Pink Map]],&quot; which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]]. The Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Cape Verde]], [[SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[SÃ£o JoÃ£o Baptista de AjudÃ¡]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, the country still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Macau]].

=== Republic ===
{{Main|Lisbon Regicide|5 October 1910 revolution|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}
[[File:35- Rei D. Manuel II - O Patriota.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], the last King of Portugal.]]
On 1 February 1908, the king [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]], [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Luis Filipe]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were murdered in Lisbon]]. Under his rule, Portugal was twice declared [[bankrupt]] â on 14 June 1892, and again on 10 May 1902 â causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. [[Manuel II of Portugal]] become the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution]], which abolished the regime and instated [[republicanism]] in Portugal. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]], which aggravated by the [[Portugal in World War I|Portuguese military intervention in World War I]], led to a [[28 May 1926 coup d'Ã©tat|military coup d'Ã©tat in 1926]] and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').

This in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933. Portugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in [[World War II]]. From the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of white mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas colonies in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives.

=== End of colonialism ===
{{Main|Portuguese Colonial War|Movimento das ForÃ§as Armadas}}
[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|Map of the Portuguese Overseas provinces in Africa by the time of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961â1974).]]
After [[India]] attained independence in 1947, the residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, liberated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.&lt;ref name =lele&gt;P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, [[SÃ£o JoÃ£o Baptista de AjudÃ¡]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire. According to the census of 1921 SÃ£o JoÃ£o Baptista de AjudÃ¡ had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty. Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations]] resulted in the defeat of the Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Also in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961â1974).

=== Carnation Revolution ===
{{Main|Carnation Revolution}}
Throughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative Estado Novo regime, firstly installed and governed by [[AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal NÃ£o Ã Um PaÃ­s Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese government and army successfully resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in [[Lisbon]], known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo RevolucionÃ¡rio Em Curso]]'', or On-Going Revolutionary Process). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. Some [[Political faction|faction]]s, including [[Ãlvaro Cunhal]]'s ''[[Partido Comunista PortuguÃªs]]'' (PCP), unsuccessfully tried to turn the country into a [[Communism|communist]] state. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create newly-independent communist states in 1975 (most notably the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]]), prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (16 August 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (Monday, 7 July 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a million destitute [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugee]]s fled the former Portuguese colonies. [[MÃ¡rio Soares]] and [[AntÃ³nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first [[Portuguese Constituent Assembly election, 1975|democratic elections]] in 50 years. However, the country continued to be governed by a [[Junta de SalvaÃ§Ã£o Nacional|military-civilian provisional administration]] until the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1976|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]] that took place on 25 April, exactly one year after the previous election, and two years after the Carnation Revolution. With a new [[Constitution of Portugal|Constitution]] approved, the country's main aim was economic recovery and strengthening of the nation's democracy. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and MÃ¡rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. In the following years, Portugal's economic situation obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977â78 and 1983â85.

=== European integration ===
{{Main|Portuguese transition to democracy|European Union|Eurozone|Schengen Area}}
[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[JerÃ³nimos Monastery]], Lisbon]]
In 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the [[European Union]] (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets. Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was not handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) until 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution.

On 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[Eurozone]].

On 5 July 2004, [[JosÃ© Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[JerÃ³nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action.

Economic disruption in the wake of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.

The territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.  It lies between latitudes [[32nd parallel north|32Â°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43Â° N]], and longitudes [[32nd meridian west|32Â°]] and [[6th meridian west|6Â° W]].

[[Continental Portugal|Mainland Portugal]] is split by its main river, the [[Tagus]] that flows from Spain and disgorges in Tagus Estuary, before escaping into the Atlantic.  The northern landscape is mountainous towards the interior with several plateaus indented by river valleys, whereas the south, that includes the [[Algarve]] and the [[Alentejo]] regions, is characterized by rolling plains.

Portugal's highest peak is the similarly named [[Mount Pico]] on the island of [[Pico Island|Pico]] in the Azores.  This ancient volcano, which measures {{convert|2351|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is a highly iconic symbol of the Azores, while the [[Serra da Estrela]] on the mainland (the summit being {{convert|1991|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level) is an important seasonal attraction for skiers and winter sports enthusiasts.

The archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores are scattered within the Atlantic Ocean: the Azores straddling the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] on a tectonic triple junction, and Madeira along a range formed by [[plate tectonics|in-plate]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] geology (much like the [[Hawaii|Hawaiian Islands]]). Geologically, these islands were formed by volcanic and seismic events, although the last terrestrial volcanic eruption occurred in 1957â58 ([[Capelinhos]]) and minor earthquakes occur sporadically, usually of low intensity.

[[Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone]], a sea zone over which the Portuguese have special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, has 1,727,408&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is the 3rd largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of the European Union and the 11th largest in the world.

=== Climate ===
Portugal is defined as a [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the south and Douro region, and ''Csb'' in the north and western Alentejo), and also [[Semi-arid climate]] or [[Steppe climate]] (''Bsk'' in certain parts of Beja district) according to the [[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification]]), and is one of the warmest European countries: the annual average temperature in [[mainland Portugal]] varies from {{convert|13|Â°C|Â°F|1}} in the mountainous interior north to over {{convert|18|Â°C|Â°F|1}} in the south and on the [[Guadiana]] [[river basin]]. The [[Algarve]], separated from the [[Alentejo]] region by mountains reaching up to 900 metres in Pico da Foia, has a climate similar to that of the southern coastal areas of Spain.

Annual average rainfall in the mainland varies from just over {{convert|3000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the northern mountains to less than {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the area of the Massueime River, near CÃ´a, along the [[Douro]] river. [[Mount Pico]] is recognized as receiving the largest annual rainfall (over{{convert|6250|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year) in Portugal, according to ''[[Instituto de Meteorologia]] '' ({{lang-en|Portuguese Meteorological Institute}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.meteo.pt |title=Instituto de Meteorologia, IP Portugal|publisher=Meteo.pt |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, such as the Guadiana basin, annual average temperatures can be as high as {{convert|20|Â°C|Â°F}}, but summer temperatures may be over {{convert|45|Â°C|Â°F}} (as a study from the Archeological Park in [[CÃ´a]] determined).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipa.min-cultura.pt/pubs/R.../folder/01.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the high mountains, such as [[Peneda-GerÃªs National Park]], a temperate maritime climate permeates (''Cfb'', according to Koppen-Geiger). The record high of {{convert|47.4|Â°C|Â°F}} was recorded in [[Amareleja]] (although this is not the hottest spot in summer, according to satellite readings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/extremos/ |title=Instituto de Meteorologia, IP Portugal |publisher=Meteo.pt |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowfalls occur regularly in the interior North and Center of the country in particular in the districts of [[Vila Real District|Vila Real]], [[BraganÃ§a District|BraganÃ§a]], [[Viseu]] and [[Guarda District|Guarda]]. In winter temperatures may drop below {{convert|-10.0|Â°C|Â°F}} in particular in [[Serra da Estrela]], [[Serra do GerÃªs]] and [[Serra de Montesinho]]. In these places snow can fall any time from October to May. In the south of the country snowfalls are rare but still occur in the highest elevations.

The country has around 2500 to 3200 hours of sunshine a year, an average of 4â6&amp;nbsp;h in winter and 10â12&amp;nbsp;h in the summer, with higher values in the southeast and lower in the northwest. The sea surface temperature on the west coast of mainland Portugal varies from {{convert|13|Â°C|Â°F|1}}-{{convert|15|Â°C|Â°F|1}} in winter to {{convert|18|Â°C|Â°F|1}}-{{convert|20|Â°C|Â°F|1}} in the summer while on the south coast in the summer the water temperature is typically around {{convert|22|Â°C|Â°F|1}} occasionally reaching {{convert|25|Â°C|Â°F|1}}.

Both the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira have a subtropical climate, although variations between islands exist, making weather predictions very difficult (owing to topography, temperature and humidity).  The Madeiran and Azorean archipelagos have a narrower temperature range, with annual average temperatures exceeding {{convert|20|Â°C|Â°F}} along the coast (according to the Portuguese Meteorological Institute).  Some islands in Azores do have drier months in the summer. Consequently, the island of the Azores have been identified as having a [[Mediterranean]] climate (both ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' types), while some islands (such as [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]] or [[Corvo Island|Corvo]]) are classified as Maritime Temperate (''Cfb'') or Humid subtropical (''Cfa''), respectively, according to Koppen-Geiger classification.  [[Porto Santo]] island in Madeira has a semi-arid Steppe climate (''BSh''). The [[Savage Islands]], which are part of the regional territory of Madeira are unique in being classified as a Desert climates (''BWh'') with an annual average rainfall of approximately {{convert|150|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The sea surface temperature in the archipelagos varies from {{convert|16|Â°C|Â°F|1}}-{{convert|18|Â°C|Â°F|1}} in winter to {{convert|23|Â°C|Â°F|1}}-{{convert|25|Â°C|Â°F|1}} in the summer occasionally reaching {{convert|26|Â°C|Â°F|1}}.

In the southern Azores, and still within the Portuguese maritime territory, there is a unique area of tropical climate (as defined by Koppen-Geiger) influenced by [[Gulf Stream]] where sea surface temperatures are over {{convert|20|Â°C|Â°F|abbr=on}} even during the winter (Source AEMET).

=== Biodiversity ===

Owing to humans occupying the territory of Portugal for thousands of years, little is left of the original vegetation. [[Protected areas of Portugal]] include one national park ({{lang-pt|Parque Nacional}}), 12 natural parks ({{lang-pt|Parque Natural}}), nine natural reserves ({{lang-pt|Reserva Natural}}), five natural monuments ({{lang-pt|Monumento Natural}}), and seven protected landscapes ({{lang-pt|Paisagem Protegida}}), which include the [[Parque Nacional da Peneda-GerÃªs]], the [[Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela]] and the [[Paul de Arzila]].  These natural environments are shaped by diverse flora, and include widespread species of pine (especially the ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'' and ''[[Pinus pinea]]'' species), the chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), the cork-oak (''[[Quercus suber]]''), the holm oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]''), the Portuguese oak (''[[Quercus faginea]]''), and eucalyptus (''[[Eucalyptus globulus]]''). All are prized for their economic value. [[Laurissilva]] is a unique type of subtropical rainforest found in few areas of Europe and the world: in the Azores, and in particular on the island of Madeira, there are large forests of endemic Laurasilva forests (the latter protected as a natural heritage preserve).

There are several species of diverse [[mammal]]ian fauna, including the [[fox]], [[badger]], [[Iberian lynx]], [[Iberian Wolf]], [[wild goat]] (''[[Capra pyrenaica]]''), wild cat (''[[Felis silvestris]]''), [[hare]], [[weasel]], [[European Polecat|polecat]], [[chameleon]], [[mongoose]], [[civet]], [[brown bear]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} (spotted near Rio Minho, close to Peneda-GerÃªs) and many others. Portugal is an important stopover for migratory birds, in places such as [[Cape St. Vincent]] or the [[Serra de Monchique|Monchique]] mountain, where thousands of birds cross from Europe to Africa during the autumn or in the spring (return migration). Most of the avian species congregate along the [[Iberian Peninsula]] since it is the closest stopover between northern Europe and Africa. Six hundred bird species make their nests in Portugal (either permanently or during the course of migration), and annually there are new registries of nesting species. The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American, European, and African birds, while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species.

There are over 100 varieties of freshwater fish species, varying from the giant European catfish (in the Tagus International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes (along the western lakes for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Upwelling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. Bioluminescent species are also well-represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe in some beaches.

There are many endemic insect species, most only found in certain parts of Portugal, while other species are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (''Lucanus cervus'') and the [[cicada]]. The [[Macronesia]]n islands (Azores and Madeira) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that evolved independent from other regions of Portugal. In Madeira, for example, it is possible to observe more than 250 species of land [[gastropods]].

== Governance ==
{{Main|Government of Portugal|Politics of Portugal}}
[[File:Cavaco Silva 2007.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva]] is the current [[President of the Portuguese Republic]].]]
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit June 2010 (82).jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Pedro Passos Coelho]] is the current [[Prime Minister of Portugal]].]]
Portugal has been a democratic republic since the ratification of the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976|Constitution of 1976]], with [[Lisbon]], the nation's largest city, as its capital. The constitution grants the division, or separation, of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The four main institutions as described in this constitution are the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|President of the Republic]], the [[Portuguese parliament|Parliament]], known as the ''Assembleia da RepÃºblica'' ({{lang-en|Assembly of the Republic}}), the [[Government of Portugal|Government]], headed by a [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], and the courts.

The President, who is elected to a five-year term, has a supervisory non-executive role: the current President is [[AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva]]. The Parliament is a chamber composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The government, whose head is the [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] (currently [[Pedro Passos Coelho]]), chooses a ''Council of Ministers'', that comprises the Ministers and State Secretaries. The [[courts]] are organized into several levels: judicial, administrative, and fiscal branches. The [[Portuguese Supreme Court|Supreme Courts]] are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member [[Portuguese Constitutional Court|Constitutional Court]] oversees the constitutionality of the laws.

Portugal operates a multi-party system of competitive legislatures/local administrative governments at the national-, regional- and local-levels. The [[Assembly of the Republic|Legislative Assembly]], Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and/or parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitarian Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] plus [[Ecologist Party &quot;The Greens&quot;]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre â People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.

=== Executive branch ===
The [[Presidents of Portugal|President]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]], is also Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (where the President is obligated by the results from Legislative Elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a State of War or siege.

The President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.

The Government is headed by the presidentially-appointed Prime Minister, who names a Council of Ministers to act as the government and cabinet. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a program, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the Assembly to reject the program by a majority of deputies confirms the government in office.

=== Legislative branch ===
The Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of proportional representation, deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.

{{Main|Law of Portugal|Law enforcement in Portugal|Crime in Portugal}}
The [[Portuguese legal system]] is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. Until the end of the 19th century, French law was the main influence. Since then, the major influence has been [[German legal system|German law]]. The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).

Portuguese law applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continues to be the major influence for those countries. Portugal's main police organizations are the ''[[Portuguese National Republican Guard|Guarda Nacional Republicana]] â GNR'' (National Republican Guard), a [[gendarmerie]]; the ''[[PolÃ­cia de SeguranÃ§a PÃºblica]] â PSP'' (Public Security Police), a civilian police force who work in urban areas; and the ''[[PolÃ­cia JudiciÃ¡ria]] â PJ'' (Judicial Police), a highly specialized criminal investigation police that is overseen by the [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]].

Portugal was one of the first countries in the world to abolish the death penalty. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.

Portugal has arguably the most liberal laws concerning possession of illicit drugs in the [[Western world]]. In 2001 Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including, but not limited to, [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]], heroin, and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than &quot;10 days worth of personal use&quot; are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use rose only slightly, whilst use among teenagers dropped, along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maia Szalavitz, [http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? ], [[Time (magazine)|Time]] (April 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2010, Portugal became the sixth country in Europe and the eighth country in the world to legally recognize [[same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]] on the national level. The law came into force on 5 June 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;dre.pt&quot;&gt;http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2010/05/10500/0185301853.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Portugal}}

Administratively, Portugal is divided into 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]]
({{lang-pt|municÃ­pios or [[concelhos]]}}), which are subdivided into 4260 civil parishes ({{lang-pt|[[freguesia]]}}). Operationally, the municipality and civil parish, along with the national government, are the only legally identifiable [[local administrative unit]]s identified by the government of Portugal (for example, cities, towns or villages have no standing in law, although may be used as catchment for the defining services). For statistical purposes the Portuguese government also identifies [[NUTS]], inter-municipal communities and informally, the district system, used until European integration (and being phased-out by the national government). Continental Portugal is agglomerated into 18 districts, while the archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are governed as [[autonomous area|autonomous regions]]; the largest units, established since 1976, are either [[mainland Portugal]] ({{lang-pt|Portugal Continental}}) and the [[autonomous regions of Portugal]] (Azores and Madeira).

The 18 districts of mainland Portugal are: [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Beja District|Beja]], [[Braga District|Braga]], [[BraganÃ§a District|BraganÃ§a]], [[Castelo Branco District|Castelo Branco]], [[Coimbra District|Coimbra]], [[Ãvora District|Ãvora]], [[Faro District|Faro]], [[Guarda District|Guarda]], [[Leiria District|Leiria]], [[Lisbon District|Lisbon]], [[Portalegre District|Portalegre]], [[Porto District|Porto]], [[SantarÃ©m District|SantarÃ©m]], [[SetÃºbal District|SetÃºbal]], [[Viana do Castelo District|Viana do Castelo]], [[Vila Real District|Vila Real]] and [[Viseu District|Viseu]] â each district takes the name of the district capital.

Within the European Union NUTS ([[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]]) system, Portugal is divided into seven regions: the [[Azores]], [[Alentejo]], [[Algarve]], [[Centro, Portugal|Centro]], [[Lisboa, Region|Lisboa]], [[Madeira]] and [[Norte, Portugal|Norte]], and with the exception of the Azores and Madeira, these NUTS areas are subdivided into 28 subregions.

[[File:OlivenÃ§a location.PNG|thumb|235px|The disputed territory of [[Olivenza|OlivenÃ§a]]]]
A member state of the United Nations since 1955, Portugal is also a founding member of [[NATO]] (1949), [[OECD]] (1961) and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] (1960); it left the latter in 1986 to join the [[European Economic Community]], that would become the European Union in 1993. In 1996 it co-founded the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), which seeks to foster closer economic and cultural ties between the world's Lusophone nations.  

In addition, Portugal is a full member of the [[Latin Union]] (1983) and the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] (1949). It has a friendship alliance and [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] treaty with its former colony, Brazil.  Portugal and England (subsequently, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) share the world's oldest active military accord through their [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]] ([[Treaty of Windsor (1386)|Treaty of Windsor]]), which was signed in 1373.

The only international dispute concerns the municipality of [[Olivenza|OlivenÃ§a]] (Olivenza).  Under Portuguese sovereignty since 1297, the municipality of Olivenza was ceded to Spain under the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] in 1801, after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal claimed it back in 1815 under the [[Congress of Vienna|Treaty of Vienna]]. However, since the 19th century, it has been continuously and peacefully ruled by Spain which considers the territory not only de facto but also de jure as an integral part of Spain.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Portuguese Armed Forces}}
[[File:F16A FAP refuel KC-10.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A Portuguese [[F-16]] refueling in mid flight.]]
The armed forces have three branches: [[Portuguese Navy|Navy]], [[Portuguese Army|Army]] and [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]]. They serve primarily as a self-defense force whose mission is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and providing humanitarian assistance and security at home and abroad. As of 2008, the three branches numbered 39,000 active personnel including 6,500 women. [[List of countries by military expenditures|Portuguese military expenditure]] in 2009 was $5.2 billion, representing 2.1 percent of GDP. Military conscription was abolished in 2004. The minimum age for voluntary recruitment is 18 years.

The Army (21,000 personnel) comprises three brigades and other small units. An [[Portuguese Intervention Brigade|infantry brigade]] (mainly equipped with [[Pandur II]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]), a [[Portuguese Mechanized Brigade|mechanized brigade]] (mainly equipped with [[Leopard 2|Leopard 2 A6]] tanks and [[M113]] APC) and a [[Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade|Rapid Reaction Brigade]] (consisting of paratroopers, [[Portuguese Army Commandos|commandos]] and rangers). The Navy (10,700 personnel, of which 1,580 are [[Portuguese Marines|marines]]) has five frigates, two submarines, and 28 patrol and auxiliary vessels. The Air Force (7,500 personnel) has the [[Lockheed F-16 Fighting Falcon]] as the main combat aircraft. 
[[File:POS Corte Real (F 332).jpg|thumb|220px|left|The ''NRP Corte Real'', ([[Vasco da Gama class frigate]]) of the [[Portuguese Navy]].]]
In addition to the three branches of the armed forces, there is the [[Portuguese National Republican Guard|Republican National Guard]], a security force subject to military law and organization ([[gendarmerie]]) comprising 25,000 personnel. This force is under the authority of both the Defense and the Interior Ministry. It has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor.

The United States maintains a military presence with 770 troops in the [[Lajes Air Base]] at [[Terceira Island]], in the Azores. The [[Joint Command Lisbon|Allied Joint Force Command Lisbon]] (JFC Lisbon) â one of the three main subdivisions of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Command Operations]] â it is based in [[Oeiras]], near Lisbon.

In the 20th century, Portugal engaged in two major military interventions: [[Portugal in the Great War|World War I]] and the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961â1974). After the end of the Portuguese Empire in 1975, the Portuguese Armed Forces have participated in peacekeeping missions in East Timor, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq ([[Nasiriyah]]) and Lebanon. Portugal also conducted several independent unilateral military operations abroad, as were the cases of the interventions of the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola in 1992 and in Guinea-Bissau in 1998 with the main objectives of protecting and withdrawing of Portuguese and foreign citizens threatened by local civil conflits.

[[File:Maia Camara Municipal.jpg|The municipality of [[Maia Municipality|Maia]], in [[Porto Metropolitan Area]], is among the most industrialized places in Portugal. [[Sonae]], Portugal's largest private employer, was founded in Maia and has its headquarters there.|thumb|right]]

Since the [[Carnation Revolution]] (1974) which culminated with the end of one of its most notable [[Economic history of Portugal|phases of economic expansion]] (that started in the 1960s),&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 FundaÃ§Ã£o da SEDES â As primeiras motivaÃ§Ãµes], &quot;Nos anos 60 e atÃ© 1973 teve lugar, provavelmente, o mais rÃ¡pido perÃ­odo de crescimento econÃ³mico da nossa HistÃ³ria, traduzido na industrializaÃ§Ã£o, na expansÃ£o do turismo, no comÃ©rcio com a EFTA, no desenvolvimento dos sectores financeiros, investimento estrangeiro e grandes projectos de infra-estruturas. Em consequÃªncia, os indicadores de rendimentos e consumo acompanham essa evoluÃ§Ã£o, reforÃ§ados ainda pelas remessas de emigrantes.&quot;, [[SEDES]]&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a significant change in annual economic growth. After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the [[PREC]] period, Portugal has been trying to adapt itself to a changing [[Globalization|modern global economy]]. Since the 1990s, Portugal's [[economic development]] model has been slowly changing from one based on [[consumption (economics)|public consumption]] to one focused on exports, [[investment|private investment]], and development of the [[high-tech]] sector. Business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear, cork (of which Portugal is the world's leading producer),&lt;ref&gt;''Grande EnciclopÃ©dia Universal'', p. 10543, &quot;Portugal&quot;, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt; wood products and beverages.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ft.com/reports/investportugal2008 Investing in Portugal Report], [[Financial Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most industry, business and finance are concentrated in [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area|Lisbon]] and [[Greater Metropolitan Area of Porto|Porto]] metropolitan areas.  The districts of [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Braga District|Braga]], [[Coimbra District|Coimbra]], and [[Leiria District|Leiria]] are the biggest economic centres outside those two main metropolitan areas.

The Portuguese currency is the [[euro]] (â¬) and the country's economy is in the [[Eurozone]] since its starting. Portugal's central bank is the ''[[Banco de Portugal]]'', which is an integral part of the [[European System of Central Banks]].

=== Sectors ===
====Primary sector====
[[Image:Obidos 10.JPG|thumb|right|Most of Portugal's farms have a small area devoted to a diversified [[intensive farming]], like these in the [[Oeste]] subregion.]]
[[Agriculture in Portugal]] is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. However, the sector also includes larger scale [[intensive farming]] export-oriented [[agrobusiness]]es backed by companies (like [[Grupo RAR]]'s [[Vitacress]], [[Sovena]], [[Lactogal]], [[Vale da Rosa]], [[Companhia das LezÃ­rias]] and [[Valouro]]). The country produces a wide variety of crops and livestock products, including [[green vegetables]], [[rice]], [[corn]], [[barley]], [[olive]]s, [[oilseed]]s, [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[cherries]], [[bilberry]], [[table grapes]], [[edible mushroom]]s, [[dairy products]], [[poultry]] and [[beef]]. [[Forestry]] has also played an important economic role among the rural communities and industry (namely [[paper industry]] that includes [[Portucel Soporcel Group]], [[engineered wood]] that includes [[Sonae IndÃºstria]], and [[furniture]] that includes several manufacturing plants in and around [[PaÃ§os de Ferreira]], the core of Portugal's major industrial operations of [[IKEA]]). In 2001, the gross agricultural product accounted for 4% of the national GDP.

Traditionally a sea-power, Portugal has had a strong tradition in [[Fishing in Portugal|the Portuguese fishing sector]] and is one of the countries with the highest fish consumption per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|author=PESSOA, M.F.; MENDES, B.; OLIVEIRA, J.S. |url = http://igbp-portugal.org/cluster2006/comunicacoes/m_f_pessoa/cluster2006-zc06c-comun.pdf|title= Culturas marinhas em Portugal|language = Portuguese|quote = O consumo mÃ©dio anual em produtos do mar pela populaÃ§Ã£o portuguesa, estima-se em cerca de 58,5 kg/ por habitante sendo, por isso, o maior consumidor em produtos marinhos da Europa e um dos quatro paÃ­ses a nÃ­vel mundial com uma dieta Ã  base de produtos do mar.}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main landing sites in Portugal (including Azores and Madeira), according to total landings in weight by year, are the harbours of [[Matosinhos]], [[Peniche, Portugal|Peniche]], [[OlhÃ£o]], [[Sesimbra]], [[Figueira da Foz]], [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]], [[PortimÃ£o]] and [[Madeira]]. Portuguese processed fish products are exported through several companies under a number of different brands like [[Conservas Ramirez]], the Worldâs oldest canned fish producer still in operation, as well as Combate, Comur, General, LÃ­der, ManÃ¡, Murtosa, Pescador, PitÃ©u, TenÃ³rio, Torreira, Vasco da Gama, etc.

====Secondary sector====
Industry is diversified, ranging from [[automobile industry|automobile]] ([[Volkswagen Autoeuropa]], [[Peugeot Citroen]]), [[aerospace industry|aerospace]] ([[Embraer]]), [[electronics industry|electronics]] and [[textile industry|textiles]], to [[food industry|food]], [[chemical industry|chemicals]], [[cement]] and [[wood pulp]]. Volkswagen Group's [[AutoEuropa]] motor vehicle assembly plant in [[Palmela]] is among the largest [[foreign direct investment]] projects in Portugal.

Modern non-traditional technology-based industries like [[aerospace]], [[biotechnology]] and [[information technology]], have been developed in several locations across the country. [[Alverca]], [[CovilhÃ£]],&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://noticias.sapo.pt/lusa/artigo/3010ee885ea3612ea6bfc1.htmlCovilhÃ£: Aleia vai montar aviÃ£o atÃ© agora vendido em kit e jactos portugueses em 2011], 14 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ãvora]],&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/dinheiro_digital/news.asp?section_id=6&amp;id_news=103403 Ãvora aprova isenÃ§Ãµes fiscais aos projectos da Embraer], [[DiÃ¡rio Digital]] (22 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ponte de Sor]] are the main centres of Portuguese [[aerospace industry]], which is led by Brazil-based company Embraer and the Portuguese company [[Oficinas Gerais de Material AeronÃ¡utico|OGMA]]. Since after the turn of the 21st century, many major biotechnology and information technology industries have been founded and are concentrated in the metropolitan areas of [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area|Lisbon]], [[Porto Metropolitan Area|Porto]], [[Braga]], [[Coimbra]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].

====Tertiary sector====
[[Image:Vilamoura.jpg|thumb|right|Marina beach in [[Vilamoura]], [[Algarve]].]]
Travel and [[Tourism in Portugal|tourism]] continues to become extremely important for Portugal, with visitor numbers forecast to increase significantly over the next years. However, there is increasing competition from Eastern European destinations such as Croatia who offer similar attractions, which are often cheaper. Consequently, the country is almost obligated to focus on its niche attractions such as health, nature and rural tourism in order to stay ahead of its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/Travel_and_Tourism_in_Portugal |title=Travel and Tourism in Portugal |publisher=Euromonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banking and insurance sectors performed well until the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], partly reflecting a rapid deepening of the market in Portugal. While sensitive to various types of market and underwriting [[risk]]s, both the life and non-life sectors, overall, are estimated to be able to withstand a number of severe shocks, even though the impact on individual insurers varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2006/cr06378.pdf Portugal: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes on the following topics: Banking Supervision, Securities Regulation, and Insurance Regulation], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===State-owned companies===
Major [[Government-owned corporation|State-owned companies]] include [[Ãguas de Portugal]] (water), [[ANA â Aeroportos de Portugal|ANA]] (airports), [[Caixa Geral de DepÃ³sitos]] (banking), [[Comboios de Portugal]] (railways), [[Companhia das LezÃ­rias]] (agriculture), [[CTT]] (postal services), [[RÃ¡dio e TelevisÃ£o de Portugal|RTP]] (media) and [[TAP Portugal]] (airline).  Some of the former are managed by state-run [[holding company]] [[ParpÃºblica]], which is a [[shareholder]] of several companies, both public and private.

===Listed companies===
Companies listed on [[Euronext Lisbon]] [[stock exchange]] like [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]], [[Cimpor]], [[Corticeira Amorim]], [[Galp Energia|Galp]], [[JerÃ³nimo Martins]], [[Millennium bcp]], [[Portucel Soporcel]], [[Portugal Telecom]] and [[Sonae]], are among the largest corporations of Portugal by number of employees, [[net income]] or international [[market share]].  The Euronext Lisbon is the major stock exchange of Portugal and is part of the [[NYSE Euronext]], the first global stock exchange.  The [[PSI-20]] is Portugal's most selective and widely known [[stock index]].

=== Performance ===
[[File:LGPK.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras Municipality]], in [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]], is home of many of the headquarters of multinational companies operating in Portugal]]
The Global Competitiveness Report for 2005, published by the [[World Economic Forum]], placed Portugal's [[competitiveness]] in the 22nd position, but the 2008â2009 edition placed Portugal in the 43rd position out of 134 countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weforum.org/pdf/gcr/2008/rankings.pdf |title=The Global Competitiveness Index rankings |accessdate=20 March 2009 |work=|publisher=World Economic Forum |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research about [[quality of life]] by the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s quality of life survey placed Portugal as the country with the 19th-best quality of life in the world for 2005, ahead of other economically and technologically advanced countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Korea, but 9 places behind its only neighbour, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf | work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite the fact that Portugal remains the country with the lowest per capita GDP in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia.publico.clix.pt&quot;&gt;{{pt icon}}{{cite web|url=http://economia.publico.pt/Noticia/portugueses-perderam-poder-de-compra-entre-2005-e-2007-e-estao-na-cauda-da-zona-euro_1352732|title=Portugueses perderam poder de compra entre 2005 e 2007 e estÃ£o na cauda da Zona Euro |publisher=PÃºblico|language=Portuguese|publication-date=2008-12-11|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor performance of the Portuguese economy was explored in April 2007 by [[The Economist]], which described Portugal as &quot;a new [[sick man of Europe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sick man&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9009032 |title=The Portuguese economy: A new sick man of Europe |publisher=The Economist |date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2002 to 2007, the unemployment rate increased by 65% (270,500 unemployed citizens in 2002, 448,600 unemployed citizens in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Luis Miguel Mota, [http://www.destak.pt/artigos.php?art=11796 PopulaÃ§Ã£o desempregada aumentou 65% em cinco anos], Destak.pt (6 June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By early December 2009, unemployment had reached 10.2% â a 23-year record high. In December 2009, ratings agency [[Standard and Poor's]] lowered its long-term credit assessment of Portugal to &quot;negative&quot; from &quot;stable,&quot; voicing pessimism on the country's structural weaknesses in the economy and weak competitiveness that would hamper growth and the capacity to strengthen its [[public finances]] and reduce [[public debt|debt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ph.msn.com/business/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3737721 Standard and Poor's pessimistic on Portugal], [[Agence France-Presse]] (7 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2011, ratings agency [[Moody's]] downgraded its long-term credit assessment of Portugal after warning of deteriorating risk of default in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodysanalytics.com/~/media/Insight/Capital-Markets-Research/Market-Signals-Reviews/11-29-03-Soverign-Risk-Report.ashx As Portugal Default Risk Climbs, Europe Begins to Stabilize], (29 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Corruption has become an issue of major political and economic significance for the country. Some cases are well known and were widely reported in the media, such as the affairs in several municipalities involving local town hall officials and businesspersons, as well as a number of politicians with wider responsibilities and power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/28120 Eurojust chief embroiled in Portuguese corruption scandal], euobserver.com (13 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://q208.wordpress.com/2008/03/29/reportagem-da-al-jazeera-sobre-portugal-um-dos-paises-mais-pobres-e-corruptos-da-europa People &amp; Power, Al Jazeera], [[Al Jazeera]] (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the [[Transparency International]] report for 2010 places Portugal in 31st position in terms of perceived corruption, just below Israel and Spain, and 34 positions above Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results Transparency International report], [[Transparency International]] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published in January 2011 by the [[DiÃ¡rio de NotÃ­cias]], a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974 and 2010, the democratic [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese Republic government]]s encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable [[slippage (finance)|slippage]] in state-managed [[public works]], inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy was also damaged by risky [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[public debt]] creation and mismanaged European [[structural and cohesion funds]] for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister [[JosÃ© Socrates|SÃ³crates]]'s cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and in 2011 the country was on the verge of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://dn.sapo.pt/inicio/tv/interior.aspx?content_id=1750097&amp;seccao=Media Grande investigaÃ§Ã£o DN ConheÃ§a o verdadeiro peso do Estado], [[DiÃ¡rio de NotÃ­cias]] (January 7, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

If analysed under a wider time span, the convergence of the Portuguese economy to EU levels has been impressive, especially from 1986 to the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V97-3VWTCDS-9&amp;_user=499884&amp;_coverDate=11%2F30%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000024499&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=499884&amp;md5=d36edb1470dfd4db9b46db274f86c7a1&amp;searchtype=a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcd.ie&quot;&gt;http://www.tcd.ie/business/staff/fbarry/papers/papers/Regiona_Aid_paper_revised.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; According to Barry (2003), &quot;what appears to have been crucial in the Portuguese case, relative to Spain at least, is the degree of labour-market flexibility that the economy exhibits. (...) Thus Portuguese convergence has been impressive, even though, consistent with its relatively low human-capital stock, the economy has specialised in low-tech production.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tcd.ie&quot;/&gt;

On April 6, 2011 Prime Minister [[JosÃ© SÃ³crates]] announced on national television that the country would request financial assistance from the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]], like [[Greece]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] had done before. It was the third time that external financial aid was requested to the IMF â the first was in the late 1970s following the Carnation Revolution.

In October 2011, [[Moody's Analytics]] downgraded nine Portuguese banks, blaming financial weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15211230 UK financial firms downgraded by Moody's rating agency], [[BBC]] (October 7, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour market ===
Although a [[Developed countries|developed country]] and a [[high income countries|high income country]], Portugal has the lowest [[GDP per capita]] in Western Europe and its population has [[Economy of the European Union|one of the lowest incomes per head among member states of the European Union]]. According to [[Eurostat]], in 2009, Portugal's GDP per capita stood at 80% of the EU27 average,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-15122010-BP/EN/2-15122010-BP-EN.PDF|title=Eurostat press release GDP per inhabitant 2009|accessdate=3 January 2011|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 10th lowest in the Union.

The average wage in Portugal is 1,039 â¬ per month (net),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langlophone.com/20100526_edition/20100526_EU27_data_table_flipped.pdf|title=Wages and taxes for the Average Joe in the EU 27|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[minimum wage]], which is regulated by law, is â¬485 per month (although paid in 14 installments, which means that on average the minimum wage is 565 euros). Officially, in 2008 the unemployment rate decreased to 7.3% in the second quarter of 2008.&lt;ref name = &quot;unemployment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.publico.clix.pt/noticia.aspx?id=1338969|title=Taxa de desemprego desce para 7,3 por cento no segundo trimestre|language=Portuguese|publisher=[[PÃºblico (Portugal)|PÃºblico]]|date=14 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it immediately rose again to higher rates. Influenced by events worldwide, by December 2009, unemployment had surpassed the 10% mark nationwide, by 2010, it was about 11%, and in 2011 it was above 12%.

=== Tourism ===
{{main|Tourism in Portugal}}
[[File:Pena National Palace.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pena National Palace]] in [[Sintra]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] and one of Portugal's most visited landmarks]]
Portugal is among the 20 most visited countries in the world, receiving an average of 13 million foreign tourists each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/indicators/ITA_top25.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism is playing an increasingly important role in Portugal's economy, contributing to about 5% of its [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Tourist hotspots in Portugal are Lisbon, the Algarve and Madeira, but the Portuguese government continues to promote and develop new tourist destinations, such as the [[Douro|Douro Valley]], the island of [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]], and [[Alentejo]]. Lisbon is, after [[Barcelona]], the European city which attracts the most tourists (with seven million tourists occupying the city's hotels in 2006, a number that grew 11.8% compared to previous year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.pt/inicio/interior.aspx?content_id=651813|title=Cidades atraem mais turistas do que os destinos sol e mar|publisher=DiÃ¡rio das Noticias|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=25 January 2007|location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese|editor=DN Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisbon in recent years surpassed the Algarve as the leading tourist region in Portugal. Porto and Northern Portugal, especially the urban areas north of [[Douro River]] valley, was the tourist destination which grew most (11.9%) in 2006, surpassing Madeira (in 2010), as the third most visited destination.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Most tourists in Portugal are [[United Kingdom|British]]-, [[Spain|Spanish]]- or [[Germany|German]]-origin visitors, travel by [[Low-cost carrier|low cost airliners]], and not only seek sun and beaches, but increasingly search for cultural, gastronomic, environmental or [[nautical tourism|nautical]] experiences (or travel for reasons of business).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==== Tourist regions ====
[[File:Almourol 034.jpg|thumb|[[Almourol Castle]], a [[Knights Templar]] stronghold used during the [[Reconquista|Christian Reconquista of Iberia]] from the [[Moors|Muslim Moors]]]]The main tourist regions can be broken-down into (by order of importance): the [[Greater Lisbon]] ({{lang-pt|[[Lisbon|Lisboa]]}}), the [[Algarve]], [[Greater Porto]] and Northern Portugal ({{lang-pt|[[Porto]] and [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte]]}}), the Portuguese Islands ({{lang-pt|Ilhas Portuguesas}}: Madeira and Azores),  and [[Alentejo]]. Other tourist regions include ''Douro Sul'', ''TemplÃ¡rios'', ''DÃ£o-LafÃµes'', ''Costa do Sol'', ''Costa Azul'', ''PlanÃ­cie Dourada'', that are unknown to many tourists or visitors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Most of these regions are grouped in tourism reference areas, which continue to be in a state of reorganization and evolution, some based on the traditional regions of Portugal: the ''Costa Verde'' (''Green Coast''); ''Costa da Prata'' (''Silver Coast)''); ''Costa de Lisboa'' (''Lisbon Coast''); ''Montanhas'' (''Mountains''); ''PlanÃ­cies'' (''Plains''); ''[[Algarve]]''; and the islands of the archipelagos of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

By the early 1970s Portugal's [[Economic history of Portugal|fast economic growth]] with increasing [[mass consumption|consumption]] and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in transportation. Again in the 1990s, after joining the [[European Economic Community]], the country built many new motorways. Today, the country has a {{convert|68732|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} road network, of which almost {{convert|3000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are part of system of 44 motorways.  Opened in 1944, the first motorway (which linked Lisbon to the National Stadium) was an innovative project that made Portugal among one of the first countries in the world to establish a motorway (this roadway eventually became the Lisbon-Cascais highway, or A5). But, although a few other tracts were created (around 1960 and 1970), it was only after the beginning of the 1980s that large-scale motorway construction was implemented.

[[Continental Portugal]]'s {{convert|89015|kmÂ²|0|abbr=on}} territory is serviced by three international airports located near the principal cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Porto]] and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].  Lisbon's geographical position makes it a stopover for many foreign airlines at several airports within the country.  The primary [[flag-carrier]] is [[TAP Portugal]], although many other domestic airlines provide services within and without the country.  The government decided to build a new airport outside Lisbon, in [[Alcochete]], to replace [[Lisbon Portela Airport]].  Currently, the most important airports are in [[Portela Airport|Lisbon]], [[Faro Airport|Faro]], [[Francisco SÃ¡ Carneiro Airport|Porto]], [[Madeira Airport|Funchal]] (Madeira), and [[JoÃ£o Paulo II Airport|Ponta Delgada]] (Azores), managed by the national airport authority group [[ANA â Aeroportos de Portugal]].

[[File:Ponte25Abril1.jpg|thumb|right|[[25 April Bridge]] across the [[Tagus River]].]]A national railway system that extends throughout the continent and into Spain, is supported and administered by [[Comboios de Portugal]]. [[Rail transport]] of passengers and goods is derived using the {{convert|2791|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of railway lines currently in service, of which {{convert|1430|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are electrified and about {{convert|900|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} allow train speeds greater than {{convert|120|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The railway network is managed by the [[REFER]] while the transport of passengers and goods are the responsibility of [[Caminhos de Ferro Portugueses]] (CP), both public companies. In 2006 the CP carried 133&amp;nbsp;million passengers and {{convert|9750000|t|LT ST|sigfig=3|abbr=on|lk=on}} of goods.

The major seaports are located in [[LeixÃµes]], [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]], [[Figueira da Foz]], [[Lisbon]], [[SetÃºbal]], [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]] and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].

The two largest metropolitan areas have subway systems: [[Lisbon Metro]] and ''Metro Sul do Tejo'' in the [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]] and [[Porto Metro]] in the [[Porto Metropolitan Area]], each with more than {{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of lines. In Portugal, [[Trams in Lisbon|Lisbon tram services]] have been supplied by the ''Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa'' ([[Carris]]), for over a century. In [[Porto]], [[Trams in Porto|a tram network]], of which only a tourist line on the shores of the [[Douro]] remain, began construction on 12 September 1895 (a first for the [[Iberian Peninsula]]).  All major cities and towns have their own local urban transport network, as well as taxi services.

=== Science and technology ===
[[File:up reitoria.jpg|thumb|right|The headquarters ([[rectorate]]) of the [[University of Porto]] (UP) â UP is the largest Portuguese university by both number of students and research output.]]
{{Main|Science and technology in Portugal}}
Scientific and technological research activities in Portugal are mainly conducted within a network of [[R&amp;D]] units belonging to [[list of universities in Portugal|public universities]] and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the [[Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e InovaÃ§Ã£o|INETI â Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e InovaÃ§Ã£o]] and the [[Instituto Nacional dos Recursos BiolÃ³gicos|INRB â Instituto Nacional dos Recursos BiolÃ³gicos]].  The funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Higher Education]] (MCTES) itself and the MCTES's [[FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e Tecnologia]] (FCT).  The largest R&amp;D units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications, include [[biosciences]] research institutions like the [[Instituto de Medicina Molecular]], the [[Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology]], the [[IPATIMUP]], the [[Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular]] and the [[Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute]].

[[File:Moniz.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[AntÃ³nio Egas Moniz]] was a Portuguese [[neurologist]] awarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1949.]]Among the largest non-state-run research institutions in Portugal are the [[Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia]] and the [[Champalimaud Foundation]], a neuroscience and oncology research centre, which in addition awards every year one of the highest monetary prizes of any science prize in the world.  A number of both national and multinational high-tech and industrial companies, are also responsible for research and development projects.  One of the oldest learned societies of Portugal is the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon]], founded in 1779.
[[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] bilateral state-supported research efforts include the [[International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory]] and the [[Ibercivis]] [[distributed computing]] platform, which are joint research programmes of both Portugal and Spain.  Portugal is a member of several pan-European scientific organizations.  These include the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[European Laboratory for Particle Physics]] (CERN), [[ITER]], and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO).

[[File:Lisboa-Oceanario.jpg|thumb|The [[Lisbon Oceanarium]] - by the time of its opening, it was among the largest aquariums in the world.]]
Portugal has the largest [[aquarium]] in Europe, the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], and the Portuguese have several other notable organizations focused on science-related exhibits and divulgation, like the state agency ''CiÃªncia Viva'', a programme of the Portuguese Ministry of Science and Technology to the promotion of a scientific and technological culture among the Portuguese population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cienciaviva.pt/cienciaviva/index.asp?accao=changelang&amp;lang=en |title=CiÃªncia Viva |publisher=Cienciaviva.pt |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Science Museum of the University of Coimbra]], the [[List of natural history museums#Portugal|National Museum of Natural History]] at the University of Lisbon, and the [[Visionarium (Portugal)|Visionarium]].

With the emergence and growth of several [[science park]]s throughout the world that helped create many thousands of scientific, technological and knowledge-based businesses, Portugal started to develop several&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecparques.pt/associados.htm |title=Tecparques â AssociaÃ§Ã£o Portuguesa de Parques de CiÃªncia e Tecnologia |publisher=Tecparques.pt |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; science parks across the country.

[[File:Alqueva dam-Rio Guadiana.JPG|thumb|[[Alqueva Dam]], in the [[Alentejo]]; the Alqueva project, an [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectric power]] generation system, created the largest artificial lake in Western Europe.]]
Portugal has considerable resources of wind and river power, the two most cost-effective renewable sources.  Since the 2000s, there has been a trend towards the development of a renewable resource industry and reduction of both consumption and use of fossil fuel resources.  In 2006, the world's largest [[solar energy|solar power]] plant at that date, the [[Moura Photovoltaic Power Station]], began operating near [[Moura, Portugal|Moura]], in the south, while the world's first commercial [[wave power]] farm, the [[AguÃ§adoura Wave Farm]], opened in the [[Norte Region, Portugal|Norte region]] (2008).  By the end of 2006, 66% of the country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while 29% were derived from [[hydroelectric]] dams, and 6% by [[wind energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/stats/electricitydata.asp?COUNTRY_CODE=PT |title=IEA Energy Statistics: Portugal |accessdate=7 April 2009 |work=|publisher=[[International Energy Agency]]|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SolarPowerPlantSerpa.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serpa solar power plant]] in the [[Alentejo]].]]
In 2008, renewable energy resource methods began to produce 43% of the nation's consumption of electricity, even as hydroelectric production decreased due to severe droughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://diariodigital.sapo.pt/news.asp?section_id=114&amp;id_news=381941 |title=Fontes renovÃ¡veis originaram 43% da electricidade consumida |work=DiÃ¡rio Digital|author=Staff |date=8 April 2009 |language=Portuguese|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, electricity exports had outnumbered imports. In the period between January and May 2010, 70% of the national production of energy came from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agenciafinanceira.iol.pt/empresas/portugal-agencia-financeira-ren-energia-electricidade/1168567-1728.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+iol/agenciafinanceira+(agenciafinanceira) |title=Portugal jÃ¡ exportou mais electricidade este ano que em 2009 |work=AgÃªncia Financeira |author=Staff |date=8 June 2010|language=Portuguese|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugalâs national energy transmission company, [[Redes EnergÃ©ticas Nacionais]] (REN), uses sophisticated modeling to predict weather, especially wind patterns, and computer programs to calculate energy from the various renewable-energy plants.
Before the solar/wind revolution, Portugal had generated electricity from hydropower plants on its rivers for decades. But new programs combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugalâs distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|Immigration to Portugal|Portuguese people}}

The ''[[Instituto Nacional de EstatÃ­stica]]'' ({{lang-pt|National Institute of Statistics}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,555,853 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male). This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity, namely after the expulsion of the [[Moors]], [[Moriscos]] and [[Sephardi Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html Portugal]&quot;. The Virtual Jewish History Tour.&lt;/ref&gt;

Native Portuguese are an [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] ethnic group, whose ancestry is very similar to other [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Southern Europe|Southern]] Europeans and [[Mediterranean people]]s, in particular Spaniards, with whom they share a common ancestry, history and cultural proximity.

The most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Immigration ===
{{main|Immigration to Portugal}}
Portugal's [[Portuguese Empire|colonial history]] has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the southwestern corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] and [[Portuguese East Africa|Mozambique]] in 1975), turning over the administration of [[Macau]] to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Brazilians]] have some Portuguese ancestry),&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal â Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. Portugal: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; has now become a country of net immigration,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4436276.stm Portugal sees integration progress]&quot;, BBC News, 14 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and not just from the last [[Portuguese India|Indian]] (Portuguese until 1961), [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|African]] (Portuguese until 1975), and [[Macau|Far East Asian]] (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;diaspora&quot;/&gt; By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal [[Immigration to Portugal|immigrants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ine.pt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=ITDS, Rui Campos, Pedro Senos |url=http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&amp;xpgid=ine_main |title=Statistics Portugal |publisher=Ine.pt |date= |accessdate=2011-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, along with a boom in [[construction]], several new waves of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], Brazilian, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|people from the former Portuguese colonies in Africa]] and other Africans have settled in the country. Romanians, Moldovans and Chinese have also chosen Portugal as destination. Portugal's [[Romani people|Romani]] population, estimated at about 40,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://criasnoticias.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/etnia-cigana-a-mais-discriminada-8-de-abril-dia-internacional-dos-ciganos/Etniacigana. A mais discriminada], (''[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]]''-5 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; offers another element of ethnic diversity. Most Romanis congregate with similar ethnic groups in the southern parts of the country and sell clothing and handicrafts in rural markets.

In addition, a number of [[EU citizen]]s, mostly from the United Kingdom, northern European or [[Scandinavia|Nordic]] countries, have become permanent residents in the country (with the British community being mostly composed of retired pensioners and choosing to live in the Algarve and Madeira).&lt;ref&gt;[http://embaixada-portugal-brasil.blogspot.com/2007/06/brasileiros-so-maior-colnia-estrangeira.html Brasileiros sÃ£o a maior colÃ³nia estrangeira em Portugal] Embaixada de Portugal No Brasil&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fatima.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of FÃ¡tima]], one of the largest Marian shrines in the world.]]

Today, 84.5% of the Portuguese population are Roman Catholic while 2.2% follow other Christian faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html |title=CIA â The World Factbook â Portugal |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 9% of the population are self-declared as non-religious (Zuckerman 2005). In addition, the country has small Protestant, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]], [[Islam in Portugal|Muslim]], [[Hinduism in Portugal|Hindu]], [[Sikh]], [[Orthodox Christianity|Christian Orthodox]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Baha'i]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] communities.

Many Portuguese holidays, festivals and traditions have a Christian origin or connotation. Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the [[History of Portugal (1279-1415)|13th and 14th centuries]], the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the [[reconquista|reconquest]], its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including the [[University of Coimbra|first university]]. The growth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese overseas empire]] made its [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] important agents of [[Colonisation|colonization]], with important roles in the [[teaching|education]] and [[evangelization]] of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of [[Liberal Revolution of 1820|liberal]] and nascent [[Republicanism|republican]] movements during the eras leading to the formation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] (1910â26) changed the role and importance of organized religion.

Portugal is a [[secular state]]: [[Separation of church and state|church and state were formally separated]] during the Portuguese First Republic, and later reiterated in the 1976 [[Portuguese Constitution]]. Other than the Constitution, the two most important documents relating to [[religious freedom]] in Portugal are: the 1940 Concordata (later amended in 1971) between Portugal and the [[Holy See]], and the 2001 Religious Freedom Act.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Portugal|Portuguese language|Mirandese language|Portuguese-based creole languages}}

[[File:Lusophone World.svg|thumb|left|300px|Map of the [[Lusosphere]]]]
Portuguese is the official language of Portugal. Portuguese is a [[Romance language]] that originated in what is now [[Galicia (Spain)]] and [[Northern Portugal]], from the [[Galician-Portuguese]] language. It is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] spoken by the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] around 2000 years ago. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire (1415â1999).

As a result, nowadays the Portuguese language is also official and spoken in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, Guinea-Bissau, and East Timor. These countries, plus [[Macau]] Special Administrative Region (People's Republic of China), make up the [[Lusosphere]], term derived from the ancient [[Roman province]] of ''[[Lusitania]]'', which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the [[Douro]] river. [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of northeastern Portugal. It retains fewer than 5,000 speakers in Portugal (a number that can be up to 12,000 if counting second language speakers).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[File:UNL presidency building.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the [[New University of Lisbon]].]]

The educational system is divided into preschool (for those under age 6), basic education (9 years, in three stages, compulsory), secondary education (3 years, till the 12th grade), and higher education (university and [[polytechnic (Portugal)|polytechnic]]).

Total adult literacy rate is 99%. Portuguese primary school enrollments are close to 100%. According to the [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) 2009, the average Portuguese 15-years old student, when rated in terms of reading literacy, mathematics and science knowledge, is placed at the same level as those students from the United States, Sweden, Germany, Ireland, France, Denmark, United Kingdom, Hungary and [[Taipei]], with 489 points (493 is the average).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.destak.pt/artigo/82223-alunos-portugueses-pela-primeira-vez-perto-da-media-relatorio-pisa|title =  Alunos portugueses pela primeira vez &quot;perto da mÃ©dia&quot; â relatÃ³rio PISA|publisher=[[Destak]]|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 35% of college-age citizens (20 years old) attend one of the country's higher education institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/GC18/Governo/Ministerios/MCTES/Intervencoes/Pages/20100111_MCTES_Int_Contrato_Confianca_EnsSup.aspx|title= Um Contrato de confianÃ§a no Ensino Superior para o futuro de Portugal|publisher=[[Government of Portugal]], portugal.gov.pt|language = Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compared with 50% in the United States and 35% in the [[OECD]] countries). In addition to being a key destination for [[international student]]s, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totaled 380,937 in 2005.

[[File:Coimbra University Tower 2.jpg|left|thumb|left|The tower of the [[University of Coimbra]], [[Coimbra]] â the university is one of the [[list of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest in continuous operation in the world]].]]

Portuguese universities have existed since 1290. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]] was first established in [[Lisbon]] before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded in 1792 the oldest engineering school of [[Latin America]] (the [[Real Academia de Artilharia, FortificaÃ§Ã£o e Desenho]]), as well as the oldest medical college of [[Asia]] (the [[Escola MÃ©dico-CirÃºrgica de Goa]]) in 1842. The largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Porto]]. Universities are usually organized into [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. Institutes and schools are also common designations for autonomous subdivisions of [[list of colleges and universities in Portugal|Portuguese higher education institutions]]. The [[Bologna process]] has been adopted since 2006 by Portuguese universities and polytechnical institutes. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department. Most student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc).

Portugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with MIT (US) and other North American institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.

=== Health ===
{{Main|Health in Portugal}}
[[File:Hospital de Santa Maria.jpg|thumb|right|Hospital of Santa Maria, [[Lisbon]].]]

According to the latest [[Human Development Report]], the average [[Life Expectancy]] in 2011 was 79.5 years.

The Portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service
(NHS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health subsystems) and voluntary
private health insurance. The NHS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population
is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the NHS.
Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives,
developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have
aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the
autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary
care.

The NHS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee
contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments
by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.

Similar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality
from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[Eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic
heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with
[[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%).
Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as
rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than
44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly)
are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.
Portugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the late
1980s.

Portugal's [[infant mortality rate]] has dropped sharply since the 1980s, when 24 of 1000 newborns died in
the first year of life. It is now around 3 deaths per a 1000 newborns. This improvement was mainly due to the
decrease in neonatal mortality, from 15.5 to 3.4 per 1000 live births.

People are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their
behaviour on their health and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health can
differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within
populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on
health status and the use of services.
Only one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is
the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in
terms of mortality and selected morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torre BelÃ©m April 2009-4a.jpg|thumb|[[BelÃ©m Tower]], [[Lisbon]]. A [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] and a typical example of Portugal's unique [[Manueline]] architecture.]]
Portugal has developed a specific culture while being influenced by various civilizations that have crossed the Mediterranean and the European continent, or were introduced when it played an active role during the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, Portugal modernized its public cultural facilities, in addition to the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] established in 1956 in Lisbon. These include the [[BelÃ©m Cultural Center]] in Lisbon, [[Serralves Foundation]] and the [[Casa da MÃºsica]], both in [[Porto]], as well as new public cultural facilities like municipal libraries and concert halls that were built or renovated in many municipalities across the country.

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Portugal}}
Traditional architecture is distinctive and include the [[Manueline]], also known as Portuguese late Gothic, a sumptuous, composite Portuguese style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century, incorporating maritime elements and representations of the [[Portuguese Age of Discovery]]. Modern Portugal has given the world renowned architects like [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]], [[Ãlvaro Siza Vieira]] (both [[Pritzker Prize]] winners) and [[GonÃ§alo Byrne]]. In Portugal [[TomÃ¡s Taveira]] is also noteworthy, particularly due to stadium design.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.dn.pt/Inicio/interior.aspx?content_id=615671 EstÃ¡dios de TomÃ¡s Taveira e Souto Moura premiados], [[DiÃ¡rio de NotÃ­cias]] (July 8, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Tom%C3%A1s-Taveira-Geoffrey-Broadbent/dp/185490034X TomÃ¡s Taveira], Geoffrey Broadbent (introduction), Publisher: St Martins Pr (February 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.arquitectura.pt/forum/f11/sao-paulo-est-dio-do-palmeiras-no-brasil-tom-s-taveira-10811/ TomÃ¡s Tveira desenha estÃ¡dio do Palmeiras no Brasil], Diarioeconomico.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Portuguese literature}}

[[File:LuÃ­s de CamÃµes por FranÃ§ois GÃ©rard.jpg|150px|thumb|upright|[[LuÃ­s de CamÃµes]], Portuguese poet of the 16th century.]]
[[Portuguese literature]], one of the earliest Western literatures, developed through text and song. Until 1350, the [[Portuguese-Galician]] [[troubadour]]s spread their literary influence to most of the Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;''Poesia e Prosa Medievais'', p. 9, para. 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gil Vicente]] (ca. 1465 â ca. 1536), was one of the founders of both Portuguese and Spanish dramatic traditions.

Adventurer and poet [[LuÃ­s de CamÃµes]] (ca. 1524â1580) wrote the epic poem ''&quot;Os LusÃ­adas&quot;'' ([[The Lusiads]]), with [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] as his main influence. Modern Portuguese poetry is rooted in neoclassic and contemporary styles, as exemplified by [[Fernando Pessoa]] (1888â1935). Modern Portuguese literature is represented by authors such as [[Almeida Garrett]], [[Camilo Castelo Branco]], [[EÃ§a de Queiroz]], [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]], [[AntÃ³nio Lobo Antunes]] and [[Miguel Torga]]. Particularly popular and distinguished is [[JosÃ© Saramago]], winner of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize for literature]].

=== Cuisine ===
&lt;!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: &quot;Portuguese cuisine&quot; and &quot;Portuguese wine&quot;, your work there will be very appreciated. --&gt;

{{Main|Portuguese Cuisine|Portuguese Wine}}
[[File:Bacalhau a Bras.jpg|thumb|170px|right|''[[Bacalhau Ã  BrÃ¡s]]''.]]Portuguese cuisine is diverse. The Portuguese consume a lot of dry [[cod]] (''[[bacalhau]]'' in Portuguese), for which there are hundreds of [[Bacalhau#Bacalhau dishes|recipes]]. There are more than enough ''[[bacalhau]]'' dishes for each day of the year. Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a potato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish. Typical Portuguese meat recipes, that may be made out of beef, pork, [[domestic sheep|lamb]], or chicken, include ''[[cozido Ã  portuguesa]]'', [[feijoada]], [[frango de churrasco]], ''leitÃ£o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]) and ''[[carne de porco Ã  alentejana]]'', a very popular northern dish is the arroz de sarrabulho (rice stewed in pigs blood) or the arroz de cabidela (Rice and chickens meat stewed in chickens blood).

Typical fast food dishes include the [[francesinha]] from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwiches]], which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in [[Middle-Ages]] Catholic monasteries widely spread across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[pastÃ©is de BelÃ©m]] (or ''pastÃ©is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and [[ovos moles]] from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food and throughout the country there are myriad good restaurants and small typical ''tascas''.

Portuguese wines have deserved international recognition since the times of the Roman Empire, which associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are: [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do DÃ£o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet: [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]] and the [[Moscatel]] from [[SetÃºbal]] and [[Favaios]]. Port Wine is well known around the world and the most widely known wine type in the world{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. The [[Douro]] wine region is the oldest in the world{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Portugal}}
[[File:Jose malhoa fado.jpg|thumb|left|''The Fado'', painting by Portuguese artist [[JosÃ© Malhoa]] (1855â1933).]]

[[Music of Portugal|Portuguese music]] encompasses a wide variety of genres. The most renowned is [[fado]], a melancholy urban music, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[AmÃ¡lia Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[JosÃ© Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[AntÃ³nio Chainho]], [[MÃ­sia]], and [[Madredeus]].

In addition to fado and folk, the Portuguese listen to pop and other types of modern music, particularly from North America and the United Kingdom, as well as a wide range of Portuguese and Brazilian artists and bands. Artists with international recognition include [[Moonspell]], [[Buraka Som Sistema]], [[Blasted Mechanism]] and [[The Gift (band)|The Gift]], with the two latter being nominees for a [[MTV Europe Music Award]].

Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, the [http://boomfestival.org/boom2012/ Boom Festival], that is also the only festival in Portugal to win international awards: European Festival Award 2010 - Green'n'Clean Festival of the Year and the Greener Festival Award Outstanding 2008 and 2010.

=== Painting ===
It has also a rich history as far as painting is concerned. The first well-known painters date back to the 15th century&amp;nbsp;â like [[Nuno GonÃ§alves]] â were part of the Gothic painting period.
[[JosÃ© Malhoa]], known for his work ''Fado'', and [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] (who painted the portraits of [[TeÃ³filo Braga]] and [[Antero de Quental]]) were both references in naturalist painting.

The 20th century saw the arrival of [[Modernism]], and along with it came the most prominent Portuguese painters: [[Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso]], who was heavily influenced by French painters, particularly by the [[Delaunays]]. Among his best known works is ''CanÃ§Ã£o Popular a Russa e o FÃ­garo''. Another great modernist painter/writer was [[Almada Negreiros]], friend to the poet [[Fernando Pessoa]], who painted his (Pessoa's) portrait. He was deeply influenced by both [[Cubist]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] trends. Prominent international figures in visual arts nowadays include painters [[Vieira da Silva]], [[JÃºlio Pomar]], [[Helena Almeida]], [[Joana Vasconcelos]], [[JuliÃ£o Sarmento]] and [[Paula Rego]].
