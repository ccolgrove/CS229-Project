'''Gihan &quot;Gigi&quot; Ibrahim''' &lt;!--(born 2 December 1988{{cn|date=October 2011}}--&gt;&lt;!--in [[Cairo, Egypt]]{{cn|date=November 2011}})--&gt; is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[journalist]], [[blog|blogger]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] activist. She has been credited as being a part of a new generation of &quot;citizen journalists&quot; who document news events using [[social media]]. For this she was featured on a cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine as &quot;one of the leaders&quot; of [[Tahrir Square]] during the [[Egyptian Revolution 2011|Egyptian Revolution]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailycamera.com/features/ci_17742185 | title = The world at Boulder's doorstep | publisher = Daily Camera | date = 4 March 2011 | accessdate = 12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim however states, that while the internet was important for coordinating people in the ousting of [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]], &quot;it was the battles on the streets that were crucial... It was their power that made the revolution.&quot;

She is a graduate from the [[American University in Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/interview-with-an-egyptian-blogger/ | title = Interview With an Egyptian Blogger | publisher = The New York Times | date = 27 January 2011 | accessdate = 12 April 2011 | first=Robert | last=Mackey}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she earned a political science degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://journalism.about.com/b/2011/01/28/citizen-journalist-gigi-ibrahim-uses-tools-of-the-web-to-spread-news-of-cairo-protests.htm | title = Citizen Journalist Gigi Ibrahim Uses Tools of the Web to Spread News of Cairo Protests | publisher = About.com | date = 28 January 2011 | accessdate = 14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to university, Gigi has had no direct links to the [[Politics of Egypt#Civil society|workers protests]] and [[List of political parties in Egypt|opposition movements]] that had previously been occurring in Egypt. It was a class on &quot;Social Mobilization under Authoritarian Regimes&quot;, lectured by [[Hossam el-Hamalawy]], that provided her with insight about activism in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bikyamasr.com/wordpress/?p=33189 | title = Egyptian activist on The Daily Show | publisher = Bikya Masr | date = 27 April 2011 | accessdate = 1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contact with el-Hamalawy, a member of the [[Revolutionary Socialists (Egypt)|Revolutionary Socialists]], led her to decide to join the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=24165 | title = Socialist from Egypt to join debate about revolution | publisher = Socialist Worker (UK) | date = 12 March 2011 | accessdate = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from ''Time'', she has also appeared in [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]], [[BBC News|BBC]], [[Al Jazeera]] and the [[Daily Show]].

Gigi was featured in a documentary by award-winning journalist Inigo Gilmore. This production, following her from the earliest days of the revolution, looks at her life not just in Tahrir Square, but also at home, commenting on the reserved view many upper middle class Egyptians initially took against the revolution. The documentary [http://www.youtube.com/user/InigoGilmore#p/u/5/ZzwU9J9kyko &quot;Gigi's revolution&quot;] was aired on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Network in the USA.

She is critical of other Egyptian youth activists such as [[Wael Ghonim]], who called on protesters to go home after Mubarak had ceded some power but refused to step down as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703561604576150604132131990.html
