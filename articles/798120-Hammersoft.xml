On April 9, 2010 the Board of Trustees selected Thomas A. Kazee, former Executive Vice President and Provost at Furman University, as the University of Evansville's 23rd president. Former president Stephen G. Jennings began retiring in May 2010.
Kazee assumed Presidential duties on June 1, 2010. In August 2010, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine listed the University of Evansville at No. 296 on their 610&amp;nbsp;&quot;Best Colleges&quot; list. This list was compiled from 6,600 colleges and universities worldwide, with the note that there was very little distinction between the highest rated institution to the last as the criteria for inclusion was extremely high and those institutions cited all share excellent status as institutions of Higher Learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Martin| first =John| title =Forbes lists UE among best schools| publisher =[[Evansville Courier &amp; Press]]| date =2010-08-15| url =http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/aug/15/no-headline---15a03ue-brf/| accessdate =2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' recognized the University of Evansville as one of the 10&amp;nbsp;best regional universities in the Midwest in its annual ranking of &quot;America's Best Colleges&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Brubeck| first =Sarah| title =UE ranks with 'America's Best Colleges'| publisher =''Evansville Courier &amp; Press''| date =2010-08-16| url =http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/aug/16/ue-ranks-with-americas-best/| accessdate =2010-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Evansville began in 1854 when Moores Hill Male and Female Collegiate Institute was founded by John Moore in the small town of Moores Hill in southeastern Indiana. The first college building at Moores Hill, Moore Hall, was completed on December 1, 1856, although the opening day of classes for the new college were held in the unfinished building on [[September 9]]th. The institution struggled financially during its time in Moores Hill, and a fire destroyed Moore Hall in 1915. The institution continued to operate in a second building, Carnegie Hall, until the move to Evansville.  The former campus in Moores Hill continued operation as an elementary and high school.  Carnegie Hall is now maintained as a museum.

On March 21, 1917, George S. Clifford made a presentation at a special session of the Indiana Conference of the [[Methodist Church]]. He suggested moving the college to [[Evansville, Indiana]]. Clifford produced a map that indicated a lack of colleges in the Evansville area - there were none within 50&amp;nbsp;miles of the city within Indiana. After deliberation, the school was relocated to Evansville in 1919 and renamed Evansville College. It operated in temporary quarters in downtown Evansville until Administration Hall (now Olmsted Hall) was completed in 1922. This is the only building remaining on campus from before World War II.

In the period from World War II to 1960, Evansville College grew significantly. Enrollment grew from about 400 during the [[Great Depression]] to 1,500 in 1946. Also following the war, the Science and Engineering Building and Alumni Memorial Union were commissioned. The Clifford Memorial Library was completed in 1957. Five residence halls were built between 1958 and 1967, along with a fitness center, dining hall, and an art building. In 1967, due to the institution's growth and organizational changes, the name was changed to the University of Evansville with the approval of the Indiana State General Assembly. Also in 1967, a new theater building, Hyde Hall, housing Shanklin Theater was finished.

In 2010 The University of Evansville completed early its Endowment Campaign to raise $80 million after having raised an additional $60 million five years previous to the new campaign.

== Athletics ==
{{main|Evansville Purple Aces}}
The University of Evansville athletic teams have the nickname the Purple Aces (originally the &quot;Pioneers&quot;).  Both men's and women's varsity sports play at the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level and compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], except for the men's swimming and diving teams which compete in the [[Mid-American Conference]]

== Campus ==
The university is known for its grassy open spaces and tree cover.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The university landscape is well maintained{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, and many students take advantage of the spacious lawns and large shade trees.

The campus is bounded on the north by the [[Lloyd Expressway]], the south by Lincoln Avenue, west by Rotherwood Avenue, and on the east by Weinbach Avenue. Walnut Street bisects the campus. Sesquicentennial Oval, the ceremonial entrance to campus, opens off of Lincoln Avenue. The oval was named in 2004 in commemoration of the university's 150th anniversary. The Schroeder Family School of Business, McCurdy Alumni Memorial Union, Hyde Hall, Olmsted Administration Hall, Clifford Memorial Library, and Koch (pronounced Cook) Center for Science and Engineering surround Sesquicentennial Oval. Most of the buildings follow an old limestone motif, and renovations generally emulate the rest of the building.

== Accomplishments ==

In the 2008-2009 Academic school year, the University of Evansville captured a title in the Concrete Canoe over perennial winners, the [[University of WisconsinâMadison]]. The winning canoe, named Sauske, will compete at the national convention in Alabama. The American Society of Civil Engineers at UE also claimed top honors at the same conference competition. The ASCE chapter at UE has been increasing their placing in their region since 2004, steadily increasing in the ranks despite hard competition from renowned engineering schools like Purdue and UWâMadison.
