[[Microsoft]] is a multinational computer technology corporation. The '''history of Microsoft''' began on April 4, 1975, when it was founded by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]].&lt;ref name=&quot;founding&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm | title=Bill Gates: A Timeline | accessdate=2006-07-03 | work=BBC News | date=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current best-selling products are the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] and the [[Microsoft Office]] suite of productivity software.

Starting in 1980, Microsoft formed an important partnership with [[IBM]] that allowed them to bundle Microsoft's operating system with computers that they sold, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new operating system for their computers called [[OS/2]]; Microsoft wrote the operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.

The company has now become largely successful. As of 2008, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of [[United States dollar|US$]] 60.42 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] and nearly 90,000 employees in 105 countries. It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of [[computer software|software]] products for computing devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005annual&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft 2005 Annual Report | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/ar05/downloads/MS_2005_AR.doc | accessdate=1 October 2005 |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date = August 1, 2007| url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/inside_ms.mspx| title = Fast Facts About Microsoft| work = microsoft.com| publisher = Microsoft Corporation| accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2007financials&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author = MSFT Investor Relations| date = July 19, 2007| url = http://www.microsoft.com/msft/earnings/FY07/earn_rel_q4_07.mspx| title = Microsoft Fourth Quarter FY 2007 Earnings Release: Microsoftâs Annual Revenue Surpasses $50 Billion| work = microsoft.com| publisher = Microsoft Corporation| accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that would spawn Microsoft germinated when Paul Allen showed Bill Gates the January 1, 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=What We'll Miss About Bill Gates â a Very Long Good-Bye| url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-06/st_billgates | accessdate=3 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen and Gates saw potential to develop an implementation of the [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Key Events In Microsoft History | url=http://www.microsoft.com/visitorcenter/student.mspx | accessdate=1 October 2005 }} ([[DOC (computing)|DOC]] format)&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gates called the creators of the new [[microcomputer]], [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] (Micro Instrumentation and [[Telemetry]] Systems), offering to demonstrate the implementation in order to win a contract with the company. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo they developed an interpreter. When Allen flew to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] to meet with [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]], the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute [[Altair BASIC]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Allen and Gates left [[Boston]], moved to Albuquerque (where MITS was located), and co-founded Microsoft there. Gross income of the young company was $1 million in 1975.

Allen came up with the original name of ''Micro-Soft'' (a [[portmanteau]] of [[microcomputer]] and software), as recounted in a [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm 1995 Fortune magazine interview with Allen and Gates].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=BILL GATES &amp; PAUL ALLEN TALK | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm | accessdate=3 May 2011 | work=CNN | first=Bill | last=Gates | date=1995-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyphenated in its early incarnations, on November 26, 1976 the company was registered under that name with the Secretary of State of New Mexico. The company's first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled &quot;[[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] Microsoft&quot; (now called &quot;[[Microsoft Japan]]&quot;), and on November 29, 1979, the term, &quot;Microsoft&quot; was first used by Bill Gates.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=What We'll Miss About Bill Gates â a Very Long Good-Bye| url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/16-06/st_billgates | accessdate=3 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; [[Steve Ballmer]] joined the company on June 11, 1980, and would later succeed Bill Gates as [[CEO]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; The company restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to &quot;Microsoft, Inc.&quot;). As part of the restructuring, Bill Gates became president of the company and Chairman of the Board, and Paul Allen became Executive Vice President.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;

Microsoft's early products were different variants of [[Microsoft BASIC]] which was the dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as [[Apple II]] ([[Applesoft BASIC]]) and [[Commodore 64]] ([[Commodore BASIC]]), and were also provided with early versions of the [[IBM PC]] as the [[IBM Cassette BASIC]].

The first [[operating system]] publicly released by the company was a variant of [[Unix]] in 1980. Acquired from [[AT&amp;T]] through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it [[Xenix]], and hired [[Santa Cruz Operation]] in order to port/adapt the [[operating system]] to several platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;xenix1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Is It Time Again For Microsoft And Unix? | url=http://www.informationweek.com/author/internet36.htm | author=Jason Levitt | publisher=Information Week | date=2000-06-12 | accessdate=2006-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695 | title=Under The Hood: Part 8 | publisher=Computer Source | author=Dafydd Neal Dyar | date=2002-11-04 | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Unix variant would become home to the first version of Microsoft's [[word processor]], [[Microsoft Office Word|Microsoft Word]]. Originally titled &quot;Multi-Tool Word&quot;, Microsoft Word became notable for its concept of &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot;, or [[WYSIWYG]].

Word was also the first application with such features as the ability to display bold text. It was first released in the spring of 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]], making it the first program to be distributed on-disk with a [[magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roy | last=A.

[[DOS]] (Disk Operating System) was the operating system that brought the company its real success. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with [[Digital Research]] failed, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the [[CP/M]] operating system, which was set to be used in the upcoming [[IBM Personal Computer]] (PC). For this deal, Microsoft purchased a [[CP/M]] clone called [[86-DOS]] from [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to [[PC-DOS]]. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM hadn't done their homework. Due to potential [[copyright infringement]] problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC-DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC-DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joewein.de/dri.html | title=Digital Research History | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html | title=Pioneers Die Broke | publisher=Forbes | author=John Steele Gordon Michael Maiello | date=2002-12-23 | accessdate=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1983, in collaboration with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, [[MSX]], which contained its own version of the DOS operating system, entitled [[MSX-DOS]]; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Microsoft Company 15 September 1975 | publisher = The History of Computing Project | url= http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company_part2.htm | accessdate=August 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=comp.sys.msx FAQ | url=http://www.komkon.org/fms/MSX/MSX.faq | accessdate=14 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/company.asp?st=1&amp;m=86 | title=MSX History | work=OLD-COMPUTERS.COM | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after [[Columbia Data Products]] successfully cloned the IBM [[BIOS]], quickly followed by [[Eagle Computer]] and [[Compaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0304/09r04/09r04.asp&amp;guid= | title=Booting Your PC: Getting Up Close &amp; Personal With A Computerâs BIOS | publisher=Smart Computing |month=November | year=1999 | accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/1994/july94/pcn0713/pcn0713.asp&amp;articleid=5360&amp;guid= | title=What Is The BIOS? |month=July | year=1994 | publisher=Smart Computing | accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1151907,00.asp | title=Everything You Want or Need to Know About Your BIOS | publisher=Extreme Tech | accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Appendix B | chapterurl=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/pubs/ipnta/appenb.pdf | title=Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age | isbn=0-7355-3652-X | accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, [[MS-DOS]], and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple:

This expansion included [[Microsoft Press]], a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: ''Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer'' by [[Peter Norton]], and ''The Apple Macintosh Book'' by [[Cary Lu]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;

==1985â1991: The rise and fall of OS/2==

Ireland became home to one of Microsoft's international production facility in 1985, and on November 20 Microsoft released its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[Windows 1.0]]), originally a graphical extension for its MS-DOS operating system.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; In August, Microsoft and IBM partnered in the development of a different operating system called [[OS/2]]. OS/2 was marketed in connection with a new hardware design proprietary to IBM, the [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Techworld Article:OS/2 users must look elsewhere | url=http://www.techworld.com/applications/features/index.cfm?featureid=1603&amp;Page=1&amp;pagePos=5 | accessdate=2005-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1986, Microsoft relocated to Redmond, Washington. Around one month later, on March 13, the company went public with an IPO, raising US$61 million at US$21.00 per share. By the end of the trading day, the price had risen to US$28.00. In 1987, Microsoft eventually released their first version of OS/2 to [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Microsoft OS/2 announcement | url=http://pages.prodigy.net/michaln/history/pr/87apr_m3592.html | accessdate=2005-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Microsoft began introducing its most prominent office products. [[Microsoft Works]], an integrated office program which combined features typically found in a [[word processor]], [[spreadsheet]], [[database]] and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] towards the end of 1986.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and [[Microsoft Bookshelf]], a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first [[CD-ROM]] product.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeobsoleteproducts | title=Obsolete Microsoft products | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft would introduce its most successful office product, [[Microsoft Office]]. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, [[Microsoft Excel]] and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as [[Microsoft SQL Server]] on January 13, 1988, a [[relational database management system]] for companies that was based on technology licensed from [[Sybase]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;

On May 22, 1990 Microsoft launched [[Windows 3.0]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; The new version of Microsoft's operating system boasted such new features as streamlined graphic [[user interface]] [[GUI]] and improved [[protected mode]] ability for the [[Intel 80386|Intel 386]] processor; it sold over 100,000 copies in two weeks.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryDesktop.mspx | title=Windows History | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows at the time generated more revenue for Microsoft than OS/2, and the company decided to move more resources from OS/2 to Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/2history&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2History.html | title=OS/2 History | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an internal memo to Microsoft employees on May 16, 1991, Bill Gates announced that the OS/2 partnership was over, and that Microsoft would henceforth focus its platform efforts on Windows and the [[Windows NT]] [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. Some people, especially developers who had ignored Windows and committed most of their resources to OS/2, were taken by surprise, and accused Microsoft of deception. This changeover from OS/2 was frequently referred to in the industry as &quot;the head-fake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRheadfake&quot;&gt;{{cite news |

During the transition from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product [[Microsoft Office]] allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as [[WordPerfect]] and [[Lotus 1-2-3]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vnunet.com/computing/analysis/2073923/behind-pearly-gates | title=Behind the Pearly Gates | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented [[Application Programming Interface]] features to make Office perform better than its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/16/novell_microsoft_wordperfect_analysis/ | title=Novell's MS complaint: we wuz robbed | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,18462,pg,1,00.asp | title=A Peek at Office Upgrade | publisher=PCWorld.com |date=2000-09-13 | author=Harry McCracken | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1992, Microsoft released [[Windows 3.1]] along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; In October, [[Windows for Workgroups 3.1]] was released with integrated networking abilities such as [[peer-to-peer]] file and printing sharing.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; In November, Microsoft released the first version of their popular database software [[Microsoft Access]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;

[[Image:Microsoft Dubai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Microsoft sign at the entrance of the Dubai Microsoft campus, [[Dubai Internet City]]. Microsoft has developed Arabic versions for most of its products.]]

By 1993, Windows had become the most widely used [[graphical user interface|GUI]] operating system in the world.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; ''Fortune Magazine'' named Microsoft as the &quot;1993 Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-02|url=http://www.salespromo.co.uk/article/90|title=Feature: Brand Microsoft |publisher=Sales Promotion }}&lt;/ref&gt; The year also marked the end of a five-year [[copyright infringement]] legal case brought by [[Apple Computer]], dubbed [[Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.]], in which the ruling was in Microsoft's favor, the release of [[Windows for Workgroups 3.11]], a new version of the consumer line of Windows, and [[Windows NT 3.1]], a server-based operating system with a similar user interface to consumer versions of the operating system, but with an entirely different kernel.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; As part of its strategy to broaden its business, Microsoft released [[Microsoft Encarta]] on March 22, 1993, the first encyclopedia designed to run on a computer.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; Soon after, the [[Microsoft Home]] brand was introduced - encompassing Microsoft's new multimedia applications for Windows 3.x., Microsoft changed its slogan to ''&quot;[[Where do you want to go today?]]&quot;'' in 1994 as part of an attempt to appeal to nontechnical audiences in a US$100 million advertising campaign.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;

Microsoft continued to make strategic decisions directed at consumers. The company released [[Microsoft Bob]], a graphical user interface designed for novice computer users, in March 1995. The interface was discontinued in 1996 due to poor sales; Bill Gates later attributed its failure to hardware requirements that were too high for typical computers; Microsoft Bob is widely regarded as Microsoft's most unsuccessful product.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple:

Spyglass went on to later dispute the terms of the agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system.

The memo described [[Netscape]] with their [[Netscape Navigator]] as a &quot;new competitor 'born' on the Internet.&quot; The memo outlines Microsoft's failure to grasp the [[Internet]]'s importance, and in it Gates assigns &quot;the Internet this highest level of importance&quot; from then on.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, Bill - [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/exhibits/20.pdf The Internet Tidal Wave]. Microsoft, May 26, 1995. Made publicly available at United States Department of Justice. United States v. Microsoft Trial Exhibits&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft began to expand its product line into [[computer network]]ing and the [[World Wide Web]]. On August 24, 1995, it launched a major [[online service]], [[MSN]] (Microsoft Network), as a direct competitor to [[AOL]]. MSN became an umbrella service for Microsoft's online services, using Microsoft Passport (now called [[Windows Live ID]]) as a universal login system for all of its web sites.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/nov02/11-08MSN8GlobalTimeLine.mspx | title=MSN Historical Time line | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued to branch out into new markets in 1996, starting with a joint venture with [[NBC]] to create a new [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[United States cable news|cable news]] television station, [[MSNBC]]. The station was launched on July 15, 1996 to compete with similar news outlets such as [[CNN]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/1996/07/15_mpp.html | title=American Public Media archive | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also launched [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], an [[online magazine]] edited by [[Michael Kinsley]], which offered political and social commentary along with the cartoon [[Doonesbury]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; In an attempt to extend its reach in the consumer market, the company acquired [[WebTV]], which enabled consumers to access the Web from their televisions.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; Microsoft entered the personal digital assistant (PDA) market in November with [[Windows CE 1.0]], a new built-from-scratch version of their flagship operating system, designed to run on low-memory, low-performance machines, such as handhelds and other small computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;cehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hpcfactor.com/qlink/?linkID=20 | title=Windows CE History | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996 saw the release of [[Windows NT 4.0]], which brought the Windows 95 GUI and Windows NT kernel together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp | title=Windows Server 2003: The Road To Gold | work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Microsoft largely failed to participate in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was [[ActiveX]], an application programming interface built on the [[Microsoft Component Object Model]] ([[Component Object Model|COM]]); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many [[programming language]]s, including the company's own [[scripting language]]s, such as [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]]. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Later in 1997, [[Microsoft Office 97]] as well as [[Internet Explorer 4.0]] were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival [[Netscape]], and by agreement with [[Apple Computer]], Internet Explorer was bundled with the [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] operating system as well as with Windows.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; [[Windows CE 2.0]], the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers.&lt;ref name=cehistory/&gt; In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the [[United States district court|federal district court]] in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;

[[Image:Windows98.png|thumb|200px|left|A [[Windows 98]] desktop]]The year 1998 was significant in Microsoft's history, with Bill Gates appointing [[Steve Ballmer]] as president of Microsoft but remaining as Chair and CEO himself.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; The company released an update to the consumer version of Windows, [[Windows 98]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; Windows 98 came with Internet Explorer 4.0 SP1 (which had [[Windows Desktop Update]] bundled), and included new features from Windows 95 OSR 2.x including the [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] [[file system]], and new features designed for Windows 98, such as support for multiple displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/win98/proddocs/chapt18.mspx?mfr=true | title=Introducing MS Windows 98, Second Edition - Chapter 18 | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft launched its Indian headquarters as well, which would eventually become the company's second largest after its U.S. headquarters.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Finally, a great deal of controversy took place when a set of internal memos from the company were leaked on the Internet. These documents, colloquially referred to as &quot;[[Halloween documents|The Halloween Documents]]&quot;, were widely reported by the media and go into detail of the threats that [[free software]] / [[open source software]] poses to Microsoft's own software, previously voiced mainly by analysts and advocates of open source software. The documents also allude to legal and other actions against [[Linux]] as well as other open source software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.opensource.org/halloween/ | title=The Halloween Documents | accessdate=2006-05-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060513142906/http://www.opensource.org/halloween/ |archivedate = May 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/06/linux.threat.idg/ | title=Microsoft pondering legal challenge to Linux | publisher=CNN | date=1998-11-06 | author=Bob Trott | accessdate=2006-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Microsoft acknowledges the documents, it claims that they are merely engineering studies.

==2000â2005: Legal issues, XP, and .NET==
[[Image:Bill Gates 2004.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bill Gates gives a presentation at [[Forum Copenhagen|IT-Forum]] in [[Copenhagen]] in 2004.]]
Microsoft, in 2000, released new products for all three lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw the beginning of the end of one its most prominent legal cases. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in [[Windows 2000]], which some{{Who|date=April 2011}} considered to be a significant improvement over previous versions. It provided an OS stability similar to that of its [[Unix]] counterparts due to its usage of the [[Windows NT]] kernel, and matching features for several of those found in the home line of the operating system including a DOS [[emulator]] that could run many [[Legacy system|legacy]] DOS applications.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of [[United States v. Microsoft]],&lt;ref name=&quot;usvms&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= United States v. Microsoft | url= http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/ms_index.htm | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice | accessdate= 2005-08-05 }} homepage at the [[United States Department of Justice]]&lt;/ref&gt; calling the company an &quot;abusive monopoly&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;findingsoffact&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm | title=U.S. vs. Microsoft findings of fact | accessdate=2006-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forcing the company to split into two separate units. Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal [[Appeal|appeals court]], and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001. On June 15, 2000 the company also released a new version of its hand-held operating system, [[Windows CE 3.0]].&lt;ref name=cehistory/&gt; The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the [[WinAPI]], the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the core functionality of the WinAPI. The update to the consumer line, [[Windows Me]] (or Windows Millennium Edition), was released on September 14, 2000.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; It sported several new features such as enhanced multimedia abilities and consumer-oriented PC maintenance options, but is often regarded as one of the worst versions of Windows due to installation problems and other issues.&lt;ref name=cnettop10worst/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,125772,pg,2,00.asp | title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time | work=PCWorld | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Windows XP.PNG|thumb|right|250px|[[Windows XP]] introduced a [[Luna (theme)|new interface]], along with many other [[Features new to Windows XP|new features]]. This screenshot shows Windows XP Professional.]]Microsoft released [[Windows XP]] and [[Microsoft Office XP|Office XP]] in 2001, a version that aimed to encompass the features of both its business and home product lines. The release included an updated version of the Windows 2000 kernel, enhanced DOS emulation abilities, and many of the home-user features found in previous consumer versions. XP introduced a new [[graphical user interface]], the first such change since Windows 95.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/evaluation/features.mspx | title=Windows XP Professional Features | accessdate=2006-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operating system was the first to require [[Microsoft Product Activation]], an [[anti-piracy]] mechanism that requires users to activate the software with Microsoft within 30 days. Later, Microsoft would enter the multi-billion-dollar [[game console]] market dominated by [[Sony]] and [[Nintendo]], with the release of the [[Xbox]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; The Xbox finished way behind the dominant [[PlayStation 2]] selling 24 million units compared to the [[PlayStation 2]]'s 136 million however they managed to outsell the [[Nintendo Gamecube]] which finished on 21 million units. Microsoft launched their second console the [[Xbox 360]] in 2005 which has turned out to be a lot more successful than their first console selling 40 million units as of 2010 and outselling Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] which has so far sold 35 million. However despite beating them with their last console Microsoft have so far been outsold by the [[Nintendo Wii]] which has introduced motion control and has opened up a new market for video games. Microsoft are hoping that their controller free experience [[Kinect]] which they released in November of 2010 will help them take some of the Wii's 71 million consumers so far as of 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2002, Microsoft launched the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] initiative, along with new versions of some of its development products, such as [[Microsoft Visual Studio]].&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; The initiative has been an entirely new development API for Windows programming, and includes a new programming language, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]. [[Windows Server 2003]] was launched, featuring enhanced administration abilities, such as new user interfaces to server tools.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; In 2004, the company released [[Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005]], a version of Windows XP designed for multimedia abilities, and [[Windows XP Starter Edition]], a version of Windows XP with a smaller feature set designed for entry-level consumers.&lt;ref name=keyevents/&gt; However, Microsoft would encounter more turmoil in March 2004 when antitrust legal action would be brought against it by the [[European Union]] for allegedly abusing its market dominance (see [[European Union Microsoft antitrust case]]). Eventually Microsoft was fined [[Euro|â¬]]497 million (US$613 million), ordered to divulge certain protocols to competitors, and to produce a new version of its Windows XP platformâcalled Windows XP Home Edition Nâthat did not include its [[Windows Media Player]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/BUSINESS/03/24/microsoft.eu/ | title=Microsoft hit by record EU fine | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2004-03-25 | accessdate=2006-05-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060413082435/http://www.cnn.com/2004/BUSINESS/03/24/microsoft.eu/ |archivedate = April 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;euantitrust&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Text of the European Union ruling against Microsoft | url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/antitrust/cases/decisions/37792/en.pdf | accessdate=2005-08-05 | format=[[PDF]]}} (from the official EU website)&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft was also ordered to produce separate packages of Windows after South Korea also landed a settlement against the company in 2005. It had to pay out US$32 million and produce more than one version of Windows for the country in the same vein as the European Union-one with Windows Media Player and [[Windows Messenger]] and one without the two programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;skorea&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/12/07/HNmicrosoftfined_1.html | title=Update: Microsoft fined $32M by South Korea | author=Dan Nystedt | publisher=IDG News Service | date=2005-12-07 | accessdate=2006-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005âpresent: Vista, Windows 7 and other transitions==
[[Image:Windows Vista.png|thumb|left|[[Windows Vista]] was one of Microsoft's client operating systems, which featured a new visual style, [[Windows Aero]].]]

In guise of competing with other [[Internet]] companies such as the search service [[Google]], in 2005 Microsoft announced a new version of its [[MSN Search|MSN search]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,119512,00.asp | title=Microsoft Spotlights Its Search Engine | publisher=PCWorld | author=Juan Carlos Perez | date=2005-02-01 | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2006, the company launched [[Microsoft adCenter]], a service that offers [[pay per click]] advertisements, in an effort to further develop their search marketing revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114671006737543462-_J28L_xrIrBNHdGD7jifJ9xlb5o_20070504.html | title=With adCenter, Microsoft Bids For Web-Search Bonanza | publisher=Wall Street Journal | author=Robert A. Guth | coauthors=Kevin J. Delaney | date=2006-05-04 | accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Microsoft created the [[CodePlex]] collaborative development site for hosting [[open source]] projects. Activity grew quickly as developers from around the world began to participate, and by early 2007 commercial open source companies, such as [[Aras Corp]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/01/15/03OPopenent_1.html | title=Soft Sell for Open Source Apps | publisher=InfoWorld | author=Neil McAllister | date=2007-01-15 | accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to offer enterprise open source software exclusively on the Microsoft platform.

On June 15, 2006 Bill Gates announced his plans for a two year transition period out of a day-to-day role with Microsoft until July 31, 2008. After that date, Gates will continue in his role as the company's chairman, head of the Board of Directors and act as an adviser on key projects. His role as Chief [[Software architect|Software Architect]] will be filled immediately by [[Ray Ozzie]], the [[Chief Technical Officer]] of the company as of June 15, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-15CorpNewsPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Announces Plans for July 2008 Transition for Bill Gates | accessdate=2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gates stated &quot;My announcement is not a retirement â itâs a reordering of my priorities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/fb5a5b88-fcab-11da-9599-0000779e2340.html | title=Bill Gates calls time on career at Microsoft | author=Richard Waters | publisher=Financial Times | date=2006-06-15 | accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly codenamed &quot;Longhorn&quot; in the early development stages, [[Windows Vista]] was released to consumers on January 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/windowsvista/archive/2006/09/01/453491.aspx | title=It's Official: Windows Vista RC1 Is Complete | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/mar06/03-21WindowsVistaDeliveryPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Updates Windows Vista Road Map | accessdate=2006-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also released a new version of its Office suite, called [[Microsoft Office 2007]], alongside Windows Vista. [[Windows Server 2008]] and [[Visual Studio 2008]], the next versions of the company's [[Server (computing)|server]] operating system and development suite, respectively, have been [[Software release life cycle#RTM|released to manufacturing]], and are scheduled to be released on February 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.betanews.com/article/New_Windows_Server_Visual_Studio_SQL_Server_to_Launch_in_February/1184080223 | title = New Windows Server, Visual Studio, SQL Server to Launch in February | author = Nate Mook | publisher = BetaNews | accessdate = 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Windows Vista was criticised for being heavy and needing large amounts of power to run the desktop widgets and the Aero theme. Many people continued to use Windows XP for many years after, due to its stability and low processing needs.

On December 19, 2007, Microsoft signed a five year, $500 million contract with [[Viacom]] that included content sharing and advertisement. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on [[Xbox Live]] and [[MSN]]. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Also, Microsoft also purchased a large amount of advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks. Finally, Microsoft will also collaborate on promotions and sponsorships for [[MTV]] and [[BET]] award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184160.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=newstop&amp;tag=newstop;title;2 Viacom, Microsoft ink content, ad deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Microsoft wanted to purchase [[Yahoo]] (first completely, later partially) in order to strengthen its position on the search engine market vis-Ã -vis [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7451946.stm | work=BBC News | title=Yahoo-Google agree online ad deal | date=2008-06-13 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7407585.stm | work=BBC News | title=Microsoft mulls fresh Yahoo deal | date=2008-05-19 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company rejected the offer, saying that it undervalued the company. In response, Microsoft withdrew its offer.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;!-- need citation --&gt;

In 2009, the opening show of the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) was hosted by [[Steve Ballmer]] for the first time. In past years, it has been hosted by [[Bill Gates]]. In the show, Ballmer announced the first public Beta Test of [[Windows 7]] for partners and developers on January 8, but also for general public on January 10.

On June 26, 2009 Microsoft started taking pre-orders at a discounted price for Windows 7 which was launched on October 22, 2009. Windows 7 has several editions, which acknowledge the rise of netbook computers with reduced processing power.

On May 10, 2011, Microsoft Corp. acquired [[Microsoft_Skype_Division|Skype Communications, S.Ã  r.l]] for US $8.5 billion&lt;ref name=&quot;SkypeMicrosoftPressRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.skype.com/press/2011/05/microsoft_to_acquire_skype.html#more|title=Microsoft to acquire Skype|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
