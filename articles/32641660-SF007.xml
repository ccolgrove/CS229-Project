'''MIUI''' (pronounced &quot;Me You I&quot;, a play on the common abbreviation of the words [[user interface]] as UI)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLkT-8CWkM&lt;/ref&gt;, developed by [[Xiaomi Tech]], is an aftermarket firmware for cell phones based on the [[open-source]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[operating system]]. It features a heavily-modified user interface that does away with the Android app drawer and has drawn comparisons with Apple's iOS. &lt;ref&gt;http://lifehacker.com/5795542/miui-is-a-gorgeous-super-fast-rom-for-android&lt;/ref&gt; It includes additional functionality not found in stock Android, including toggles on the notification pull-down, new music, gallery,  and camera apps, and an altered phone dialer that displays matching contacts as a user enters a number. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.miui.com/a-24.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

MIUI is based on Android 2.3.7 and [[CyanogenMod]] 7.1 sources, and was initially developed in the Chinese language by Chinese startup [[Xiaomi]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://technode.com/2011/04/14/rumour-lei-jun%E2%80%99s-miui-android-rom-teams-up-with-guess-who/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/ref&gt; Xiaomi added a number of apps to enhance the basic framework; those include MITalk (a [[BlackBerry_Messenger|Blackberry Messenger]] clone), MINotes, MIBackup, MIMusic, and MIGallery.

Updates are usually provided over-the-air every Friday. MIUI is then translated and ported in unofficial versions to other languages by independent developers. The list of translations can be found on MIUI official site &lt;ref&gt;http://en.miui.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
MIUI is made up of two parts, MI and UI, where UI stands for [[User Interface]] and MI, as stated by Xiaomi CEO [[Lei Jun]], stands for Mobile Internet and Mission Impossible.

==Criticisms==
The modified operating system has been criticized for being similar to [[IOS_(Apple)|iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redmondpie.com/install-miui-gingerbread-custom-rom-on-google-nexus-s-4g-how-to-tutorial/&lt;/ref&gt; . Due to the fact that MIUI is developed in China, some features that are not relevant to the Chinese market, such as WiMax support, are unavailable on MIUI, and without access to the source code, it is not possible for 3rd parties to easily add this support.

==Xiaomi Phone==

Xiaomi released a smartphone, called the [[Xiaomi Phone]], which ships with MIUI pre-loaded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engadget.com/2011/08/16/xiaomi-m1-with-miui-os-a-310-phone-with-1-5ghz-dual-core-soc-a/&lt;/ref&gt;
