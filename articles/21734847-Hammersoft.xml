'''Canada-Norway relations''' are foreign relations between [[Canada]] and [[Norway]]. 

== History ==
The very first Europeans to reach North America were Norsemen, who made at least one major effort at settlement at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in Newfoundland around 1000 AD.  [[Snorri Thorfinnsson]] aka Snorri GuÃ°riÃ°sson, was the son of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] and his wife GuÄriÄ. He is thought to be the first European baby born in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/vikings.html Smithsonian Magazine | History &amp; Archaeology | The Vikings: A Memorable Visit to America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Little Norway]] was a [[Norwegian Army Air Service]]/[[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] training camp in Canada during [[World War II]]. Camp Norway in [[Lunenburg]], [[Nova Scotia]] was the naval training camp. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emb-norway.ca/News_and_events/norwaycanada/campnorway/norwegians/]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cold War, Canadian troops were stationed in Norway as part of the NATO alliance.  The [[Canadian Air-Sea Transportable Brigade Group]] was assigned to reinforce Norway in the case of a general war in Europe.
