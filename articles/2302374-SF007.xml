'''Liu E''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|å|é¶}}|s={{linktext|å|é¹}}|p=LiÃº Ã}}, 18 October [[1857 in literature|1857]] â 23 August [[1909 in literature|1909]]), [[Chinese style name|courtesy name]]/&quot;zÃ¬&quot;: &quot;'''Tieyun'''&quot; ('''T'ieh-yÃ¼n''') (éµé²), was a [[China|Chinese]] scholar, entrepreneur, and writer.

==Government and politics==
Liu was a native of Dantu (modern day [[Zhenjiang]]). In the government he worked with flood control, famine relief, and railroads. He became disillusioned with official ideas of reform and became a proponent of private economic development modeled after western systems. During the [[Boxer Uprising]] he speculated in government rice, distributing it to the poor. He was [[Cashiering|cashiered]] for these efforts, but shrewd investments had left him wealthy enough to follow his pioneering archaeological studies and to write fiction.

==Oracle bone archeology and scholarship==
He collected five thousand [[oracle bone]] fragments, published the first volume of examples and rubbings in 1903, and correctly identified thirty-four [[Oracle bone script|oracle bone script characters]].

==''The Travels of Lao Can''==
It was his economic ideas that inspired his literary work ''The Travels of Lao Can'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|è|æ®|æ¸¸|è®°}}|p={{linktext|LÇo| CÃ¡n| YÃ³u|jÃ¬}}}}, or using the [[Wade-Giles]] romanization: &quot;The Travels of Lao Ts'an&quot;) written in 1903-04&lt;ref name=masterworks&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=cUcHvd-KYUUC&amp;pg=PA299 Barbara Stoler Miller, Masterworks of Asian Literature in Comparative Perspective: A Guide for Teaching, published by M.E. Sharpe, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; and published in [[1907 in literature|1907]]. Thinly disguising his own views in those of the physician hero, Liu satirically describes (inaccurately){{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} the rise of the Boxers in the countryside , the decay of the Yellow River control system, and the hypocritical incompetence of the bureaucracy. The novel, a social satire that showed the limits of the old elite and officialdom, was an immediate success. The 1983 translation by [[Yang Xianyi]] and [[Gladys Yang]] omits major sections on the grounds that Liu could not have written them because they were superstitious.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Exile and death==
Liu was framed for malfeasance related to his work during the Boxer Rebellion and was exiled in 1908, dying within the next year in [[ÃrÃ¼mqi|Urumqi, Xinjiang]].
