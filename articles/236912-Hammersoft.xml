'''Bharat Ratna''' ({{lang-hi|à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤ à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¨}}, translates to ''Jewel of India''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mahajan|first=Vidya Dhar |title= The Constitution of India|year= 1971 |publisher= [[Eastern Book Company]]|location=[[Lucknow]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]|isbn= | page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Gem of India''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hoiberg|first=Dale|coauthors=Indu Ramchandani|title= Students' Britannica India|year= 2000 |publisher= EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (India)|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-85229-760-5 | pages=Vol. 3, p198 |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; in English) is the [[Republic of India]]'s highest [[civilian award]], awarded for the highest degrees of national service. This service includes artistic, literary, and scientific achievements, as well as &quot;recognition of public service of the highest order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pylee|first=Moolamattom Varkey |title= The Constitution of India|year= 1971 |publisher= S. Chand &amp; Company Ltd. |location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-219-2203-6 | page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[knighthood|knights]], holders of the Bharat Ratna carry no special title nor any other honorifics, but they do have a place in the [[Indian order of precedence]].

The award was established by the first [[President of India]], [[Rajendra Prasad]], on 2 January 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dhawan|first= S. K.|title= Bharat Ratnas, 1954â1991|year= 1991 |publisher= Wave Publications|location=|asin=B0006EYROK | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other major national honours, such as the [[Padma Vibhushan]], [[Padma Bhushan]] and [[Padma Shri]], the awarding of the Bharat Ratna was suspended from 13 July 1977 to 26 January 1980.

==History==
The order was established by [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[President of India]], on 2 January 1954. The original statutes of January 1954 did not make allowance for posthumous awards (and this perhaps explains why the decoration was never awarded to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), though this provision was added in the January 1955 statute. Subsequently, there have been twelve posthumous awards, including the award to [[Subhash Chandra Bose]] in 1992, which was later withdrawn due to a [[legal technicality]], the only case of an award being withdrawn. The award was briefly suspended from 13 July 1977 to 26 January 1980.

While there was no formal provision that recipients of the Bharat Ratna should be Indian citizens, this seems to have been the general assumption.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Of the 41 awards so far, there has been one award to a naturalised Indian citizen, [[Mother Teresa]] (1980), and to two non-Indians, [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] (1987) and [[Nelson Mandela]] (1990). The awarding of this honour has frequently been the subject of litigation questioning the constitutional basis of such.

Originally, the specifications for the award called for a circular gold medal carrying the state emblem and motto, among other things. It is uncertain if a design in accordance with the original specifications was ever made. The actual award is designed in the shape of a [[peepul]] leaf and carries with the words &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot;, inscribed in Devanagari script. The reverse side of the medal carries the state emblem and motto. The award is attached to a {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} ribbon, and was designed to be worn around the recipient's neck.

==Controversies==
===Award to Subhas Chandra Bose===
Indian freedom fighter [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose]] was awarded Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1992. The award was later withdrawn due to a legal technicality. This is the only case of an award being withdrawn. It was withdrawn in response to a [[Supreme Court of India]] directive following a Public Interest Litigation filed in the Court against the ''posthumous'' nature of the award. The Award Committee could not give conclusive evidence of Boseâs death and thus it invalidated the ''posthumous'' award.

===Award to Abul Kalam Azad===
When the award was offered to freedom fighter and India's first [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Minister of Education]], [[Abul Kalam Azad]], he promptly declined it saying that it should not be given to those who have been on the selection committee. Later he was awarded posthumously in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2714615.cms Those who said no to top awards] The Times of India, 20,Jan 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The original specifications for the award called for a circular gold medal, 35&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, with the sun and the Hindi legend &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot; above and a floral wreath below. The reverse was to carry the state emblem and motto. It was to be worn around the neck from a white ribbon. There is no indication that any specimens of this design were ever produced and one year later the design was altered.
