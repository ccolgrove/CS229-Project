The '''LanzhouâUrumqi High-Speed Railway''', also known as '''Lanxin Second Railway''', is a [[high-speed rail]] under construction in [[Northwest China|northwestern]] [[China]]. It will connect [[Lanzhou]] in [[Gansu|Gansu Province]] and [[ÃrÃ¼mqi]] in [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]].

Construction work began on November 4, 2009. The {{convert|1776|km|adj=on}} railway will take four years to complete, of which, {{convert|795|km}} is in [[Gansu]], {{convert|268|km}} in [[Qinghai]] and {{convert|713|km}} in [[Xinjiang]]. 31 [[train station|stations]] will be built along the line. The project costs 143.5&amp;nbsp;billion yuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/14562/10317457.html|title=å°æ°éè·¯ç¬¬äºåçº¿ä»æ¥å¨ä¹é²æ¨é½å¼å·¥|language=Chinese|date=November 4, 2009|accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its completion, an overnight sleeper train is expected to connect Beijing to Urumqi, 3,450 km apart, in less than 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://cq.qq.com/a/20091105/000648.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the existing [[Lanxin railway]], which runs entirely in Gansu and Xinjiang, the new high-speed rail will be routed from Lanzhou to [[Qinghai|Qinghai Province]] to [[Xining]] before heading northwest across the [[Qilian Mountains]] into the [[Hexi Corridor]] at [[Zhangye]]. The rail tracks in the section near Qilianshan Tunnel will be at 3,858 meters above sea level&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/dfpd/gansu/2010-10-01/content_954064.html&lt;/ref&gt;, making it the highest high-speed rail track in the world. Trains will run at 350&amp;nbsp;kilometres per hour on the line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/10/0220/14/5VVMOUR2000120GU.html å°æ°éè·¯ç¬¬äºåçº¿æ°çæ®µæ¥èæ½å·¥ç­ç«æå¤©]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tianshannet.com.cn/news/content/2010-12/12/content_5436119.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wind shed ==
{{seealso|List of wind-related railway accidents}}
Near [[Shanshan]], the railway will go through the ''hundred-[[Li (length)|li]] wind zone'', where desert wind constantly blows most days of a year. In 2007, strong wind overturned a train on the southern branch of Lanxin Railway, and four people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/China/200975.htm Strong Wind Derails Train, Killing 4]&lt;/ref&gt; A 67-kilometre long wind-protection gallery will be built in this region.
