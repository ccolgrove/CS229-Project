The show is produced by [[Endemol|Endemol Globo]] and presented by news reporter [[Pedro Bial]]. The season was officially confirmed since 2008 as part of a millionaire contract between international Endemol and Rede Globo. The prize award will be R$1,500,000 without tax allowances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/bigblog/posts/2010/03/29/no-bbb-11-bial-quer-sentir-doce-aroma-do-sucesso-278814.asp|title =No &quot;BBB 11&quot;, Bial quer &quot;sentir o doce aroma do sucesso|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress Maria Melillo won the competition and the grand prize of R$1,500,000, while runner-up Wesley Schunk and third place finisher Daniel Rolim walked away with R$150,000 and R$50,000 respectively.

==Production==
===Cast===

Applications were due by September 10, 2010 until October 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://noticias.r7.com/blogs/daniel-castro/2010/08/24/inscricoes-para-big-brother-11-comecam-em-10-de-setembro/|title =InscriÃ§Ãµes para Big Brother 11 comeÃ§am em 10 de setembro|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the process was set to start September 1, 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;N2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://g1.globo.com/pop-arte/noticia/2010/07/boninho-revela-que-bbb11-aceitara-inscricoes-partir-de-setembro.html|title =Boninho revela que BBB11 aceitarÃ¡ inscriÃ§Ãµes a partir de setembro|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;N3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/772400-bbb11-abre-inscricoes-em-setembro-diz-boninho-no-twitter.shtml|title =BBB11&quot; abre inscriÃ§Ãµes em setembro, diz Boninho no Twitter|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was postponed to avoid an eventual confusion with the premiere of the [[HipertensÃ£o (season 2)|second season]] of [[HipertensÃ£o]], another [[Rede Globo]] reality television show.

Semi-finalist interviews were held in November 2010 and the final casting interviews took place in early December 2010. There were nineteen housemates competing for the grand prize: ten women and nine men.&lt;ref name=&quot;N2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;N3&quot;/&gt; 

The first housemate, a woman, was officially chosen on October 10, 2010, but did not have their identity revealed. Producers reported that she was chosen in virtual chat, which happened at the show's official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =

===The House===

According to the producers, the Big Brother House passed by the biggest reform in history, with the entire structure being redesigned for the new season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sidneyrezende.com/noticia/79772+bbb+10+ja+estamos+preparando+a+planta+da+casa+do+bbb11+diz+boninho|title =BBB 10: &quot;JÃ¡ estamos preparando a planta da casa do &quot;BBB11&quot;, diz Boninho|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/zapping/767143-casa-do-bbb-11-sofrera-grande-reforma.shtml|title =Casa do &quot;BBB 11&quot; sofrerÃ¡ grande reforma|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Big Brother divided the housemates into four teams. Two of them (the Orange team and the Green team) enjoyed the luxury and comfort of the new mansion, which had two floors. The other two teams (the Red team and the Blue team) stayed in the other side, which lack beds, food and structure for any activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =

At the end of the week five, the teams dissolved, and the remaining twelve housemates were divided into two groups, one would live at the Rich House and the other would have to live at the Poor House.

==The Game==
===Saboteur===
Each week, one of the housemates is chosen by internet poll to be the Big Brother Saboteur. The saboteur had the goal to disrupt life in the House and cause as much havoc as possible. The production crew chooses the mission, and if the saboteur does it successfully, he/she will win R$10,000.

:&lt;small&gt;{{note|S1|Note S1}}: Diogo managed to lock the Poor House's door with a padlock but his identity was uncovered after he dropped its key in front of Cristiano.
&lt;/small&gt;

===Double Eviction Night===

The first round of nominations in the third week featured the second double eviction in Big Brother Brasil history, with a female and a male evictees leaving the House on day 20. Housemates Michelly and Rodrigo were both eliminated in a surprise eviction, after losing individual mas first implemented on the [[Big Brother Brasil 3|third season]] of the show. 

On day 43, Big Brother bosses have revealed that two of week 7's three nominated housemates would leave the house in another double eviction, which took place on day 50 in a regular eviction night. Diogo and Janaina, who received the highests percentages of the public vote (44% and 33% respectively) were both eliminated in a match against Paula. This concept is a first in the Brazilian series.

===Glass House===

On day 23, Big Brother brought back the Glass House (BBB Bubble), which first appeared in the [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth season]] of the show. This time, the house confined the first five evicted housemates (Ariadna, Mauricio, Rodrigo, Michelly and Igor) for a new shot to win the game. The public had to choose just one of the alumni to return to the program. Mauricio was elected and returned to the game on day 27.
