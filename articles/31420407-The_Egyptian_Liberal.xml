BenoÃ®t Challand, teaching Middle Eastern politics at the [[University of Bologna]], commented on the slogan in the following way:

{{Quote|The rendering of autonomy in Arabic illustrates my point as the term is translated as ''tasayyir daati'' {{sic}} â that is the &quot;self-impulse,&quot;  or &quot;self-drive.&quot; And indeed, once the initial spark was lit, it was as if the Tunisian people moved as a whole, into spontaneous protests. Egyptian, Libyan, and Yemeni people called for the fall of their respective regime. The slogan &quot;ash-shaâb yourid isqat al-nithaam&quot; [the people want the fall of the regime], appearing across the region, captures this social cohesion (the people) and the unity in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Challand |first=Benoit |url=http://www.deliberatelyconsidered.com/2011/03/the-counter-power-of-civil-society-in-the-middle-east-2/ |title=The Counter-Power of Civil Society in the Middle East |work=Deliberately Considered |date=2 March 2011|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rashid Khalidi]], the Edward Said professor of Arab studies at [[Columbia University]] and the editor of the ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]'', commented in the following manner:

{{Quote|It will largely be determined in these streets, as well as in the internet cafes, and in the union halls, newspaper offices, women's groups and private homes of millions of young Arabs who have served notice as publicly as possible that they will no longer tolerate being treated with the contempt and disrespect their governments have shown them for their entire lives. They have put us all on notice with their slogan: &quot;The people want the fall of the regime.&quot; They are not only referring to their corrupt governments; they also mean the old regime that has prevailed for decades in the entire Arab world, from the Atlantic to the Gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;rk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Khalidi |first=Rashid |url=http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/02/24/reflections_on_the_revolutions_in_tunisia_and_egypt |title=Reflections on the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt|date=24 February 2011|accessdate=13 April 2011 |publisher=The Middle East Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In post-Mubarak Egypt, given the fact that the military government only partially met the demands of the revolutionaries, with the dreaded state of emergency remaining in place, some protesters started using a somewhat different version of the slogan: ''The people want to bring down the field marshal'', referring to Field Marshal [[Mohamed Tantawi]], the Chairman of the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scorecard: Egypt's army and the revolution |author=Evan Hill |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/2011629124848564932.html |newspaper=[[Al-Jazeera English]] |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
