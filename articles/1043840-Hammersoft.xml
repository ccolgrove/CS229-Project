'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Denmark]] on 10 May 1988,&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; StÃ¶ver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p525 ISBN 9873832956097&lt;/ref&gt; just seven months after the [[Danish parliamentary election, 1987|last elections]]. Prime Minister [[Poul SchlÃ¼ter]] chose to call for an election after the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]]-led government fell short of a majority in a foreign policy issue after they failed to come to an agreement with the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]]. In a parliamentary debate Prime Minister Poul SchlÃ¼ter accused the leader of the Social Democrats, [[Svend Auken]], of breaking a political deal between the two of them, whilst Auken accused SchlÃ¼ter of lying to the public. 

However, the election did not change the balance of power in the Folketing. [[Common Course]] failed to cross the 2% percent threshold and lost their four seats. The [[Centre Democrats (Denmark)|Centre Democrats]] and the [[Christian People's Party (Denmark)|Christian People's Party]] left the government (although they continued to support it) and were replaced by the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]]. The reason for doing this was that it gave SchlÃ¼ter a majority in foreign policy issues, which had caused this election. The Centre Democrats and Christian People's Party continued to support the government though.

Voter turnout was 85.7% in Denmark proper, 70.3% in the [[Faroe Islands]] and 57.9% in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;Nohlen &amp; StÃ¶ver, p547&lt;/ref&gt;
