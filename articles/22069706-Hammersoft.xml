==History==
===The beginning===
This station was founded in October 1934 as '''KSLM''', a 100 [[watt]] day-time AM station broadcasting on 1370 [[kHz]] in [[Salem, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bc44&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=1944 Broadcasting-Telecasting Yearbook |year=1944 |page=144 |chapter=Directory of Standard Broadcasting Stations of the United States |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=End&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.archive.org/details/oregonendoftrail00writrich |title= Oregon: End of the Trail |author= [[Federal Writers' Project|Writers' Program]] of the [[Work Projects Administration]] in the [[Government of Oregon|State of Oregon]] |series= [[American Guide Series]] |year= 1940 |publisher= [[Binfords &amp; Mort]] |location= [[Portland, Oregon]] |page= 228|oclc= 4874569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owner Harry B.

In September 1937, KSLM was one of several [[Pacific Northwest]] area stations to join the [[Don Lee (broadcaster)|Mutual-Don Lee Broadcasting System]].  KSLM changed frequencies to 1360&amp;nbsp;kHz on April 28, 1939, which allowed for a power increase to 1,000 watts during the day and 500 watts at night.  In 1940, the nighttime signal was raised to match the daytime power at 1,000 watts.  On March 29, 1941, KSLM changed frequencies again, this time to the current 1390&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=&quot;orh&quot;/&gt;

[[File:KSLM-AM QSL card 1964.png|right|thumb|KSLM logo on a [[QSL card]] from August 1964]]
Harry B. Read sold KSLM license holder Oregon Radio, Inc., to automobile dealer Paul V. McElwain and partner Glenn E. McCormick for a reported sale price of $69,000 on March 1, 1944. At the time of the sale, it was still the only commercial radio station with Salem as its community of license.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc44&quot;/&gt; In May 1959, KSLM increased its daytime signal power to 5,000 watts and switched its network affiliation from Mutual to [[ABC News Radio|ABC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bc60&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=1960 Broadcasting Yearbook |year=1960 |page=A-214 |chapter=Directory of AM and FM Radio stations in the U.S. |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New ownership===
After more than four decades of continuous corporate ownership, Oregon Radio, Inc., sold KSLM to Holiday Radio, Inc., in October 1977 as part of a two-station deal valued at $684,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc79&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Broadcasting Yearbook 1979 |year=1979 |pages=C182-C183 |chapter=Directory of Radio Stations in the United States and Canada |publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ownership initially continued the [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music format that the station had been broadcasting for most of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc79&quot;/&gt; KSLM flipped to an [[adult contemporary]] music format in 1982.

In October 1985, Holiday Radio, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Ronette Communications Corporation along with its FM sister station for {{nowrap|$1.2 million}}.  The deal was approved by the FCC on December 6, 1985, and the transaction was consummated on February 20, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19851008ET) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=82434 |date=February 20, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of an internal corporate reorganization, Ronette Communications Corporation applied to the FCC to transfer the KSLM broadcast license to Ronette Communications of Oregon, Inc., in February 1986.  The transfer was approved by the FCC on February 11, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on July 17, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19860206EG) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=85604 |date=July 17, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1986 the station transitioned to an [[oldies music]] format.

Just over two years later, in March 1988, Daytona Group of Oregon, Inc., contracted to sell this station to John E. Grant's 1010 Broadcasting, Inc., for $215,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;orh&quot;/&gt;  The deal was approved by the FCC on July 15, 1988, and the transaction was consummated on July 26, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19880324EE) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=110610 |date=July 26, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1010 Broadcasting, Inc., agreed in February 1992 to sell this station to K-Salem Communications (Greg Fabos, owner) for $151,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;orh&quot;/&gt;  The deal was approved by the FCC on April 6, 1992, and the transaction was consummated on May 8, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19920226ED) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=171019 |date=May 8, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station began replacing live and local [[disc jockey]]s with programming from [[Satellite Music Network]]'s satellite-fed &quot;[[Kool Gold]]&quot; oldies format in February 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;orh&quot;/&gt;

===Trouble ahead===
In July 1994, K-Salem Communications reached an agreement to sell KSLM to Willamette Broadcasting Corp., Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on November 2, 1994, and the transaction was consummated on December 22, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19940715EB) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=200980 |date=December 22, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new owners had difficulty finding a new transmitter site for the station after the sale and the station was off the air from late 1995 until early 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;orh&quot;/&gt;

With the station back in operation, Willamette Broadcasting Corp., Inc., announced in September 1998 that it would sell this station to [[Entercom Communications]] subsidiary Entercom Portland License, LLC, for $605,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |title=Changing Hands |first=Alisa |last=Holmes |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53123288.html |date=October 19, 1998 |quote=KSLM(AM) Salem, Ore.

===Changing callsigns===
The station took on a [[sports radio]] format as a simulcast of [[Vancouver, Washington]], sister station KFXX (910 AM, now [[KKSN (AM)|KKSN]]), branded as &quot;The Fan&quot;, just after the sale to Entercom was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;epr1&quot;/&gt;  When 910 AM became oldies-formatted KKSN, KSLM maintained the simulcast and became an oldies station.  In January 2007, Entercom dropped KKSN's oldies format for [[talk radio]] as part of a pending sale to [[Salem Communications]] and KSLM began once again simulcasting sports radio [[KFXX (AM)|KFXX]], now at 1080 AM.&lt;ref name=&quot;fyb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Tower Site of the Week |title=The Big Trip 2006, Part III: Corvallis and Salem, OR |first=Scott |last=Fybush |url=http://www.fybush.com/sites/2007/site-070223.html |date=February 23, 2007 |quote=A quick note on KSLM: a few months after our visit, it took the KKSN calls when Entercom turned off the oldies and sold the 910 facility to Salem - the broadcaster, not the city.

The FCC changed the callsign to '''KKSN''', the call letters of its former sister station and simulcast partner, on February 12, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;  To better align it with Portland sister station [[KFXX (AM)|KFXX]] (1080 AM), the callsign was changed again on January 20, 2009, this time to '''KVXX'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;

On May 1, 2009, KVXX dropped its simulcast of KFXX to begin airing [[Spanish language]] [[ESPN Deportes]] programming in conjunction with [[sister station]] KTRO.&lt;ref name=&quot;ruf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;edr7&quot;/&gt; The station was assigned the current '''KWOD''' [[call sign]] by the FCC on May 29, 2009, after an Entercom-owned station in [[Sacramento, California]], switched to [[KBZC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;

On July 12, 2010, KWOD changed their format to [[English language]] sports radio, simulcasting [[sister station]] [[KFXX (AM)|KFXX]] (1080 AM, &quot;ESPN 1080, The Fan&quot;).

==Former on-air staff==
[[Peter Courtney]], a member of the [[Oregon Senate]], and since 2003 the President of the Senate, was once employed by KSLM as a [[pundit (expert)|political commentator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Oregon Blue Book |title=Members of the Oregon Senate |url=http://bluebook.state.or.us/state/legis/legis02.htm |accessdate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
