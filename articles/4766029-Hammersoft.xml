'''AMV''' is an [[Australia]]n [[television station]] licensed to, and serving the regions surrounding [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]] and [[Albury-Wodonga]] in south western [[New South Wales]] and north eastern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The station was, for many years, merged with [[CBN (Australian TV station)|RVN-2]] as ''the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service''.

==History==
===Origins===

AMV-4 commenced broadcasting on 7 September 1964.[http://www.austvhistory.com/prime/preaggregation.htm#vic www.austvhistory.com] It broadcast programming from the three commercial stations in Sydney ([[ATN-7]], [[TCN-9]] and [[TEN-10]]) alongside local programing including coverage of the Albury Gold Cup, the Ovens &amp; Murray Grand Final and the 1988 Miss Australia pageant. The station has continuously produced a half-hour regional news program on weeknights, currently known as ''[[Prime Television#News|Prime News]]''.

===Prior to going on air===
When the commercial television license for the [[Riverina]] area was being determined, a number of local groups submitted proposals. [[Young, New South Wales|Young]]-based radio station [[2LF]], along with local councils and businesses in the Young-[[Cootamundra]] area, [[Wagga Wagga]] newspaper ''[[The Daily Advertiser (Wagga Wagga)|The Daily Advertiser]]'' and radio station [[2WG]], together with local Wagga Wagga businessmen, as well as a group of smaller newspapers and some licensed clubs.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

2LF's proposal later joined forces with the Advertiser/2WG bid - 2LF would get 10% of the shares, 2WG got 20% and The Advertiser got 15%, with the remaining shares to be offered to local people. After issues at the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board|Australian Broadcasting Control Board (ABCB)]] enquiry for the license, the 2LF/2WG/Advertiser group (trading as Riverina Television) won the license.

The initial board was made up representatives from 2WG, 2LF, The Daily Advertiser, and two local councils. A few days after the license was announced, the chairman and station manager had a disagreement, resulting in the resignation of both. They were replaced by Wal Hucker, who ran a film animation and sound company in Sydney, and was also the former chairman's brother-in-law.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} The former chairman's wife also joined the board, as the Control Board made it clear that 2WG had to remain involved in the station. Bill Marsden, of 2LF, became the station manager.

A disagreement with Wagga Wagga council over the location of a potential studio site, which would have provided direct line of sight transmission to the [[Mount Ulandra]] transmitter, saw a new site rezoned from residential areas.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

As with most stations launching at that time, the mast would be shared with the local transmitter of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], but not the transmitting facilities, as chief engineer Stuart McDonald wanted to operate the facilities remotely. RVN would be first station to operate their transmitters in this way. The studios were completed in early 1964.

===Early broadcasting===
AMV-4 Albury opened transmission for the first time at 5:00pm on 19 June 1964. The opening night's programming included an announcement from the area's then local Federal Member, footage of the station's construction, an episode of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and the feature film, ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dambusters]]''. The station closed down for the night at 10:00pm

As with most stations at the time, news was done by announcing over slides, or read to the camera, combined with the previous night's news film from [[ATN-7]] [[Sydney]]. Local programming, including commercials, was broadcast live. RVN was the only station to have made a profit, albeit a small one, in its first year of operation.

===RVN-AMV===
By the early 1970s, many regional stations faced financial difficulties, and as a result RVN and AMV merged to form the Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty. Ltd., in 1971. The stations were known on-air as ''RVN-AMV''. Both stations were programmed separately, until 1976 when transmission for both stations was centralized in Wagga Wagga.

In 1983, the stations faced a unique situation when New South Wales and Victoria ended [[daylight saving]] periods at different times. For three weeks, RVN's output was shown on AMV on a one hour delay. It was also unusual in thatit served audiences in two states, and had to program accordingly. New South Welsh viewers received Sydney news and sports, primarily [[rugby league]], while viewers in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were shown [[Melbourne]] news and sports (mainly [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]]).

By the mid 1980s, 80 people were employed at Wagga, and a further 40 in Albury. RVN-AMV was purchased by [[Paul Ramsay]]'s Ramcorp Ltd. in 1987, and merged with the [[CBN (Australian TV station)|Midstate Television 6-8-9]] network, forming ''The Prime Network''. RVN and AMV split up in 1989, when Southern [[New South Wales]] was aggregated - RVN joined with [[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN]], as the [[Seven Network]] affiliate in the area in competition with [[CTC (TV station)|Ten Capital]] and [[WIN-4|WIN Television]].{{Fact|date=September 2007}} AMV, meanwhile expanded into the rest of Victoria as the state's [[Seven Network]] affiliate, in competition with [[VTV (TV station)|Vic TV]] and [[GLV/BCV|Southern Cross]].

RVN's callsign ceased to exist in 1991, when the [[Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga]] and [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] licenses were merged to become only CBN.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} At the same time, AMV moved from [[VHF]] channel 4 to VHF channel 11, in order to allow [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations to be established without interference from existing television stations (using VHF channels 3, 4, 5 and 5A).

== Prime7 News ==

AMV produces and broadcasts a live 30-minute ''Prime7 News'' bulletin for the region, each weeknight at 6:00pm.

''Prime7 News Albury'' is presented by Daniel Gibson.

In the Ballarat, Bendigo and Gippsland regional markets, short two-minute updates are presented on a rotating basis by Natalie Forrest and Renee Bogatko with weather forecasts from Daniel Gibson and Madelaine Collingnon.
