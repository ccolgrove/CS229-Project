<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3350464" ns="0" title="Divalent"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">In chemistry, a '''divalent''' ion or molecule has a [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] of two and thus can form two bonds with other ions or molecules. An older term for divalent is '''bivalent'''.&lt;ref name=freedictionary&gt;The Free Dictionary: [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Valence ''valence'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Divalent [[anions]]''' are atoms or radicals with two additional [[electrons]] when compared to their elemental state (that is, with 2 more electrons than [[protons]]). For instance, S&lt;sup&gt;2â&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[sulfide]] anion.

A '''divalent [[cation]]''' is missing two electrons as compared with the neutral atom. For instance, [[iron(II)]] or Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the divalent cationic form of iron. Divalent cations are present in abundance in [[hard water]], for example, [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). These ionic minerals in solution are what contribute to the properties of water which cause it to be hard, such as the formation of [[limescale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;&gt;World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/en/hardness.pdf Hardness in Drinking-Water], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
