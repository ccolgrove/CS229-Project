Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation ([[Sony Electronics]] in the U.S.), [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], [[Sony Ericsson]], and [[Sony Financial]]. As a semiconductor maker, Sony is among the [[Semiconductor sales leaders by year|Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Sales Leaders]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Sony Group'''|ã½ãã¼ã»ã°ã«ã¼ã|SonÄ« GurÅ«pu}} is a Japan-based [[Business group|corporate group]] primarily focused on the Electronics (such as AV/IT products &amp; components), Game (such as PlayStation), Entertainment (such as motion pictures and music), and Financial Services (such as insurance and banking) sectors. The group consists of Sony Corporation (holding &amp; electronics), [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] (game), [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (motion pictures), [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (music), [[Sony Financial Holdings]] (financial services) and [[Sony Corporation shareholders and subsidiaries|others]]. 

Its founders [[Akio Morita]] and [[Masaru Ibuka]] derived the name from ''[[wikt:sonus|sonus]]'', the [[Latin]] word for sound, and also from the English slang word &quot;sonny&quot;, since they considered themselves to be &quot;sonny boys&quot;, a [[loan word]] into Japanese which in the early 1950s connoted smart and presentable young men.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonyHistory&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tobei.gif|thumb|left|[[Masaru Ibuka]], the co-founder of Sony]]
In late 1945, after the end of [[World War II]], [[Masaru Ibuka]] started a radio repair shop in a bomb-damaged department store [[Shirokiya]] building in [[Nihonbashi]] of Tokyo. The next year, he was joined by his colleague, Akio Morita, and they founded a company called ''Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo K.K.'',&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-1/h2.html|title=Sony Global&amp;nbsp;â Sony History|accessdate=16 February 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061128064313/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-1/h2.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). The company built Japan's first [[tape recorder]], called the Type-G.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;
In the early 1950s, Ibuka traveled in the United States and heard about [[Bell Labs]]' invention of the [[transistor]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt; He convinced Bell to license the transistor technology to his Japanese company. While most American companies were researching the transistor for its military applications, Ibuka and Morita looked to apply it to communications. Although the American companies [[Regency TR-1|Regency Electronics]] and [[Texas Instruments]] built the first transistor radio as joint venture, it was Ibuka's company that made them commercially successful for the first time.'''

In August 1955, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo released the Sony [[TR-55]], Japan's first commercially produced [[transistor radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-b.html|title=Sony Global&amp;nbsp;â Product &amp; Technology Milestones-Radio|accessdate=16 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They followed up in December of the same year by releasing the Sony TR-72, a product that won favor both within Japan and in export markets, including Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and Germany. Featuring six transistors, push-pull output and greatly improved sound quality, the TR-72 continued to be a popular seller into the early sixties.'''

In May 1956, the company released the TR-6, which featured an innovative slim design and sound quality capable of rivaling portable tube radios. It was for the TR-6 that Sony first contracted &quot;Atchan&quot;, a cartoon character created by Fuyuhiko Okabe, to become its [[advertising character]]. Now known as &quot;Sony Boy&quot;, the character first appeared in a cartoon ad holding a TR-6 to his ear, but went on to represent the company in ads for a variety of products well into the mid-sixties.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The following year, 1957, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo came out with the TR-63 model, then the smallest (112 Ã 71 Ã 32&amp;nbsp;mm) transistor radio in commercial production. It was a worldwide commercial success.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

[[University of Arizona]] professor Michael Brian Schiffer, PhD, says, &quot;Sony was not first, but its transistor radio was the most successful. The TR-63 of 1957 cracked open the U.S. market and launched the new industry of consumer microelectronics.&quot; By the mid 1950s, American teens had begun buying portable transistor radios in huge numbers, helping to propel the fledgling industry from an estimated 100,000 units in 1955 to 5,000,000 units by the end of 1968.

=== Origin of name ===
When Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo was looking for a romanized name to use to market themselves, they strongly considered using their initials, TTK. The primary reason they did not is that the railway company [[Tokyu Corporation|Tokyo Kyuko]] was known as TKK.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The company occasionally used the acronym &quot;Totsuko&quot; in Japan, but during his visit to the United States, Morita discovered that Americans had trouble pronouncing that name. Another early name that was tried out for a while was &quot;Tokyo Teletech&quot; until Morita discovered that there was an American company already using Teletech as a brand name.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Made in Japan (biography)|Made in Japan]]'' â Akio Morita and Sony (pg. 76) by Akio Morita with [mÃ¼zik indir][http://www.indiristan.net/ mÃ¼zik indir] Edwin M. Rheingold and Mitsuko Shimomura, Signet Books, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Sony&quot; was chosen for the brand as a mix of two words. One was the [[Latin]] word &quot;''Sonus''&quot;, which is the root of sonic and sound, and the other was &quot;''Sonny''&quot;, a familiar term used in 1950s America to call a boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonyHistory&quot;/&gt; The first Sony-branded product, the TR-55 transistor radio, appeared in 1955 but the company name did not change to Sony until January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.co.uk/article/id/1060176719725 Sony.co.uk. About Sony. '&amp;#39;The History of the Sony Corporation'&amp;#39;]. Sony.co.uk. Retrieved on 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the change, it was extremely unusual for a Japanese company to use [[Romanization of Japanese|Roman letters]] to spell its name instead of writing it in [[kanji]]. The move was not without opposition: TTK's principal bank at the time, [[Mitsui]], had strong feelings about the name. They pushed for a name such as Sony Electronic Industries, or Sony Teletech. Akio Morita was firm, however, as he did not want the company name tied to any particular industry. Eventually, both Ibuka and Mitsui Bank's chairman gave their approval.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

== Formats and technologies ==
{{See|List of Sony trademarks}}

Sony has historically been notable for creating its own in-house standards for new recording and storage technologies, instead of adopting those of other manufacturers and standards bodies. The most infamous of these was the [[videotape format war]] of the early 1980s, when Sony marketed the [[Betamax]] system for video cassette recorders against the VHS format developed by [[JVC]]. In the end, VHS gained critical mass in the marketbase and became the worldwide standard for consumer VCRs and Sony adopted the format. While Betamax is for all practical purposes an obsolete format, a professional-oriented [[component video]] format called [[Betacam]] that was derived from Betamax is still used today, especially in the television industry, although far less so in recent years with the introduction of digital and high definition.

In 1968 Sony introduced the [[Trinitron]] [[brand|brand name]] for its lines of [[aperture grille]] [[cathode ray tube]] televisions and (later) [[Visual display unit|computer monitors]]. Trinitron displays are still produced, but only for markets such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. Sony discontinued the last Trinitron-based television set in the USA in early 2007. Trinitron computer monitors were discontinued in 2005.

Sony launched the [[Betamax]] [[videocassette recorder|videocassette recording]] format in 1975. In 1979 the [[Walkman]] brand was introduced, in the form of the world's first portable music player.

1982 saw the launch of Sony's professional [[Betacam]] videotape format and the collaborative Compact Disc (CD) format. In 1983 Sony introduced 90&amp;nbsp;mm micro diskettes (better known as {{convert|3.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[floppy disk]]s), which it had developed at a time when there were 4&quot; floppy disks and a lot of variations from different companies to replace the then on-going 5.25&quot; floppy disks. Sony had great success and the format became dominant; 3.5&quot; floppy disks gradually became obsolete as they were replaced by current media formats. In 1983 Sony launched the [[MSX]], a home computer system, and introduced the world (with their counterpart [[Philips]]) to the Compact Disc (CD). In 1984 Sony launched the [[Discman]] series which extended their Walkman brand to portable CD products. In 1985 Sony launched their Handycam products and the [[8 mm video format|Video8 format]]. Video8 and the follow-on hi-band [[8 mm video format|Hi8]] format became popular in the consumer camcorder market. In 1987 Sony launched the 4&amp;nbsp;mm DAT or [[Digital Audio Tape]] as a new digital audio tape standard.

In addition to developing consumer-based recording media, after the launch of the CD Sony began development of commercially based recording media. In 1986 they launched Write-Once [[optical disc]]s (WO) and in 1988 launched [[Magneto-optical drive|Magneto-optical disc]]s which were around 125MB size for the specific use of archival data storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-21/h4.html| title = Sony History on development of Magneto Optical Discs| accessdate =6 February 2007| year = 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061224013537/http://www.sony.net/Fun/SH/1-21/h4.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 24 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s two high-density optical storage standards were being developed: one was the MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), backed by Philips and Sony, and the other was the Super Density disc (SD), supported by [[Toshiba]] and many others. Philips and Sony abandoned their MMCD format and agreed upon Toshiba's SD format with only one modification based on MMCD technology, viz [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFMPlus]]. The unified disc format was called DVD which was marketed in 1997.

Sony introduced the [[MiniDisc]] format in 1993 as an alternative to Philips DCC or [[Digital Compact Cassette]]. Since the introduction of MiniDisc, Sony has attempted to promote its own audio compression technologies under the [[Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding|ATRAC]] brand, against the more widely used MP3. Until late 2004, Sony's [[Walkman#Network Walkman|Network Walkman]] line of digital portable music players did not support the MP3 de facto standard natively, although the provided software [[SonicStage]] would convert MP3 files into the ATRAC or ATRAC3 formats.

In 1993, Sony challenged the industry standard [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 surround sound format with a newer and more advanced proprietary motion picture digital audio format called [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound). This format employed eight channels (7.1) of audio opposed to just six used in Dolby Digital 5.1 at the time. Unlike Dolby Digital, SDDS utilized a method of backup by having mirrored arrays of bits on both sides of the film which acted as a measure of reliability in case the film was partially damaged. Ultimately, SDDS has been vastly overshadowed by the preferred DTS ([[DTS (sound system)|Digital Theatre System]]) and Dolby Digital standards in the motion picture industry. SDDS was solely developed for use in the theatre circuit; Sony never intended to develop a home theatre version of SDDS.

In 1998, Sony launched their [[Memory Stick]] format; [[flash memory]] cards for use in Sony lines of digital cameras and portable music players. It has seen little support outside of Sony's own products with [[Secure Digital card]]s (SD) commanding considerably greater popularity. This is due in part to the SD format's greater throughput (which allows faster recording and access), higher capacities, and significantly lower price per unit capacity compared to Memory Sticks available at the same time. Sony has made updates to the Memory Stick format with [[Memory Stick#Memory Stick Duo and PRO Duo|Memory Stick Duo]] and [[Memory Stick Micro]].

Sony and Philips jointly developed the Sony-Philips digital interface format ([[S/PDIF]]) and the high-fidelity audio system [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]. The latter has since been entrenched in a format war with [[DVD-Audio]]. At present, neither has gained a major foothold with the general public. CDs are preferred by consumers because of ubiquitous presence of CD drives in consumer devices.

In 2004, Sony built upon the [[MiniDisc]] format by releasing [[HiMD|Hi-MD]]. Hi-MD allows the playback and recording of audio on newly-introduced 1 GB Hi-MD discs in addition to playback and recording on regular MiniDiscs. Recordings on the Hi-MD Walkmans can be transferred to and from the computer virtually unrestricted, unlike earlier [[MiniDisc#NetMD|NetMD]]. In addition to saving audio on the discs, Hi-MD allows the storage of computer files such as documents, videos and photos. Hi-MD introduced the ability to record CD-quality audio with a linear PCM recording feature. It was the first time since MiniDisc's introduction in 1992 that the [[Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding|ATRAC]] [[codec]] could be bypassed and lossless CD-quality audio could be recorded on the small discs.

Sony was one of the leading developers and remains one of the strongest proponents of the [[Blu-ray Disc]] optical disc format, which eventually emerged as the market leader over the competing standard, Toshiba's [[HD DVD]], after a 2 year-long format war. The first Blu-ray players became commercially available in June 2006, and Sony's first Blu-ray player, the [[Sony BDP-S1]], debuted in December 2006 with an MSRP of US $999.95. By the end of 2007 the format had the backing of every major motion picture studio except [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], and [[DreamWorks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2007/08/22/paramount_drops_bluray_michael_bay_drops_paramount.html| title = Paramount drops Blu-ray, Michael Bay drops Paramount| accessdate =22 August 2007| work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Keith | last=Stuart | date=22 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/20/AR2007082000687.html| title = Paramount to Drop Blu-Ray High-Def DVDs| accessdate =20 August 2007| work=The Washington Post | first=Alex | last=Veiga | date=20 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2007/08/highdefinition_disc_disarray_c.html| title = High-Definition Disc Disarray (Cont'd.)| accessdate =22 August 2007 | year = 2007 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray format's popularity continued to increase, solidifying its position as the dominant HD media format, and Toshiba announced its decision to stop supporting HD DVD on 19 February 2008.

Over the years, Sony has introduced these standards:
* [[Umatic]] (~1968)
* [[Betamax]] (1975)
* [[Betacam]] (1981)
* Compact Disc with [[Philips]] (1982)

[[File:PS2-slim-console.png|thumb|left|The [[PlayStation 2#Slimline|Slimline PlayStation 2 with controller]]]]

In late 1994 Sony launched the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] to compete with other consoles. This successful console was succeeded by the [[PlayStation 2]] in 2000. The PlayStation 2 has become the most successful video game console of all time, selling over 150 million units as of 2011. The PlayStation brand was extended to the portable games market in 2005 by the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP). Sony developed the [[Universal Media Disc]] (UMD) optical disc medium for use on the PlayStation Portable. Although Sony tried to push the UMD format for movies, major-studio support for the format was cut back in spring 2006, though as of 2009 some major-studio titles continue to be released on UMD.

Sony released the [[PlayStation 3]], a high-definition console, in 2006. It later introduced the [[PlayStation Move]], an accessory that allows players to control video games using motion controllers. Sony announced that on 1 April 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/28/ps3-firmware-v3-21-update/#commentform '&amp;#39;Official PS3 Firmware_v3.21 Update:'&amp;#39;].

Sony admitted in late 2005 to hiring [[graffiti]] artists to spray paint advertisements for their [[PlayStation Portable]] game system in seven major cities including New York City, [[Philadelphia]], San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4567236.stm Graffiti ads spark debate in US]. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sydney, Australia. The mayor of Philadelphia filed a [[cease and desist]] order. According to Sony, they paid businesses and building owners for the right to graffiti their walls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,69741,00.html Wired News]. Wired.com. Retrieved on 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of early January 2006, Sony had no plans to keep or withdraw them.

In November 2006, a marketing company employed by Sony created a website entitled &quot;All I want for Xmas is a PSP&quot;, designed to promote the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] through [[viral marketing]]. The site contained a blog, which was purportedly written by &quot;Charlie&quot;, a teenager attempting to get his friend &quot;Jeremy&quot;'s parents to buy him a PSP, providing links to t-shirt iron-ons, Christmas cards, and a &quot;music video&quot; of either Charlie or Jeremy &quot;rapping&quot;. However, visitors to the website soon discovered that the website was registered to a marketing company, exposing the site on sites such as YouTube and [[digg]], and Sony was forced to admit the site's true origin in a post on the blog, stating that they would from then on &quot;stick to making cool products&quot; and that they would use the website for &quot;the facts on the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]&quot;. The site has since been taken down. In an interview with next-gen.biz, Sony admitted that the idea was &quot;poorly executed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony: PSP Viral Campaign 'Poorly Executed' |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/sony-psp-viral-campaign-poorly-executed|publisher=next-gen.biz/ |date=13 December 2006 |accessdate=20 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Sony Computer Entertainment America, marketer of the popular [[PlayStation]] game consoles, was sued by [[Immersion Corporation]] of [[San Jose, California]] which claimed that Sony's PlayStation &quot;Dual Shock&quot; controllers infringed on Immersion's patents. In 2004, a federal jury agreed with Immersion, awarding the company US$82&amp;nbsp;million in damages. A U.S. district court judge ruled on the matter in March 2005 and not only agreed with the federal jury's ruling but also added another US$8.7&amp;nbsp;million in damages.

====Laptop batteries dysfunction====
In April 2006, a Sony laptop battery exploded in Japan and caught fire. A Japanese couple in Tokyo sued both Sony and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Japan for over Â¥2&amp;nbsp;million (US$16,700) regarding the incident. The suit argues that the man suffered burns on his finger when the battery burst into flames while being used, and his wife had to be treated for mental distress due to the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engadget 2007-7-25&quot;&gt;{{citenews|title=Japanese couple sues Sony and Apple over burning battery|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/25/japanese-couple-sues-sony-and-apple-over-burning-battery/|publisher=Engadget|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2006, Sony and [[Dell]] admitted to major flaws in several Sony [[Lithium-ion battery|batteries]] that could result in the battery overheating and catching fire. As a result they recalled over 4.1&amp;nbsp;million laptop batteries in the largest computer-related recall to that point in history. The cost of this recall was shared between Dell and Sony. Dell also confirmed that one of its laptops caught fire in Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dell Details on Notebook Battery Recall |url=http://www.direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/08/14/1803.aspx |publisher=Direct2Dell |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060820160832/http://www.direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/08/14/1803.aspx |archivedate = 20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dell announces recall of 4.1&amp;nbsp;million laptop batteries |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/08/14/dell-recall.html |publisher=CBC News |date=14 August 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recall also prompted Japan's [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] to order the companies to investigate the troubles with the batteries.

===Sony Pictures Entertainment===
In July 2000, a marketing executive working for Sony Corporation created a fictitious film critic, [[David Manning (fictitious writer)|David Manning]], who gave consistently good reviews for releases from Sony subsidiary [[Columbia Pictures]] that generally received poor reviews amongst real critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;critic&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3524759.stm |publisher=BBC News  | title = Legal fight over fake film critic |date= 2 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the scandal was revealed, Sony apologised to Ridgefield Press, the newspaper Manning was claimed to be from. Sony claimed it was unaware of the marketing ploy, and pulled the ads and suspended Manning's creator and his supervisor. In 2003, Sony paid the state of Connecticut $325,000 in fines following the Connecticut Attorney General's investigation into Sony's alleged fraudulent marketing practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/09/phony.critic/index.html | publisher=Cable News Network | title=Moviegoers to settle with studio after being lured by phony critic | author=Emanuella Grinberg | date=9 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, Sony finalized a settlement to pay $1.5m to fans who saw the reviewed films in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4741259.stm | title=Sony pays $1.5m over fake critic | date=3 August 2005 |publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Sony started using [[ARccOS Protection]] on some of their film DVDs, which caused compatibility problems with some DVD players â including models manufactured by Sony. After complaints, Sony was forced to issue a recall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070418-sony-to-replace-incompatible-dvds.html Sony admits, fixes problem with DVD DRM]. Arstechnica.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sony BMG===
{{Main|Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal}}
In October 2005, it was revealed by [[Mark Russinovich]] of [[Winternals|Sysinternals]] that [[Sony BMG]]'s music CDs had installed a [[rootkit]] on the user's computer as a [[digital rights management|DRM]] measure (called [[Extended Copy Protection]] by its creator, British company [[Fortium Technologies|First 4 Internet]]), which was difficult to detect or remove.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/ Sony BMG Litigation Info]. EFF.org. Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutes a crime in many countries, and poses a major security risk to affected users. The uninstaller Sony initially provided removed the rootkit, but in turn installed a [[phoning home|dial-home]] program that posed an even greater security risk. Sony eventually provided an actual uninstaller that removed all of Sony's DRM program from the user's computer. Sony BMG faced several class action lawsuits regarding this matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Sony faces class action lawsuits for DRM|Sony faces class action lawsuits for DRM]]. Wikinews.
&lt;/ref&gt;
On 31 January 2007, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a [http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2007/01/sony.htm news release] announcing that Sony BMG had agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that Sony BMG committed several offenses against United States federal law. This settlement required that Sony BMG allow consumers to exchange the CDs through 30 June 2007, and to reimburse consumers for up to $150 for the repair of damage to their computers that they may have incurred while removing the software.

In September 2009 Sony had its Mexican office raided by police to recover over 6000 CDs, masters and artwork, by the popular Latin American artist [[Alejandro FernÃ¡ndez]]. FernÃ¡ndez's lawyers claimed that Sony was in breach of contract as FernÃ¡ndez had been contracted to Sony for seven albums and the recordings were an eighth album made after the contract had expired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/sony-music-office-raided-090907/ Pirated Artist Orders Police Raid on Sony Music Office].

===Digital photography===
Sony offers a range of digital cameras, ranging from point-and-shoot models to digital SLRs.

Initially, in October 2005, it was reported by Sony that there were problems with the [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) in 20 models of digital still cameras. The problems can prevent the cameras from taking clear pictures, and in some cases, possibly prevent a picture being taken at all. In late November 2006, the recall was broadened to eight additional models of digital cameras sold between 2003 and 2005. The problem appears to manifest itself mostly when the camera is used in areas with hot weather. The eight models affected are the following: DSC-F88, DSC-M1, DSC-T1, DSC-T11, DSC-T3, DSC-T33, DSC-U40 and DSC-U50. Sony indicated that they would repair or replace the affected camera at no charge. Since Sony is one of the largest producers of CCD chips, this recall may affect other manufacturers and models of cameras, possibly as many as 100 models or more. Other manufacturers of digital cameras, including Canon, Minolta, Nikon, Olympus or Fuji have indicated they will replace faulty CCDs in their respective models of cameras if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=mobile_wireless&amp;articleId=9005380&amp;taxonomyId=15 Sony finds CCD problem with some of its digital cameras].

=== Finance and Revenue ===
In May 2011, Sony expected to lose a total of 260&amp;nbsp;billion yen ($3.2&amp;nbsp;billion) for the year, due to the effects of the Japanese earthquake.

In November 2011, Sony was ranked 9th (jointly with Panasonic) in Greenpeaceâs re-launched Guide to Greener Electronics that assesses the policies and practices to reduce climate impact, produce greener products, and make operations more sustainable of 18 leading electronics manufacturers. The company scored 3.6/10, incurring a penalty point for comments it has made in opposition to energy efficiency standards in California. It also risks a further penalty point in future editions for being a member of trade associations that have commented against energy efficiency standards. &lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics | Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Together with [[Phillips]], Sony receives the highest score for energy policy advocacy after calling on the EU to adopt an unconditional 30% reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Meanwhile, it receives full marks for the efficiency of its products; all of its TVs meet or exceed the latest Energy Star standards. However, Sony scores no points on its paper policy, risking another penalty point in future editions, as it is listed as a client of Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a company associated with illegal logging and deforestation in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;/&gt; 

Sony publishes on its website a list of products, for which the company had (as of February 2010) or intended to replace PVC and BFR with alternative substances by the end of FY 2010 (April 2011), nevertheless as of January 2011 the list does not identify which products are fulfilling these criteria at the moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/csr/environment/chemical/products/index.html#hyo |title=Sony Global â Management of Chemical Substances in Products | publisher=Sony |accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism and controversy ===
In 2000, Sony was ridiculed for a document entitled &quot;NGO Strategy&quot; that was leaked to the press. The document involved the company's surveillance of environmental activists in an attempt to plan how to counter their movements. It specifically mentioned environmental groups that were trying to pass laws that held electronics-producing companies responsible for the clean up of the toxic chemicals contained in their merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knight|first=Danielle|title=Sony's PR War on Activists|url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2000/09/sonys-pr-war-activists|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=22 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early July 2007, Sony ranked 14th on the [[Greenpeace]] chart &quot;Guide to Greener Electronics.&quot; This chart graded major electronics companies on their environmental work.
