The '''foreign relations of South Sudan''' are the relations between the [[South Sudan|Republic of South Sudan]] and [[sovereign state]]s and international organisations. The establishment of the relationships followed the formation of the South Sudanese state on 9 July 2011. [[Sudan]] became the first state in the world to recognise South Sudan.

==Foreign policy==
In the immediate aftermath of the country's independence, South Sudan's foreign policy prerogative was seen as a challenge in the quest to balance relations between the [[West]], other [[Africa]]n states and the [[Arab world|Arab states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-07/11/c_13976792.htm |title=News analysis: South Sudan needs equation on external relations to satisfy all parties |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2011-07-11 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, South Sudan has sought to shed its reliance on North Sudan, reportedly planning to introduce the [[Swahili language]] and orient itself toward [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coastweek.com/kenxin_110805_04.htm|agency=Coastweek|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011|title=South Sudanese still in Kenya despite new state}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecitizen.co.tz/news/55-east-african-news/12784-south-sudan-free-to-join-the-eac.html|agency=The Citizen|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=12 July 2011|title=South Sudan 'free to join the EAC'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Corporate+News/RVR+targets+planned+Uganda+Sudan+railway+line/-/539550/1213656/-/n67o0bz/-/|agency=Business Daily|title=RVR targets planned Uganda-Sudan railway line|first=Allan|last=Odhiambo|date=5 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology of relations==
Many states have recognised South Sudan upon independence, or announced planning to do so. Sudan was the first to do so on 8 July 2011, 1 day prior to independence. Four other states followed suit on 8 July. Over 25 countries had recognised the country on 9 July, including all permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;france&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/ledirect/755873/france-reconnait-sud-soudan |title=La France reconnaÃ®t le Sud-Soudan |accessdate=9 July 2011 |publisher=20 Minutes |author=Reuters |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite web|title=South Sudan: The birth of a nation|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=628419182|date=9 July 2011|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kremlin1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ÐÐ¾Ð·Ð´ÑÐ°Ð²Ð¸ÑÐµÐ»ÑÐ½Ð¾Ðµ Ð¿Ð¾ÑÐ»Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ðµ ÐÑÐµÐ·Ð¸Ð´ÐµÐ½ÑÑ Ð ÐµÑÐ¿ÑÐ±Ð»Ð¸ÐºÐ¸ Ð®Ð¶Ð½ÑÐ¹ Ð¡ÑÐ´Ð°Ð½ Ð¡Ð°Ð»ÑÐ²Ð°ÑÐ¾ÑÐµ ÐÐ¸Ð¸ÑÑ ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ´Ð¸ÑÑ|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/news/11882|date=9 July 2011|publisher=[[President of Russia]]|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United States&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2011/07/20110709070453tegdirb0.1807454.html?CP.rss=true#axzz1RblFU2Ag |title=Obama on U.S. Recognition of South Sudanâs Independence &amp;#124; IIP Digital |publisher=Iipdigital.usembassy.gov |date= |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=China&gt;{{cite web|title=China recognizes independence of South Sudan|url=http://www1.chinadaily.com.cn/china/9 July 2011/content_12869896.htm|date=9 July 2011|publisher=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2011, President [[Salva Kiir]] told the Speaker of the [[East African Legislative Assembly]] that he hoped the EAC will consider expediting South Sudan's accession to the supranational organisation.

Relations between the two states commenced with Israel's recognition of South Sudan a day after its independence&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/10/us-israel-sudan-south-idUSTRE7690PB20110710 Israel recognises South Sudan, offers economic aid] ''Reuters'', July 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and South Sudan announcing the following week its intention to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel.&lt;ref name=israel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE76E1EA20110715|title=South Sudan will have relations with Israel-official|publisher=Reuters|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 2011, it was announced that full diplomatic ties had been established between the two countries.&lt;ref name=fullDepRecIsrForMin &gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-announces-full-diplomatic-ties-with-south-sudan-1.375746 | title=Israel announces full diplomatic ties with South Sudan | first=Barak | last=Ravid | newspaper=''[[Haaretz]]'' | date=28 July 2011 | accessdate=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a significant boon to Israel, as Sudan does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and does not recognise Israeli sovereignty.&lt;ref name=israel /&gt; 

Economic ties show the most potential. As of 23 July 2011, several Israeli companies are already in talks for various business deals. &lt;ref name=&quot;YNet&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4097591,00.html | title=Israeli companies discover South Sudan | work=Money ××××× | date=22 July 2011 | agency=YNetNews | accessdate=23 July 2011 | author=Petersburg, Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel  is host to thousands of refugees from South Sudan, who are now ready to return to their native country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/netanyahu-israel-recognizes-south-sudan-as-independent-state-1.372460 Netanyahu: Israel recognizes South Sudan as independent state]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
{{main|South Sudan â Sudan relations}}
Since independence relations with Sudan have been under negotiation. Sudan's President [[Omar al-Bashir]] first announced, in January 2011, that dual citizenship in the North and the South would be allowed,&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC independence&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12144675 |title=Southern Sudan votes on independence |author=Will Ross |publisher=BBC  |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but upon the independence of South Sudan he retracted the offer. He has also suggested an EU-style confederation.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 9 July&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14089843 |title=South Sudan becomes an independent nation |publisher=BBC News  |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uganda===
{{main|South Sudan â Uganda relations}}
Prior to independence relations between the two states were fostered through cultural contacts such as the presence of South Sudanese students in Uganda. As independence approaches the two states started to enhance their economic ties. However, the [[Lord's Resistance Army]]'s presence in South Sudan was a stumbling block.
