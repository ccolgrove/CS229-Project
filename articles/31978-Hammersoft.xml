'''United Airlines Flight 93''' was [[United Airlines]]' &lt;!--superfluous here: daily--&gt;scheduled morning [[transcontinental flight]] across the United States from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to [[San Francisco International Airport]] in [[California]]. On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, the [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757â222]] aircraft operating the route was hijacked by four [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. It subsequently crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]] in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], during an attempt by some of the passengers to regain control.

The hijackers breached the aircraft's cockpit and overpowered the flight crew approximately 46 minutes after takeoff. [[Ziad Jarrah]], a trained pilot, then took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast of the United States, presumably toward the United States capital of [[Washington, D.C.]] (The specific target there â whether the [[United States Capitol]], the [[White House]], or possibly some other building â is not known.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14778963/ United 93 Target Unknown]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the hijackers took control of the plane, several passengers and flight attendants were able to make telephone calls and learn that attacks had been made on the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York]] and [[the Pentagon]] in [[Virginia]]. Some of the passengers then made an attempt to regain control of the aircraft. During the attempt, however, the plane crashed into a field in [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]], near Shanksville in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], about {{convert|80|mi|km}} southeast of [[Pittsburgh]] and {{convert|150|mi|km}} northwest of Washington, D.C. All on board, including the four hijackers, were killed. A few witnessed the impact from the ground and news agencies began reporting the event within an hour.

Subsequent analysis of the [[flight recorder]]s recovered from the crash site revealed how the actions taken by the passengers prevented the aircraft from reaching the hijackers' intended target. Of the four aircraft hijacked on September 11{{ndash}}the others were [[American Airlines Flight 11]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]]{{ndash}}United Airlines Flight 93 was the only one that failed to reach its hijackers' intended target.

A temporary memorial has stood on the site since the attacks; construction of the first phase of a [[Flight 93 National Memorial|permanent memorial]] at the crash site was dedicated on September 10, 2011.

Two [[F-16]] fighter jets from the 121st Fighter Squadron of the [[Air National Guard|D.C. Air National Guard]] were scrambled and ordered to intercept Flight 93; the pilots intended to ram it since they did not have time to arm the jets.&lt;ref name=&quot;intercept&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44459345/ns/us_news-9_11_ten_years_later/ Kamikaze: F-16 pilots planned to ram Flight 93]&lt;/ref&gt; They never reached Flight 93 and did not learn of its crash until hours afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/f-16-pilot-was-ready-to-give-her-life-on-sept-11/2011/09/06/gIQAMpcODK_story_1.html F-16 pilot was ready to give her life on Sept. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;

NORAD insisted to the 9/11 Commission that fighters would have intercepted Flight&amp;nbsp;93 before it reached its target in Washington, D.C., but the commission disagreed, stating that &quot;NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed&quot; and concluding that had it not crashed it probably would have arrived in Washington by 10:23.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chap5&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=We Have Some Planes |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm |year=2004 |title=9/11 Commission Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although US military forces had been alerted about the hijackings, and two Air Force F-16 jet fighters were airborne in the area, no official authorisation to shoot down Flight 93 was given until the aircraft had crashed.
