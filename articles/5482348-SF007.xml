'''Microsoft Picture It!''' is a discontinued [[photo editing]] [[Application software|application]] created by [[Microsoft]]. Version 1.0 was released in September 1996. Borrowing from the [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] [[user interface]] concepts of [[Microsoft Publisher]], Picture It! was geared to make digital imaging easy for consumers. It was the first consumer imaging program to enable [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] creation, leveraging alpha masking (a concept published by [[Alvy Ray Smith]], founder of [[Pixar]], in 1978) while running on an 8 MB [[RAM]] [[Pentium]] computer. Microsoft purchased [[Altamira (software)|Altamira Software]], the company owned by Alvy Ray Smith in 1994 and made Alvy Ray Smith, a Microsoft fellow. 

The Picture It! file format used the extension &lt;tt&gt;.MIX&lt;/tt&gt; (Microsoft Image Extension). The &lt;tt&gt;.MIX&lt;/tt&gt; extension was also used by [[Microsoft PhotoDraw]] although its format was incompatible with Picture It!.

In 2001, Microsoft merged its ''Home Publishing'' product with Picture It! to create ''Picture It! Publishing''. In [[2003]], Picture It! was significantly changed, expanded with more advanced editing features and rebranded as [[Microsoft Digital Image]] with the home publishing features removed and a focus exclusively on photo editing. Digital Image was also eventually discontinued in [[2006]] after the release of [[Windows Vista]].
