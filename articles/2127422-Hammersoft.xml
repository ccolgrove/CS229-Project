Although the band had received critical acclaim with their previous album, ''Giant Steps'', ''Wake Up!'' was their first true commercial success, reaching number one in the UK album charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/release.php?release=46848 |title=Wake Up |publisher=chartstats.com |accessdate={{date|2011-09-08}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due in large part to two factors: the emergence of [[Britpop]] as a driving force in mid-1990s British music, and a catchy Top 10 single, &quot;[[Wake Up Boo!]]&quot;.
