'''Nag Hammadi''' ({{lang-ar|ÙØ¬Ø¹ Ø­ÙØ§Ø¯Ù}}, {{IPA-arz|ËnÃ¦É¡Êe Ä§Ã¦mËmÃ¦Ëdi|IPA}}), is a city in [[Upper Egypt]]. Nag Hammadi was known as [[Sheneset-Chenoboskion | Chenoboskion]] ({{lang-el|Î§Î·Î½Î¿Î²ÏÏÎºÎ¹Î¿Î½}}) in [[classical antiquity]], meaning &quot;geese grazing grounds&quot;. It is located on the west bank of the [[Nile]] in the [[Qena Governorate]], about 80 kilometres north-west of [[Luxor]]. 

It has a population of about 30,000, who are mostly farmers. [[Sugar]] and [[aluminium]] are produced in Nag Hammadi.

The town of Nag Hammadi was established by Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi, who was a member of the Hammadi family in [[Sohag]], [[Egypt]]. Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi was a major landholder in Sohag, and known for his strong opposition to the British occupation.

Mahmoud Pasha Hammadi created Nag Hammadi for the indigenous people from Sohag who were forced to abandon their homeland by the British occupation. In recognition of this, the new town was given the name &quot;Hammadi&quot;.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==The Nag Hammadi Library==
{{main|Nag Hammadi library}}

Nag Hammadi is best known for being the site where local farmers found a sealed earthenware jar containing thirteen leather-bound [[papyrus]] [[codex|codices]], together with pages torn from another book, in December 1945. The mother of the farmers burned one of the books and parts of a second (including its cover). Thus twelve of these books (one missing its cover) and the loose pages survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHL&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=James M. Robinson |year=1988 |title=The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=Harper San Francisco |location=San Francisco}}. &quot;The Nag Hammadi library consists of twelve books, plus eight leaves removed from a thirteenth book in late antiquity and tucked inside the front cover of the sixth. These eight leaves comprise a complete text, an independent treatise taken out of a book of collected essays.&quot; (p.10)&lt;/ref&gt; The writings in these codices, dating back to the 2nd century AD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nag-hammadi.com/ www.nag-hammadi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; comprised 52 mostly [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] tractates ([[treatise]]s), believed to be a library hidden by monks from the nearby monastery of [[St Pachomius]] when the possession of such banned writings, denounced as [[Christian heresy|heresy]], was made an offence.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} 

The contents of the [[coptic binding|Coptic-bound]] [[codex|codices]] were written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], though the works were probably all translations from [[Greek language|Greek]]. Most famous of these works must be the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]'', of which the Nag Hammadi codices contain the only complete copy.

All the texts have been public since 1975, and are available online.

==Nag Hammadi massacre==
{{main|Nag Hammadi massacre}}

The city was the site of the [[Nag Hammadi massacre]] in January 2010, wherein eight [[Copts|Coptic]] [[Christianity|Christians]] were shot dead by three [[Muslim]] men.&lt;ref name=&quot;catastrophe&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8478397.stm Egypt's anxious Copts 'await next catastrophe']&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen Coptic Christians were attacked altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;catastrophe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=1&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elfagr.org%2FNewsDetails.aspx%3FnwsId%3D15807%26secid%3D3611&amp;sl=ar&amp;tl=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8444851.stm | work=BBC News | title=Egypt church attack kills Copts | date=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
