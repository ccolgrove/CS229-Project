==Biography==

A 1992 graduate of [[Sylvania Southview High School]], Eric often created [[home movies]] with friends to show to other students. After graduating from the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts]] in 1996 as a member of the Gamma Eta Chapter of [[Pi Kappa Alpha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He later developed and wrote for the [[The WB Television Network|The WB]]'s [[2003 in television|2003]] television series ''[[Tarzan (WB series)|Tarzan]]'', which was cancelled after eight episodes, and followed this by writing the [[2005 in film|2005]] film ''[[Boogeyman (film)|Boogeyman]]''. The movie was followed by a sequel, ''Boogeyman 2''.

He is currently writing and directing his first theatre film ''Haunted'', ready for a 2012 release. In August 2011, it was announced that Kripke is developing a series for [[The CW Television Network]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Deadman]].

Kripke is married and has a son, born 2007, who shares a birthday with Kripke's character [[Sam Winchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=''iF Magazine''|title=Exclusive Interview: Eric Kripke Says War is Hell on 'Supernatural' Season 3|date=7/25/2007|author=Sean Elliott|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2260|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071004180557/http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2260|archivedate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boogeyman==
{{main|Boogeyman (film)}}
Prior to his success with ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'', Kripke wrote a screenplay for the film [[Boogeyman (film)|Boogeyman]], which was released in early 2005. The film focuses on the life of Tim, played by [[Barry Watson (actor)|Barry Watson]]. Tim, who's currently suffering the loss of his mother, goes home to confront the [[supernatural]] creature who he believes killed his father and is also the reason for his mother's demise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reelcriticreviews.com/reviews/boogeyman.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, which was looked down upon by critics, gives fans a glimpse of how Kripke's writing style has changed over the years. Although he has remained in the supernatural vein, the subject of Kripke's writing has gone from being psychologically driven to being more centered around the character's actions and interactions with each other. Kripke's writing has also gotten stronger in regards to research. It seems that while handling the Boogeyman legend Kripke used more facts from his head than he used facts from more reliable sources. As fans{{who|date=October 2011}} of ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' know Kripke carefully researches every creature featured on the show. (In most cases the research Kripke and his team have done end up getting repeated by the show's main character Sam Winchester.)

==Supernatural==
{{main|Supernatural (TV series)}}
In [[2005 in television|2005]], Kripke created the series ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and currently serves as a hands-on executive producer on the series after serving as the show's primary showrunner for the first five seasons of which he was noted for creating a uniquely detailed five-year plan. ''Supernatural'' first aired on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]]. It now airs on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], which was created by The WB's 2006 merger with [[UPN]]. He is known in the fandom of ''Supernatural'' as Lord Kripke and his theme song is &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot; by Blue Oyster Cult.

''Supernatural'' (currently in its seventh season) tells the story of two brothers, Sam and [[Dean Winchester]] two &quot;hunters&quot; whose job it is to protect the world from ghosts, demons, and other supernatural beings. The brothers also find themselves causing and ending the [[apocalypse]]. Despite the interest that the characters themselves have generated the show is also highly regarded for correctly citing supernatural lore.

==Haunted==

After Kripke left ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' following the show's fifth season he began developing other projects. One of these projects, entitled ''Haunted'' has been picked by [[Warner Bros]].&lt;ref&gt;http://screenrant.com/eric-kripke-haunted-movie-director-supernatural-robf-123107/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Kripke won [[Slamdance Film Festival]]'s Audience Award for ''Truly Committed'', and, in 2008, [[TelevisionWeek]] named him one of its &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; currently working in television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvweek.com/masters-of-scifi-08/index.php Master of Horror: Eric Kripke]&lt;/ref&gt;
