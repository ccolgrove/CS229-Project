'''''AB III''''' is the third [[studio album]] by the rock band [[Alter Bridge]], released on October 8, 2010. Produced by Michael &quot;Elvis&quot; Baskette, the album is a departure from the band's first two albums, lyrically because it is a loose [[concept album]] dealing with darker lyrical themes of struggling with faith, and musically due to its more dynamic and progressive sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III&amp;nbsp;â Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alterbridge.com/html/2010/09/08/new-alter-bridge-ab-iii-bio/ |title=New Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III&amp;nbsp;â Bio |date=September 8, 2010 |work=Alter Bridge's blog |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''AB III'' is also the first Alter Bridge album to be released on [[Roadrunner Records]], making it the band's third consecutive album to be released on a different label.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter Bridge Join Forces With Roadrunner Records&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alterbridge.com/html/2010/08/31/alter-bridge-join-forces-with-roadrunner-records/ |title=Alter Bridge Join Forces With Roadrunner Records |date=August 31, 2010 |work=Alter Bridge's blog |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on Roadrunner Records worldwide except North America, where it was self-released on Alter Bridge Recordings via [[Capitol Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AB III to Hit Stores in USA November 9th Featuring Hit Single âIsolationâ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alterbridge.com/html/2010/10/06/ab-iii-to-hit-stores-in-usa-november-9th-featuring-hit-single-%E2%80%9Cisolation%E2%80%9D/ |title=AB III to Hit Stores in USA November 9th Featuring Hit Single âIsolationâ |date=October 6, 2010 |work=Alter Bridge's blog |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''AB III'' was written throughout 2008 and 2009, but the songs were arranged generally quickly. Regarding the arrangement and recording process of the album, lead singer [[Myles Kennedy]] said that the creation of ''AB III'' was different from that of the band's previous album, ''[[Blackbird (album)|Blackbird]]'', because the band had about six weeks to put the music together before they started to work with their producer, Michael Baskette. Kennedy said, &quot;I think it actually worked out well, because it's a very spontaneous record.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BaHFKJTuBI Myles Kennedy Talks About The New Alter Bridge Album]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2010 the band announced that the recording, mixing, and mastering of the album was finished and all that was left was to decide on was the official title, song titles, track listing, and album art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entire Recording Process Finished on Third Alter Bridge Album&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=7326114&amp;blogId=536143074 |title=Entire Recording Process Finished on Third Alter Bridge Album |date=June 21, 2010 |work=Alter Bridge's blog |accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 2010, the band announced that the working title of the album, ''AB III'', would actually be the official title after all, stating they think it is &quot;simple yet effective&quot;. On the same blog post, they announced each song on the record one by one throughout the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;

The same press release confirmed a European release date of October 11, 2010 for the new album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alter Bridge Join Forces With Roadrunner Records&quot;/&gt; On October 6, the band announced that the album is scheduled for a North American release on November 9, 2010 on their own label, Alter Bridge Recordings, a subsidiary of [[Capitol Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AB III to Hit Stores in USA November 9th Featuring Hit Single âIsolationâ&quot;/&gt; ''AB III'' was first released in Australia three years to the day after their previous album on October 8, 2010.

&quot;Zero&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; were included on the United States version of the album as bonus tracks. The Japanese version contains a bonus track called &quot;Never Born to Follow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/AB-III-Alter-Bridge/dp/B0045ASBY8/ |title=AB III: Alter Bridge |publisher=Amazon |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist [[Mark Tremonti]] said that ''AB III'' could be the band's final studio album and that future Alter Bridge releases may be released digitally or in the form of [[extended play|EP]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|Show=%2fThemes%2flistenin%2fplayer%2fMakePostPlaylist.ashx%3fPlaylistOrder%3d14334%2c14335%2c14336%2c14337%2c14338%2c14339%2c14340%2c14341%2c14342%2c14343%2c14344%2c14345%2c14346%2c14347%2c14348%2c14349%2c14350%2c13980%2c13981%2c13982%2c13983%2c3671%2c3672%2c3673%2c3674%2c2486%2c2485%2c2489%2c2487%2c1302%2c1301%2c1295%2c1305%2c14330%2c14331%2c14332%2c14333&amp;Title=home+page |title=Mark Tremonti speaks about the potential end of full length albums |date=2010 |work=This Is Listening |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--DO NOT DELETE. LISTEN TO THE INTERVIEWS PROVIDED. THIS IS USEFUL INFORMATION.--&gt;

On October 25, 2011 the band will release a special edition of the album titled ''AB III.5'', which will include the three bonus tracks plus an hour-long documentary titled ''One by One''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=163612 |title=ALTER BRIDGE: 'AB III.5' CD/DVD Special Edition Detailed |date=9-21-2011 |publisher=Blabbermouth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and lyrical content==
''AB III'', initially described by the band as being very dark, heavy, and dynamic, is lyrically a very dark record and a radical departure from the band's first two albums, ''[[One Day Remains]]'' and ''[[Blackbird (album)|Blackbird]]'', in terms of subject matter. It is a loose [[concept album]], a first for Alter Bridge, about a character &quot;desperately struggling to find their place in a world steeped in doubt and emptiness,&quot; whereas the other two Alter Bridge records primarily focus on themes of &quot;hope and perseverance in the face of adversity.&quot; Kennedy has said that the album &quot;touches on the thoughts and emotions of someone who has come to question everything that was once regarded as an absolute truth&quot; and that it is about &quot;the realization that everything you once believed in might not exist.&quot; However, on ''AB III'', there are songs that touch on other emotions as well such as &quot;Wonderful Life,&quot; a song about a man losing his wife to disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III&amp;nbsp;â Bio&quot;/&gt;

The record is also much more intricate, progressive, and dynamic than their first two albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III&amp;nbsp;â Bio&quot;/&gt; It has even been described as [[progressive metal]] in some reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB III Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/alter_bridge/ab_iii/index.html|title=AB III Review |publisher=Ultimate Guitar Archive |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy plays more [[lead guitar]] on this album than he does on ''[[Blackbird (album)|Blackbird]]''. He said that &quot;[he's] definitely doing things [he hasn't] done in a long time as a guitar player.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge, Slash) interview: Guitarist Uncut: Exclusive on the next Alter Bridge album and touring with Slash&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/myles-kennedy-alter-bridge-slash-interview-260683 |title=Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge, Slash) interview |author=Rob Laing |date=July 13, 2010 |work=MusicRadar |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tremonti's vocals are also more prominent compared to the band's previous releases, singing co-lead vocals with Kennedy on &quot;Words Darker Than Their Wings,&quot; the title of which is derived from a phrase in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel ''[[A Game of Thrones]]''.

''AB III'' has received critical acclaim. Rob Laing from [[MusicRadar]] highly praised it and called it &quot;one of the guitar albums of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicradar.com/guitarist/alter-bridge-ab-iii-track-by-track-review-278474 |title=Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III: Track-by-track review |author=Rob Laing |date=September 17, 2010 |work=MusicRadar |publisher=Future Publishing Limited |accessdate=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Falzone from Outune.net, an Italian music website, also praised ''AB III'' and said that it &quot;reveals another unpredictable side&quot; to Alter Bridge, but that because of that, &quot;the earliest fan could not welcome this record immediately&quot; and that the record &quot;will require more than one or two listenings to be appreciated and understood at your best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outune.net/tunemag/rocktune/alter-bridge-ab-iii-premiere.html |title=Alter Bridge: AB III premiÃ¨re [English Version] |author=Claudia Falzone |date=September 15, 2010 |publisher=Outune.net 4.0 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petra Whiteley from Reflections of Darkness called ''AB III'' &quot;impressive&quot; and a &quot;must-get,&quot; and stated that &quot;the musicianship of this album is altogether honed to excellence.&quot; She also praised the band by saying that &quot;they are more interested in making music and that authenticity of their art and integrity are more important to them than the commercial side of it.&quot; She later went on to say that Alter Bridge &quot;will go far and shouldnât be missed out on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rev2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reflectionsofdarkness.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8293&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III |author=Petra Whiteley |date=September 25, 2010 |publisher=Reflections of Darkness |accessdate=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Florino from [[Artistdirect]] gave the record an extremely positive review and a perfect 5 out of 5 score. He said that it is &quot;one of the best rock records of 2010&quot; and called it a &quot;sprawling masterpiece that illuminates just how brilliant this band truly is&quot; and &quot;a juggernaut of an album that places the band firmly in the rock 'n' roll pantheon forever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Artistdirect&quot;/&gt; He expanded on this in an interview with [[Myles Kennedy]] by calling the album &quot;everything 21st century rock music should be&quot; and saying that it will &quot;establish this band among the most important in the genre.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myles &quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/myles-kennedy-of-alter-bridge-talks-ab-iii-slash-and-john-irving/7680874 |title=Myles Kennedy of Alter Bridge Talks &quot;AB III,&quot; Slash and John Irving |author=Rick Florino |date=October 11, 2010 |work=Artistdirect |publisher=Rogue Digital, LLC |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment Focus also reviewed the album positively, saying, &quot;Overall this is a great album from the band that sees them all stepping up a notch.&quot; However, the reviewer noted that ''AB III'' will &quot;test some listeners&quot; and that &quot;[f]ans of the previous two albums may find this one a bit more difficult to digest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entertainment-focus.com/music/articles/alter-bridge-ab-iii |title=Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III |author=Justin Ng |date=October 15, 2010 |work=Entertainment Focus |publisher=Pip |accessdate=October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Contrapuntist'' called ''AB III'' &quot;a grand achievement and possibly the best hard rock album of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecontrapuntist.com/2010/12/15/album-review-ab-iii-by-alter-bridge/ |title=Album Review: AB III by Alter Bridge |date=December 15, 2010 |publisher=''The Contrapuntist''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimate Guitar named ''AB III'' one of the best ten albums of the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/columns/features/ug_top_ten_albums_of_2010.html |title=UG Top Ten Albums Of 2010 |date=December 24, 2010 |publisher=''Ultimate Guitar''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all reviews have been entirely positive. A reviewer from Type 3 Media said, &quot;Overall ''AB III'' is a good effort, but it may not hold up to Alter Bridgeâs previous releases.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rev6&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://type3media.com/2010/10/07/album-review-alter-bridge-abiii/ |title=Album Review: Alter Bridge&amp;nbsp;â AB III |author=P.
