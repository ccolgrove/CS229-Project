The '''exploration of [[Mars]]''' has been an important part of the [[space exploration]] programs of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]]. Dozens of [[robotic spacecraft]], including [[orbiter]]s, [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]]s, and [[rover (space exploration)|rover]]s, have been launched toward Mars since the 1960s. These missions were aimed at gathering data about current conditions and answering questions about the history of Mars as well as a preparation for a possible [[human mission to Mars]]. The questions raised by the scientific community are expected to not only give a better appreciation of the red planet but also yield further insight into the past, and possible future, of [[Earth]].

The exploration of Mars has come at a considerable financial cost with roughly two-thirds of all spacecraft destined for Mars failing before completing their missions, with some failing before they even begin. Such a high failure rate can be attributed to the complexity and large number of variables involved in an interplanetary journey, and has led researchers to jokingly speak of ''The Great Galactic Ghoul'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dinerman | first=Taylor | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/232/1 | title=Is the Great Galactic Ghoul losing his appetite? | work=The space review | date=2004-09-27 | accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which subsists on a diet of Mars probes. This phenomenon is also informally known as the [[#Mars Curse|''Mars Curse'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Knight |first=Matthew | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/science/12/23/mwonders.mars/index.html | title= Beating the curse of Mars | work=Science &amp; Space | accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2011, there is one functioning piece of equipment on the surface of Mars beaming signals back to Earth: the [[Opportunity rover]].

In October 2009, an agreement was signed  between United States' space agency, NASA, and Europe's space agency, ESA in order to increase cooperation and expand collective capabilities, resources and expertise to continue the exploration of Mars; this agreement is named the [[Mars Exploration Joint Initiative]] (MEJI).&lt;ref name=MEJI &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/news/mars-20090708.html |title=NASA and ESA Establish a Mars Exploration Joint Initiative |accessdate=2009-11-09 |date=July 8, 2009 |publisher=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael A.

{{Main|Mars}}
Mars has long been the subject of human fascination. Early telescopic observations revealed color changes on the surface which were originally attributed to seasonal vegetation as well as apparent [[martian canal|linear features]] which were ascribed to intelligent design. These early and erroneous interpretations led to widespread public interest in Mars. Further telescopic observations found Mars' two moons - [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the polar ice caps and the feature now known as [[Olympus Mons]], the solar system's tallest mountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sheehan | first=William | url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/contents.htm | title= The Planet Mars: A History of Observation and Discovery | publisher = The University of Arizona Press, Tucson| date = 1996 | accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These discoveries piqued further interest in the study and exploration of the red planet. Mars is a rocky planet, like Earth, that formed around the same time, yet with only half the diameter of Earth, and a far thinner atmosphere, it has a cold and desert-like surface.  It is notable, however, that although the planet has only one quarter of the ''surface area'' of the Earth, it has about the same ''land area'', since only one quarter of the surface area of the Earth is land.

==Launch windows==
In order to understand the history of the robotic exploration of Mars it is important to note that minimum-energy [[launch window]]s occur at intervals of approximately 2.135 years, i.e. 780 days (the planet's [[synodic period]] with respect to Earth).{{cn|date=November 2011}}

In addition to these minimum-energy trajectories, which occur when the planets are aligned so that the Earth to Mars transfer trajectory goes halfway around the Sun, an alternate trajectory which has been proposed goes first inward toward [[Venus]] orbit, and then outward, resulting in a longer trajectory which goes about 360 degrees around the Sun  &lt;ref&gt;(&quot;[http://www.sff.net/people/ckanderson/flight.htm opposition-class trajectory]&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}}.

==Early flyby probes and orbiters==
===Early Soviet missions===
{{Main|Mars 1M}}
{{Main|Mars 1}}
[[File:Mars 1M.jpg|thumb|Mars 1M spacecraft]]
The [[Mars 1M]] program (sometimes dubbed Marsnik in Western media) was the first Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program,  which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, [[Mars 1960A]] and [[Mars 1960B]] (also known as ''Korabl 4'' and ''Korabl 5'' respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both launchers were unable to develop enough thrust to commence ignition, so Earth parking orbit was not achieved. The spacecraft reached an altitude of 120&amp;nbsp;km before reentry.

[[Sputnik 22|Mars 1962A]] was a Mars fly-by mission, launched on October 24, 1962 and [[Sputnik 24|Mars 1962B]] a lander mission, launched in late December of the same year both failed from either breaking up as they were going into Earth orbit or having the upper stage explode in orbit during the burn to put the spacecraft into the Mars trajectory.

[[Mars 1]] (1962 Beta Nu 1) an automatic interplanetary station launched to Mars on November 1, 1962 was the first probe of the Soviet [[Mars probe program]]. Mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet at a distance of about 11,000&amp;nbsp;km and take images of the surface as well as send back data on cosmic radiation, [[micrometeoroid]] impacts and Mars' [[magnetic field]], radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds. Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two day intervals and later at 5 days in which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected. On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000&amp;nbsp;km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased, due to failure of the spacecraft's antenna orientation system.

In 1964, both Soviet probe launches, of [[Zond 1964A]] on June 4, and [[Zond 2]] on November 30, (part of the [[Zond program]]), resulted in failures. Zond 1964A had a failure at launch, while communication was lost with Zond 2 en route to Mars after a mid-course maneuver, in early May 1965.

The USSR intended to have the first artificial satellite of Mars beating the planned American [[Mariner 8]] and [[Mariner 9]] martian orbiters. But on May 5, 1971 [[Cosmos 419|Cosmos 419 (Mars 1971C)]], a heavy probe of the Soviet Mars program M-71, failed on launch. This spacecraft was designed as an orbiter only, while the second and third probes of project M-71, [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]], were multi-aimed combinations of orbiter and lander.

===Mariner program===
{{Main|Mariner program}}
[[File:Mars (Mariner 4).jpg|thumb|The first close-up images taken of Mars in 1965 from Mariner 4 show an area about 330 km across by 1200 km from limb to bottom of frame.]][[File:Mars m04 11e.jpg|thumb|[[Mariner (crater)|Mariner Crater]], as seen by Mariner 4.  The location is [[Phaethontis quadrangle]].]]

In 1964, [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] made two attempts at reaching Mars. [[Mariner 3]] and [[Mariner 4]] were identical spacecraft designed to carry out the first flybys of Mars. Mariner 3 was launched on November 5, 1964, but the shroud encasing the spacecraft atop its rocket failed to open properly, and it failed to reach Mars. Three weeks later, on November 28, 1964, Mariner 4 was launched successfully on a 7Â½-month voyage to the red planet.

Mariner 4 flew past Mars on July 14, 1965, providing the first close-up photographs of another planet. The pictures, gradually played back to Earth from a small tape recorder on the probe, showed lunar-type impact craters.

NASA continued the Mariner program with another pair of Mars flyby probes, [[Mariner 6 and 7]], at the next launch window.  These probes reached the planet in 1969.  During the following launch window the Mariner program again suffered the loss of one of a pair of probes.  [[Mariner 9]] successfully entered orbit about Mars, the first spacecraft ever to do so, after the launch time failure of its sister ship, [[Mariner 8]].  When Mariner 9 reached Mars, it and two Soviet orbiters ([[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]], see ''Mars probe program'' below) found that a planet-wide dust storm was in progress.  The mission controllers used the time spent waiting for the storm to clear to have the probe rendezvous with, and photograph, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]].  When the storm cleared sufficiently for Mars' surface to be photographed by Mariner 9, the pictures returned represented a substantial advance over previous missions.  These pictures were the first to offer evidence that liquid water might at one time have flowed on the planetary surface.

===Viking program===

The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars.  Huge river valleys were found in many areas.  They showed that floods of water carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.  Areas of branched streams, in the southern hemisphere, suggested that rain once fell.&lt;ref&gt;ISBN 0-8165-1257-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raeburn, P.  1998.

{{Mars map indicating landers}}
[[File:Mars Viking 12a001.png|thumb|right|The first image transmitted by the Viking 1 Lander from the surface of Mars, showing the craft's footpad.]]

The [[Soviet Union]] intended to beat the USA by sending landers first in the [[Mars probe program]] M-69 in 1969, but both probes of the new heavy 5-ton design, [[Mars 1969A]] and [[Mars 1969B]], failed at launch.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

The first probes to impact and land on Mars were the Soviet Union's [[Mars 2]] and [[Mars 3]], as part of the Mars probe program M-71 in 1971. Each carried a lander. The Mars 2 lander crashed; Mars 3 was the first successful lander but stopped transmitting data and images from the surface after 15 seconds of operation.

[[Mars 6]] and [[Mars 7]] landers on the next Soviet Mars probe program M-73 failed their missions in 1974; the first impacted on the surface, while the second missed the planet.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

The first landers to successfully accomplish their missions were the American [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2]] in 1976.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

==Mars Curse==
{{off-topic|date=December 2011}}&lt;!-- the Venus claims appear to be off topic --&gt;
The high failure rate of [[Exploration_of_Mars#Timeline_of_Mars_exploration|missions launched]] from Earth attempting to explore Mars has become informally known as the &quot;Mars Curse&quot; or &quot;Martian Curse&quot;. The &quot;Galactic Ghoul&quot;&lt;ref name=OrangevilleCitizen-2008-10-23&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2008/1023/columns/032.html|title=Looking to Mars |last=Bothwell|first=William|date=2008-10-23|publisher=Orangeville Citizen|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Great Galactic Ghoul&quot; is a fictional space monster jokingly said to consume Mars [[unmanned space mission|probe]]s, a term coined in 1997 by [[Time Magazine]] journalist [[Donald Neff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309090504/html/41.html &quot;The Depths of Space: The Story of the Pioneer Planetary Probes (2004)&quot;] from [http://www.nap.edu/ The National Academies Press].

Of 38 launches from Earth in an attempt to reach the planet, only 19 have succeeded {{asof|2011|11}},{{cn|date=December 2011}} a success rate of 50%. Twelve of the missions included attempts to land on the surface, but only seven transmitted data after landing.{{cn|date=December 2011}}

The majority of the failed missions occurred in the early years of space exploration and were part of the Soviet and later Russian [[Mars probe program]] that suffered several technical difficulties,{{cn|date=December 2011}} other than the largely successful [[Venera]] program for the exploration of [[Venus]].&lt;!-- the Venus claims seem to belong in another article; not the Mars article --&gt;

Modern missions have an improved success rate; however, the challenge, complexity and length of the missions make it inevitable that failures will occur.&lt;ref name=universetoday&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/2008/03/22/the-mars-curse-why-have-so-many-missions-failed/ The &quot;Mars Curse&quot;: Why Have So Many Missions Failed?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. NASA Mars exploration program has had a somewhat better record of success in Mars exploration, achieving success in 13 out of 20 missions launched (a 65% success rate), and succeeding in six out of seven (an 86% success rate) lander missions.

==Manned missions==
{{Main|Manned mission to Mars}}
Many people have long advocated a manned mission to Mars as the next logical step for a manned space program after lunar exploration.  Aside from the prestige such a mission would bring, advocates argue that humans would easily be able to outperform robotic explorers, justifying the expense. Aerospace engineer [[Robert_Zubrin|Bob Zubrin]] is one of the main proponents of such missions. Some critics contend, however, that robots can perform better than humans at a fraction of the expense. If life exists on Mars, a manned mission could contaminate it by introducing earthly microbes, so robotic exploration would be preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Lupisella, ML. [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/reports/CB-1089/lupisella.pdf &quot;Human Mars Mission Contamination Issues.&quot;] ''NASA''.&lt;/ref&gt; A list of hypothetical or proposed manned Mars missions is located at [[manned mission to Mars]].

====Concept missions====
There are a number of conceptual missions for the exploration of Mars, but the missions are not yet fully funded nor under development.

;'Red Dragon' Mars Mission
{{as of|2011|07}}, NASA [[Ames Research Center]] is developing a concept for a low-cost [[Mars mission]] that would utilize a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon Heavy]] as the launch vehicle and trans-Martian injection vehicle, and the [[Dragon (spacecraft)|Dragon capsule]] to [[Atmospheric entry|enter]] the [[Martian atmosphere]].  The concept would be proposed for funding in 2012/2013 as a [[Discovery Program|NASA Discovery mission]], for launch in 2018 and arrival at Mars several months later.  The science objectives of the mission would be to look for evidence of life â detecting &quot;molecules that are proof of life, like [[DNA]] or [[Perchlorate|perchlorate reductase]] ... proof of life through [[biomolecules]].  ... Red Dragon would drill {{convert|3.3|ft}} or so underground, in an effort to sample reservoirs of [[Water_on_Mars#Evidence_of_frozen_water|water ice]] known to lurk under the red dirt.&quot; The mission cost is projected to be less than {{currency|425000000|US}}, not including the launch cost.&lt;ref name=sdc20110731&gt;
{{cite news |last=Wall|first=Mike |title='Red Dragon' Mission Mulled as Cheap Search for Mars Life |url=http://www.space.com/12489-nasa-mars-life-private-spaceship-red-dragon.html |accessdate=2011-07-31 |newspaper=SPACE.com |date=2011-07-31 |quote=''This so-called &quot;Red Dragon&quot; mission, which could be ready to launch by 2018, would carry a cost of about $400 million or less. ... developing the Red Dragon concept as a potential NASA Discovery mission, a category that stresses exploration on the relative cheap. ... NASA will make another call for Discovery proposals in 18 months or so... If Red Dragon is selected in that round, it could launch toward Mars in 2018. ... Assuming that $425 million cap [for NASA Discovery missions] is still in place, Red Dragon could come in significantly under the bar. We'd have money left over to do some science.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
