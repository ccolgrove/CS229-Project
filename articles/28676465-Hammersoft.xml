'''Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul''' is an [[Church of England]] parish church in the village of [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire|Kingsbury]], [[Warwickshire]], England. It is the only Church of England church in the parish and it dates from the 12th century

==History==
The church was built around the year 1200, when the church was built and until the 19th century the village was just a small hamlet, it was surrounded by land owned by then prime minister Sir [[Robert Peel]].

The stones of the church porch show evidence of arrow-sharpening grooves, sometimes said to have been done by soldiers but more probably by hunting parties or locals waiting their turn for the nearby village butts, as all males had to be proficient with a longbow.

==Today==
The church is part of the [[Diocese of Birmingham]] and the Deanery of [[Polesworth]]. It is the main church in the Kingsbury and Baxterley group of churches along with [[Baxterley Church|Baxterley]], [[St. Mary The Church of Our Lady Merevale|Merevale]], [[Church of the Resurrection, Hurley|Hurley]] and [[St Michael &amp; All Angels Church, Wood End|Wood End]], All five share the same vicar who is currently Revd.
