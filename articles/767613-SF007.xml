'''Anaconda''' is the installer for [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]].

[[Anaconda]]s are [[lizard]]-eating snakes (similar to [[Pythonidae|pythons]]), and the [[Caldera OpenLinux|Caldera]] installation program was called âLizardâ, hence the name.

== Functionality ==
Anaconda offers a text-mode and GUI mode, so users can install on a wide range of systems.
It is designed to be easily portable and supports a wide range of hardware platforms ([[IA-32]], [[Itanium]], [[DEC Alpha]], [[IBM ESA/390]], [[PowerPC]]). It supports installing from local storage devices like CD-ROM drives and harddisks as well as from network resources via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], or [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]]. Installations can be automated with the use of a [[Kickstart (Linux)|kickstart]] file, that automatically configures the installation, allowing users to run it with minimal supervision.

== Technology ==
It is mainly written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] with some modules written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. It has a graphical frontend that is based on [[PyGTK]] and designed with the [[Glade Interface Designer]] as well as a text frontend using [[Newt (programming library)|newt]].

== Availability and usage ==
It is available as [[Free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

Anaconda installer is used by [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and a number of other projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Distros&lt;/ref&gt;
