The '''[[Singapore|Republic of Singapore]]''' is a [[list of sovereign states|sovereign]] [[republic]] comprising the main island of Singapore and smaller outlying islands which are located at the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=2 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sn.html|title=Singapore|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore lies {{convert|137|km|mi}} north of the [[equator]], south of the [[Malaysia]]n state of [[Johor]] and north of [[Indonesia]]'s [[Riau Islands]]. Singapore is one of three remaining true [[city-state]]s in the world. It is the second smallest nation in [[Asia]].

Prior to European settlement, the island now known as Singapore was the site of a [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] fishing village at the mouth of the [[Singapore River]]. Several hundred indigenous [[Orang Laut]] people also lived along the nearby coast, rivers and on smaller islands. In 1819 the [[British East India Company]] established a trading post on the island, which was used thereafter as a strategic trading post along the [[spice route]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/getting_around/tours_in_singapore/ethnic___cultural/flavours_of_singapore.html| title= Flavours of Singapore |work= Uniquely Singapore| publisher= [[Singapore Tourism Board]]| accessdate= 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore would become one of the most important commercial and military centres of the British Empire, and the hub of British power in Southeast Asia. The city was [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|occupied by the Japanese]] during [[World War II]], which [[Winston Churchill]] called &quot;Britain's greatest defeat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.strategypage.com/militaryforums/30-18346.aspx| title= The 30 Greatest Battles of World War II}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore reverted to British rule immediately postwar, in 1945. Eighteen years later the city, having achieved independence from Britain, merged with [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form [[Malaysia]]. However, less than two years later it seceded from the federation and became an independent [[republic]] on 9 August 1965. Singapore joined  the [[United Nations]] on 21 September that same year.

Since independence, Singapore's [[standard of living]] has been on the rise. [[Foreign direct investment]] and a state-led drive to industrialization based on plans drawn up by the Dutch economist [[Albert Winsemius]] have created a modern economy focused on electronics manufacturing, petrochemicals, tourism and financial services alongside traditional [[entrepÃ´t]] trade. Singapore is the 6th wealthiest country in the world in terms of [[GDP per capita]].&lt;ref&gt;
