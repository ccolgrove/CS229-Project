[[Image:Sg1stargatefront.jpg|thumb|right|250px|thumb|The most important piece of technology in the ''Stargate'' universe: the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] itself.]]

In the [[fictional universe]] of ''[[Stargate]]'', a number of technologically advanced races and societies have produced a variety of highly advanced weapons, tools, and spacecraft. By liaising with these races and learning from them, Earth too has begun to create its own futuristic technology. All such technology is SCI-classified top secret, and is used solely by the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] and its [[SG teams]], or in [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MO30KAzBb_MC |title=Reading Stargate SG-1 |author=Stan Beeler, Lisa Dickson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional materials and elements {{anchor|Fictional materials}}==
*'''Hoffan drug''' A drug made by the [[Hoffan]]s, which prevents the individual from being fed on by the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] and kills any Wraith who attempts to do so. It first appears in &quot;[[Poisoning the Well (Stargate Atlantis)|Poisoning the Well]]&quot;, where the Atlantis Expedition is made aware of the drug. They quickly discover that the drug's positive benefits come with a 50% chance of death in the subject. The Hoffans distributed it among their population anyway, and the Wraith exterminated them as a result. The drug is later discovered and refined by [[Michael (Stargate)|Michael]], reducing the fatality rate to 30%, and distributed to several random planets in Pegasus. To that end, in &quot;[[Outsiders (Stargate Atlantis)|Outsiders]]&quot;, it is revealed the Wraith are destroying any civilization associated with the drug so they can feed &quot;indiscriminately&quot; again.

*'''Maclarium''' {{anchor|Maclarium}} An artificially-synthesized [[Transactinide element|super-heavy element]] with an atomic weight of over 200, named after its fictional creator, Dr. MacLaren. Originally named HU-2340, in the episode {{sgcite|Red Sky}} SG-1 attempts to introduce it into the sun of the planet K'Tau, hoping to neutralize foreign [[plutonium]] atoms and thus stop a reaction that would eventually render K'Tau uninhabitable.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Naqahdah-collage.jpg|thumb|Weapons-grade naqahdah (top) and liquid naqahdah (bottom)]] --&gt;
*'''Naqahdah''' {{anchor|Naqahdah}} ({{IPA-en|ËnÃ¦kwÉ¨dÉ|}}, also spelled &quot;'''naquahdah'''&quot;, &quot;'''naquadah'''&quot; or &quot;'''naquaada'''&quot;) A rare, [[superheavy element|superheavy]] metal first depicted (but not named) as a [[quartzite]]-like &quot;[[mineral]]&quot; in the original [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'' movie]]. Its most basic use is as a weapon: naqahdah greatly amplifies energy, making it extremely potent if paired with explosives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;&gt;[[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its unique properties, naqahdah forms the basis for many advanced technologies; the Stargates themselves are composed almost entirely of naqahdah. Naqahdah is also present in the bloodstream of the [[Goa'uld]], which allows them to control their technology and sense the presence of other symbiotes. The Goa'uld have naqahdah mining operations on many planets; its refined form, '''weapons-grade naqahdah''', is extremely valuable and often used as currency.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ties That Bind&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Ties That Bind}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons-grade naqahdah is so dense that two Jaffa are required to lift a quantity the size of a couple of common housing bricks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Upgrades&quot;/&gt; Alternate forms of naqahdah include '''liquid naqahdah''', used to power Goa'uld [[staff weapon]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fifth Race&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Fifth Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''heavy liquid naqahdah''', used to power Goa'uld AG-3 weapons satellites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Absolute Power&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Absolute Power}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naqahdah is a [[superconductor]].  Naqahdah does not occur naturally in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fail Safe&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Fail Safe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Naqahdriah''' {{anchor|Naqahdriah}} (also spelled &quot;'''naquahdriah'''&quot; or &quot;'''naquadria'''&quot;) A highly unstable variant [[isotope]] of naqahdah with considerably greater energy-production capacity â and correspondingly greater explosive potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meridian&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Meridian|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naqahdriah emits radiation that can cause death,&lt;ref&gt;{{sgcite|Meridian|ref=showall}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in non-lethal doses brain damage, resulting in delusions or schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shadow Play&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Shadow Play|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy released by naqahdriah can [[catalyst|catalyze]] nearby naqahdah into more naqahdriah in a self-sustaining reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallout&quot;/&gt; Naqahdriah was thought to occur naturally only in the nation of Kelowna on the planet Langara, but was later discovered that it was created by a Goa'uld during an experiment. In Kelowna it is used to construct weapons of mass destruction for a cold war against two rival nations. The Kelownan [[Jonas Quinn]] brings naqahdriah to [[Stargate Command]] in protest of his government's weapons program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meridian&quot;/&gt; Naqahdriah allows the Earth [[Earth starships in Stargate#F-302|X-302 fighter]] to be fitted with a far smaller hyperdrive than would otherwise be possible, although its instability limits the drive's utility to short, unguided jumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Redemption&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Redemption|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth ship [[Earth starships in Stargate#Prometheus|''Prometheus'']] also initially uses naqahdriah in its hyperdrive, though the element's instability causes problems on its first flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prometheus&quot;/&gt; The Earth [[Earth technology in Stargate#Mark IX &quot;Gatebuster&quot; bomb|Mark IX &quot;Gatebuster&quot;]] [[nuclear bomb]] is enhanced with naqahdriah and is designed to detonate the naqahdah in a Stargate to create a massive explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beachhead&quot;/&gt; The two powersources with enough power to dial the two Nine Chevron addresses are planets with Naquadria cores and Stars.

*'''[[Neutronium]]''' {{anchor|Neutronium}} A super-dense element key to [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] technology and in the construction of [[Replicator (Stargate)#Human-form Replicators|human-form Replicators]].&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;/&gt; The Asgard time dilation device on Halla is protected by a shell of solid neutronium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;/&gt; The new Asgard homeworld, Orilla, is rich in neutronium, which leads it to be targeted by the Replicators.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;/&gt; The nanite [[Asuran]]s are also based on neutronium, and the abundant deposits of neutronium in the crust of their homeworld proves to be the final key to their defeat in {{sgcite|Be All My Sins Remember'd|Atlantis}}. Earth has obtained supplies of neutronium, code-named &quot;pre-assembled masonry panels&quot;, for its own nanite experiments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Outcast&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Outcast|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Trinium''' {{anchor|Trinium}} A fictional [[metal]] introduced in {{sgcite|Spirits}}, which is of great value to [[Stargate Command]]. Though weak and brittle in its raw form, when refined it is 100 times lighter and stronger than [[steel]]. After the [[iris (Stargate)|iris]] over Earth's [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] is destroyed in {{sgcite|A Matter of Time}}, a trinium-[[titanium]] replacement is installed. Trinium is used in the production of Earth's starships, such as the ''[[Earth starships in Stargate#Prometheus|Prometheus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prometheus&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Prometheus|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{sgcite|Evolution}}, a trinium dart is used to pierce the armor of a [[Kull Warrior]]. Trinium is also a key component in [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]] technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Between Two Fires&quot;/&gt; The hull of the advanced Asgard ship ''[[Starships in Stargate#O'Neill-type|O'Neill]]'' is composed of an [[alloy]] of trinium, [[carbon]], and naqahdah, stated by [[Asgard (Stargate)#Thor|Thor]] to be the strongest material known to his people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Small Victories&quot;/&gt;

==Earth technology==
{{Main|Earth technology in Stargate}}
{{See also|List of Earth starships in Stargate}}
The humans of Earth (known as the [[Tau'ri]] to the [[Goa'uld]] and [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]], and the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]] to the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]) have developed many futuristic technologies throughout the course of ''Stargate SG-1'' and its spin-offs. One of the primary missions of the [[Stargate Program]] is the acquisition of technologies capable of defending Earth and improving the lives of its inhabitants. Most useful alien technologies brought back by [[SG team]]s through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] are studied at the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] or at Area 51, and reverse-engineered when possible. Earth has also benefitted immensely from collaborations and gifts from its various offworld allies, such as the [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] and the [[Tok'ra]]. Since the discovery of Atlantis in the Pegasus galaxy, Earth has gained a significant understanding of [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] technology.

== Ancient technology ==
{{Main|Ancient technology in Stargate}}
{{See also||1=Starships in Stargate#Ancient starships|l1=Ancient starships in Stargate}}
Although extinct, the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] (originally called the &quot;Alterans&quot;, known as &quot;Lanteans&quot; in the Pegasus galaxy) are the most advanced civilization in the ''Stargate'' fictional universe. Among their many technological achievements is the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] network itself, central to the franchise, and the City Ship of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis''. Ancient inventions and machines play critical roles in many ''Stargate'' stories, including &quot;[[The Fifth Race (Stargate SG-1)|The Fifth Race]]&quot;, &quot;[[Redemption (Stargate SG-1)|Redemption]]&quot;, &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot;, and ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.

==Asgard technology==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Plasma-beam-weapons.png|thumb|The ''Daedalus'' and ''Apollo'' fire Asgard plasma beams, from &quot;Be All My Sins Remember'd&quot;.]] --&gt;
{{See also||1=Starships in Stargate#Asgard starships|l1=Asgard starships in Stargate}}
The [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] are an extremely advanced race who become allies of Earth, and provide many of their technologies to the [[Stargate Command|SGC]]. They were once contemporaries of the Ancients, and learned much from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;/&gt; The Asgard are no longer capable of traditional reproduction and instead perpetuate themselves through [[cloning]], as they have the technology to upload and store Asgard consciousnesses and transfer them to new bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Revelations&quot;/&gt; [[Neutronium]] is a key element of Asgard technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;/&gt; Prominent Asgard technologies include:

*'''Battle Armor''' {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} metallic suits worn by a rogue group of Asgard in Pegasus. They possess a built in shield-wall generator that can hold back weapons-fire from conventional weapons for several minutes and an EM dampening field that negates any scanning equipment used on them. They also have a preprogrammed self-destruct in case anyone tries to remove the suit by force. The interior of the suits mould to the wearer, allowing normal humans  to use them in addition to the much smaller Asgard.
*'''Beaming technology''' Teleportation system that allows people and objects to be moved nearly instantly across long distances,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thor's Chariot&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Thor's Chariot|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; capable of handling objects as large as an entire [[skyscraper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ex Deus Machina&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Ex Deus Machina|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asgard have shared beaming technology with Earth, and it is installed on Earth battlecruisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethon&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Ethon|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Siege, Part 3|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology also falls into the hands of the [[Goa'uld]] after [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] probes Thor's mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revelations&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Revelations|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chimera&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Chimera|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaming requires a sensor lock on the subject;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nemesis&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Nemesis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of [[SG team]]s are equipped with locator beacons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethon&quot;/&gt; and later locator chip implants, to facilitate emergency beam-out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Off the Grid&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Off the Grid|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] have developed countermeasures to prevent beaming aboard their ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt; Beaming is not possible through shields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revelations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Search and Rescue&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Search and Rescue|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a slight modification, Asgard beams can convert matter into desired forms such as air and food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unending&quot;/&gt;
*'''Computer core''' Computer containing all the knowledge of the Asgard, including their entire recorded history. It is installed on the ''Odyssey'' as the Asgard's final act before their self-destruction. The core can generate a holographic representation of any Asgard for interaction. It has its own power source that is tied into the systems of the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unending&quot;/&gt; The core is very user-friendly, allowing IOA agent Marrick to create a [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]] simply by giving it a chip with the base design (the core filled in the blanks).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ark of Truth&quot;&gt;''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dialing device''' Small stone-shaped device capable of activating a [[Stargate]] to a predetermined destination without the need for a [[DHD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sgcite|1969|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Directed energy weapon''' Asgard starships are armed with energy weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Order&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|New Order|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Revelations&quot;/&gt; Kvasir loans an energy weapon to the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] in order to return numerous alternate universe [[SG teams]] to their respective realities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ripple Effect&quot;/&gt; In {{sgcite|Unending}}, the Asgard install '''plasma beam weapons''', their latest technology, on the ''Odyssey''. These beams are capable of overcoming the shields of an [[Ori mothership]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Unending&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Unending|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons are later installed on the other ''Daedalus''-class battlecruisers and are shown to be highly effective against both [[Asuran]] and [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;By All My Sins Remember'd&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Be All My Sins Remember'd|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Last Man&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Last Man|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hologram system''' Technology that allows the remote projection of three-dimensional images. The Asgard use [[hologram]]s to disguise themselves as Norse gods on primitive planets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thor's Hammer&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Thor's Hammer|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Sky&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Red Sky|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asgard communication systems use holograms to facilitate conversation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revelations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Sky&quot;/&gt; The [[Stargate Command|SGC]] has developed its own version of an Asgard hologram system, called &quot;Chimera&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bounty&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Bounty|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] acquires the technology after probing Thor's mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revelations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost City&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Lost City|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intergalactic hyperdrive''' Asgard hyperdrives allow travel between galaxies in days or hours,&lt;ref name=&quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;/&gt; given a sufficient power source.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt; The Asgard have shared their hyperdrive technology with Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt;
*'''Invisibility device''' Technology given to the Tiernod to hide from predators. Several are stolen by rogue NID agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shades of Grey&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Shades of Grey|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Replicator disruptor satellite''' Application of the [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Replicator Disruptor|Ancient Replicator disruptor]] designed to function on a planetary scale. One is provided to the [[Alpha Site (Stargate)|Alpha Site]] to defend against [[Replicator (Stargate)#Fifth|Fifth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gemini&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Gemini|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is developing its own version called the &quot;Planetary Wide Anti-Replicator Weapon&quot; (PWARW).&lt;ref name=&quot;First Strike&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|First Strike|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Shields''' Asgard starships are equipped with energy shields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Small Victories&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Small Victories|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asgard shields are capable of enduring all sorts of weapons fire from every existing race.  Goauld weapons do virtually no damage to it, while the much feared Ori weapons require several direct hits to penetrate.  Also Asgard shields have been the only known defense against even the Ancient's drone weapons.  Asgard shield technology has been shared with Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt;
*'''Thor's Hammer''' Device installed on Cimmeria to protect it against the [[Goa'uld]]. It scans incoming travelers through the Stargate and beams those harboring a symbiote into a prison, which allows humans to leave but not Goa'uld (nor Jaffa with juvenile symbiotes). [[SG-1]] disables the Hammer to rescue [[Teal'c]], and later Thor provides a new Hammer to Cimmeria which provides an exception to one Jaffa, Teal'c.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thor's Chariot&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thor's Hammer&quot;/&gt;
*'''Time dilation device''' Technology that manipulates the passage of time. One is used in an attempt to trap the [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]] on the planet Halla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unnatural Selection&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Unnatural Selection|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is loaned to Earth to seal an interdimensional gap in a black hole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ripple Effect&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Ripple Effect|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asgard core on the ''Odyssey'' has a built-in time dilation device, used to escape the Ori in {{sgcite|Unending}}.

==Asuran technology==
[[Image:Asuransatelliteweapon.jpg|thumb|Asuran satellite weapon in &quot;First Strike&quot;.]]
The [[Asuran]]s (more commonly referred to as the Replicators) are sentient nanite constructs created by the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] to fight the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. The Asurans possess the early technology of the Ancients at the time of their war with the Wraith. The Asurans use [[Ancient starships in Stargate|starships of Atlantean design]], such as [[Ancient City Ship|city ship]]s and [[Aurora class battleship|''Aurora''-class battleships]]. In {{sgcite|Lifeline|Atlantis}} and {{sgcite|This Mortal Coil|Atlantis}}, a second type of Asuran warship is shown, smaller in size than the ''Aurora''-class. Prominent Asuran technologies include:

*'''Core drive''' A component of an Asuran battleship's navigation system. An Asuran copy of Keller gives one to a clone of Elizabeth Weir, who in turn gives it to the Atlantis Expedition. McKay uses it to track all the ''Aurora''-class battleships in the Pegasus galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;This Mortal Coil&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|This Mortal Coil|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Probe''' Hyperspace-capable device used by Oberoth's forces to track down the remnants of Niam's rebel group. It is shot down over their duplicate Atlantis, though not before transmitting data back to Asuras.&lt;ref name=&quot;This Mortal Coil&quot;/&gt;
*'''Satellite weapon''' Weapon sent to attack Atlantis in response to Earth's preemptive strike on Asuras, consisting of a stripped-down ship with a Stargate, hyperdrive, shield, and sensors. Once the Stargate activates, the Asurans transmit a powerful energy beam through. The beam doubles as an unlimited power source for the shield, effectively making the satellite indestructible. The wormhole can be maintained indefinitely by means of multiple [[ZPM]]s on the other side, which also prevents the target's Stargate from dialing out. Atlantis only survives the satellite weapon by moving out of range, leaving its planet for another.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Strike&quot;/&gt;

==Goa'uld technology==
{{Main|Goa'uld technology in Stargate}}
{{See also||1=Starships in Stargate#Goa'uld starships|l1=Goa'uld starships in Stargate}}
The [[Goa'uld]] are the main adversaries for most of the run of ''Stargate SG-1''. They scavenged or conquered most of their advanced technologies from other races. However, there are innovators amongst the Goa'uld; [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] and [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] in particular have been depicted with a great deal of technological ingenuity. Many Goa'uld devices, such as the [[staff weapon]], are designed to be more showy than practical, meant to intimidate and reinforce their position as gods to their followers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Warrior&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Warrior|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pieces of Goa'uld technology, such as the hand device and the healing device, respond only to mental commands and require naqahdah in the bloodstream of the user to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thor's Chariot&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seth&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Seth|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Goa'uld technologies include:

*'''Force shield''' An energy barrier, also called a force-field or simply a shield. Goa'uld force shields work on a frequency oscillation principle, so a relatively slow moving object can bypass it at the right moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Upgrades&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Upgrades|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa'uld motherships are protected by force shields,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Serpent's Lair&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Serpent's Lair|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are some ground-based facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Into the Fire&quot;/&gt; Force shields are also installed inside ships to restrict access to certain areas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Upgrades&quot;/&gt; and to contain hull breaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Descent&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Descent|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some powerful Goa'uld are equipped with personal force shields activated with a button on their hand device. These shields react proportionally to the amount of kinetic energy of incoming matter, so they can be penetrated by relatively slow-moving objects such as a thrown knife.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nox&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Nox|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tok'ra]] have made force shield technology available to the [[Stargate Command|SGC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prototype&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Prototype|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hand device''' Also known as a &quot;ribbon device&quot;, the hand device is a metal, glove-like object with a large red gem set in the palm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;&gt;''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is the personal weapon of the [[Goa'uld]] and requires [[naqahdah]] in the bloodstream to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seth&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Seth|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; They utilize a modified version of a staff weapon's power source channeled through amplification crystals, and are thought-controlled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forever in a Day&quot;/&gt; The hand device can generate a shockwave that throws back anyone in its path with great force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;/&gt; The [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] attribute the Goa'uld ability to hurl people through the air as a sign of their divine power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threshold&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Threshold|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand device can also generate an energy stream to a person's head that causes severe pain and eventual death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;/&gt; This function creates a mental link between Goa'uld and victim, which may allow the Goa'uld host to send a message through.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forever in a Day&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Forever in a Day|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand devices can also be used to block zat blasts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Double Jeopardy|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have buttons on the wrist for controlling Goa'uld technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secrets&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Secrets|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Enemies&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Enemies|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sarcophagus''' Coffin-like chamber capable of vastly extending life, healing almost any illness, repairing grievous injuries, and even reviving the recently dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;/&gt; However, frequent use of the sarcophagus becomes addictive and has a deteriorating effect upon the mind;&lt;ref name=&quot;Need&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Need|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a main factor in why the [[Goa'uld]] are evil, and why the [[Tok'ra]] refuse to use the sarcophagus.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tok'ra&quot;/&gt; Sarcophagi are sometimes used to preserve individuals for thousands of years,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hathor&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Hathor|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tomb&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Tomb|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is a limit to how long a sarcophagus can extend a person's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallen&quot;/&gt; The first sarcophagus was created by the Goa'uld Telchak, using a less potent version of the energy emitted by an [[Ancient technology in Stargate#healing device|Ancient healing device]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolution&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Evolution|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Staff weapon''' Standard weapon used by the [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]], consisting of a metal quarterstaff with an almond-shaped head that splits open to fire a powerful energy blast. There is a counterbalancing club on the back end, allowing the weapon to be used in melee combat at close ranges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;/&gt; It is powered by liquid [[naqahdah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fifth Race&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Fifth Race|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; In skilled hands it can be quite effective,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloodlines&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Bloodlines|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is less accurate and slower to fire than Earth-made firearms; [[Jack O'Neill (Stargate)|Jack O'Neill]] describes it as a &quot;weapon of terror&quot; rather than of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Warrior&quot;/&gt; Heavier models of the weapon can be slung at the waist by a strap,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fifth Man&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Fifth Man|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;48 Hours&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|48 Hours|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; or mounted on fixed or mobile platforms to act as artillery support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Into the Fire&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Into the Fire|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goa'uld ships are equipped with large-scale versions of these weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Movie&quot;/&gt; The [[Mythology of Stargate#Jaffa|Sodan]] use a variant of the staff weapon with the back half removed, making it light and easier to carry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babylon&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Babylon|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zat'nik'tel (Zat)''' (pronounced &quot;ZAT-nik-a-tel&quot;, usually shortened to &quot;zat&quot;) A commonly used sidearm shaped like a small snake curved into an &quot;S&quot; shape, that springs forward when activated. One shot from the zat stuns (though its effectiveness varies with different people), a second shot kills, and a third shot disintegrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Within the Serpent's Grasp&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Within the Serpent's Grasp|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers eventually regretted introducing the disintegration feature and [[retcon]]ned it out of existence after season 3; an in-joke is made of this in the episode {{sgcite|Wormhole X-Treme!}}, where [[Martin Lloyd]] suggests it and a character replies &quot;that's quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever heard you say.&quot; Zat blasts can be transmitted through conductive materials like metals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Memento Mori&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Memento Mori|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used to either destroy electronic equipment&lt;ref name=&quot;Into the Fire&quot;/&gt; or as a power source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost City&quot;/&gt;

==Ori technology==
[[Image:Supergate.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Prometheus'' next to a Supergate, from &quot;Beachhead&quot;.]]
{{See also||1=Starships in Stargate#Ori starships|l1=Ori starships in Stargate}}
The [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] are [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascended beings]] who serve as the main antagonists in seasons 9 and 10 of ''Stargate SG-1'', posing a major threat because of their advanced technology. As they were once the same race as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], Ori and Ancient technologies are comparable and have many similarities. The Ori Supergate is compatible with a normal Milky Way Stargate,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot;/&gt; and the Ori possess [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Ring transporter|ring transporters]] cosmetically different but functionally identical to Ancient equivalents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Origin|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have their own version of the [[Ancient technology in Stargate#Control Chair|Ancient control chair]] on their motherships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Counterstrike&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Counterstrike|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Ori technologies include:

*'''Orbital weapons satellite''' A satellite that fires a powerful energy beam. A Prior provides the design to the Rand Protectorate on Tegalus in exchange for their conversion to Origin. [[Stargate Command]] sends the ''Prometheus'' to destroy the weapon, but it is protected by a shield impervious to its attacks. The ''Prometheus'' is itself destroyed as the satellite's weapon can penetrate its shields. SG-1 eventually plans an attack that would destroy the satellite, compelling Rand officials to the negotiations table.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ethon&quot;/&gt;
*'''Prior plague''' A [[biological weapon]] released by the Priors, used to coerce populations into accepting Origin as the Priors can also cure it using their powers. The disease is similar to the plague that nearly wiped out the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]] millennia ago, suggesting a relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Powers That Be&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Powers That Be|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plague is highly virulent and eventually leads to major organ failure. First seen used against primitive planets,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Powers That Be&quot;/&gt; the Priors eventually deploy it against Earth, where it rapidly spreads beyond the [[Stargate Command|SGC]]. The epidemic is cured with assistance from the Ancient Orlin, the Sodan, and the Jaffa Gerak (who had been transformed into a Prior), though not before thousands of lives are lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Fourth Horseman|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Shields''' Several forms of Ori shields have been depicted. Ori ships are equipped with powerful shields that are impervious to almost any attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camelot&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Camelot|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{sgcite|Beachhead}}, a Prior generates a force-field that uses the energy of incoming weapons fire to expand. The shield is projected through the Stargate and persists even after the Prior is destroyed, and eventually covers the entire planet after absorbing the energy of an Earth-made Mark-IX [[naqahdriah]]-enhanced nuclear bomb. It then collapses the planet into a quantum singularity, to serve as the power source for a nearby Supergate. The Orici, [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]], is protected by a personal shield generated by a pendant around her neck. According to her, it contains a piece of Celestis, the Ori holy city. It protects her against the [[Dakara superweapon]] in {{sgcite|Counterstrike}}. In {{sgcite|The Quest}}, she extends the shield around SG-1 and Ba'al to protect them against a [[dragon]].
*'''Supergate''' A gigantic Stargate designed to allow the passage of starships. The [[Goa'uld]] word for this device is &quot;Chappa'ko&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camelot&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; The Supergate is made up of 90 smaller pieces that are moved through a regular Stargate. Once assembled, a nearby planet is collapsed into a quantum singularity to provide the massive power needed to open a wormhole to the Ori galaxy. [[Samantha Carter]] theorizes that the singularity allows a connection to be maintained indefinitely. Each segment of the Supergate is nearly indestructible;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beachhead&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Beachhead|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Camelot&quot;/&gt; [[Stargate Command]] eventually develops a plan to destroy the Supergate by beaming Mark-IX nuclear warheads between the segments and detonating them during gate activation.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ark of Truth&quot;/&gt; The first Ori attempt to create Supergate in the Milky Way fails when [[Vala Mal Doran]] inserts her [[Tel'tak]] into the incomplete ring and prevents the segments from completely connecting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beachhead&quot;/&gt; The second Supergate forms successfully and allows a fleet of [[Ori mothership]]s into the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Camelot&quot;/&gt; The [[Stargate Command|SGC]] seals the Supergate to the Ori by opening a connection from the Pegasus galaxy to a regular Stargate near the Supergate, and then &quot;jumping&quot; the wormhole to the Supergate with a large nuclear explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Pegasus Project&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Pegasus Project|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supergate is reopened in order to send the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]] to the Ori galaxy,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Shroud&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Shroud|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used by the ''Odyssey'' to travel to the Ori galaxy.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ark of Truth&quot;/&gt; The special effects for the Supergate are not always consistent regarding its size in different episodes.
*'''Ori Staff Weapon''' A small, metallic staff used by Ori warriors as their primary weapon. It seems to be a much more refined version of a Goa'uld staff weapon. It fires small blue/white bolts of plasma, rather than a large blob of yellow plasma, as with the Goa'uld's version. It is powered by a small blue crystal that is also capable of powering other Ancient devices by using wires to transfer the current.
*'''Ori Stun Weapon''' A small hand weapon shaped in the symbol of Origin that is worn as a gauntlet on the arm of Ori soldiers. The Ori stun weapon appears to share the same blue/white plasma energy as the larger Ori staff weapon, but is less potent. This weapon is similar in function to the Zat'ni'katel with one shot from this weapon capable of rendering an individual unconscious and multiple shots required to kill.
*'''Prior Staff''' A tall staff with a blue jewel at the top that is carried by the Priors. This staff is adorned with the symbol of Origin and when activated the crystal on the top glows, likely serving to convince followers of Origin that the actions performed by the Priors are miracles of the Ori. The staff is connected to that of every other Prior through a subspace link, strong enough to cover an entire galaxy but not strong enough to reach the home galaxy of the Ori.

==Tok'ra technology==
The [[Tok'ra]] are an offshoot of the [[Goa'uld]] and thus have access to many of their technologies, such as [[Goa'uld technology in Stargate#Shields|force-fields]], [[Goa'uld technology in Stargate#Memory device|memory devices]] and [[Goa'uld technology in Stargate#Transphase eradication rod (TER)|transphase eradication rods]]. Tok'ra forces rely on [[Goa'uld technology in Stargate#Zat'n'ktel|zat'n'ktel]]s, as they lack the [[naqahdah]] necessary to build [[staff weapons]]. The Tok'ra often assist the SGC in developing new technologies, and they have provided many pieces of their technology to [[Stargate Command]] when required. Tok'ra one-way force-fields are installed in the SGC's isolation rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prototype&quot;/&gt; Prominent Tok'ra technologies include:
*'''Crystal tunnel''' Used by the Tok'ra to quickly build new bases, these tunnels grow underground automatically from a small seed crystal into predetermined configurations, manufacturing oxygen in the process to create a livable environment. They can also be collapsed rapidly should the Tok'ra need to evacuate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tok'ra&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Tok'ra|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used to facilitate a Langaran drilling machine on a mission to stop the underground spread of [[naqahdriah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallout&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Fallout|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Goa'uld tracking network''' An encoded subspace network that receives signals from tracking devices on over a hundred [[Ha'tak]]s, placed by Tok'ra operatives over a number of years. Jacob/Selmak provides a receiver to this network to the SGC in order to monitor the war between the Goa'uld and the Replicators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reckoning&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Reckoning|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Kull disruptor]]'''  A weapon based on an Ancient healing device, that can neutralize [[Kull Warrior]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Death Knell&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Death Knell|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Radioactive isotope''' When injected, this isotope conceals the user from sensors for eight hours. It is used by Daniel Jackson and Jonas Quinn to infiltrate Anubis' mothership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fallen&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Fallen|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Re'ol chemical''' A memory-altering substance derived from the natural secretions of the Re'ol species, which allows a subject to fool another into trusting them. It is used by [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] to infiltrate a summit of the [[System Lord]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Summit&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Summit|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] to infiltrate the [[Lucian Alliance]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Company of Thieves&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Company of Thieves|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Symbiote extractor''' Apparatus used to extract a symbiote from a host. Ba'al's clone was the first to be shown having been removed from its human host.&lt;ref name=&quot;Continuum&quot;&gt;''[[Stargate: Continuum]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbiotes have been removed from their host by the Tok'Ra before this, whether this device or other means were used to do this is unknown.
*'''Symbiote poison''' An aerosol toxin deadly to [[Goa'uld]] symbiotes, that is highly potent even in minute quantities. It is originally developed to assassinate the System Lords, but is instead used to wipe out Anubis' army on Revanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Last Stand&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Last Stand|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust later gains access to the poison and uses it to attack Goa'uld worlds in &quot;[[Endgame (Stargate SG-1)|Endgame]]&quot;, killing millions of Jaffa in the process.
*'''Tretonin''' {{anchor|Tretonin}} A drug extracted from Goa'uld symbiotes, introduced in {{sgcite|Cure}} as the creation of the Pangaran civilization, using the spawn of the Tok'ra Queen Egeria. The drug reproduces the symbiote's healing powers, allowing perfect health and extended life, while also suppressing the user's natural immune system as the symbiote does.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cure&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Cure|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tok'ra eventually develop a synthetic version of tretonin, which is first tested on the Jaffa in {{sgcite|Birthright}} and eventually becomes widespread amongst the Jaffa, freeing them from their dependence on the Goa'uld. Tretonin is ineffective in a small number of Jaffa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birthright&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Birthright|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Za'tarc detector''' A device invented by Anise, meant to work in conjunction with a [[Goa'uld technology in Stargate#Memory device|memory device]] to search for false memories that would indicate that a person has been brainwashed into a za'tarc assassin. It works by comparing the subject's conscious and subconscious mind. However, it can give a false positive if the subject is subconsciously concealing something else, such as in the case of [[Jack O'Neill (Stargate)|Jack O'Neill]] and his attraction to [[Samantha Carter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Divide and Conquer|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allegiance&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Allegiance|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wraith technology==
{{See also||1=Starships in Stargate#Wraith starships|l1=Wraith starships in Stargate}}
The [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] are the main antagonists of ''Stargate Atlantis''. Although not as advanced as their enemies, [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]], the Wraith were able to drive them out of the Pegasus galaxy by virtue of superior numbers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Rising|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; made possible by [[cloning]] technology powered by stolen [[ZPM]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoils of War&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Spoils of War|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wraith have been shown to be tactically and technologically adaptable,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Defiant One&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Defiant One|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Siege|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Midway&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Midway|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; being able to quickly develop a countermeasure to [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] beaming technology,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt; and creating highly sophisticated [[computer virus]]es for use against the ''Daedalus''&lt;ref name=&quot;The Intruder&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Intruder|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Asuran]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reunion&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Reunion|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wraith also operate an extensive network of transmitters and relay devices throughout Pegasus that allow them to respond rapidly to events of interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspicion&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Childhood's End&quot;/&gt; Many pieces of Wraith technology, including their ships, are a hybrid of organic and mechanical parts with the ability to heal damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phantoms&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Phantoms|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Wraith technologies include:

*'''Culling beam''' A short-range transporter beam that dematerializes and stores matter for rematerialization at a later time. They are most often mounted on the bottom of Wraith darts for the purpose of capturing human prey, hence the common name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising&quot;/&gt; They can also be used to deploy troops,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege&quot;/&gt; or as a site-to-site teleportation system in Wraith facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reunion&quot;/&gt;
*'''EM generator''' An experimental device that generates a low-frequency pulse capable of triggering traumatic hallucinations in nearby humans, meant to enhance the Wraith's telepathic ability to create illusions. Abandoned on a planet after it proved unstable, it is activated by a group of [[Genii (Stargate)|Genii]], who kill each other under the device's influence. The Atlantis team nearly suffers the same fate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phantoms&quot;/&gt;
*'''Grenade''' A spherical explosive device on a timer, activated by pulling the two hemispheres apart, twisting a quarter turn, and pushing back together. [[John Sheppard (Stargate)|John Sheppard]] uses one as a [[landmine]] in an unsuccessful attempt to kill a Wraith in {{sgcite|The Defiant One|Atlantis}}. It should be noted that this grenade has a golden colour, an inorganic design and seems designed to kill rather than stun it's targets. For these reasons it should be considered a possibility that the wraith from which the devices were recovered may have taken them from a victim, possibly a Lantean.
*'''Probe''' A hovering spherical device used for reconnaissance. One investigates M7G-677 in response to a location signal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Childhood's End&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Childhood's End|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another monitors the hunt of [[Ronon Dex]] on Sateda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sateda&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Sateda|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has similarities with the &quot;Kino&quot; which was discovered by the Destiny Expedition in SGU.
*'''Stun bomb''' Newly introduced weapon shaped like a ball, that generates a massive stunner discharge. Its range is shown to cover the entire [[Stargate Command|SGC]] facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Midway&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Midway|Atlantis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stun rod''' A rod separated into two pieces that, once connected, generate a stunner discharge that incapacitates everyone within at least a dozen meters except for the user.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Contact (Part 1)&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|First Contact (Part 1)|Atlantis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stunner''' Handheld weapons designed to incapacitate human prey for future feeding, and thus cause no significant physical damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspicion&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Suspicion|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three sizes of stunners have been shown: a small [[pistol]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt; a medium [[truncheon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;The Lost Boys&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Lost Boys|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a large rifle with a [[bayonet]]-type spike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rising&quot;/&gt; Some humans are more resistant to stunner blasts than others,&lt;ref name=&quot;Broken Ties&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Broken Ties|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and humans under the influence of Wraith feeding enzyme are either immune or extremely tolerant to its effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Siege, Part 3&quot;/&gt; The [[Atlantis Expedition]] has accumulated a cache of stunners from their encounters with the Wraith.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Eye&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Eye|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Subspace tracker''' An organic device that transmits a tracking signal through subspace, allowing targets to be tracked from many light-years away. Runners have these surgically implanted into their back, usually in or near their spinal columns, preventing easy removal and enabling the Wraith to easily keep track of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Runner&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Runner|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intergalactic Communication Device''' Constructed by a Wraith on Earth in a parallel universe. Used electricity from the main power grid of the US to send a message to other Wraith about the location of Earth. When activated, it also generates an enormous EM field that can cause blackouts miles away. Due to the immense power, the device also opened a small rift in the space-time continuum, carrying the message to other realities due to it being destroyed before the transmission was finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vegas&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Vegas|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other technology==
{{See also|Starships in Stargate}}
Various other technologies have been depicted in ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' that are significant to the plot, including:
*'''Atanik armband''' Legendary devices believed to be created by the extinct Ataniks. Worn on the forearm, they inject a virus into the user that vastly enhances speed and strength. They are discovered by the [[Tok'ra]] Anise, who brings them to the [[Stargate Command|SGC]] for testing as their effects are neutralized by [[Goa'uld]] symbiotes. [[SG-1]] undertakes a mission to destroy Apophis' advanced mothership under the armbands' influence, but discover that the effects wear off as the host acquires antibodies to the virus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Upgrades&quot;/&gt;
*'''Memory-grafting device''' Technology invented by the Galarans (at least particularity based and enhanced from other technologies left on their world), allowing one person's memories to be read, stored, and implanted seamlessly with human physiology. Earth expresses interest in the device due to its great military and professional potential, though it is shown that there is also the potential for abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collateral Damage&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Collateral Damage|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is later used by [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Cameron Mitchell]] to help a dying friend,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stronghold&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Stronghold|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to give Vala false memories so as to capture Adria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominion&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Dominion|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Link''' Sophisticated computer system that provides for the inhabitants of P3X-289, who live in a protective force-field due to an ecological disaster. The Link is found to be altering memories to keep its charges from learning that the force-field is shrinking and that it has been sending people outside to die so as to avoid overpopulation. The Link is disabled by [[SG-1]], and the people of P3X-289 resettled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revisions&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Revisions|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Mimic device''' Small devices used by aliens to impersonate [[Stargate Command|SGC]] personnel in an invasion of Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foothold&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Foothold|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the aliens are defeated, the devices are sent to Area 51 for study. They are stolen by the [[NID (Stargate)|NID]] and used to frame Jack O'Neill for an assassination attempt on Senator Kinsey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Smoke &amp; Mirrors|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Quantum mirror''' A portal made from [[naqahdah]], found on P3R-233, that allows access to parallel universes. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]]'s experience with the mirror gives Earth advance warning of Apophis' attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;There But For the Grace of God&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|There But For the Grace of God|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the mirror is stored at Area 51. It is used by alternate versions of Samantha Carter and Charles Kawalsky to flee from Goa'uld domination in their universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Point of View (Stargate SG-1)&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Point of View|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror is later destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ripple Effect&quot;/&gt;
*'''Tollan ion cannon''' The primary defense technology of the [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]]. They are ground-based weapons that can destroy a [[Ha'tak]] in a single shot,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pretense&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Pretense|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] devises shield modifications that render them useless. Under Goa'uld pressure, the Tollan offer ion cannon technology to Earth in exchange for trinium. However, [[Samantha Carter]] determines that it would be impractical for Earth to deploy an ion cannon network due to the number of cannons required.&lt;ref name=&quot;Between Two Fires&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Between Two Fires|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tollan phase device''' A small device developed by the Tollan which allows them to pass through solid matter such as walls or the iris protecting Earth's Stargate. The Tollan later incorporate this technology into a powerful bomb developed for the Goa'uld Tanith and were planned to be used to destroy Stargate Command before the Tollan rebelled against Tanith.
*'''Traveler pistol (Ronon's gun)''' Weapon carried by [[Ronon Dex]], first seen in {{sgcite|Runner|Atlantis}}. It has three settings that are indicated by color on the weapon: orange for stun, white for kill and red for incinerate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Progeny&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Progeny|Atlantis|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the weapon is still unknown, though the episode {{sgcite|Travelers|Atlantis}} shows the Travelers carrying the same type of weapons.  It is unknown whether the Travelers developed these weapons or simply scavenged them.
*'''Sentinel''' Advanced defensive device created by the Latonans, who have since rejected technology and forgotten its specifications. The device is inadvertently disabled by two NID agents seeking to study its technology for the defense of Earth, leaving Latona vulnerable. [[SG-1]] determines that the Sentinel must be bonded to a human operator to activate; one of the NID agents originally responsible volunteers in order to save Latona from Svarog.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sentinel&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|The Sentinel|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Touchstone''' A device on the planet Madrona that controls the weather, without which the weather becomes violent. In the episode {{sgcite|Touchstone}}, it is stolen by rogue [[NID (Stargate)|NID]] agents masquerading as [[Stargate Command|SGC]] personnel, and later recovered by SG-1.
