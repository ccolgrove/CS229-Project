This article includes current squads of Hungary U-20 and U-19 national football teams.

== The road to 2008 UEFA Euro U-19 ==

After 11 years, the Hungarian U-19 football team qualified to the EURO U-19 final tournament. At the [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification#Group 2|first round of qualifiers]] the team finished the top of the group, with 3 victories, against [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] (6-0), [[Wales national under-19 football team|Wales]] (3-1), and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] (2-1). After that, [[2008 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship elite qualification#Group 2|second round]] was much harder, but as a host of the Group 2 matches, the team played at home, in Hungary, and the athmosphere helped in times of need. The first match against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], was a 2-2 draw, but in the last 2 matches, the team could win, against [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] 2-1, and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] 1-0 and that was enough to qualify.
