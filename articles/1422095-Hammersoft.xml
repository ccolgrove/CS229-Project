==History==
Auville, Bickel, and Flaim grew up as friends in Bowie, Maryland. Auville and Flaim attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School; at the same time, Bickel met Bishop at DeMatha Catholic High School. Bickel and Flaim also attended the University of Maryland together.  After graduating from college, the foursome and other friends hung out and often shared living quarters. In 1995, the four began their broadcasting career as a hobby with a 30-minute [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show in Bowie featuring sports chat and irreverent humor.

The show focused on the interplay of the foursome, featuring guests such as [[Playboy]] models, rock notables, and local sports celebrities such as University of Maryland basketball coach [[Gary Williams]].  Their high local ratings lead to their national debut on May 18, 1999, airing on about 50 affiliates of [[Westwood One]]'s radio network.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss61999&quot;&gt;[http://www.junksweb.com/news/EEVkupZZVEUrBMqOug.shtml &quot;Called up to 'The Show'&quot; ''Street &amp; Smith's Sports Business Journal'' article (06/07/21999)]&lt;/ref&gt;  That syndication was short-lived, however. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Through the show's history it occupied a night slot from 7-11 p.m. and 8-midnight from mid-2001 until early 2002.  In October 2002, the show moved from WJFK to [[WHFS]] during the morning drive time slot.&lt;ref name=&quot;jw01&quot;/&gt; When WHFS changed formats from alternative rock to Spanish-language, the show returned to WJFK-FM in a lunchtime spot.  In 2006, the Junkies' show returned to the morning drive, replacing ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' when it ended its run on terrestrial radio.

==Events==
* '''Junkies Poker Open'''

* '''Unauthorized Redskins Pre-Game Show'''
Since the 2004 season, the Junkies have hosted a two-hour pregame show prior to the kick-off of each Washington Redskins game. The show is broadcast live from a Washington area restaurant or bar and airs on [[WJFK-FM]].  The show is considered &quot;unauthorized&quot; because they have continued doing the program even though WJFK no longer holds the rights to broadcast the team's games.

* '''Upersay Owlbay Party'''
The Junkies host a party for the [[NFL]] championship game at a Washington area restaurant or bar.  The name is based on a [[Pig Latin]] version of the phrase &quot;super bowl&quot; due to the NFL's [[Super_Bowl#NFL_trademark_issues|active pursuit of trademark issues with the Super Bowl name]].

* '''Junkies' Spring Break Party'''
An annual spring break themed party held at the State Theater in [[Falls Church, Virginia]].

* '''Sundress Sillies Party'''
First held in 2008, the Junkies host an annual end-of-summer party at the Backyard Bar &amp; Grille in [[Chantilly, Virginia]]. Women are encouraged to attend wearing a [[sundress]].  They also promote a &quot;V.I.P. section&quot; for women who do not wear underwear, but do not actively check to verify &quot;V.I.P.&quot; eligibility.

As of 2011 the Junkies were forced to change the name of the part to &quot;Summer Dress Party&quot; due to trademark issues with an undisclosed company.

==Controversy==
An interview with tennis player [[Justin Gimelstob]] made international headlines because of comments Gimelstob made about [[Anna Kournikova]] and other female tennis players. Gimelstob was reprimanded by his employer, [[Tennis Channel]], and made a donation to the Women's Sports Foundation as a result of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article4228384.ece Fault! Tennis star's sexist attack on Anna Kournikova was way over the line], ''The Times'', June 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
