On April 12, 2008, the White Team came from behind to beat the Blue Team 14-13 at [[Joe Aillet Stadium]]. Defense dominated the first half as neither team's offense could muster a score. With nine seconds remaining in the second quarter, the Blue Team's Jay Dudley blocked a Brad Oestricher field goal attempt, and Brian White recovered the ball and ran 71&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. The extra point was missed, and the Blue Team went into the locker room with a 6-0 halftime lead. In the third quarter, the Blue Team extended their lead to 13-0 on a trick play as TE Dennis Morris tossed a touchdown pass to WR Philip Beck. Just seconds into the fourth quarter, RB William Griffin rushed for a three-yard touchdown for the White Team's first score of the game. Later in the fourth quarter, QB Ross Jenkins connected on a thirty-yard touchdown pass to WR Phillip Livas to complete the White Team's 14-13 comeback win. LB Quin Harris led the White Team with four tackles including a sack. Josh Victorian had 3.5 tackles and pulled in an interception. The Blue Team's D'Anthony Smith had four tackles on the day with two sacks. Shawn Simmons led the Blue Team with 8.5 tackles. LB Jay Dudley had 5.5 tackles with a sack. Brian White added an interception to go with his return for a touchdown, and safety Deon Young added another interception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latechsports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/041208aaa.html |title=Late Rally Lifts White Team to Top  |publisher=Louisiana Tech University |accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
