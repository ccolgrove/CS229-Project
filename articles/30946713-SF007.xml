'''Argo''' was part of a project to make the [[Internet]] accessible to scholars in the Humanities at the [[University of Groningen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter20&quot; /&gt; The Argo [[web browser]] was created in August 1994 by [[Bert Bos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WWW3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=SIMPLE STYLE SHEETS  FOR SGML &amp; HTML  ON THE WEB|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/style.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=20 June 2010|author=[[Bert Bos]]|date=14 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There currently is no publicly available compiled version, although the source code still exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/Argo/browser/argo/ the download directory for the Argo files]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Argo browser was able to handle its own [[style sheet language]] called [[Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal]] (SSP) [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] mostly by [[Xlib]]/[[Xrm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WWW3&quot;/&gt; SSP was general enough to be able to applied to other [[markup language]]s in addition to [[HTML]]. In the development process of [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) Bos was one of the first people who decided to join [[HÃ¥kon Wium Lie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter20&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Chapter 20 - The CSS saga|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=23 June 2010|author=[[HÃ¥kon Wium Lie]]|coauthors=[[Bert Bos]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this early adoption SSP had other advanced features that could not be integrated in CSS1 and had to wait for CSS2.&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter20&quot; /&gt; [[Arena (web browser)|Arena]] and Argo were presented as a [[testbed]] at the [[World Wide Web Conference 3]] on 10â14 April 1995 in [[Darmstadt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WWW3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter20&quot; /&gt;

==Functionality==
Argo based on the [[W3A]], an [[Application programming interface|API]] for ''WWW browser applets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Home Page of Bert Bos|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=27 June 2010|author=[[Bert Bos]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The browser featured [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] modules, or &quot;[[applets]]&quot;, which allowed for the addition of new functionality without recompilation. Examples of such functionality provided by the applets includes adding support for the following:&lt;ref name=&quot;WWW3&quot; /&gt;

* [[Internet bookmark|Bookmarks]]/history
* [[Cache]]/[[Proxy server|proxy]] support
* [[File format|Data formats]] (e.g. [[ASCII]], [[GIF]], [[HTML]], [[JPEG]], [[XBM]], [[X PixMap|XPM]])
* [[E-mail client]]s (e.g. [[Mutt (e-mail client)|Mutt]], [[Pine (e-mail client)|Pine]])
* [[Communications protocol|Protocols]]: [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]],&lt;ref name=&quot;argo user commands&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Argo: user commands per mode|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/Argo/doc/Argo.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=27 June 2010|author=[[Bert Bos]]|date=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gopher (protocol)|gopher]],&lt;ref name=&quot;argo user commands&quot; /&gt; [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]],&lt;ref name=&quot;argo user commands&quot; /&gt; [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]],&lt;ref name=&quot;argo user commands&quot; /&gt; [[Wide area information server|WAIS]],&lt;ref name=&quot;argo user commands&quot; /&gt; [[File URI scheme|local files]]&lt;ref name=&quot;argo user commands&quot; /&gt;
* Graphical navigation

The browser's [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] depended on the modules to provide such functionality.

==Technical==
The browser was run on [[HP-UX]] and used dynamic loading to support its applets(plugins).
