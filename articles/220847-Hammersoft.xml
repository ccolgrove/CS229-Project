The '''hammer and sickle''' (â­) is a part of [[communist symbolism]] and its usage indicates an association with [[Communism]], a [[Communist party]], or a [[Communist state]]. It features a [[hammer]] and a [[sickle]] overlapping each other. The two tools are symbols of the industrial [[proletariat]] and the [[peasant]]ry; placing them together symbolizes the unity between industrial and agricultural workers. This emblem was conceived during the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. It is best known from having been incorporated into the [[red flag]] of the [[Soviet Union]], along with the [[Red star|Red Star]]. It has also been used in other flags and emblems.

==Soviet and Russian usage==
[[File:Hammer and sickle.svg|thumb|170px|The yellow on red version became a Soviet symbol that was also placed on the flag.]] 
The hammer and sickle was originally a hammer on a [[plough]], with the same meaning (unity of peasants and workers) as the better known hammer and sickle. The hammer and sickle, though in use since 1917/18, was not the official symbol until 1922, before which the original hammer and plough insignia was used by the Red Army and the Red Guard on uniforms, medals, caps, etc.

Later, the symbol was featured on the [[flag of the Soviet Union]], adopted in 1923 and finalized in the [[1924 Soviet Constitution]], and flags of the [[republics of the Soviet Union]] after 1924. Before this, the flags of Soviet republics tended to be a plain red field, with the golden text of the name of the respective republic superimposed on it, as stipulated in Article 90 of the [[1918 Soviet Constitution]].

* The [[Coat of Arms of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Coats of Arms of the Soviet Republics]] showed the hammer and sickle, which also appeared on the [[Red Star]] badge on the uniform cap of the [[Red Army]] uniform and in many other places.
* ''Serp i MÃ³lot'' ([[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]] of {{lang-ru|Ð¡ÐµÑÐ¿ Ð¸ Ð¼Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ñ}}, &quot;sickle and hammer&quot;) is the name of the [[Moscow Metallurgical Plant]].
* ''Serp i Molot'' is also the name of a stop on the [[electric railway]] line from Kurski [[railway station]] in [[Moscow]] to [[Gorki]], featured in [[Venedikt Erofeev]]'s novel, ''[[Moscow-Petushki]]''.

Some [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] have argued that the symbol, like others used in the Soviet Union, was actually a [[Russian Orthodox]] symbol that was used by the Communist Party to fill the religious needs that Communism was replacing as a new state &quot;religion.&quot; The symbol can be seen as a permutation of the [[Patriarchal cross|Russian Orthodox two-barred cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=David |last=Lempert |authorlink= |title=Daily Life in a Crumbling Empire: The Absorption of Russia into the World Economy |location= |publisher=Columbia University Press |series=Eastern European Monographs |year=1996 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==

A flag featuring a yellow hammer and sickle on a red field is flown commonly throughout [[Laos]], often side-by-side with the [[Flag of Laos|Laotian flag]].

Two federal subjects of the post-Soviet Russian Federation use the hammer and sickle in their symbols: the [[Vladimir Oblast]] has them on its flag and the [[Bryansk Oblast]] has them on its coat of arms, which is also the central element of its flag.

The former [[Soviet]] (now Russian) national airline, [[Aeroflot]], continues to use the hammer and sickle in its symbol.

The separatist government of [[Transnistria]] uses (with minor modifications) the flag and the emblem of the former [[Moldavian SSR]], which include the hammer and sickle. The flag can also be used without the hammer and sickle in some circumstances, for example on Transnistrian-issued [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]].

The [[Communist Party of China]] uses it as the party symbol. It is also used by Communist Parties in most countries.

The [[Maoist]] group, [[Shining Path]] in [[Peru]] uses it as part of its symbol.

A hammer and a sickle are both prominently included in the [[Coat of arms of Austria|Austrian coat of arms]], although they are not superimposed over each other and are not intended to represent communism, rather the union of the workers and the former aristocracy (represented by a crown) within the Austrian Republic.

==Variations of the symbol==

Many symbols having similar structures and messages to the original have been designed. For example, the [[flag of Angola|Angolan flag]] shows a segment of a [[gear|cog]], crossed by a [[machete]], and crowned with a [[red star|socialist star]]. In the logo of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]], a circle is formed by a half cog and a [[semicircle|semicircular]] sickle-blade. A hammer is laid directly over the sickle's handle with the hammer's [[Hammer#Designs and variations|head]] at the logo's center. The logo of the [[Communist Party of Turkey (current)|Communist Party of Turkey]] consists of half a cog wheel crossed by a hammer, with a star on the top. The [[Communist Party of Canada]] symbol features a [[gear]] entwined with a circular sheath of [[wheat]].

Tools represented in other designs include: the [[Ink brush|brush]], [[sickle]], and hammer of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]]; the [[spade]], [[torch|flaming torch]], and hoe [[Labour Party (UK)#The split under MacDonald|used prior to 1984]] by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] (which was a [[socialism|socialist]] and not a communist party); the [[monkey wrench]] and [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] of the [[Earth First!]] movement; the [[pickaxe]] and [[rifle]] used in [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|communist Albania]]; and the hammer and [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]] of the emblem of the [[East Germany|East German]] flag. The [[Far Eastern Republic]] of Russia used an [[anchor]] crossed over a spade or pickaxe, symbolising the union of the fishermen and miners. The [[Fourth International]], founded by [[Trotsky]], uses a hammer and sickle symbol on which the number '4' is superimposed. The Trotskyist [[League for the Fifth International]] merges a hammer with the number '5', using the number's lower arch to form the sickle.

The [[Communist Party of Britain]] uses the hammer and [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|dove symbol]]. Designed in 1988 by Mikhal Boncza, it is intended to highlight the party's connection to the peace movement. It is usually used in conjunction with the hammer and sickle, and appears on all of the CPB's publications. Some members of the CPB prefer one symbol over the other, although the party's 1994 congress reaffirmed the hammer and dove's position as the official emblem of the Party. Similarly, the [[Communist Party of Israel]] uses a dove over the hammer and sickle as its symbol. The flag of the [[Guadeloupe Communist Party|Communist Party of Guadeloupe]] uses a sickle, turned to look like a [[capital letters|majuscule 'G']], to represent [[Guadeloupe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/gp%7Dpcg.html Flags of the World]&lt;/ref&gt;

With differing intent, the eagle on the [[Coat of Arms of Austria|Austrian flag]] holds a [[Or (heraldry)|golden]] hammer in its left [[claw|talon]], and a golden sickle in its right talon. The tools were not meant to be references to communism (indeed, the eagle also wears a golden [[crown (headgear)|crown]]) but, rather, were meant to represent the [[industry|industrial]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] laborers, united with the former [[aristocracy]], in one [[republic]]an democracy.

The [[flag of Burma]], from 1974â2010, featured a bushel of [[rice]] superimposed on a [[cogwheel]].

==Ban on the symbol==
[[File:BWHammerSickle.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An artistic rendering of the hammer and sickle.]]
The hammer and sickle remains a popular symbol amongst [[communism|communists]] and certain other [[leftist]]s worldwide. In most countries, there are no laws restricting the use of the symbol, so it is legal to display it publicly. This includes the majority of [[Europe]]an countries, especially those that have large Communist Parties with a significant amount of popular support (for example [[France]], [[Greece]] and [[Russia]]).

However, in several countries in [[Eastern Europe]] where the communist movement is small or non-existent, there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a &quot;[[totalitarian]] and criminal ideology,&quot; and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other communist symbols such as the [[Red Star]] is considered a criminal offence. [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hungarian_ban&quot;&gt;Hungarian Criminal Code 269/B.Â§ (1993.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/europe/7459976.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols | date=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; have banned the symbol along with other communist symbols. A similar law was considered in [[Estonia]], but eventually failed in a parliamentary committee. The foreign ministers of Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic called for an [[EU]]-wide ban on communist symbols in 2010, urging the EU &quot;to criminalize the approval, denial or belittling of communist crimes&quot; and stating that &quot;the denial of such crimes should be treated the same way as the denial of the Holocaust and must be banned by law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://rt.com/politics/european-commission-communist-crimes/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Hungarian politician Attila Vajnai was arrested, handcuffed and fined for wearing a red star on his lapel during a demonstration. He appealed his sentence to the [[European Court of Human Rights]], which decided that the ban was a violation of the freedom of expression, calling the Hungarian ban &quot;indiscriminate&quot; and &quot;too broad.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,663154,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;
