[[File:Espadon-Morges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Swiss [[longsword]], 15th or 16th century]]
A '''sword''' is a [[blade]]d weapon   (''edged weapon'') used  primarily for [[Melee weapon|cutting or thrusting]]. The precise definition of the term varies with the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. In the most narrow sense, a sword  consists of a [[blade]] with one or two edges, a [[hilt]], and a [[crossguard]].
But in some cases the term may also refer to weapons without crossguard, or with only a single edge ([[backsword]]).

The basic principles of swordsmanship have remained fairly constant through the centuries, but the actual techniques vary among cultures and periods as a result of the differences in blade design and purpose.
The names given to many swords in [[mythology]], [[literature]], and [[history]] reflect the high prestige of the weapon and the wealth of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Cirlot |year=2002 |title=A Dictionary of Symbols |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |pages=323â325 |isbn=0486425231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sword is said to be the emblem of military honor and should incite the bearer to a just and generous pursuit of honor and virtue. It is symbolic of liberty and strength. In the Middle Ages, the sword was often used as a symbol of the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp/keyword.sword/qx/symbolism_details.htm |title=Symbolism - sword |publisher=Swyrich Corporation |accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the sword developed in the [[Bronze Age]], evolving from the [[dagger]]; the [[Bronze Age sword|earliest specimens]] date to ca. 1600 BC. The [[Iron Age sword]] remained fairly short and without a crossguard. The [[spatha]] as it developed in the [[Late Roman army]] became the predecessor of the [[European sword]] of the Middle Ages, at first adopted as the [[Migration period sword]], and only in the [[High Middle Ages]] developed into the classical [[Arming sword]] with crossguard.
In the [[Early Modern period]], the sword developed into the [[rapier]] and eventually the [[smallsword]], surviving into the 18th century only in the role of [[European dueling sword|dueling weapon]]. By the 19th century, swords were reduced to the status of either [[ceremonial weapon]] or [[practice weapon|sport equipment]] in [[fencing]].

Non-European weapons called &quot;sword&quot; include [[single-edged]] weapons such as  the Middle Eastern [[saif]], the Chinese [[dao (sword)|dao]] and the related Japanese [[katana]]; these would more accurately be described as [[sabre]]s or [[backsword]]s, but their high prestige in their respective cultures favoured the use of &quot;sword&quot;. 
The Chinese [[jian]] is an example of a non-European double-edged sword, like the European models derived from the double-edged [[Iron Age sword]].

The word ''[[:wikt:sword|sword]]'' comes from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[wikt:sweord|sweord]]'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''swert'', [[Old Norse]] ''sverÃ°'', from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*swer-'' &quot;to wound, to cut&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sword |title=Online Etymology Dictionary 'Sword' |first=Douglas |last=Harper |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bronze Age====
{{Main|Bronze Age sword}}

[[Image:Apa Schwerter.jpg|thumb|Apa type swords, 17th century BC.]]
The sword developed from the [[dagger]] when the construction of longer blades became possible, from the late 3rd millennium BC in the Middle East, first in arsenic copper, then in tin-bronze. The oldest sword-like weapons are found at [[Arslantepe]], [[Turkey]], and date to around 3300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=175686&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Archaeologists from Rome's La Sapienza University have announced the discovery of what they believe are the world's oldest swords |publisher=The Times Higher Education |date=28 March 2003 |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is generally considered that these are longer daggers, and not the first ancestors of swords. Sword blades longer than {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} were rare and not practical until the late Bronze Age because at longer lengths, the [[tensile strength]] of [[bronze]] starts to decrease radically, and consequently longer blades would bend easily. It was not until the development of stronger alloys such as [[steel]], and improved [[heat treatment]] processes that longswords became practical for [[combat]]. They were also used as decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drews |first=Robert |year=1995 |title=The end of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=revised |pages=197â204 |isbn=0691025916}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Nebra Schwerter.jpg|thumb|The swords found together with the [[Nebra skydisk]], ca. 1600 BC.]]

The hilt, either from organic materials or bronze (the latter often highly decorated with spiral patterns, for example), at first simply allowed a firm grip and prevented the hand from slipping onto the blade when executing a thrust or the sword slipping  out of the hand in a cut. Some of the early swords typically had small and slender  blades intended for thrusting. Later swords were broader and were both cutting and thrusting weapons. A typical variant for European swords is the leaf-shaped blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, in the [[British Isles]] and [[Ireland]] in particular. Robert Drews linked the Naue Type II Swords, which spread from Southern Europe into the Mediterranean, with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclectichistorian.net/Griffzungenschwert/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080318192233/http://www.eclectichistorian.net/Griffzungenschwert/ |archivedate=18 March 2008 |title=The Naue Type II Sword |publisher=Eclectichistorian.net |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bronze-age-craft.com/Naue_II.htm |title=The Naue II Sword |last=Hoagland |first=Brock |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese swords|Sword production in China]] is attested from the Bronze Age [[Shang Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chang |first=K. C.|year=1982 |title=Studies of Shang Archaeology |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=6â7|isbn=0300035780}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the Warring States period and Qin Dynasty. Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high tin edges over softer, lower tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see [[sword of Goujian]]). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high tin bronze (17â21% tin) which is very hard and breaks if stressed too far, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends if stressed too far. Although iron swords were made alongside bronze, it was not until the early [[Han period]] that iron completely replaced bronze.&lt;ref name=HanIron/&gt;

In South Asia earliest available [[Bronze age sword]]s of copper were discovered in the [[Harappa]]n sites, in present-day Pakistan, and date back to 2300 BC. Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the [[Ganges]]-[[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] [[Doab]] region of [[Bangladesh]], consisting of [[bronze]] but more commonly [[copper]].&lt;ref name=allchin111-114&gt;Allchin, pp. 111â114&lt;/ref&gt; Diverse specimens have been discovered in [[Fatehgarh]], where there are several varieties of hilt.&lt;ref name=allchin111-114/&gt; These swords have been variously dated to times between 1700â1400 BC, but were probably used more notably in the opening centuries of the 1st millennium BC.&lt;ref name=allchin111-114/&gt;

====Iron Age====
[[Image:Hallstatt culture swords ramsauer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|19th century illustration of [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] swords]]
{{Main|Iron Age sword}}

[[Iron]] became increasingly common from the 13th century BC, mainly due to the [[Bronze Age collapse|collapse of the bronze producing Civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Theodore A. |last=Wertime |coauthor=J. D. Muhly |year=1980 |title=The Coming of the Age of Iron |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300024258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hittites]], the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]&lt;ref&gt;Burton p.104&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Proto-Celtic]] [[Hallstatt culture]] (8th century BC) figured among the early users of iron swords. Iron has the advantage of mass-production due to the wider availability of the raw material. Early iron swords were not comparable to later [[steel]] blades. The iron was not [[quenching|quench-hardened]] although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were at times fully equipped with bronze weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greco-Roman Antiquity====
{{see|Migration period sword}}
By the time of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the Parthian and Sassanid Empires in Iran, iron swords were common. The Greek [[xiphos]] and the Roman [[gladius]] are typical examples of the type, measuring some {{convert|60|to|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanson |first=Victor Davis |year=1993 |title=Hoplites: the classical Greek battle experience |publisher=Routledge Publishing |pages=25â27 |isbn=0415098165 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=K0LMLn_CA08C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldsworthy |first=Adrian Keith |year=1998 |title=The Roman army at war: 100 BC-AD 200 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=216â217 |isbn=0198150903 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=55KE-nNtTRUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA217#v=onepage |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late [[Roman Empire]] introduced the longer [[spatha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fields |first=Nic |year=2009 |title=The Roman Army of the Principate 27 BCE-CE 117 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |pages=30â31 |isbn=1846033861 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=v_ZVubRc1mQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the term for its wielder, [[spatharius]], became a court rank in Constantinople), and from this time, the term ''[[longsword]]'' is applied to swords comparatively long for their respective periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mantello |first=Frank Anthony C. |coauthor=Rigg, A.

Swords from the Parthian and Sassanian Empires were quite long, the blades on some late Sassanian swords being just under a metre long. 

Swords were also used to administer various [[physical punishment]]s, such as non-surgical [[amputation]] or [[capital punishment]] by decapitation. The use of a sword, an honorable weapon, was regarded in Europe since [[Roman Republic|Roman times]] as a privilege reserved for the [[nobility]] and the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;Naish p.39&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]] mentions swords of Indian iron and steel being exported from India to [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prasad, chapter IX&quot;&gt;Prasad, chapter IX&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lanka]]n and [[India]]n Blades made of [[Damascus steel]] also found their way into [[Persia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prasad, chapter IX&quot;/&gt;

Chinese steel swords made their first appearance in the later part of the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]], but were not widely used until the 3rd century BC [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=HanIron&gt;{{cite web |last=Cao |first=Hangang |title=A Study of Chinese Weapons Cast During Pre-Qin and Han Periods in the Central Plains of China |url=http://www.arscives.com/historysteel/cn.article.htm |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Chinese [[Dao (sword)|Dao]] (å [[pinyin]] dÄo) is single-edged, sometimes translated as [[sabre]] or [[broadsword]], and the [[Jian]] (åorå [[pinyin]] jiÃ n) is double-edged.

====Europe and the Middle East====

[[File:Morgan-bible-fl-29.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Battle scene from the [[Morgan Bible of Louis IX]] showing 13th century swords]]
During the [[Middle Ages]] sword technology improved, and the sword became a very advanced weapon. It was frequently used by men in battle, particularly during an attack.
The spatha type remained popular throughout the [[Migration period]] and well into the Middle Ages. [[Vendel Age]] spathas were decorated with Germanic artwork (not unlike the Germanic [[bracteate]]s fashioned after Roman coins). The [[Viking Age]] saw again a more standardized production, but the basic design remained indebted to the spatha.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, Lloyd Robert(2006). ''The archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. CE 400â1200''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 93â95. ISBN 0521547407
&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 10th century, the use of properly quenched hardened and tempered steel started to become much more common than in previous periods. The Frankish 'Ulfberht' blades (the name of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ee1799vFgnAC&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Ulfberht&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q=Ulfberht&amp;f=false |title=Writing society and culture in early Rus, c. 950â1300 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=109 |first=Simon |last=Franklin |isbn=0511030258}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles the Bald]] tried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by [[Vikings]] in raids against the [[Franks]].
[[Wootz steel]] which is also known as [[Damascus steel]] was a unique and highly prized steel developed on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a globular cementite in a matrix of pearlite. The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.{{#tag:ref|Maryon, Herbert(1960).

It was only from the 11th century that [[Normans|Norman]] swords began to develop the quillons or [[crossguard]]. During the [[Crusades]] of the 12th to 13th century, this [[Cruciform#Cruciform sword|cruciform]] type of [[arming sword]] remained essentially stable, with variations mainly concerning the shape of the [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]]. These swords were designed as cutting weapons, although effective points were becoming common to counter improvements in armour, especially the 14th century change from [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]] to [[plate armour]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeep, John M.(2001). ''Medieval Germany: an encyclopedia''. Routledge publishing. p.802, ISBN 0824076443
&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the 14th century, with the growing use of more advanced armor, that the Hand and a half sword, also known as a &quot;bastard sword&quot;, came into being. It had an extended grip that meant it could be used with either one or two hands. Though these swords did not provide a full two-hand grip they allowed their wielders to hold a [[shield]] or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to use it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow.&lt;ref name=Gravett&gt;Gravett, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of curved swords, or [[scimitars]] (and other regional variants as the [[arab people|Arabian]] [[saif]], the [[Persia]]n [[shamshir]] and the [[turkic people|Turkic]] [[kilij]]) is from the 9th century, when it was used among soldiers in the [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] region of [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daily life in the medieval Islamic world|author=James E.

As steel technology improved, single-edged weapons became popular throughout Asia. Derived from the [[China|Chinese]] [[Jian]] or [[dao (broadsword)|dao]], the [[Korea]]n [[hwandudaedo]] are known from the early medieval [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]]. Production of the [[Japan]]ese [[tachi]], a precursor to the [[katana]], is recorded from ca. 900 AD (see [[Japanese sword]]).&lt;ref&gt;Friday, Karl F.(2004).

&lt;/ref&gt;
Japan was famous for the swords it forged in the early 13th century for the class of warrior-nobility known as the samurai.  A samurai's primary weapon was the katana, which was used for infantry. Other infantry swords included: [[wakizashi]] (shorter companion sword for katana), [[nodachi]], [[kubikiri]], [[tantÅ]] and [[hachiwara]].  Cavalry swords were the [[tachi]] and ancient tachi.  Temple swords included the one-handed tachi and [[ChokutÅ]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeep, John M.(1998). ''The connoisseur's book of Japanese swords''. Kodansha International publishing.

The [[Talwar]] is a type of curved sword that was introduced to India in the 13th century by invading Muslim conquerors and was adopted by communities who favoured the sword as their main weapon, including the Rajputs, Marathas and Sikhs.

===Late Middle Ages and Renaissance===

{{Main|Longsword|ZweihÃ¤nder}}From around 1300 to 1500, in concert with improved [[armour]], innovative sword designs evolved more and more rapidly. The main transition was the lengthening of the grip, allowing two-handed use, and a longer blade. By 1400, this type of sword, at the time called ''[[longsword|langes Schwert]]'' (longsword) or ''spadone'', was common, and a number of 15th and 16th century ''[[Fechtbuch|FechtbÃ¼cher]]'' offering instructions on their use survive. Another variant was the specialized armour-piercing swords of the [[estoc]] type. The [[longsword]] became popular due to its extreme reach and cutting and thrusting abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David|last=Lindholm|coauthor=Nicolle, David |title=The Scandinavian Baltic Crusades 1100â1500 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |year=2007 |page=178 |isbn=1841769886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Battle of Kappel detail.jpg|frame|left|1548 depiction of a ZweihÃ¤nder used against pikes in the [[Battle of Kappel]]]]

The [[estoc]] became popular because of its ability to thrust into the gaps between plates of armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Leonid |last=Tarassuk |coauthor=Blair, Claude |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms &amp; Weapons: The Most Comprehensive Reference Work Ever Published on Arms and Armor from Prehistoric Times to the Present â with Over 1,200 Illustrations |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |year=1982 |page=491 |isbn=067142257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grip was sometimes wrapped in wire or coarse animal hide to provide a better grip and to make it harder to knock a sword out of the user's hand.&lt;ref name=McLean&gt;McLean, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that some zweihander swords were over {{convert|6|ft|m}} long, with the one ascribed to [[Frisia]]n warrior [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] being {{convert|2.13|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=out|disp=flip}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunseradiel.nl/index.php?simaction=content&amp;pagid=289&amp;mediumid=1 |publisher=Gemeente WÃ»nseradiel |title=Greate Pier fan WÃ»nseradiel |language=West Frisian |accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gigantic blade length was perfectly designed for manipulating and pushing away enemy pole-arms, which were major weapons around this time, in both Germany and Eastern Europe. Doppelsoldners also used katzbalgers, which means 'cat-gutter'. The katzbalger's S-shaped guard and {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} blade made it perfect for bringing in when the fighting became too close to use a zweihander.&lt;ref name=Landsknechts&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Douglas |year=1976 |title=The Landsknechts |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=11 |isbn=0850452589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian use of swords became increasingly common during the late Renaissance, with duels being a preferred way to honorably settle disputes. The practice of civilian dueling,  with specifically designed civilian swords such as the Italian [[Cinquedea]] and Swiss [[Baselard]], became so popular that according to one scholar: &quot;In France during the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1589â1610), more than 4,000 French aristocrats were killed in duels in an eighteen-year period...During the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] (1610â1643)...in a twenty-year period 8,000 pardons were issued for murders associated with duels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The [[side-sword]] was a type of war sword used by infantry during the [[Renaissance]] of [[Europe]]. This sword was a direct descendant of the [[arming sword]]. Quite popular between the 16th and 17th centuries, they were ideal for handling the mix of armored and unarmored opponents of that time.  A new technique of placing one's finger on the [[ricasso]] to improve the grip (a practice that would continue in the [[rapier]]) led to the production of hilts with a guard for the finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myarmoury.com/review_dw_ss.html|title=Darkwood Armory Side Sword|publisher=myArmoury.com|date= |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This sword design eventually led to the development of the civilian [[rapier]], but it was not replaced by it, and the side-sword continued to be used during the rapier's lifetime. As it could be used for both cutting and thrusting, the term ''cut and thrust'' sword is sometimes used interchangeably with side-sword.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''cut &amp; thrust'' is a non-historical classification first used within The [[Association for Renaissance Martial Arts]] to differentiate cutting swords with compound hilts from true rapiers.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of note is that as rapiers became more popular, attempts were made to hybridize the blade, sacrificing the effectiveness found in each unique weapon design. These are still considered side-swords and are sometimes labeled ''sword rapier'' or ''cutting rapier'' by modern collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thearma.org/terms4.htm|title=Medieval &amp; Renaissance Sword Forms and Companion Implements|publisher=The association for Renaissance Martial Arts|date= |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of note, side-swords used in conjunction with [[buckler]]s became so popular that it caused the term [[swashbuckler]] to be coined. This word stems from the new fighting style of the side-sword and buckler which was filled with much &quot;swashing and making a noise on the buckler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.fencing.net/product_p/ca-2279.htm|title= Practical Side Sword|publisher=Fencing.net|date= |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Ottoman Empire]], the use of a curved sabre called the [[Yatagan]] started in the mid-16th century. It would become the weapon of choice for many in [[Turkey]] and the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The sword in this time period was the most personal weapon, the most prestigious, and the most versatile for close combat, but it came to decline in military use as technology, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[firearms]] changed warfare. However, it maintained a key role in civilian self-defense.&lt;ref name =Britannica/&gt;

===Early Modern period===
{{see|Rapier|Backsword|Smallsword|Sabre}}

The [[rapier]] is believed to have evolved either from the Spanish ''[[espada ropera]]'' or from the swords of the Italian nobility somewhere in the later part of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green p.583-584&lt;/ref&gt; The rapier differed from most earlier swords in that it was not a military weapon but a primarily civilian sword. Both the rapier and the Italian [[schiavona]] developed the crossguard into a [[basket-hilted sword|basket-shaped guard]] for hand protection.&lt;ref name=Oakeshott/&gt; During the 17th and 18th centuries, the shorter [[smallsword]] became an essential fashion accessory in European countries and the New World, though in some places such as the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] large swords as the basket-hilted broadsword were preferred, and most wealthy men and military officers carried one slung from a belt. Both the smallsword and the rapier remained popular [[European dueling sword|dueling swords]] well into the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Norman,B.;Vesey,A.(1980). ''The rapier and small-sword, 1460â1820''. Arms and Armour Press. ISBN 0405130899&lt;/ref&gt;

As the wearing of swords fell out of fashion, [[walking stick (device)|canes]] took their place in a gentleman's wardrobe. This developed to the gentlemen in the Victorian era to use the [[umbrella]]. Some examples of canesâthose known as sword canes or [[swordstick]]sâincorporate a concealed blade. The [[France|French]] [[martial art]] ''[[la canne]]'' developed to fight with canes and swordsticks and has now evolved into a sport. The English martial art [[singlestick]] is very similar.

===Modern history===
{{see|ÃpÃ©e|Sword replica}}
Towards the end of its useful life, the sword served more as a weapon of self-defense than for use on the battlefield, and the military importance of swords steadily decreased during the [[Modern Age]]. Even as a personal sidearm, the sword began to lose its preeminence in the early 19th century, paralleling the development of reliable [[handgun]]s.&lt;ref name =Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/577385/sword |title=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica-&quot;Sword&quot; |publisher=The EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|date= |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, swords were still used in combat, especially in [[Colonial War]]s between native populations and [[Colonial Empire]]s. For example, during the [[Aceh War]] the [[Aceh Sultanate|Acehnese]] [[Klewang]]s, a sword similar to the machete, proved very effective in close quarters combat with Dutch troops, leading the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] to adopt a heavy cutlass, also called klewang (very similar in appearance to the US Navy Model 1917 Cutlass) to counter it. Mobile troops armed with [[carbine]]s and klewangs succeeded in suppressing Aceh resistance where traditional infantry with [[rifle]] and [[bayonet]] had failed. From that time on until the 1950s the [[Royal Dutch East Indies Army]], Royal Dutch Army, Royal Dutch Navy and Dutch police used these cutlasses called Klewang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Jack Churchill leading training charge with sword.jpg|thumb|British Major [[Jack Churchill]] (far right) leads a training exercise, sword in hand, in [[World War II]].]]
Swords continued in use, but were increasingly limited to military commissioned [[officer (armed forces)|officers']] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s' ceremonial [[uniform]]s, although most armies retained heavy cavalry until well after [[World War I]]. For example, the British Army formally adopted a completely new design of [[1908 and 1912 Pattern British Army Cavalry Swords|cavalry sword]] in 1908, almost the last change in British Army weapons before the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=John |year=1966 |title=British Military Swords from 1800 to the Present Day |publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co. |isbn=0090812018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of World War I, in August 1914, infantry officers in all combatant armies still carried swords as part of their field equipment. The high visibility and limited practical use of the weapon however led to it being abandoned within weeks, although most mounted cavalry continued to carry sabres throughout the War. In China troops used the long anti-cavalry [[Miao dao]] well into the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The last units of British heavy cavalry switched to using [[armoured vehicle]]s as late as 1938. Swords and other dedicated melee weapons were used occasionally by many countries during [[World War II]], but typically as a secondary weapon as they were outclassed by coexisting [[firearms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Thomas M. |year=2006 |title=German Swords of World War II â A Photographic Reference Vol.3: DLV, Diplomats, Customs, Police and Fire, Justice, Mining, Railway, Etc. |publisher=Schiffer Pub Ltd |isbn=0764324322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Youens |first=Michael |coauthor=Warner, Philip |year=1973 |title=Japanese Army of World War II |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=0850451183 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Zk8bF_ShpsoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Mike |year=1998 |title=Battles of World War II |publisher=ABDO Publishing |isbn=1562398040 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=OYVwusIBWPEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of [[sword replica|replicas]] of historical swords originates with 19th century [[historicism (art)|historicism]].&lt;ref name=Historicism&gt;{{cite book |author=Dov M. Gabbayâ, Anthonie Meijersâ, Paul Thagardâ, John Woods |year=2009 |title=Philosophy of Technology and Engineering Sciences |publisher=Elsevier âPublishing |page=1208 |isbn=0444516670}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary replicas can range from cheap factory produced look-alikes to exact recreations of individual artifacts, including an approximation of the historical production methods.

Some kinds of swords are still commonly used today as weapons, often as a side arm for military infantry. The Japanese katana, wakizashi and tanto are carried by some infantry and officers in Japan and other parts of Asia and the [[kukri]] is the official melee weapon for India. Other swords in use today are the [[sabre]], the [[scimitar]], the [[shortsword]] and the [[machete]].&lt;ref name=Historicism&gt;{{cite book |last=Chappellâ |first=Mike |year=1993 |title=The Gurkhas |pages=31â32 |isbn=1855323575 |publisher=Osprey Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], some rebels have been seen armed with swords as either primary or secondary weapons. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl9_yj4OG3E&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceremonial use===
Swords are commonly worn as a [[ceremonial weapon|ceremonial item]] in many military and naval services throughout the world. Occasions to wear swords include any event in dress uniforms where the rank-and-file carry arms: [[parade]]s, reviews, [[Military tattoo|tattoos]], and changes of command. They are also commonly worn for officers' weddings, and when wearing dress uniforms to churchâalthough they are rarely actually worn in the church itself. 

In the British forces they are also worn for any appearance at [[Court (royal)|Court]]. In the [[United States]], every Naval officer at or above the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]] is required to own a sword, which can be prescribed for any formal outdoor ceremonial occasion; they are normally worn for changes of command and parades. For some Navy parades, [[cutlasses]] are issued to [[Petty Officers]] and [[Chief Petty Officer]]s. 

In the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] every officer must own a sword, which are prescribed for formal parades and other ceremonies where dress uniforms are worn and the rank-and-file are under arms. On these occasions depending on their billet, Marine Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (E-6 and above) may also be required to carry swords, which have hilts of a pattern similar to U.S. Naval officers' swords but are actually [[sabre]]s. The USMC Model 1859 NCO Sword is the longest continuously-issued edged weapon in the U.S. inventory

The Marine officer swords are of the [[Mameluke sword|Mameluke]] pattern which was adopted in 1825 in recognition of the Marines' key role in the capture of the [[Tripoli#The_Barbary_Wars|Tripolitan]] city of [[Battle of Derna|Derna]] during the [[First Barbary War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Roffeâ |title=United States Marine Corps |year=1972 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=5 |isbn=0850451159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken out of issue for approximately 20 years from 1855 go 1875, it was restored to service in the year of the Corps' centennial and has remained in issue since.

==Morphology==
The sword consists of the [[blade]] and the [[hilt]].
The term ''[[scabbard]]'' applies to the cover for the sword blade when not in use.

===Blade===
{{main|Sword blade}}
====Double-edged blades====
[[File:Sword parts.svg|right]]
The blade may have grooves known as [[fuller (weapon)|fullers]] for lightening the blade while allowing it to retain its strength and stiffness, similar to the effect produced by a [[I-beam|steel I-beam]] used in construction. The blade may taper more or less sharply towards a point, used for thrusting. The part of the blade between the [[Center of Percussion]] (CoP) and the point is called the ''foible'' (weak) of the blade, and that between the [[Center of balance (sword)|Center of Balance]] (CoB) and the hilt is the ''forte'' (strong). The section in between the CoP and the CoB is the ''middle''. The ''[[ricasso]]'' or ''shoulder'' identifies a short section of blade immediately forward of the guard that is left completely unsharpened, and can be gripped with a finger to increase tip control. Many swords have no ricasso. On some large weapons, such as the [[Germany|German]] ''[[ZweihÃ¤nder]]'', a metal cover surrounded the ricasso, and a swordsman might grip it in one hand to wield the weapon more easily in close-quarter combat.&lt;ref name=Landsknechts/&gt; 
The ricasso normally bears the [[trademark|maker's mark]]. 

====Tang====
* In the case of a rat-tail tang, the maker welds a thin rod to the end of the blade at the crossguard; this rod goes through the grip.&lt;ref name=TangTypes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gungfu.com/cart-htm/swords_tang_types.htm |title=Tang Types of a Sword |publisher=gungfu.com |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name=Medieval&gt;Pearce, Michael 'Tinker'(2007). ''The Medieval Sword in the Modern World''. Lulu.com, pp.44-45, ISBN 1430328010&lt;/ref&gt;
* In traditional construction, Swordsmiths [[peening|peened]] such tangs over the end of the pommel, or occasionally welded the hilt furniture to the tang and threaded the end for screwing on a pommel. This style is often referred to as a &quot;narrow&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot; tang. Modern, less traditional, replicas often feature a threaded pommel or a pommel nut which holds the hilt together and allows dismantling.&lt;ref name=Medieval/&gt;
* In a &quot;full&quot; tang (most commonly used in knives and [[machete]]s), the tang has about the same width as the blade, and is generally the same shape as the grip.&lt;ref name=TangTypes/&gt; In European or Asian swords sold today, many advertised &quot;full&quot; tangs may actually involve a forged rat-tail tang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;!--does not belong under &quot;blade&quot;. Also, only applies to  late medieval European swords.
At the base of the blade, a flap of leather called the ''Chappe'' can be attached to a sword's [[crossguard]], which serves to protect the mouth of the scabbard and prevent water from entering. This is also called a ''Rain Guard''.&lt;ref&gt;Burton,p.124&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

On Japanese blades, the maker's mark appears on the [[tang (weaponry)|tang]]  under the grip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yumoto |first=John M. |year=1979 |title=The Samurai sword: a handbook |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |page=137 |isbn=0804805091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Single-edged blades====
[[Single-edged]] blades do not fall under the term &quot;sword&quot; in the narrow sense (see [[sabre]], [[scimitar]]), but are often included in a more loose meaning of the term. These blades  often have a secondary &quot;false edge&quot; near the tip.&lt;ref&gt;Evangelista, Page 223&lt;/ref&gt;



[[File:Rapier mg 3370-no shadows.jpg|left|thumb|Hilt of a rapier. In this case, with a [[Basket-hilted sword|basket shaped hilt]]]]

===Hilt===
[[File:Sword of Umar ibn al-Khittab-mohammad adil rais.JPG|thumb|145px|Sword of Caliph Umar, with later hilt.]]
The [[hilt]] is the collective term for the parts allowing for the handling and control of the blade; these consist of the [[Hilt#Grip|grip]], the [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]], and a simple or elaborate [[Guard (weapon)|guard]], which in post-[[Viking Age]] swords could consist of only a [[crossguard]] (called a [[cruciform]] hilt or [[quillons]]). In addition to improving the sword's balance and grip, the pommel can also be used as a blunt instrument at close range, and its weight affects the center of percussion. It may also have a ''[[Hilt#Sword knot|sword knot]]'' or ''[[Hilt#Sword knot|tassel]]''. By the 17th century, with the growing use of firearms and the accompanying decline in the use of [[armour]], many [[rapier]]s and [[European dueling sword|dueling swords]] had developed elaborate basket hilts, which protect the palm of the wielder and rendered the [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Eduard(2004). ''Swords and daggers: an illustrated handbook''. Courier Dover Publications, p.13, ISBN 0486433927&lt;/ref&gt;  

The [[tang (weaponry)|tang]] consists of the extension of the blade structure through the hilt.

==Sword scabbards and suspension==
{{main|scabbard}}
Common accessories to the sword include the [[scabbard]], as well as the ''sword belt''.

*'''Scabbard''': The scabbard, also known as the '''Sheath''', is a protective cover often provided for the sword blade. Over the millennia, scabbards have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The metal fitting where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the '''throat''', which is often part of a larger scabbard '''mount''', or '''locket''', that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal '''tip''', or '''chape''', which on both leather and metal scabbards is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a '''drag''', or '''shoe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robsonââ, Brian(1975). ''Swords of the British Army: the regulation patterns, 1788â1914''. Arms and Armour Press, p. 10, ISBN 0901721336&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Sword belt''': The sword belt is a [[belt (clothing)|belt]] with an attachment for the sword, used to carry it when not in use. It is usually fixed to the scabbard of the sword, providing a fast means of drawing the sword in battle. Examples of sword belts include the [[Balteus (sword belt)|Balteus]] used by the [[Roman legionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Smithâ, pp.133â134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
{{Main|Types of swords}}
Swords can fall into categories of varying scope. The main distinguishing characteristics include blade shape (cross-section, taper, and length), shape and size of the hilt and pommel, age, and place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myarmoury.com/feature_geibig.html|title=The Sword Typology of Alfred Geibig |publisher=myarmoury.com |date= |accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively comprehensive [[Oakeshott typology]] was created by historian and illustrator [[Ewart Oakeshott]] as a way to define and catalogue swords based on physical form, though a rough sense of chronology is apparent. However, this typology does not set forth a prototypical definition for the longsword. Instead, it divides the broad field of weaponry into many exclusive types based on their predominant physical characteristics, including blade shape and hilt configuration. The typology also focuses on the smaller, and in some cases contemporary, single-handed swords such as the [[arming sword]].&lt;ref name=Oakeshott&gt;Oakeshott, Ewart. ''The Sword in the Age of Chivalry''. Boydell Press 1994. Pages 18-19. ISBN 0851157157&lt;/ref&gt;

For any other type than listed below, and even for uses other than as a weapon, see the article [[Sword-like object]].

===Single and double-edged===
[[File:Jaguar warrior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aztec]] Warrior holding a [[Macahuitl]], a sword that is wooden but has [[obsidian|obsidian shards]] in the blade.]]
{{Redirect|Double-edge|the physical theatre company|Double Edge Theatre}}
As noted above, the terms [[longsword]], [[broad sword]], [[great sword]], and [[Claymore|Gaelic claymore]] are used relative to the era under consideration, and each term designates a particular type of sword.

In most Asian countries, a sword ([[jian]] å, geom (ê²), ken/tsurugi (å£), pedang) is a double-edged straight-bladed weapon, while a knife or saber ([[dÄo]] å, do (ë), to/[[katana]] (å), pisau, golok) refers to a single-edged object. In Sikh history, the sword is held in very high esteem. A single-edged sword is called a kirpan, and its double-edged counterpart a khanda or tega.&lt;ref&gt;Singh Jiwan Singh, B. Chatter, &quot;The turban and the sword of the Sikhs: Essence of Sikhism&quot;, Amritsar,2001, ISBN 8176014915&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans also frequently refer to their own single-edged weapons as swordsâgenerically [[backsword]]s, including sabers. Other terms include [[falchion]], [[scimitar]], [[cutlass]], [[dussack]], [[groÃes Messer|Messer]] or [[mortuary sword]]. Many of these refer to essentially identical weapons, and the varying names may relate to their use in different countries at different times. A [[machete]] as a tool resembles such a single-edged sword is used to cut through thick vegetation, and many of the terms listed above describe battlefield weapons that originated as farmers' tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=European Weapons and Armour |last= Oakeshott |first= Ewart|year= 1980 |publisher= Lutterworth Press |location= Guildford &amp; London |isbn= 0178821262|page= 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Two-handed====
{{See also|Two-handed sword}}
A two-handed sword generally refers to any sword that usually requires two hands to wield. Throughout history two-handed swords have generally been less common than their one-handed counterparts, one exception being their common use in Japan.

====Hand and a half sword====
A Hand and a half sword, colloquially known as a &quot;[[bastard sword]]&quot;, was a sword with an extended grip that could be used with either one or two hands. These swords did not provide a full two-hand grip but they allowed its wielders to hold a [[shield]] or parrying dagger in their off hand, or to use it as a two-handed sword for a more powerful blow.&lt;ref name=McLean/&gt;
