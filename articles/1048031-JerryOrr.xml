'''FactCheck.org''' is a [[non-partisan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nonpartisan&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Conkey, Christopher |date=2004-01-29 |title=Hitting the campaign trail via your PC; Our picks for five web sites that cut through the bluster |work=The Wall Street Journal |page=D1 |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;blockquote&gt;www.factcheck.org - Brooks Jackson, a former Cable News Network and Wall Street Journal reporter, debunks misleading claims, false attacks and subtle associations that litter the campaign trail on a Web site housed at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center. It strives to reinforce the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's conviction: &quot;Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.&quot; The site is thoroughly apolitical: Anyone who plays with the facts gets skewered. And Mr. Jackson keeps harping on things that offend him until they subside.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; nonprofit&lt;ref name=&quot;nonprofit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Hartlaub, Peter |date=2004-10-24 |title=Web sites help gauge the veracity of claims; Online resources check ads, rumors |work=San Francisco Chronicle |page=A1 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2004/10/24/MNFACTS.DTL |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[website]] that describes itself as a {{&quot;'}}consumer advocate' for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in [[Politics of the United States|U.S. politics]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;factcheckorgabout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/about/ |title=About |publisher=FactCheck.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a project of the [[Annenberg Public Policy Center]] of the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania|Annenberg School for Communication]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and is funded primarily by the [[Annenberg Foundation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;factcheckorgabout&quot;/&gt; FactCheck has won three Webby Awards in the Politics category, in 2008, 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?season=15&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of its content consists of rebuttals to what it considers inaccurate, misleading, or false claims by politicians. FactCheck has also targeted misleading claims from various partisan groups.

Besides maintaining a website, FactCheck.org distributes audio stories by [[podcast]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factcheck.org/feed/podcast/ FactCheck.org Radio]{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iTunes]] Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordpress.asc.upenn.edu/category/factcheck-radio/feed/]{{Dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topic in the 2004 Vice-presidential debate==
FactCheck.org became a focus of political commentary following the [[U.S. presidential election debates, 2004|2004 vice-presidential debate]] between [[Dick Cheney]] and [[John Edwards]]. Cheney cited the website, claiming that the independent site defended his actions while CEO of [[Halliburton]]. Cheney's claim is disputed by FactCheck.org as wrong, saying that &quot;Edwards was mostly right&quot; when talking about &quot;Cheney's responsibility for earlier Halliburton troubles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Cheney &amp; Edwards Mangle Facts
| accessdate = 2010-01-10
| date = 2004-10-06
| publisher = Factcheck.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheney's reference created some controversy because he incorrectly cited the web site's address as &quot;FactCheck.''com''.&quot; At the time of the debate, factcheck.com was controlled by [[Frank Schilling|Frank Schilling's]] company Name Administration Inc., who quickly redirected the address to point to an anti-Bush website owned by Bush critic [[George Soros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milbank|first=Dana|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A12901-2004Oct6.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=2004-10-07|page=A08|title=Urging Fact-Checking, Cheney Got Site Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;
