== History ==
=== Origins ===
{{Main|Handheld electronic game}}
The origins of handheld game consoles are found in handheld and tabletop electronic game devices of the 1970s and early 1980s.  These electronic devices are capable of playing only a single game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendo popular&quot;/&gt; they fit in the palm of the hand or on a tabletop, and they may make use of a variety of video displays such as [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]], or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;electronic handheld definition&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Demaria| first = Rusel| coauthors = Johnny L.

The project began when Michael Katz, Mattel's new product category marketing director, told the engineers in the electronics group to design a game the size of a calculator, using LED (light-emitting diode) technology.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimate history&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Kent| first = Steven| title = The Ultimate History of Video Games| url = http://books.google.com/?id=C2MH05ogU9oC&amp;q=%22The+Ultimate+History+of+Video+Games%22&amp;dq=%22The+Ultimate+History+of+Video+Games%22| publisher = Prima Publishing| year = 2001| page = 200| isbn = 978-0-7615-3643-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our big success was something that I conceptualizedâthe first handheld game.  I asked the design group to see if they could come up with a game that was electronic that was the same size as a calculator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;âMichael Katz, former marketing director, Mattel Toys.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimate history&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The result was the 1976 release of ''Auto Race''.&lt;ref name=&quot;1up&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Parish| first = Jeremy| title = PSPredecessors| publisher = 1up| date = 2005-03-28| url = http://www.1up.com/features/pspredecessors| accessdate = 2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Followed by ''Football'' later the same year{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, the two games were so successful that according to Katz, &quot;these simple [[electronic handheld]] games turned into a '$400 million category.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;electronic handheld definition&quot;/&gt; Mattel would later win the honor of being recognized by the industry for innovation in handheld game device displays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards&quot;&gt;{{cite press release| title = Winners of 59th Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards Announced by National Television Academy at Consumer Electronics Show| publisher = Reuters| date = 01-08-2008| url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/01/08/idUS152198+08-Jan-2008+BW20080108| accessdate = 2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, other manufacturers including [[Coleco]], [[Parker Brothers]], [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]], [[Entex Industries|Entex]], and [[Bandai]]&lt;ref name=&quot;competitors&quot;/&gt; began following up with their own tabletop and handheld electronic games.

In 1979 the LCD-based [[Microvision]], designed by [[Smith Engineering]] and distributed by Milton-Bradley, became the first handheld game console and the first to use interchangeable game cartridges.&lt;ref name=&quot;phoenix&quot;/&gt; The Microvision game ''Cosmic Hunter'' (1981) also introduced the concept of a [[D-pad|directional pad]] on handheld gaming devices{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}, and is operated by using the thumb to manipulate the on-screen character in any of four directions.&lt;ref name=&quot;handheldmuseum2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Morgan| first = Rik| title = CosmiHunter| publisher = Handheld Museum| date = 05-08-2008| url = http://www.handheldmuseum.com/MB/MVCosmicHunter.htm| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110628172547/http://www.handheldmuseum.com/MB/MVCosmicHunter.htm| archivedate = 2011-06-28| accessdate = 2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Gunpei Yokoi]], traveling on a [[Shinkansen|bullet train]], saw a bored businessman playing with an [[LCD]] [[calculator]] by pressing the buttons. Yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varney |first=Allen |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_87/490-Searching-for-Gunpei-Yokoi |title=The Escapist: Searching for Gunpei Yokoi |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com |date=2007-03-06 |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1980, [[Nintendo]] began to release a series of electronic games designed by Yokoi called the [[Game &amp; Watch]] games.&lt;ref name=&quot;game and watch&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Pollack| first = Andrew| title = Gunpei Yokoi, Chief Designer Of Game Boy, Is Dead at 56| publisher =The New York Times| date = 1997-10-09| url = http://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/09/business/gunpei-yokoi-chief-designer-of-game-boy-is-dead-at-56.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FD%2FDeaths%20(Obituaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of the technology used in the credit-card-sized calculators that had appeared on the market, Yokoi designed the series of LCD-based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;game over&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Sheff| first = David| authorlink = David Sheff| title = Game Over: Press Start to Continue| url = http://books.google.com/?id=0dK2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Game+Over:+Press+Start+to+Continue&amp;dq=Game+Over:+Press+Start+to+Continue| publisher = GamePress| year = 1999| page = 28| isbn = 978-0-9669617-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For later, more complicated Game &amp; Watch games, Yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or &quot;D-pad&quot; for control of on-screen characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Buchanan| first = Levi| title = From Janitor to Superstar Gunpei Yokoi, inventor of the Game Boy, would have been 67 this week.| publisher = IGN| date = 2008-09-08| url = http://retro.ign.com/articles/908/908569p1.html| accessdate = 2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yokoi also included his directional pad on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] controllers, and the cross-shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry as a replacement for the joystick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards2&quot;&gt;{{cite press release| title = Nintendo Wins Emmy Award| publisher = Nintendo| date = 2008-01-08| url = http://www.gamingnexus.com/FullNews/Nintendo-wins-an-Emmyfor-the-D-pad/Item3466.aspx| accessdate = 2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Yokoi began designing Nintendo's first handheld game console, he came up with a device that married the elements of his Game &amp; Watch devices and the Famicom console,&lt;ref name=&quot;game over2&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Sheff| first = David| authorlink = David Sheff| title = Game Over: Press Start to Continue| url = http://books.google.com/?id=0dK2AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Game+Over:+Press+Start+to+Continue&amp;dq=Game+Over:+Press+Start+to+Continue| publisher = GamePress| year = 1999| page = 294| isbn = 978-0-9669617-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; including both items' D-pad controller. The result was the Nintendo Game Boy.

In 1982, the [[Bandai LCD Solarpower]] was the first [[solar energy|solar-powered]] gaming device. Some of its games, such as the [[Survival horror|horror]]-themed game ''Terror House'', featured two [[LCD panel]]s, one stacked on the other, for an early [[Stereoscopy|3D effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/361591/the-top-ten-retro-gaming-secrets/3 The top ten retro gaming secrets (page 3)], [[PC Pro]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, [[Takara Tomy]]'s [[Tomytronic 3D]] simulated [[3D computer graphics|3D]] by having two [[LED]] panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device, making it the first dedicated home video 3D hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/features/361591/the-top-ten-retro-gaming-secrets The top ten retro gaming secrets (page 1)], [[PC Pro]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late 1980s through early 1990s ===
The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the beginnings of the handheld game console industry as we know it, after the demise of the Microvision. As backlit LCD game consoles with color graphics consume a lot of power, they were not battery-friendly like the non-backlit original Game Boy whose monochrome graphics allowed longer battery life. By this point, [[rechargeable battery]] technology had not yet matured and so the more advanced game consoles of the time such as the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Atari Lynx]] did not have nearly as much success as the Game Boy.

Even though third-party rechargeable batteries were available for the battery-hungry alternatives to the Game Boy, these batteries employed a [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] process and had to be completely discharged before being recharged to ensure maximum efficiency; lead-acid batteries could be used with automobile circuit limiters (cigarette lighter plug devices); but the batteries had mediocre portability. The later [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|NiMH]] batteries, which do not share this requirement for maximum efficiency, were not released until the late 1990s, years after the Game Gear, Atari Lynx, and original Game Boy had been discontinued. During the time when technologically superior handhelds had strict technical limitations, batteries had a very low [[ampere-hour|mAh]] rating since batteries with heavy power density were not yet available.

Modern game systems such as the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] have rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium-Ion]] batteries with proprietary shapes. Other seventh-generation consoles such as the [[GP2X]] use standard [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]]. Because the mAh rating of alkaline batteries has increased since the 1990s, the power needed for handhelds like the GP2X may be supplied by relatively few batteries.

==== Game Boy ====
{{Main|Game Boy}}

[[File:Game-Boy-Original.jpg|right|thumb|130px|The original Game Boy]]
It was not until five years later{{clarify|date=April 2011}} that [[Nintendo]] released the Game Boy. The design team headed by the late [[Gunpei Yokoi]] had also been responsible for the [[Game &amp; Watch]] system, as well as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Kid Icarus]]''. The Game Boy came under scrutiny by some industry critics, saying that the monochrome screen was too small, and the processing power was inadequate. The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns, and when compared to the Microvision, the Game Boy was a huge leap forward.

Yokoi recognized that the Game Boy needed a [[Killer application|killer app]]âat least one game that would define the console, and persuade customers to buy it. In June 1988, [[Minoru Arakawa]], then-CEO of Nintendo of America saw a demonstration of the game ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]'' at a trade show. Nintendo purchased the rights for the game, and packaged it with the Game Boy system. It was almost an immediate hit. By the end of the year more than a million units were sold in the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;GBsales1989&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstarkansasnews.net/2011/01/game-boy-nintendo-dominates-the-portable-market/ |title=Game Boy â Nintendo dominates the portable market |accessdate=2011-04-28  |date=2011-01-22 |publisher=First Arkansas News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 25 million were sold by 1992.{{Verify source|date=November 2007}} As of March 31, 2005, the Game Boy and [[Game Boy Color]] combined to sell 118.69 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendoannualreport2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/report/NintendoAnnualReport2005.pdf |title=05 Annual Report |accessdate=2008-03-22  |date=2006-03-31 |format=PDF |publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GBsales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/source/7.htm |title= Game Boy |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work=A Brief History of Game Console Warfare |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Atari Lynx ====
{{Main|Atari Lynx}}
[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.png|left|thumb|Atari Lynx]]
In 1987, [[Epyx]] created the Handy Game; a device that would turn into the Atari Lynx in 1989. It was the first color handheld console ever made, as well as the first with a [[backlight|backlit]] screen. It also featured networking support with up to 17 other players, and advanced hardware that allowed the zooming and scaling of sprites.  The Lynx could also be turned upside down to accommodate [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] players. However, all these features came at a very high price point, which drove consumers to seek cheaper alternatives. The Lynx was also very unwieldy, consumed batteries very quickly, and lacked the third-party support enjoyed by its competitors. Due to its high price, short battery life, production shortages, a dearth of compelling games, and Nintendo's aggressive marketing campaign, and despite a redesign in 1991, the Lynx became a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]]. Despite this, companies like Telegames helped to keep the system alive long past its commercial relevance, and when new owner Hasbro released the rights to develop for the public domain, independent developers like Songbird have managed to release new commercial games for the system every year until 2004's ''Winter Games''.{{clear}}

==== TurboExpress ====
{{Main|TurboExpress}}
[[File:turbo express.jpg|thumb|TurboExpress handheld, TV tuner, and games]]
The '''TurboExpress''' was a portable version of the TurboGrafx, released in 1990 for $249.99 (the price was briefly raised to $299.99, soon dropped back to $249.99, and by 1992 it was $199.99). Its Japanese equivalent was the [[TurboExpress|PC Engine GT]].

It was the most advanced handheld of its time and could play all the [[TurboGrafx-16]]'s games (which were on a small, credit-card sized media called HuCards). It had a 66&amp;nbsp;mm (2.6 in.) screen, the same as the original Game Boy, and could display 64 [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] at once, 16 per scanline, in 512 (some{{Who|date=August 2011}} say only 482?) colors. It had 64&amp;nbsp;kilobytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. The Turbo ran its two 6820 [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] at 3.58&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] in parallel.

The optional &quot;TurboVision&quot; TV tuner included RCA audio/video input, allowing users to use TurboExpress as a video monitor. The &quot;TurboLink&quot; allowed two-player play. ''Falcon'', a flight simulator, included a &quot;head-to-head&quot; dogfight mode that could only be accessed via TurboLink. However, very few TG-16 games offered co-op play modes especially designed with the TurboExpress in mind.{{clear}}

==== Bitcorp Gamate ====
{{Main|Gamate}}
[[File:Gamate.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Gamate and game cards]]
The Bitcorp Gamate was the one of the first handheld game systems created in response to the Nintendo Gameboy. It was released in Asia in 1990 and distributed worldwide by 1991.

Like the Sega Game Gear, it was horizontal in orientation and required 4 AA batteries. Unlike many later Gameboy clones, its internal components were professionally assembled (no &quot;glop-top&quot; chips). Unfortunately the system's fatal flaw was its screen. Even by the standards of the day, its screen was rather difficult to use, suffering from similar motion blur problems that were common complaints with the first generation Gameboys. Likely because of this fact sales were quite poor, and Bitcorp closed by 1992. However it has recently been discovered that new games continued to be published for the Asian market, possibly as late as 1994. The total number of games released for the system remains unknown.

Interestingly, Gamate games were designed for stereo sound, but the console was only equipped with a mono speaker. To appreciate the full sound pallet, a user must plug into the head phone jack. Doing so reveals very sophisticated music.{{clear}}

==== Sega Game Gear ====
{{Main|Sega Game Gear}}
[[File:Game-Gear-Handheld.jpg|thumb|Sega Game Gear]]
The Sega '''Game Gear''' was the third color handheld console, after the Lynx and the TurboExpress. Released in Japan in 1990 and in North America and Europe in 1991, it was based on the [[Sega Master System]], which gave Sega the ability to quickly create Game Gear games from its large library of games for the Master System. While never reaching the level of success enjoyed by Nintendo, the Sega Game Gear proved to be a fairly durable competitor, lasting longer than any other Gameboy rivals.

While the Game Gear is most frequently seen in black or navy blue, it was also released in a variety of additional colors: red, light blue, yellow, clear, and violet. All of these variations were released in small quantities and frequently only in the Asian market.

Following Sega's success with the Game Gear, they began development on a successor during the early 1990s, which was intended to feature a [[touchscreen]] interface, many years before the [[Nintendo DS]]. However, such a technology was very expensive at the time, and the handheld itself was estimated to have cost around $289 were it to be released. Sega eventually chose to shelve the idea and instead release the [[Sega Nomad]], a handheld version of the [[Mega Drive]] (Genesis), as the successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|publisher=IGN|author=Travis Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Watara Supervision ====
{{Main|Watara Supervision}}
[[File:Supervision.jpg|thumb|left|Supervision: 2nd version.]]
The Watara Supervision was released in 1992 in an attempt to compete with the Nintendo Game Boy. The first model was designed very much like a Game Boy, but it was grey in color and had a slightly larger screen. The second model was made with a hinge across the center and could be bent slightly to provide greater comfort for the user. While the system did enjoy a modest degree of success, it never impacted the sales of Nintendo or Sega. The Supervision was redesigned a final time as &quot;The Magnum&quot;. Released in limited quantities it was roughly equivalent to the Game Boy Pocket. It was available in three colors: yellow, green and grey. Watara designed many of the games themselves, but did receive some third party support, most notably from '''Sachen'''.

A TV adapter was available in both PAL and NTSC formats that could transfer the Supervision's black and white pallet to 4 colors, similar in some regards to the Super Game Boy from Nintendo.{{clear}}

==== Hartung Game Master ====
{{Main|Hartung Game Master}}
[[File:Hgm front-1-.jpg|right|thumb|Hartung Gamemaster]]
The Hartung Game Master was an obscure handheld released at an unknown point in the early 1990s. Its graphics were much lower than most of its contemporaries, similar in complexity to the Atari 2600. It was available in black, white, and purple, and was frequently rebranded by its distributors, such as Delplay, Videojet and Virella.
The exact number of games released is not known, but is likely around 20. The system most frequently turns up in Europe and Australia.{{clear}}

=== Late 1990s ===
The [[Game Boy]] was nine years old before it got its first successor. In 1998, the [[Game Boy Color]] was released. It used the smaller and lighter form-factor of the Game Boy Light (released in Japan only), but featured a full color screen. It was also backwards-compatible, so that it could play not only games specifically made for the Game Boy Color, but standard Game Boy games as well. It did not have significantly more computing power than the Game Boy, however.

By this time, the lack of significant development in [[Nintendo]]'s product line began allowing more advanced systems such as the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] and the [[WonderSwan Color]] to achieve moderate success.{{clear}}

==== Game.com ====
{{Main|Game.com}}
[[File:GameCom-Handheld.jpg|thumb|Game.com]]
The Game.com (pronounced in TV commercials as &quot;game com&quot;, not &quot;game dot com&quot;, and not capitalized in marketing material) was a handheld game console released by [[Tiger Electronics]] in September 1997. It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience, sporting PDA-style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus. However, Tiger hoped it would also challenge Nintendo's Game Boy and gain a following among younger gamers too. Unlike other handheld game consoles, the first game.com consoles included two slots for game cartridges, which would not happen again until the DS and DS Lite, and could be connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem. Later models had only a single cartridge slot.{{clear}}

==== Game Boy Color ====
{{Main|Game Boy Color}}
[[File:Game-Boy-Color-Purple.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Game Boy Color was the first handheld by Nintendo featuring Colors]]
The '''Game Boy Color''' (also referred to as '''GBC''' or '''CGB''') is Nintendo's successor to the Game Boy and was released on October 21, 1998 in Japan and in November of the same year in the United States. It features a color screen, and is slightly bigger than the [[Game Boy Pocket]]. The processor is twice as fast as a Game Boy's and has twice as much memory. It also had an [[infrared]] communications port for wireless linking which did not appear in later versions of the Game Boy, such as the Game Boy Advance.

The Game Boy Color was a response to pressure from game developers for a new system, as they felt that the Game Boy, even in its latest incarnation, the Game Boy Pocket, was insufficient. The resulting product was backward compatible, a first for a handheld console system, and leveraged the large library of games and great installed base of the predecessor system. This became a major feature of the Game Boy line, since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors. As of March 31, 2005, the Game Boy and [[Game Boy Color]] combined to sell 118.69 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendoannualreport2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GBsales&quot;/&gt;

The console was capable of displaying up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of 32,768, and could add basic four-color shading to games that had been developed for the original Game Boy. It could also give the sprites and backgrounds separate colors, for a total of more than four colors.{{clear}}

==== Neo Geo Pocket Color ====
{{Main|Neo Geo Pocket Color}}
[[File:NeoGeo-Pocket-Color.jpg|thumb|Neo Geo Pocket Color]]
The Neo Geo Pocket Color (or '''NGPC''') was released in 1999 in Japan, and later that year in the United States and Europe. It was a 16-bit color handheld game console designed by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]], the maker of the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] home console and arcade machine. It came after SNK's original [[Neo Geo Pocket]] monochrome handheld, which debuted in 1998 in Japan.

In 2000 following SNK's purchase by Japanese [[Pachinko]] manufacturer Aruze, the Neo Geo Pocket Color was dropped from both the US and European markets, purportedly due to commercial failure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}{{clear-left}}

The system seemed well on its way to being a success in the U.S. It was more successful than any Game Boy competitor since [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], but was hurt by several factors, such as SNK's infamous lack of communication with third-party developers, and anticipation of the Game Boy Advance.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The decision to ship U.S. games in cardboard boxes in a cost-cutting move rather than hard plastic cases that Japanese and European releases were shipped in may have also hurt US sales.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}{{clear}}

==== Wonderswan Color ====
{{Main|Wonderswan Color}}
[[File:Wonderswan color-JD.jpg|left|thumb|The Wonderswan Color]]
The '''WonderSwan Color''' is a handheld game console designed by [[Bandai]]. It was released on December 9, 2000 in Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;swanLaunch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promoduck.com/PressRelease/html/press_con10a048.htm |title=Bandai announces release of WonderSwan color |accessdate=2011-04-28  |date=2000-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was a moderate success.

The original [[WonderSwan]] had only a black and white screen. Although the WonderSwan Color was slightly larger and heavier (7&amp;nbsp;mm and 2&amp;nbsp;g) compared to the original WonderSwan, the color version featured 512&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|kB]]&lt;ref name=&quot;swanSpec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/084/084272p1.html |title=WonderSwan Color Revealed |accessdate=2011-04-28  |date=2000-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and a larger color LCD screen. In addition, the WonderSwan Color is compatible with the original WonderSwan library of games.

Prior to WonderSwan's release, Nintendo had virtually a monopoly in the Japanese video game handheld market. After the release of the WonderSwan Color, Bandai took approximately 8% of the market share in Japan partly due to its low price of 6800 yen (approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]65).&lt;ref name=&quot;swanSpec&quot; /&gt;

Another reason for the WonderSwan's success in Japan was the fact that Bandai managed to get a deal with [[Square (company)|Square]] to port over the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games with improved graphics and controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;swanSpec&quot; /&gt; However, with the popularity of the Game Boy Advance and the reconciliation between Square and Nintendo, the WonderSwan Color and its successor, the [[SwanCrystal]] quickly lost its [[competitive advantage]].{{clear}}

=== 2000s ===
The 2000s saw a major leap in innovation, particularly in the second half with the release of the DS and PSP.

==== Game Boy Advance ====
{{Main|Game Boy Advance}}
[[File:Game-Boy-Advance-1stGen.jpg|right|thumb|The Game Boy Advance was a major upgrade to the Game Boy line]]
In 2001, Nintendo released the Game Boy Advance ('''GBA''' or '''AGB'''), which added two shoulder buttons, a larger screen, and more computing power than the Game Boy Color.

The design was revised two years later when the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] (GBA SP), a more compact version, was released. The SP featured a &quot;[[Bivalve shell|clamshell]]&quot; design (folding open and closed, like a laptop computer), as well as a [[Frontlight|frontlit]] color display and rechargeable battery. Despite the smaller form factor, the screen remained the same size as that of the original. In 2005, the [[Game Boy Micro]] was released. This revision sacrificed screen size and backwards compatibility with previous Game Boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter [[Backlight|backlit]] screen. A new SP model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time.

Along with the [[Nintendo GameCube]], the GBA also introduced the concept of &quot;connectivity&quot;: using a handheld system as a console controller. A handful of games use this feature, most notably ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Pac-Man Vs.]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]''.

As of December 31, 2007, the GBA, GBA SP, and the Game Boy Micro combined have sold 80.72 million units worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;080124e&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2008/080124e.pdf#page=8 |title=Consolidated Financial Highlights |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2008-03-22 |format=PDF | page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==== Game Park 32 ====
{{Main|GP32}}
[[File:Gp32-flu.jpg|left|thumb|GP32]]
The original GP32 was released in 2001 by the South Korean company [[Game Park]] a few months after the launch of the Game
Boy Advance. It featured a 32-bit CPU, 133&amp;nbsp;MHz processor, MP3 and Divx player, and e-book reader. [[SmartMedia]] cards were used for storage, and could hold up to 128mb of anything downloaded through a USB cable from a PC. The GP32 was redesigned in 2003. A front-lit screen was added and the new version was called GP32 FLU (Front Light Unit). In summer 2004, another redesign, the GP32 BLU, was made, and added a backlit screen. This version of the handheld was planned for release outside South Korea; in Europe, and it was released for example in Spain (VirginPlay was the distributor). While not a commercial success on a level with mainstream handhelds (only 30,000 units were sold), it ended up being used mainly as a platform for user-made applications and emulators of other systems, being popular with developers and more technically-adept users.&lt;ref name=&quot;clockerz&quot;&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6159783.html GP2X Q&amp;A, With Craig Rothwell].

[[File:Nokia N-Gage.png|right|thumb|150px|N-Gage]]
[[File:Nokia-NGage-QD.jpg|left|thumb|150px|N-Gage QD]]
[[Nokia]] released the N-Gage in 2003. It was designed as a combination MP3 player, cellphone, PDA, radio, and gaming device. The system received much criticism alleging defects in its physical design and layout, including its vertically-oriented screen and requirement of removing the battery to change game cartridges. The most well known of these was &quot;[[N-Gage|sidetalking]]&quot;, or the act of placing the phone speaker and receiver on an edge of the device instead of one of the flat sides, causing the user to appear as if they are speaking into a [[taco]].

The N-Gage QD was later released to address the design flaws of the original. However, certain features available in the original N-Gage, including MP3 playback, FM radio reception, and USB connectivity were removed.

[[N-Gage (service)|Second generation of N-Gage]] launched on April 3, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090412015450/http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archivedate=2009-04-12 |title= A New Day for N-Gage |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the form of a service for selected [[Nokia]] [[Smartphone]]s.{{clear}}

==== Tapwave Zodiac ====
{{Main|Tapwave Zodiac}}
In 2004, Tapwave released the Zodiac. It was designed to be a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-handheld game console hybrid. It supported photos, movies, music, [[Internet]], and documents. The Zodiac used a special version Palm OS 5, 5.2T, that supported the special gaming buttons and graphics chip. Two versions were available, Zodiac 1 and 2, differing in memory and looks. The Zodiac line ended in July 2005 when Tapwave declared bankruptcy.{{clear}}

==== Nintendo DS ====
{{Main|Nintendo DS}}
[[File:Nintendo-DS-Fat-Blue.png|thumb|The Nintendo DS has two screens (the lower of which is a touchscreen), a microphone and Wi-Fi connectivity.]]
The Nintendo DS was released in November 2004. Among its new features were the incorporation of two screens, a [[touchscreen]], wireless connectivity, and a microphone port. As with the Game Boy Advance SP, the DS features a clamshell design, with the two screens aligned vertically on either side of the hinge.

The DS's lower screen is touch sensitive, designed to be pressed with a stylus, a user's finger or a special &quot;thumb pad&quot; (a small plastic pad attached to the console's wrist strap, which can be affixed to the thumb to simulate an analog stick). More traditional controls include four face buttons, two shoulder buttons, a [[D-pad]], and &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Select&quot; buttons. The console also features online capabilities via the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] and ad-hoc wireless networking for multiplayer games with up to sixteen players. It is backwards-compatible with all Game Boy Advance games, but not games designed for the Game Boy or Game Boy Color.

In January 2006, Nintendo revealed an updated version of the DS: the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] (released on March 2, 2006 in Japan) with an updated, smaller form factor (42% smaller and 21% lighter than the original Nintendo DS), a cleaner design, longer battery life, and brighter, higher-quality displays, with adjustable brightness. It is also able to connect wirelessly with Nintendo's Wii console.

In October 2008, Nintendo announced the [[Nintendo DSi]], with larger, 3.25&amp;nbsp;inch screens and two integrated cameras. It will have an [[Secure Digital|SD card]] storage slot in place of the [[Game Boy Advance]] slot, plus internal flash memory for storing downloaded games. It was released on November 1, 2008 in Japan, and was released in North America April 5, 2009, and April 3, 2009 in Europe.

As of December 31, 2009, the Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite and Nintendo DSi combined have sold 125.13 million units worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/090507e.pdf#page=22 |title=Consolidated Financial Highlights |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=2009-04-31 |format=PDF |publisher=Nintendo |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Nintendo released a larger version of the DSi, called the DSi XL.{{clear}}

==== Game King ====
{{Main|Game King}}
[[File:GameKing2.jpg|left|thumb|The GameKing 2.]]
The GameKing was a handheld game console released by the Chinese company TimeTop in 2004. The first model while original in design owes a large debt to Nintendo's Gameboy Advance. The second model, the GameKing 2, is a more direct rip-off, this time of Sony's PSP. This model also was upgraded with a backlit screen, with a distracting background transparency (which can be removed by opening up the console). A color model, the GameKing 3 apparently exists, but was only made for a brief time and was difficult to purchase outside of Asia.  Whether intentionally or not, the GameKing has the most primitive graphics of any handheld released since the Game Boy of 1989. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As many of the games have an &quot;old school&quot; simplicity, the device has developed a small cult following. The Gameking's speaker is quite loud and the cartridges' sophisticated looping soundtracks (sampled from other sources) are seemingly at odds with its primitive graphics.

TimeTop made at least one additional device sometimes labeled as &quot;GameKing&quot;, but while it seems to possess more advanced graphics, is essentially an emulator that plays a handful of multi-carts (like the GB Station Light II). Outside of Asia (especially China) however the Gameking remains relatively unheard of due to the enduring popularity of Japanese handhelds such as those manufactured by Nintendo and Sony.{{clear}}
