'''Engadget''' is a [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] technology [[blog]] network with daily coverage of [[gadgets]] and [[consumer electronics]]. Though on appearance Engadget functions much like a blog and may be defined as such, much of its editorial content takes the form of an [[online magazine]]. Engadget currently operates a total of ten 'blogs' - four written in English and six international versions with independent editorial staff. Engadget frequently ranks among the top 5 in the 'Technorati top 100'&lt;ref&gt;[http://technorati.com/blogs/top100 Top 100 Blogs - 1 to 25 - Technorati&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was noted in [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] for being one of the best blogs of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1999770_1999761_1999863,00.html | work=Time | title=Best Blogs Of 2010 | date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Engadget was co-founded by former [[Gizmodo]] technology weblog editor and co-founder, [[Peter Rojas]]. Engadget is a member of [[Weblogs, Inc.]], a [[blog]] network with over 75 [[Blog|weblogs]] including [[Autoblog]] and [[Joystiq]] and formerly including Hack-A-Day. Weblogs Inc. was purchased by [[AOL]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt; Engadget's editor-in-chief, [[Ryan Block]], announced on July 22, 2008 that he would be stepping down as editor-in-chief in late August, leaving the role to [[Joshua Ryan|Joshua Topolsky]]. On March 12, 2011 [[Joshua Ryan|Joshua Topolsky]] announced that he was leaving Engadget making Tim Stevens the editor-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/04/welcome-to-engadget/ Welcome to Engadget - Engadget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Fruhlinger, who has been writing for Engadget since 2004, has acted as Engadget's Editorial Director since 2007.

==Engadget Blogs==
Engadget operates a number of blogs spanning seven different languages including English, Chinese (traditional and simplified), Japanese, Spanish, Polish, Korean and German. The English edition of Engadget operates four blogs which, like the international editions, have been assimilated into a single site with a sub-domain prefix. These include Engadget Classic (the original Engadget blog), Engadget Mobile, Engadget HD and most recently Engadget Alt.

Launched in March 2004, Engadget is updated multiple times a day with articles on [[gadgets]] and [[consumer electronics]]. It also posts [[rumor]]s about the technological world, frequently offers opinion within its stories, and produces the weekly [[Engadget Podcast]] that covers tech and gadget news stories that happened during the week.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/12/18/ryan-block-engadget-tech-cx_rr_07webceleb_1218block.html|publisher=[[forbes]].com|title=The Gadget Guru|author=Rachel Rosmarin|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, dozens of writers have written for or contributed to Engadget, Engadget Alt, Engadget Mobile and [[Engadget HD]], including high profile bloggers, industry analysts, and professional journalists. These writers include [[Jason Calacanis]], [[Paul Boutin (journalist)|Paul Boutin]], Phillip Torrone, Joshua Fruhlinger, Marc Perton and [[Susan Mernit]]. Darren Murph, who became the World's Most Prolific Professional Blogger as recorded by Guinness World Records on July 29, 2010, is the site's Managing Editor and has written over 17,212 posts (and growing) to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/05/engadgets-darren-murph-nabs-guinness-world-record-for-most-blog/|publisher=Engadget.com|title=Engadget's Darren Murph nabs Guinness World Record for most blog posts ever written!|author=Joshua Topolsky|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analyst Ross Rubin has contributed a weekly column called [http://engadget.com/tag/switchedon Switched On] since October 2004.

Engadget has been nominated for numerous awards, including a 2004 [[Bloggies|Bloggie]] for Best Technology Weblog, and 2005 Bloggies for Best Computers or Technology Weblog and Best Group Weblog; Engadget won Best Tech Blog in the 2004 and 2005 Weblog Awards.

Google Reader, as well as many other RSS readers, has included Engadget as a default [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed, pulling the latest articles which appear at the top of all user's mailboxes.

To extend readership, the blog is available in several languages including Spanish, Japanese, German, Polish (until 1.04.2010), Korean, and Chinese (traditional and simplified).

Engadget uses the Blogsmith [[Content management system|CMS]] to publish its content.

==The Engadget Podcast==
The Engadget podcast was launched in October 2004 and was originally hosted by Phillip Torrone and Len Pryor. He was the host for the first 22 episodes of the podcast at which point Eric Rice took over. Eric Rice is known for his own podcast, called The Eric Rice Show and has also produced podcasts for [[Weblogs Inc]]. Eric hosted and produced 4 episodes of the podcast for Engadget until the show was taken over by Peter Rojas and Ryan Block. The podcast was hosted by Editor-in-chief [[Joshua Topolsky]] along with editors Paul Miller and Nilay Patel with occasional special guests, until their 2011 departure. The podcast was produced by Trent Wolbe under Topolsky's editorship and continues to be under [[Tim Stevens (Editor)]].

The topic of discussion for the podcast is technology related and closely linked to events that have happened during the week in the world of technology. The show generally lasts an hour or more. The show is normally weekly, however the frequency can change, especially during special events. When events such as the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) and the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) occur, the podcast has been known to be broadcast daily.

The Engadget podcast is available as a subscription through [[iTunes]], [[Zune Marketplace]] and as an [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed. Alternatively, it can be downloaded directly from the site in either [[MP3]], [[Ogg]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[m4b]] format. The m4b version features images related to the current topic of discussion and can be displayed in [[iTunes]] or on a compatible player.

Engadget has started doing live podcasts, usually broadcasting Thursday or Friday afternoons on Ustream. The recorded podcast is usually available the day after.

==The Engadget App==
On Dec 30th 2009 Engadget released its first mobile app for the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/30/engadget-releases-iphone-app/ Engadget releases iPhone app | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/downloads/iphone Engadget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;Engadget then released an Engadget app for the Palm Pre and Palm Pixie phones on January 1, 2010 claiming it was the &quot;1000th application in the &quot;PalmOS&quot; Catalog&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/01/engadget-now-available-for-pre-and-pixi-the-first-webos-app-of/ Engadget now available for Pre and Pixi: the first webOS app of 2010 (and 1000th in the Catalog)! - Engadget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;A week later, on January 8, 2010 they launched the app on the BlackBerry platform. Finally, they released an app for Android devices on March 25, 2010 making the app available on all major mobile smartphone platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/25/the-engadget-app-for-android-is-finally-really-here/ The Engadget app for Android is finally, really here! - Engadget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The app's features included sharing articles through [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] or e-mail, the ability to tip Engadget on breaking news, and the ability to bookmark and view articles offline.

==The Engadget Show==
[[File:Engadget-Show-Ident-Logo-01-June-2011.jpg|right|thumb|The [[station identification]] logo first used on 'The Engadget Show' on 1st June 2011]] [[File:Engadget Show Original Ident.jpg|right|thumb|The original [[station identification]] logo used on 'The Engadget Show']] On September 8, 2009, Josh Topolsky announced that Engadget would be taping a new video show once a month in [[New York City]].

==Controversy==
===Trademark Infringement===
In early 2006, Engadget reported that they were victims of their likeness being stolen and used as a store name at a mall in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. However, they stated they would not be taking any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/10/a-visit-to-the-engadget-store/|title=A visit to the Engadget store...|date=10 July 2006|accessdate=December 17, 2008|author=Peter Rojas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store has since changed its name (or possibly shutdown and a new store opened with a new name). In July 2007, another store had opened, also in Malaysia, with a logo bearing the same resemblance to Engadget's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/01/the-fake-engadget-store-returns-in-a-new-location/|title=The (fake) Engadget store returns in a new location!|date=1 July 2007|accessdate=December 17, 2008|author=Ryan Block}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple Delay Hoax===
In May 2007, Engadget published a story based on an email sent to Apple employees announcing that the company was delaying the launches of both the iPhone and Mac OS X Leopard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/16/iphone-delayed-until-october-leopard-delayed-again-until-januar/|publisher=Engadget|title=False alarm: iPhone NOT delayed until October, Leopard NOT delayed again until January|date=May 16, 2007|author=Ryan Block|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the story ran, Apple's share price dropped 3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gear Blog Rivals Engadget and Gizmodo Turn the Competition Up to 11|url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/magazine/16-04/mf_gadgetblogs?currentPage=3|publisher=[[Wired.com]]|date=24 March 2008|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Engadget blunder sends Apple stock tumbling|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/57967/2007/05/engadget.html|publisher=[[Macworld]].com|author=Tom Spring|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 20 minutes later the story was retracted after the email was discovered to have been a hoax perpetrated on Apple employees. Apple's shares eventually recovered and Ryan Block apologized for the mistake.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot; /&gt;

===Misattribution===
In March 2006, DAPreview, a website about [[digital audio player]]s, noted that Engadget used a photo that had originally been taken by DAPreview, and then removed attribution by cropping the DAPreview logo off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engadget: Busted for Unethical Blogging|publisher=[[Digital Trends]]|url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/news-article/9827/engadget-busted-for-unethical-blogging|author=Ian Bell|date=20 March 2006|accessdate=17 December 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engadget's managing editor Ryan Block agreed that the photo had been copied and cropped, stated that it had been a mistake, and apologized and restored the image's attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanablock.com/archive/2006/03/controversy/|author=Ryan Block|title=Controversy|date=21 March 2006|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===T-Mobile &quot;magenta&quot; accusations===
On March 31, 2008, Engadget reported that [[Deutsche Telekom]] (the parent company of [[T-Mobile]] and [[T-Mobile USA]]) had sent a letter requesting that Engadget cease using the color magenta in its Engadget Mobile site, claiming that T-Mobile had trademarked the color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/31/deutsche-telekom-t-mobile-demands-engadget-mobile-discontinue/|title=Deutsche Telekom / T-Mobile demands Engadget Mobile discontinue using the color magenta|publisher=Engadget|author=Ryan Block|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engadget issued a response on April 1, mainly by repainting the Engadget sites and changing the Mobile logo for the day to a logo that looks as though it is saying &quot;Engadge t-mobile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/01/painting-the-town-magenta/|title=Painting the town magenta|publisher=Engadget|author=Ryan Block|date=1 April 2008|accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has since returned to normal format, with the exception of the highlighting color.

===Mass exodus===
In early 2011 a mass exodus ensued at Engadget with eight of the more prominent editorial and technology staff members leaving [[AOL]] to build a new gadget site with CEO [[Jim Bankoff]] at [[SB Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/business/media/04carr.html &quot;No Longer Shackled by AOL&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On leaving, [[Joshua Topolsky]], former Editor-in-chief, is quoted having said, âWe have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we havenât made a hire since I started running the site, and I thought we could be more successful elsewhereâ. It appears the departure of the team from AOL which includes not only Topolsky but editors [[Nilay Patel]], Paul Miller, Joanna Stern, Ross Miller, Chris Ziegler, Chad Mumm, Justin Glow, Dan Chilton, Thomas Ricker and Vladislav Savov was primarily the cause of an internal memo distributed by AOL detailing &quot;The AOL Way&quot;, a 58-page long company plan to turn AOL into a media empire. Some employees suggested that AOL was destroying journalism for page views and that it would be difficult for the organisation to apply a 'one size fits all' business model to a business primarily made up of acquisitions with diverging outlooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenextweb.com/media/2011/02/01/is-aol-destroying-tech-journalism/ Is AOL destroying journalism for page views? - TNW Media&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Miller makes a mention of this on his blog where he writes &quot;Iâd love to be able to keep doing this forever, but unfortunately Engadget is owned by AOL, and AOL has proved an unwilling partner in this siteâs evolution. It doesnât take a veteran of the publishing world to realize that AOL has its heart in the wrong place with content. As detailed in the âAOL Way,â and borne out in personal experience, AOL sees content as a commodity it can sell ads against&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pauljmiller.com/ paul j. miller&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The group set up a 'placeholder site', &quot;This is my Next&quot; whilst they develop the new gadget site over at SB Nation. The new site is called [[The Verge (website)|The Verge]].
