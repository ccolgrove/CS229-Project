It won its first championship in 1939 and has gone on to become one of Greece's most successful football teams.

For a more general overview of the club, see [[AEK Athens F.C.]]

==Origin==
The large Greek population of [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), not unlike those of the other Ottoman urban centres, continued its athletic traditions in the form of numerous athletic clubs. Clubs such as [[KurtuluÅ SK|Enosi Tataoulon]] ({{lang|el|ÎÎ½ÏÏÎ· Î¤Î±ÏÎ±Î¿ÏÎ»ÏÎ½}}) from the [[KurtuluÅ|Tatavla]] district, '''Megas Alexandros''' ({{lang|el|ÎÎ­Î³Î±Ï ÎÎ»Î­Î¾Î±Î½Î´ÏÎ¿Ï}}) of Vathyriakos, and '''Hermes''' ({{lang|el|ÎÏÎ¼Î®Ï}} - '''Ermis''') of [[Galata]] existed to promote [[Greeks|Hellenic]] athletic and cultural ideals; Hermes, one of the more popular clubs, was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera (Galata). Forced to change its name to [[BeyoÄluspor|Pera Club]] in 1921, many of its athletes fled during the population exchanges at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greco-Turkish War]], and settled in Athens and [[Thessaloniki]]. Remainder of Greek community founded BeyoÄluspor, which is sister team of AEK, in 1923. BeyoÄluspor played in Ä°stanbul First League periods of 1940-1942, 1944â1947, 1952â1959 and [[Turkcell Super League|National League]] between 1962-1964.

==1924â1939==

On 13 April 1924, a group of Constantinopolitan refugees (among them athletes from Pera Club
and the other Constantinopolitan clubs) met at the athletic shop of Emilios and Menelaos Ionas
on Veranzerou Street, in the center of Athens, and established AEK.

The founders of AEK established the club with the intention of providing athletic and cultural diversions for the thousands of predominantly Constantinopolitan and Anatolian refugees who had settled in the new suburbs of Athens ([[Nea Filadelfeia]], [[Nea Ionia]], [[Nea Chalkidona]], [[Nea Smyrni]], e.t.c.). AEKâs first game was a 2-0 win against Aias Athinon.

AEKâs football team grew rapidly in popularity during the 1920s, eclipsing the already-established Athens-based refugee clubs ([[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]], [[Apollon Smyrnis]]), thanks mainly to the large pool of immigrants that were drawn to the club and due, in no small part, to the political connections and wealth of several of the clubâs board members. Not possessing a football ground, AEK played most of its early matches at various locations around Athens, including the grounds of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Athens)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] and the [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium|Leoforos Alexandras Stadium]].

AEKâs first president, Konstantinos Spanoudis (1871â1941), a [[journalist]] and associate of the then Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], petitioned the government to set aside land for the establishment of a sports ground. In 1926, land in Nea Filadelfia that was originally set aside for refugee housing was donated as a training ground for the refugees. AEK began using the ground for training (albeit unofficially) and by 1930 the property was signed over to the club. Venizelos soon approved the plans to build what was to become AEKâs home ground for the next 70 years, the [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]]. The first home game, in November 1930, was an exhibition match against Olympiacos that ended in a 2-2 draw.

In 1928 [[Panathinaikos FC]], Olympiacos, and AEK began a dispute with the fledgling [[Hellenic Football Federation]] (EPO), decided to break away from the Athens regional league and form an alliance called [[P.O.K.]](acronym for Podosfairikes-Omades-Kentrou). During the dispute, POK organised friendly matches against each other and several continental European clubs. In 1929, though, the dispute ended and AEK, along with the other POK clubs, entered the EPO fold once again.

In 1932, AEK won their first Greek Cup title, beating [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.]] 5-3 in the final. The team boasted a number of star football players in [[Kostas Negrepontis]] (a veteran of the original Pera Club of Constantinople), [[Kleanthis Maropoulos]], [[Tryfon Tzanetis]], Michalis Delavinias, Giorgos Mageiras and Spyros Sklavounos.

The clubâs mixed success during the 1930s was highlighted by the first Greek Championship-Cup double in 1939.

==1940â1959==
Under former player Kostas Negrepontis as coach, AEK won the Greek Championship in 1940.
With [[England|English]] coach Jack Bimby at the reins, veteran players Maropoulos, Tzanetis, Delavinias and Mageiras, along with new blood Kostas Poulis, Giorgos Goulios, and Pavlos Emmanoualidis, AEK won the Greek Cup competitions of 1949 and 1950, beating Panathinaikos 2-1 and Aris 4-0.

AEK won also the Athens regional championship of 1950, but the playoff games for the
Pan-Hellenic title were not played, due to many players being called up for a prolonged
training camp for the national team.

The early 1950s saw the addition of the next generation of star footballers in Giannis Kanakis, [[Andreas Stamatiadis]], and goalkeeper Stelios Serafeidis, and along with Poulis and Emmanoualidis, AEK again won the Greek Cup title of 1956, this time beating Olympiacos 2-1 in the final. 1957 saw the debut of one of the greatest forwards of the era, [[Kostas Nestoridis]]. Having joined AEK from [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]] in 1956, Nestoridis was forced to sit out the 1956 season because of a dispute between the two clubs over his transfer. In 1958 and 1959 he finished top goal scorer in the league, but it wasnât enough for AEK to take any titles.

==1960â1974==
With Kostas Nestoridis scoring goals aplenty in the early 1960s, (top goalscorer 1958-1963), and the timely signing of attacker [[Mimis Papaioannou|Dimitris Papaioannou]] in 1962, AEK went on to win the 1963 Championship.

Known affectionately as âMimisâ by the AEK supporters, Papaioannou scored twice in the 1963 playoff against Panathinaikos, levelling the scores at 3-3 and giving AEK its first post-war championship title on goal aggregate. Coached by [[Hungarians|Hungarian]]-[[Germany|German]] JenÅ Csaknady, the championship team also consisted of veterans Nestoridis, Serafeidis and Stamatiadis, Alekos Sofianidis, [[Stelios Skevofilakas]], Giorgos Petridis, Manolis Kanellopoulos, and Miltos Papapostolou.

The club followed up with Cup victories in 1964 and 1966, and with the return of Csaknady to the coachâs position in 1968, and with some great players in Kostas Nikolaidis, Giorgos Karafeskos, Panagiotis Ventouris, Fotis Balopoulos, Spyros Pomonis, Alekos Iordanou, Nikos Stathopoulos and Andreas Papaemmanouil, AEK won the championship with relative ease, and became the first Greek football club to reach the quarter-final of European Champions Cup.
The addition of goalkeeper Stelios Konstantinidis and Apostolos Toskas reinforced the team and allowed AEK to take its fifth championship title in 1971.
AEK won also the unofficial Super-Cup of 1971 beating Olympiacos 4-2 on penalty kicks,
after 2 draws of 2-2 at Piraeus and 1-1 at Nea Filadelfia (normal time).

| &lt;small&gt;Lineup against QPR (1977-03-02)&lt;/small&gt;
|}

Summer arrivals included [[Thomas Mavros]], [[Nikos Christidis]], [[Petros Ravousis]] and [[Takis Nikoloudis]].

The clubs most memorable moment in European competitions was the campaign to the semi-final of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] during the [[1976â77 UEFA Cup|1976â77]] season under [[FrantiÅ¡ek Fadrhonc]]'s management. In the way to the semi-final AEK Athens managed to eliminate four clubs. In the [[1976â77 UEFA Cup#First round|first round]] they faced [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] champions [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]]. In [[Athens]] won 2â0 with [[Goal (sport)|goals]] by [[Takis Nikoloudis]] and [[Mimis Papaioannou]]. In [[Moscow]], Dynamo paid them back by winning 2â0 and leading the match to [[extra time]]. In the last minute of extra time, AEK Athens managed to score thanks to a [[penalty kick]] by [[Tasos Konstantinou]] and proceeded to the [[1976â77 UEFA Cup#Second round|second round]]. They were drawn against [[England|English]] 4th placed side [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. In Athens a goal by [[Walter Wagner (footballer)|Walter Wagner]] and an [[own goal]] by [[Rod Thomas]] gave AEK the 2-0 win. In [[Derby]] AEK Athens found themselves behind in the score line but responded scoring three times with Takis Nikoloudis, Tasos Konstantinou and Walter Wagner. Derby Country only managed to score a consolation goal and the match ended in a 2-3 win for AEK Athens. In the [[1976â77 UEFA Cup#Third round|third round]] AEK Athens had to oppose [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] giants [[Red Star Belgrade]]. In Athens AEK was once again victorious by winning 2-0. [[Mimis Papaioannou]] and [[Thomas Mavros]] were the goal-scorers. In [[Belgrade]] Red Star took the lead with a goal by [[Petar BaraliÄ]] but Walter Wagner quickly equalised. The two additional goals scored by [[Zoran FilipoviÄ]] and [[DuÅ¡an SaviÄ]] were not enough and AEK Athens won on [[Away goals rule|away goals]]. In the [[1976â77 UEFA Cup#Quarter-finals|quarter-final]] AEK Athens faced their greatest challenge to that moment, English league's runner-up side [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]]. The first leg was played in [[London]]. The two penalty kick goals in the first ten minutes scored by [[Gerry Francis]] and another one scored by [[Stan Bowles]] gave QPR the 3â0 win and what looked like a certain qualification. Nevertheless AEK Athens made the impossible possible. With two goals by Thomas Mavros and ano more by Mimis Papaioannou AEK Athens sent the match to extra time and eventually to a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Three minutes before the final whistle, [[FrantiÅ¡ek Fadrhonc]] had [[Nikos Christidis]] substitute [[Lakis Stergioudas]], the team's regular [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. His move proved vital as Nikos Christidis saved two penalties and gave AEK Athens a 7-6 win. In the [[1976â77 UEFA Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] draw AEK Athens were to play either Italian league's runner-up side [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] or Spanish league's third placed side [[Athletic Bilbao]]. Ultimately AEK Athens had to face the Italians. In [[Turin]], Juventus scored first with [[Antonello Cuccureddu]] but AEK Athens responded with a goal by [[Lefteris Papadopoulos]]. Two goals by [[Roberto Bettega]] and one by [[Franco Causio]] followed, giving Juventus a 4-1 victory. Juventus also won in [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]] thanks to a goal scored by [[Roberto Boninsegna]] end went on to win their first European title.

===Overview===

Under Fadrhonc's management the club performed well and although they did not manage to win any title they set the basis for the successes which followed.

[[File:Saravakos-Zandravelis.jpg|thumb |left |150px |[[Dimitris Saravakos]], here in a veterans game, joined AEK Athens from rivals [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]] (2009-10-08).]]

In 1994-1995 AEK was the first Greek football club that participated in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League after defeating [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] champions [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. AEK Athens was eliminated in the group stage by [[Eredivisie|Dutch]] champions [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Serie A|Italian]] champions [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who later made it to the final.

In the [[1994â95 Alpha Ethniki|Alpha Ethniki]] AEK Athens had one of the less successful seasons in its history finishing fifth, 21 points behind champions [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]].

AEK Athens chairman Makis Psomiadis replaced popular head coach [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=23378.html |title=Santos quits AEK |date=2002-05-09 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with former AEK Athens legend [[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]]. This decision was not received well by hardcore fans [[Original 21]] who protested because they considered his move to rivals [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] six year ago as high treason. Despite the open hostility towards Bajevic the signings of [[Vassilis Borbokis]] and [[Grigoris Georgatos]] spread optimism for a successful season.

AEK Athens' unbeaten run in the [[2002â03 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] was the highlight of the season. The club played against Cypriot champions [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL]] in the [[2002â03 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|third qualifying round]]. In the first leg in [[Nicosia]] APOEL scored first with [[Marinos Ouzounidis]] but AEK Athens managed to take the lead with [[Vassilis Borbokis|Vasilis Borbokis]] scoring twice. A late equaliser by [[Costas Malekkos]] did not prove enough for APOEL as [[Demis Nikolaidis]] scored during stoppage time giving his club the win. In [[Athens]] AEK Athens won thanks to a header by [[Mauricio Wright]] and entered the [[2002â03 UEFA Champions League#Group stage|group stage]] where they were drawn against [[Belgian Pro League|Belgian]] champions [[K.R.C. Genk|Racing Genk]], [[Serie A|Italian]] runner-up side [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and UEFA Champions League's holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. AEK Athens secured two goalless draws agains Racing Genk in [[Genk]] and Roma in Athens before confronting Real Madrid. Defending champions Madrid drew 3-3 with AEK, but were twice behind against the Greek side. [[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vasilis Tsiartas]] became the first player to score against the Spanish side in this season's competition with a sixth-minute [[Direct free kick|free-kick]]. However, Madrid were soon back on level terms thanks to [[Zinedine Zidane]]'s goal after 15 minutes before further goals from [[Christos Maladenis]] and Demis Nikolaidis put the hosts in the driving seat. However, another Zidane strike and a second-half [[Guti (footballer)|Guti]] goal ensured Madrid left with a point&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=36428.html |title=AEK give Madrid a fright |date=2002-10-03 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An in a way opposite match was played in [[Madrid]] where [[Steve McManaman]]'s two goals put Real Madrid in front during half-time and AEK Athens equilised with goal by [[Kostas Katsouranis]] and [[Walter Centeno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=39412.html |title=Substitutions fire AEK revival |date=2002-10-23 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The next match was agains Racing Genk in Athens. Racing Genk scored first and AEK Athens responded with [[Vassilis Lakis|Vasilis Lakis]] scoring. The group stage was concluded in [[Rome]] agains Roma where AEK Athens was once again behind in the scoreline by a goal scored by [[Marco Delvecchio]] but managed to score a late equiliser with Walter Centeno. The six draws AEK Athens secured are a feat no other club has ever accomplished.

The team continued in the [[2002â03 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and smashed Israeli champions [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] by achieving two of their biggest wins ever in European competitions. They first won in Athens 4-0 with goals by [[Grigoris Georgatos]], Demis Nikolaidis, [[Milen Petkov]] and [[Theodoros Zagorakis|Thodoris Zagorakis]] and then 4-1 in Nicosia with two goals by Vasilis Lakis and two more by Kostas Katsouranis and [[Dimitris Nalitzis]]. [[Walid Badir]] had earlier scored a penalty kick for Maccabi Haifa. AEK Athens' run was brought to an end in the [[2002â03 UEFA Cup#Fourth round|last-16 round]] by Spanish side [[MÃ¡laga CF|MÃ¡laga]]. They drew 0-0 in [[MÃ¡laga]] but lost 0-1 in Athens thanks to a goal by [[Antonio Manuel SÃ¡nchez GÃ³mez|Manu]].

The season was also punctuated by the demolition of [[Nikos Goumas Stadium]], home to AEK for over 70 years, and the assault of club president Makis Psomiadis and his bodyguards to the team captain [[Demis Nikolaidis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=gre/news/newsid=50062.html |title=Nikolaidis in dispute with AEK |date=2003-01-13 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After seven years wearing AEK Athens' number 11 shirt during which he scored 125 goals in the [[Superleague Greece|Alpha Ethniki]], and partly due to the clubâs growing financial problems from mismanagement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=gre/news/newsid=72426.html |title=Psomiadis charged over missing millions |date=2003-05-30 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Demis Nikolaidis]] terminated his contract by mutual consent and signed for [[AtlÃ©tico Madrid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=81083.html |title=Nikolaidis seals Spanish switch |date=2003-07-13 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The transfers of [[Nikos Liberopoulos]] from [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=87400.html |title=Liberopoulos lands at AEK |date=2003-08-01 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ioannis Okkas|Giannis Okkas]] from [[P.A.O.K. F.C.|P.A.O.K.]] promised to revitalise the clubâs on-field success amid the growing financial problems. Modest performances, though, were not enough as more off-field dramas unfolded. Unable to cope with the negativity from a large section of AEK Athens fans, BajeviÄ resigned in 2004 during a season match against [[Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]] and [[Ilie Dumitrescu]] was appointed as a caretaker manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=142174.html |title=Dumitrescu takes over at AEK |date=2004-02-02 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
Under BajeviÄ's management the club generally perform well, especially in his first season. They played a total of 82 matches winning 45 of them and drawing in 23 more. They scored a total of 166 goals conceding 78.

{{main|2004â05 AEK Athens F.C. season}}

On the brink of bankruptcy, and losing most of its [[UEFA Euro 2004]] stars and experienced players to other European clubs, AEK needed a miracle to prevent it from being relegated to the Greek amateur leagues. Though both [[Kostas Katsouranis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=209806.html |title=Katsouranis stays at AEK |date=2004-07-25 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nikos Liberopoulos]] remained, [[Vassilis Borbokis]], [[Grigoris Georgatos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=131253.html |title=Georgatos quits AEK |date=2003-12-04 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UEFA Euro 2004]] MVP [[Theodoros Zagorakis|Theodoris Zagorakis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=207407.html |title=Zagorakis release alerts Europe |date=2004-07-14 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michalis Kapsis]], [[Michalis Kasapis]], [[Michel Kreek]], [[Vassilis Lakis]], [[Vassilios Tsiartas|Vassilis Tsiartas]], and [[Ioannis Okkas|Giannis Okkas]] all left the club in the wake of the troubles.

In was then when [[Demis Nikolaidis]] persuaded a group of businessmen (including [[Nicholas X. Notias|Nikos Notias]], [[Petros Pappas]], [[Takis Kannelopoulos]], [[Gikas Goumas]] and [[Polis Hatziioannou]]) to buy shares and invest money to the club and became the new club president with the help of all AEK fans who started mass protests organized by the hardcore fans [[Original 21]]. His primary task was to lead AEK Athens out of its precarious financial position. The first success was an arrangement through the Greek justice system to write off most of the massive debt that previous club administrators had amassed, and to repay any remaining public debts in manageable instalments. Securing the clubâs existence in the Alpha Ethniki, Nikolaidis then began a program to rebuild AEK to its former glory. He appointed experienced former player [[Ilija IviÄ]] as technical director of the club and brought back [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]] as head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=208245.html |title=Santos returns to AEK |date=2004-07-16 |work=uefa.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AEK Athens fans, emboldened by Nikolaidisâs efforts, followed suit by buying season ticket packages in record numbers (over 17,000). AEK Athens recruited mostly young Greek players led by Katsouranis and Liberopoulos to form a competitive team.

With the winter additions of [[JÃºlio CÃ©sar da Silva e Souza|JÃºlio CÃ©sar]] and [[Serbia national football team|Serbian]] international [[Vladimir IviÄ]] AEK Athens came close to winning the [[Alpha Ethniki 2004â05|2004â05 Alpha Ethniki]] but a surprise loss to underdogs [[Ionikos F.C.|Ionikos]] cost them the title. Furthermore a serius mistake by [[referee]] [[Kyros Vassaras]] made them lose the chance to compte in the [[UEFA Champions League]] [[2005â06 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds#Third qualifying round|third qualifying round]].

{{main|2007â08 AEK Athens F.C. season}}

On 12 February 2008 AEK parted company with [[Lorenzo Serra Ferrer]] after a poor run of form and un-successful signings and replaced him with former player and then assistant manager [[Nikos Kostenoglou]], on a caretaker basis, at the end of an indifferent season. The team had an impressive run in the last ten games of the league, during which they had two 4-0 wins against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]], finishing in first place. Nevertheless the team ultimately finished second due to a court case between [[Apollon Kalamarias F.C.|Apollon Kalamaria]] and Olympiacos for the illegal usage of [[Roman Wallner]] in Apollon Kalamaria's 1-0 win earlier in the season. Olympiacos were awarded the three points in a court hearing, thus finishing two points ahead of AEK. AEK president [[Demis Nikolaidis]] and several other managers and chairmen have been angered with the court's decision stating that the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] knew about the usage of the illegal player prior to the game but didn't do anything about it.

The second place meant that the club had to compete in the league's play-offs but AEK Athens' captains, MVP performer [[Rivaldo]] and president [[Demis Nikolaidis]] did not want to compete as they considered themselves champions. [[Akis Zikos]] preferred to retire after the league's last game against [[Asteras Tripoli F.C.|Asteras Tripoli]] than compete in the play-offs. Nevertheless, the clubs stakeholders insisted that the club had to compete and the ultimately did. The clubs low morale resulted in disastrous results, including a 4-1 loss against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] and a 4-0 loss against [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]]. They finishing second in the play-offs missing the opportunity to compete in the [[UEFA Champions League]] during the nest season.

===Overview===
Under Kostenoglou's management the club had mixed performances, excellend in the domestic league yet disappointing in the UEFA Cup and the play-offs. They played a total of 18 matches winning 10 of them and drawing in 5 more. They scored a total of 35 goals conceding 19.

On top of that [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] legend [[Rivaldo]] who was the new captain asked, and was ultimately given, a last minute thansfer to [[Uzbeks|Uzbeki]] side [[FC Bunyodkor|Bunyodkor]].

The season started in the worst way possible as AEK Athens failed to surpass [[AC Omonia|Omonia]] (0-1 in [[Athens]], 2-2 in [[Nicosia]]) for [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup's]] [[2008â09 UEFA Cup#Second qualifying round|second qualifying round]] second qualifying round resulting their elimination from European competitions, the earliest on in ther history.

The league campaign started very well due to the 2-1 [[Local derby|derby]] win over [[AEK and Panathinaikos rivalry|rivals]] [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] thanks to goals by [[Arnaldo Edi Lopes da Silva|Edinho]] and [[Ismael Blanco]] in the opening game but a series of poor performances and results left AEK Athens in a difficult situation. Donis was eager to leave the club after drawing 3-3 against underdogs [[Thrasyvoulos F.C.|Thrasyvoulos]] despite having a 0-3 [[half-time]] lead, but president [[Demis Nikolaidis]] did not allow him to leave. Nevertheless, Nikolaidis left shortly after due to the continuous disappointing results, the heavy criticism he took from the fans and the press for the disbandment of last year's championship winning team and a lengthy clash with the club's hardcore supporters [[Original 21]]. The presidency was temporarily taken by Nikos Koulis and Takis Kanellopoulos. However, the series of disappointing results continued, bringing anger and insecure situations for everyone in the team. The first to be hit by this wave of disappointment and with the council of the team upset, was Donis, who was asked to leave the team after a 0-0 home draw against [[Panserraikos F.C.|Panserraikos]].

===Overview===
Under Donis' management the club did not perform well. They played a total of 13 matches winning 4 of them and drawing in 7 more. They scored a total of 17 goals while conceding 16.

{{main|2008â09 AEK Athens F.C. season}}

On November 21, 2008, Koulis and Kanellopoulos hired [[DuÅ¡an BajeviÄ]] as head coach for the third time. However after a while and because of the controversy surrounding BajeviÄ's return to AEK Athens a rivalry sparked between him and Kanellopoulos resulting in the latterâs resign from the presidency.

[[Georgios Kintis]] became the team's new president shortly after but did not last long as on February 4, 2009 Nikos Thanopoulos was elected as number 41 president of AEK Athens.

During the winter transfer period [[Edson Ramos Silva|Edson Ratinho]] and [[Greece national football team|Greece's]] captain [[Angelos Basinas]] left the club. The only addition to the squad was [[Olivier N'Siabamfumu]].

Bajevic brought some much-needed stability to the club, and performances on the pitch improved vastly towards the end of the season, culminating in AEK's progression to the [[2008â09 Greek Cup|Greek Cup]] [[2008â09 Greek Cup#Final|final]] against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]. Although they took an early 2-0 lead, thanks to two goals by [[Ismael Blanco]], and a 3-2 lead, thanks to a stoppage time goal by [[Ignacio Scocco|Nacho Scocco]], the march ended in a 4-4 draw and the winner would be decided in a penalty shootout in which AEK Athens lost 14-15 due to three penalties misses by [[Daniel Majstorovic]], [[Nikolaos Georgeas|Nikos Georgeas]] and [[Agustin Pelletieri]].

AEK Athens finished fourth in the [[2008â09 Superleague Greece|Greek Superleague]], thus qualifying for the seasons [[2008â09 Superleague Greece#Play-offs|play-offs]].

In the play-offs they secured the second place just missing out the [[UEFA Champions League]] [[2009â10 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round#Third qualifying round|third qualifying round]] ticket. Instead AEK Athens would compete in the newly founded [[2009â10 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]].

[[Ismael Blanco]] finished the season with a total 23 goals, 14 of which were scored in the [[2008â09 Superleague Greece|Greek Superleague]] earning him his second consecutive title of [[List of top goalscorers in Superleague Greece by season|Greek Superleague top goalscorer]]. He was also the top goalscorer of the Greek Cup.

Despite the difficulties AEK Athens won 3-0 in the second leg, thanks to goals by [[Gustavo Manduca]] and [[Ignacio Scocco|Nacho Scocco]] (x2), and qualified for the UEFA Europa League [[2009â10 UEFA Europa League group stage#Group I|group stage]].

In a group featuring [[Primeira Liga|Portuguese]] third placed side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Premier League|English]] fifth placed side [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], and [[Belarusian Premier League|Belarusian]] champions [[FC BATE Borisov|BATE]], AEK Athens secured only a 1-0 victory against Benfica thanks to a header by [[Daniel Majstorovic]] and a gathered total of four points.

The transfer of [[Ignacio Scocco|Nacho Scocco]] to [[Al Ain S.C.C.|Al Ain]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] brought 2.8 million [[Euro]]s to AEK Athens yet combined with the deparure of [[Argentina national football team|Argentine]] international [[SebastiÃ¡n Saja]] and [[Miguel Marcos Madera|MÃ­chel]] greatly depowered the squad.

==Colours and Kit==

[[File:AEK shirt.jpg|thumb |right |400px| AEK Athens' shirt history from 1924 until 2008.]]

Yellow and black, the colours AEK Athens has adopted for their kits come from it connection with [[Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Yellow symbolises the glory of the Empire while black symbolises the grief for the Empire's fall.

The third kit is usually blue and white colour taken from the [[Flag of Greece|Greek flag]]. For a couple of season the third kit used to be [[Scarlet (color)#Dark scarlet|dark scarlet]], a colour which was featured in the Empire's [[Byzantine heraldry#Gallery|flag]].

AEK Athens have always worn predominantly striped or plain yellow shirts, black shorts, and yellow or black socks. Variations mostly include all-black or all-yellow kits.

The most notable exception were the kits manufactured by Italian firms Basic and [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]] which were used during the 1990s. They featured a double-headed eagle across the kit and the 1994 version was voted &quot;Kit of the season&quot; by [[UEFA]].

===Crest===

[[File:Flag of the Greek Orthodox Church.svg|thumb |right |150px| Flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].]]

[[File:CoA of Palaiologos Dynasty.svg|thumb |right |150px| [[Byzantine heraldry|Imperial emblem]] under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty.]]

In 1924, AEK Athens adopted the image of a [[double-headed eagle]] as their emblem. AEK Athens was created by [[Greeks|Greek]] refugees from [[Constantinople]] in the years following the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919â1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and subsequent [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] and the emblem was chosen as a reminder of their lost homelands representing the club's historical ties to [[Constantinople]]. After all, the double-headed eagle is featured in the flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], whose headquarters are in Constantinople, and served as [[Byzantine heraldry|Imperial emblem]] under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty.

AEK Athens' main emblem underwent numerous minor changes between 1924 and 1982. The design of the eagle on the shirt badge was often not identical to the design of the eagle depicted on official club correspondence, merchandise and promotional material. All designs were considered &quot;official&quot; (in the broadest sense of the word), however, it was not until 1982 that an identifiable, copyrighted design was established as the club's official, and shirt, badge. The emblem design was changed in 1989, and again in 1993 to the current shield design.
