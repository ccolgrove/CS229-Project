The following is a catalogue of '''characters from the U.S. version of ''The Office'''''. ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' is a television series based on [[The Office (UK TV series)|the British television comedy of the same name]]. The format of the series, a parody of the [[fly on the wall]] documentary technique that intersperses traditional [[situation comedy]] segments with [[mockumentary|mock interviews]] with the show's characters, provides the audience access to the ongoing interior monologues for all of the main characters, as well as occasional insights into other characters within the show.

==Other Dunder Mifflin/Sabre employees==

===Rolando===

'''Rolando''' ([[Adam Jamal Craig]]) is the effeminate, African-American receptionist at [[Dunder Mifflin]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]] branch. In the episode &quot;[[Branch Wars]]&quot;, Rolando informs [[Pam Halpert|Pam]] about the raid on the Utica branch by [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]], [[Dwight Schrute|Dwight]], and [[Jim Halpert|Jim]]. In the episode &quot;[[Lecture Circuit]]&quot;, Michael and Pam travel to Utica so Michael can perform a presentation to the Utica staff, including [[Karen Filippelli|Karen]]. Upon entering the office, Michael introduces Pam to Rolando (whom she already knows) and suggests that they go on a &quot;little friend date&quot;, to which Rolando responds with a scoff and proceeds to tell Michael he is late for his meeting.&lt;ref&gt;http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Rolando&lt;/ref&gt;

===A.J.===

'''A.J.''' ([[Rob Huebel]]) is an affable salesman at the Nashua branch, as well as, more notably, the boyfriend of Michael's ex, Holly, when she transfers there from Scranton. Michael meets him on his [[Lecture Circuit|lecture circuit]] and becomes devastated when he learns Holly is dating him. Michael awkwardly calls out A.J. during his presentation about Holly, but A.J. doesn't react. He is seen again at the [[Company Picnic|company picnic]] along with Holly, whom he is still dating. A.J. tells Michael they've started designing a house for themselves. Michael makes a number of joking insults at A.J., who doesn't respond to them. After Michael and Holly's disastrous presentation coupled with the obvious affection the two still have for each other, Michael maturely lets Holly leave with A.J. as he is not going to force anything to happen between them. A.J. can also be seen in the end of the TV commercial for the Nashua branch that the advertising representatives shown Michael in &quot;[[Local Ad]]&quot;. He is seen in the 1-hour long Christmas episode, &quot;[[Classy Christmas]]&quot; after Holly is transferred back to Scranton. He surprised her only to Michael's disgust after learning they are living with each other. In season seven, when Holly returns to Scranton for a temporary secondment, it is revealed that she and A.J. are going through problems and that she is upset that he has not proposed to her yet. Holly then tells A.J. she wants to take a break between them, ends their relationship, and begins dating Michael again.

===Danny Cordray===

'''Danny Cordray''' ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) is introduced in Season 7 in the episode, &quot;[[The Sting (The Office) |The Sting]]&quot; as a rival salesman who is stealing all of Dunder Mifflin's clients. Michael, Dwight and Jim set up an in-building sting to copy his skills as a salesman. When Danny finds out about the sting, he tells Michael he is going to punch him in the face. Michael offers him a job as a traveling salesman (blessedly forgetting about [[Todd Packer]] having that post) and Danny takes it only to be insulted by all the employees. When Jim was in Stamford, Pam dated Danny a few times, but he never called her back.
In &quot;[[Costume Contest]]&quot;, he seems to fit in with the employees, and impresses them by inviting the whole staff to a Halloween party at Public School, the bar he owns. Meanwhile, Jim tries numerous times to find out why Danny never called Pam back. Danny first says that Pam only talked about Jim during their dates and he knew she was in love with him; when Jim and Pam tell him that couldn't be true, Danny reluctantly says the real reason he didn't call her back because she was &quot;kind of dorky.&quot; Jim seems annoyed with Danny's honesty but Pam appears to appreciate that she knows the real story at last. In &quot;[[Michael's Last Dundies]]&quot;, he wins the &quot;Hottest in The Office&quot; Dundie, defeating reigning champ Ryan. In a deleted scene from the episode, he can be seen accepting the award in advance with Michael.

===Kathy Simms===
'''Kathy Simms''' (Lindsay Broad) is introduced in the season eight episode &quot;[[Pam's Replacement]]&quot; as a temporary office worker filling in for Pam during her pregnancy.

==Warehouse employees==
===Lonnis &quot;Lonny&quot; Collins===

'''Lonny''' ([[Patrice O'Neal]]) is a dock worker. Lonny joins his friend Darryl in open displays of irritation by and intimidation toward Michael. He became a vocal supporter of Darryl in trying to establish a union, citing the low pay they receive in comparison to the office employees. He is best known for yelling at Michael after Michael trashed the entire warehouse. He also insulted Michael in front of the staff during Darryl's safety training seminar, after Michael frequently interrupted the presentation with his obnoxiousness, and made fun of Michael anew during the office staff's own workplace safety lecture. Kelly insults him, referring to him as &quot;[[Sea Monster]]&quot; because he is overweight.

===Madge Madsen===

'''Madge Madsen''' ([[Karly Rothenberg]]) is a dock worker. Madge is a female warehouse employee who played against the office team during the &quot;[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]&quot; game (which led to Michael's crude reference to her as &quot;the [[East Germany#Sport|East German]] gal&quot;).  When Michael led the male office workers into the warehouse for some &quot;guy time,&quot; Madge excused herself from the proceedings. Initially Michael did not understand why she was leaving, indicating that he had not realized that she was a woman. Michael mistook her name by calling her &quot;Pudge&quot; and later &quot;Padge&quot;, not knowing her real name. Michael and Dwight stole her uniform when heading out to prank the Utica branch during &quot;[[Branch Wars]]&quot;, and Jim ended up wearing it during the whole fiasco.  Madge makes a brief appearance in &quot;Heavy Competition&quot; when Dwight mistakes her for Michael as she walked by him. In &quot;[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]&quot; it is revealed that the warehouse employees refer to her as &quot;Garfield&quot; for her affection for lasagna. In &quot;[[Costume Contest]]&quot;, after the warehouse workers are allowed to make sales, it is said that Madge had made her first sale. When she and the rest of the warehouse employees win nearly a million dollars in a winning lottery ticket during &quot;[[Lotto (The Office)|Lotto]]&quot;, Madge quits her job on the spot.

===Phillip===

'''Phillip''' is a dock worker who is visibly shocked at Michael's antics.

===Jerry DiCanio===

'''Jerry DiCanio''' ([[Matt DeCaro]])  is a dock worker.  In the episode &quot;[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]&quot;, Michael, knowing that his team is winning, claims that Jerry's inadvertent elbow hit to Michael's face is an intentional foul.  Michael then declares that their &quot;friendly&quot; game has led to violence, and abruptly ends the game, declaring his team the winner.

===Michael===

'''Michael''' (Lamont Ferrell) is a dock worker who once gave Michael Scott a ride home, getting stuck for an hour in traffic, only to find that Michael had forgotten his name the following week in &quot;[[Stress Relief]]&quot;.

===Matt===

'''Matt''' ([[Sam Daly]]) works at the Dunder-Mifflin warehouse. It is presumed that he started work there shortly before December 2009. It is revealed in &quot;[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]&quot; that Oscar Martinez secretly has a crush on him, and that Matt is also gay. Pam spends the whole Christmas party trying to get Oscar and Matt to bond. In the episode &quot;[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]&quot;, Oscar invites the warehouse crew and the office to drinks in an effort to hang out with Matt. The only real interaction between the two is when Matt invites Oscar to play [[basketball]] with him which Oscar gladly accepts despite the fact that he is terrible at basketball, confirming Darryl's accurate impression that Matt has nothing in common with Oscar.

===Hide===

'''Hide''' (Hidetoshi Imura) was introduced in the episode &quot;[[Basketball (The Office)|Basketball]]&quot; loading boxes in the background but is formally introduced in &quot;[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]&quot;. Hide is best known from his retelling the story of how he came to America. A former heart surgeon from Japan, he claims he was &quot;the best&quot; due to his steady hands. He said that one day a [[Yakuza]] boss needed a new heart and that he did the operation but the [[Yakuza]] boss died during the operation. He hid in a fishing boat and came to America where Darryl hired him and &quot;saved his life&quot;. However, Hide later claims that his big secret is that he killed the Yakuza boss on purpose and is still the best surgeon. With Dwight's help, he applies for Sabre's minority executive training program, unsuccessfully. He is married and owns a house and an American car. Hide is one of the warehouse employees who becomes part of a near million-dollar winning lottery ticket in &quot;[[Lotto (The Office)|Lotto]]&quot;, and along with the rest of the warehouse, quits his job on the spot. A melancholy Darryl has to hire new warehouse staff and starts making disparaging remarks about the former warehouse staff, singling out Hide as using his money to make a drink for Asian homosexuals.

==Former Dunder Mifflin employees==
===Michael Scott===

''Main article: [[Michael Scott (The Office)]]

'''Michael Scott''' started at Dunder Mifflin in 1992, and was one of Dunder Mifflin's top salesmen. After Ed Truck retired, he was promoted to Regional Manager. As regional manager, Michael was often immature and used his position to try to make his employees his friends, much to their dismay. However, on some occasions, he proved to be a terrific manager and business man, notably when negotiating his demands for the Michael Scott Paper Company to be bought out by Dunder Mifflin, and strategically hiring Danny Cordray due to his good sales record being a good addition to the company. He left in the Season 7 episode &quot;[[Goodbye, Michael]]&quot; to move to Boulder, Colorado with his fiancee, [[Holly Flax]].

===Holly Flax===

''Main article: [[Holly Flax]]

'''Holly Flax''' was a Human Resources Representative for Dunder Mifflin, originally employed at the Nashua branch but in mid 2008 transferred to the Scranton branch for a few months to replace [[Toby Flenderson]], where she finds herself sparking up a friendship and eventual relationship with Regional Manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], who shares a similar personality. After CFO David Wallace finds out about their relationship, he transfers her back to her original branch and ultimately this leads to her and Michael breaking up due to long distance. She later begins dating a salesman at her office named A.J., and soon they start living with each other. When Toby takes another leave of absence, Holly is transferred back to the Scranton branch as a temporary fill-in. She breaks up with A.J. in a matter of weeks and begins dating Michael again shortly after that. When she realizes her parents are aging in need of assistance (and also that her time at the Scranton branch is running thin) she decides to leave the company, with Michael following closely after her.

===Charles Miner===

''Main article: [[Charles Miner (The Office)]]''

'''Charles Miner''' ([[Idris Elba]]) was the stern, no-nonsense, newly appointed Vice President of Northeast Sales for Dunder Mifflin and an antagonist to Michael and Jim.

===Devon White===

'''Devon White''' (Devon Abner) is a former office worker in Supplier Relations.  He was an office employee who sat across from Creed (who is directly responsible for getting Devon fired, to save his own job). Devon (dressed as a hobo) was reluctantly laid off by Michael on &quot;[[Halloween (The Office)|Halloween]]&quot;, and took it badly. In a bid to salvage their &quot;friendship&quot;, Michael offered Devon free [[Chili's]] gift certificates which Devon ripped up in Michael's face.  While storming out, Devon invited &quot;Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly, Toby, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Stanley, or [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|the temp]],&quot; to drinks, leaving out Angela, Dwight, Michael, and Creed. This implies he was never friendly with Angela and Dwight. Devon then smashes a pumpkin on Michael's car in retaliation. The episode marks his only dialogue in front of the camera. When Michael later receives a $3,000 Christmas bonus because Dunder Mifflin saved money through downsizing, he considers calling Devon to thank him, saying &quot;some good came of it.&quot; 

Devon was also warned by Dwight in &quot;[[The Dundies]]&quot; to keep his speech short. On the Season One DVD, a deleted scene from &quot;[[Diversity Day]]&quot; shows Devon with a &quot;West Nile&quot; sign on his forehead, as he escapes the seminar for a smoke. On the Season Two DVD, a deleted scene from &quot;[[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]]&quot; shows Michael walking down the street in [[New York City]], when a seemingly [[homeless]] pedestrian seems to recognize him and then chases him down the street. In the following scene, Michael reveals that it was Devon chasing him, and cluelessly reflects that it was nice to see Devon again and get closure on their whole story.

===Josh Porter===

'''Joshua &quot;Josh&quot; Porter''' ([[Charles Esten]]) was the ''[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] Regional Manager''. Introduced in the &quot;[[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]]&quot; episode (and first mentioned- although not seen- in the &quot;[[Pilot (The Office)|Pilot]]&quot;), Josh was the Regional Manager of the Stamford branch before its closure in &quot;[[Branch Closing]]&quot;.

Josh is a colleague of Michael's and seemingly a more responsible and competent boss (although some episodes imply that Michael's branch is more productive than Josh's). Jim worked for him in Stamford and seemed to look up to him (taking after his practice of biking to work). Michael resents Josh, initially because he feels that Jim prefers Josh's friendship to his own. This is later proven untrue; however, Michael still retained a certain resentment for Josh.

When it was announced in &quot;[[Branch Closing]]&quot; that Dunder Mifflin Scranton would be closing, Josh was offered a promotion to become the manager of Dunder Mifflin's newly formed Northeast region. However, he leveraged the offer to obtain a senior management job with [[Staples, Inc.|Staples]], throwing plans for the Scranton closing into disarray. As a direct result of Josh's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin, it was decided to close the Stamford branch instead. Disgusted, Jim later says of Josh's double-dealing, &quot;Say what you will about Michael Scott -- but he would ''never'' do that.&quot;

In deleted scenes from the episode &quot;[[The Convention (The Office)|The Convention]]&quot; Josh states that he once spent time working on a [[Kibbutz]] in [[Israel]] and when Dwight asks if they grew beets there Josh says they focused on growing oranges, tells Dwight he was once a member of the [[United States Coast Guard]], says he doesn't want to comment on Michael and Jan because it's gross, and declines Jan's offer to join her in her room for a drink.

===Ed Truck===

'''Ed Truck''' ''(deceased)'' ([[Ken Howard]]) was the former Regional Manager of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] Branch for whom Michael worked before Ed retired. Ed also hired Creed, Phyllis, and Darryl, who describe Ed as &quot;a good guy&quot;. In the episode &quot;[[The Carpet]]&quot;, Michael believes that the [[fecal matter]] left on his office [[carpet]] was left there because he is disliked by his coworkers. He scams Truck into meeting with him to discuss [[pension]] issues but winds up asking for his opinions on the situation. As it turned out, Ed had someone defecate on his office carpet as well. In that discussion, Ed's advice to Michael is &quot;Why can't you just let your workers be your workers, your friends be your friends, and your family be your family?&quot; (The joke here is that Michael has no real friends or family, and his employees serve as reluctant surrogates).

According to Creed (in &quot;[[Grief Counseling (The Office)|Grief Counseling]]&quot;), Ed was &quot;drunk as a skunk&quot; and driving on [[U.S. Route 6 in Pennsylvania|Route 6]] when he managed to go under an 18-wheeler, [[Decapitation|decapitating]] himself. Michael doesn't take the death of his former boss too well, leading to [[grief counseling]] for his employees. Though Michael in previous episodes expressed feelings of dislike toward Ed's more serious management style when he worked under him, he expresses feeling of extreme remorse when Kelly, in giving Michael her undivided attention and pity, proclaims that he must feel awful. Michael requests that a statue of Ed be erected in his memory, but Jan nixes the suggestion, stating that Corporate wouldn't like it. As a compromise, there is a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] honoring him hanging between Michael's office and the conference room.

===Hunter===

'''Hunter''' ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]) was Jan's assistant (&quot;[[The Negotiation]]&quot;). Michael feels threatened by Hunter's youthful good looks.  He also has listened in on Michael and Jan's phone conversations; in &quot;[[Women's Appreciation]]&quot; he was on the line during a sensitive phone conversation between the two and Jan tells Michael to tell Hunter if he is visiting her that night, so that he can get more vodka. In &quot;[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]]&quot;, Michael makes Hunter uncomfortable by asking him to give Jan a message: &quot;I want to squeeze [[breast implants|them]].&quot; After receiving her termination, Jan wishes Hunter luck with his band and tells him, &quot;Don't let them change you.&quot; In &quot;[[Dinner Party (The Office)|Dinner Party]]&quot;, it is revealed that Ryan fired Hunter not long afterwards (perhaps for his complicity in Jan's negligence of her job); however, he has released a CD with his band, ''The Hunted'', implying he may have taken up a career in music. One of the songs (as well as Jan's behavior when she listens to it), &quot;That One Night&quot;, seems to imply that Hunter at one point may have slept with Jan, and quite possibly that he lost his virginity to her. On Jan's website, &quot;serenitybyjancandles.com&quot;, she lists one candle as &quot;Hunter Green&quot; and says, &quot;This youthful, firm scent will leave your mouth watering. While designing this candle I felt like a college girl again. Just as Eve was tempted by a decadent apple, youâll be tempted by the most erotic scent of my collection, &quot;Hunter Green.&quot; &quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serenitybyjancandles.com/candles/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;, another hint at the possible sexual relations between her and Hunter.

===Jordan Garfield===
'''Jordan Garfield''' ([[Cody Horn]]) was the new Executive Assistant that Deangelo Vickers had hired in &quot;[[The Inner Circle (The Office)|The Inner Circle]]&quot; (mainly to prove to the staff that he was not sexist). She was shown to be inexperienced (having no business background) and only chosen because of her model looks, which deeply frustrated Pam. She could be seen taking notes during one of Deangelo's inner circle meetings, and was called a &quot;whore&quot; by Dwight after asking him what she could do for him. She was also present at the basketball game downstairs in the warehouse with Deangelo and the rest of the staff. In a deleted scene, Deangelo told her to escort Jim out of his office, which she awkwardly did. After that, she had her first talking head interview, where she openly expressed how she wasn't liking her new job so far.

In &quot;[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]&quot;, Dwight ordered her to clean his original desk off and move his belongings to the manager's office. Later, he brought her into the room and talked about how everyone in the office thought of her as a joke (being hired only because of her looks). In a deleted scene, she went around checking everyone off to see what troubles they were having - Jim filled out the forms for her as a prank towards Dwight, and she laughed at it; in a talking head that occurred right after, she acknowledged Jim's funniness and shyly looked down, which hinted that she was possibly developing a crush on him.

Jordan is not seen in the eighth season, presumably having left the company once the new manager was chosen.

===Ronni===

'''Ronni''' ([[Dale Raoul]]) appeared in the episode &quot;[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]&quot; as the replacement for Pam as receptionist when she went to art school. Michael was visibly unappreciative of her, and after her question &quot;Does anyone want to dance?&quot; at an office party was met with universal disgust, he had Ronni replaced with Ryan. She also has a cameo in the episode &quot;[[Shareholder Meeting]]&quot; in a flashback.

===Dan Gore===

'''Dan Gore''' (Dan Cole) is the Regional Manager of the Buffalo branch. He was first introduced in &quot;[[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]]&quot; attending the meeting with the new CFO, David Wallace. He also attended Wallace's cocktail party in &quot;[[Cocktails (The Office)|Cocktails]]&quot;, and was seen in &quot;[[Launch Party]]&quot; trying to see if his branch's camera was working. He was one of the company leaders who attended Ryan's wilderness retreat, along with Toby (and not the pointedly un-invited Michael Scott). It is announced in &quot;[[Company Picnic]]&quot; that the Buffalo branch is closing due to the economy, meaning all the employees working at the branch will lose their jobs, though he is not present to hear this.

===Craig===

'''Craig''' (Craig Anton) is the manager of the Albany branch seen in &quot;[[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]]&quot;. Craig doesn't seem to take his job very seriously and has &quot;been kicked out of every strip club in Albany&quot; according to Michael. He resents having to work under Jan and doesn't always do what she orders him to. He and Michael seem get along well, though their relationship is soured when they argue over their opinions of Jan and when Craig tries to save face by leaking Michael's relationship between the two in front of David Wallace. Michael later jokes that Craig &quot;is not the sharpest tool in the shed&quot; in an attempt to defend Jan.

===Troy L. Underbridge===

'''Troy Underbridge''' ([[Noel Petok]]) works in banking at the corporate office. Troy Underbridge is notorious for encouraging [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]]'s partying and cocaine abuse. [[Dwight Schrute]] is convinced that Troy is in fact a [[hobbit]]. Troy originally appeared in the episode &quot;[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]]&quot; with no lines. He then reappeared with a more pivotal role in &quot;[[Night Out]]&quot;, and then returned once again in &quot;[[Goodbye, Toby]]&quot; in a deleted scene. Since he worked for the Dunder Mifflin corporate office, it is presumed that he lost his job with the other corporate executives.

Troy had a brief appearance in Michael's film ''Threat Level Midnight'' (in the episode &quot;[[Threat Level Midnight]]&quot;).

Troy's middle initial is introduced on the ''Threat Level Midnight'' website. His name is supposed to read like &quot;troll under bridge&quot;.

===Kendall===

'''Kendall''' is the human resources representative for corporate. He was mentioned by [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] in the episode &quot;[[The Job (The Office)|The Job]].&quot; While interviewing [[Jim Halpert]], David called Kendall an irritating HR guy and said he is probably the only guy Jim isn't going to like, mirroring Michael's unconditional dislike of Toby. When Holly Flax learns of Meredith's trading sexual favors for supply discounts in &quot;[[Business Ethics (The Office)|Business Ethics]]&quot;, Kendall not only isn't upset by the news (he thinks Meredith is doing D-M a good turn) he angrily tells her she's failed to just get the review forms signed and says if she can't do that they'll need another discussion. Kendall makes his first on-screen appearance in &quot;[[Stress Relief]],&quot; and appears again in &quot;[[Company Picnic]],&quot; in which he and [[Toby Flenderson]] talk about past human resources stories, showing a similar personality to Toby. Since he was the corporate HR representative, it is presumed that he lost his job or was transferred out of New York to a new Sabre branch that needed its own Toby on-site.

===Thomas Peets===

'''Thomas Peets''', according to the season two episode, &quot;[[Performance Review]],&quot; was a former Dunder Mifflin Scranton accountant. Michael noted that Tom was &quot;weird.&quot; Apparently, Tom suffered from depression and shot himself. For the first three seasons, he was simply referred to as &quot;Tom.&quot; His full name was finally revealed on May 2, 2008, when NBC uploaded Dwight's [http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/downloads/dunder_mifflin_org_chart.pdf organization] [http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/downloads/dunder_mifflin_emerg_org_chart.pdf charts] from the fourth season episode &quot;[[Did I Stutter?]]&quot; as [[.pdf]] files available for download.  In a DVD extra for the Fourth Season DVD set, the writers revealed that Tom's suicide was a joke but by setting it one year prior to the discovery of a note from Tom they realized that the suicide would have been the day before Ryan was hired as a [[temporary worker]]...thus making Ryan Tom's replacement.

===Sadiq===

'''Sadiq''' ([[Omi Vaidya]]) does [[tech support]]. First appearing in &quot;[[E-mail Surveillance]]&quot;, he is sent by management to teach Michael how to monitor office email. Sadiq's [[turban]] in the context of the [[Post 9-11]] atmosphere initially leads Michael to assume that he is dangerous. This assumption leads Michael to run into the office and tell everyone to be quiet and turn off the lights so Sadiq will think that nobody is inside. Later in the episode, Sadiq attends Jim's barbecue (to the consternation of Michael, who wasn't invited and still doesn't appear to trust Sadiq's motives). In &quot;[[Fun Run]]&quot;, Sadiq cleans a computer virus from [[Pam Halpert|Pam]]'s computer. He is a [[Sikh]] but resents being only classified by his religion, telling a meeting during &quot;Fun Run&quot; that he likes listening to [[hip hop]] and [[National Public Radio]], and is restoring a 1967 [[Chevrolet Corvette C3|Corvette]]. When the company is acquired by Sabre, Sadiq presumably loses his job, as a new IT Technician, Nick, takes his place. Dwight tells Sadiq's angrily departing successor Nick that they liked Sadiq for two reasons: he kept to himself, and they were afraid to cross him because they thought he might actually be a terrorist.

===Nick===

'''Nick''' ([[Nelson Franklin]]) is the [[information technology|IT]] administrator brought in by Sabre corporate.  Reserved but amiable, Michael regards him as a &quot;nerd&quot; and everyone in the office treats him as badly as Michael treats Toby, forgetting his name and role in the office as Gabe claims they think he is the actual IT guy. Dwight and Ryan try to blackmail Nick into helping getting Jim fired, but he refuses.  He quits his job in the Season 6 finale to join Teach for America (Detroit), but before he leaves he tells off the entire staff for treating him like dirt and never remembering his name. He vengefully reveals a number of personal secrets that various office members have kept hidden on their computers, outs Andy as the leak in the printer fires story, and gives everyone the [[finger (gesture)|finger]] as he leaves.

==Employees transferred from Stamford Branch==

After Josh Porter throws the planned absorption of the Scranton Branch into disarray, corporate decides that Scranton will absorb Stamford. Six Stamford Branch employees are transferred to Scranton: Tony Gardner, Martin Nash, Hannah Smoterich-Barr, [[Karen Filippelli]], [[Andy Bernard]] and [[Jim Halpert]] (who formerly worked at Scranton). The first three listed above quit almost immediately, because of Michael's management methods and other office problems; Andy and Jim stay. Karen stays for a considerable amount of time (the remainder of Season 3) but eventually transfers to the Utica branch after Jim breaks up with her.

===Tony Gardner===

'''Tony Gardner''' (Mike Bruner) was a heavyset bespectacled employee at the Stamford branch, and is one of the six employees that were transferred to Scranton during &quot;[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]]&quot;. Tony also has a tendency to whine, as shown in his first appearance in the &quot;[[Diwali (The Office)|Diwali]]&quot; episode, when his chips get stuck in a vending machine, and he asks Karen to use her &quot;skinny little arms&quot; to help him get them out. Before even meeting Tony, Dwight tries to persuade Michael to fire him on his first day in order to scare the new employees straight. On Tony's first day, he can hardly take Michael's antics, but he hits his breaking point when Michael and Dwight tried to lift his large person onto a table for an orientation demonstration (Michael refers to his leg as a &quot;hock&quot;). Humiliated and angry, Tony quits, admitting that he was not completely sure about transferring to begin with, but mostly blaming Michael's management style. An insulted Michael fires Tony instead, resulting in Dunder Mifflin having to pay him severance which infuriates Jan. Michael later regrets firing him and briefly considers finding him and getting closure, but reconsiders because he is &quot;too fat&quot;.

Tony has a cameo appearance in Michael's film ''Threat Level Midnight'' (in the episode &quot;[[Threat Level Midnight]]&quot;) as a pianist.

===Martin Nash===

'''Martin Nash''' ([[Wayne Wilderson]]) ''Supplier Relations''.  Martin Nash worked at the Stamford branch, and was one of the six employees transferred to Scranton in &quot;[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]]&quot;. According to a deleted scene from &quot;[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]]&quot;, Martin is 37 years old. Before working at Dunder Mifflin, he served time in [[prison]] after getting busted for [[insider trading]] (which Kevin says is strangely similar to what he does). However, since he was put in a minimum-security facility, Martin claims his time in prison was just really boring. When he was released, he was hired by Josh through a federal reformed convict employment program, which allows Dunder Mifflin to receive rebate checks. Michael made a bad first impression on Martin, when he told the African-American employee, &quot;I will show you where all the slaves work.&quot; He attempted to befriend Stanley, but failed. In &quot;[[The Convict]]&quot;, when Martin's past is revealed to the office, Michael overly stresses his trust in Martin to everyone, worried that people would see him as a racist for looking at him as an ex-convict. However, since Martin's tales from prison were generally positive, everyone actually envies his experience compared to their jobs, frustrating Michael. Martin is the second employee from the Stamford branch to leave because of Michael's management style, particularly after Michael makes his prison sentence the focal point of one of his seminars.

===Hannah Smoterich-Barr===

'''Hannah Smoterich-Barr''' (Ursula Burton) ''Accounting''.  Hannah worked at the Stamford branch, and was one of the six employees transferred to Scranton.  In &quot;[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]]&quot;, Hannah had unpleasant encounters with Ryan (who found it impossible to concentrate while she was using a breast milk pump) and Creed (who photographed her left breast and made it his computer's desktop wallpaper). She dresses her infant son in pink, claiming it's his &quot;favorite color,&quot; and is offended when anyone assumes the child is female. Hannah quits her job while Michael is on vacation at Sandals in Jamaica, after complaining of the hostile environment and claiming harassment, making her the third transferred employee from the Stamford branch to quit at Scranton. The character is very similar to Anne from the British series; both are women who have traditionally been presented as likable and friendly on TV shows (Hannah being a new mom, Anne being pregnant), but Hannah and Anne come across as snippy and unlikable. They also only appeared in a few episodes each, with Anne being told off for her nasty attitude, and Hannah quitting under hostile circumstances.

==Family/Loved ones of the main characters==
===Carol Stills===

'''Carol Stills''' ([[Nancy Carell]], wife of actor Steve Carell) is Michael's real estate agent. She has two children.  Michael entertained her kids at an ice-skating rink and she was Michael's date to the casino night.  In a deleted scene, it is revealed that after &quot;[[Casino Night]],&quot; Michael continued seeing her over the three months in between the second and third seasons.&lt;ref&gt;The Office: [http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/nbc_offdelscene_301_20060921.shtml#video Online Deleted Scenes]&lt;/ref&gt; Carol rejected Michael's marriage proposal after they had been on nine dates. In &quot;[[A Benihana Christmas]],&quot; after Michael gave her an inappropriate Christmas card of them (which was actually a family photo with Michael's face superimposed over Carol's ex-husband) she rejects his Christmas gift of two tickets to Jamaica and breaks up with him. In a deleted scene from that episode, Carol responds to Michael's question on the phone of what he did wrong with a very long list of complaints, and when Michael asks what he did right, she hangs up on him. In the seventh season, in the episode &quot;[[Sex Ed (The Office)|Sex Ed]]&quot;, Michael tells Carol he has herpes. She doesn't think it's herpes, and when Michael asks her if he romanticizes his relationships, she says that is definitely the case.

===Bob Vance===

'''Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Vance''', Vance Refrigeration, ([[Robert R. Shafer]]) is [[Phyllis Lapin-Vance]]'s husband and owner of Vance Refrigeration, a neighboring tenant in the [[Industrial park|office park]]. His professional name is &quot;Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration,&quot; evidenced by the officiator's dialogue in &quot;[[Phyllis's Wedding]]&quot;. He always introduces himself as &quot;Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration&quot;, most likely in an attempt to plug his business through the documentary. He is seen for the first time in &quot;[[Christmas Party (The Office)|Christmas Party]]&quot; and introduces himself to Kevin, Stanley, and Ryan in exactly that manner individually even though they were all standing next to each other. This leads Ryan to jokingly ask &quot;So...what line of work are you in Bob?&quot; It is implied that he is involved in illegal activities based on the facts that he was indicted by the grand jury and was seen having large amounts of cash readily available. On [[Valentine's Day (The Office)|Valentine's Day]], he sent a number of gifts to Phyllis at the office, each card signed with his tagline. He also supplied a mini-fridge as a &quot;[[Casino Night]]&quot; prize. In &quot;[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]]&quot;, he referred to Michael and Stanley as &quot;a pair of Marys&quot; after they ordered Phyllis to get to the back of the pretzel line, instead of letting the two kiss. He is a friendly and helpful neighbor to Dunder Mifflin, including offering to pump the employees' car tires back full of air after Michael had flattened them in an attempt to create office camaraderie in &quot;[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]].&quot; When word gets out that the Scranton branch is shutting down, Bob offers to buy the Dunder Mifflin warehouse, therefore allowing all the workers there to keep their jobs. In &quot;[[Ben Franklin (The Office)|Ben Franklin]]&quot; a bachelor party is held for him in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse before his wedding, but he refuses to be entertained by the stripper Michael hires. He eventually marries Phyllis in &quot;[[Phyllis's Wedding]],&quot; invites all her coworkers, and kicks Michael out after an embarrassing toast. In a deleted scene from &quot;[[Women's Appreciation]],&quot; he comes to the Dunder Mifflin office to comfort Phyllis after she is flashed, then takes her for a walk to calm her nerves.

He drives a [[Chevrolet Tahoe|GMC Yukon]] and is a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] (&quot;[[Fun Run]]&quot;). He is portrayed as an attentive and dedicated husband who is deeply in love with Phyllis. During the wedding episode, Phyllis mentions &quot;baby mama drama&quot; because Bob's other family from [[Ho Chi Minh City]] is coming in, but this has not been mentioned otherwise. In the 2nd episode of the Outburst webisodes, Oscar mentioned that Bob had been indicted by a grand jury. However, Phyllis states that all the charges were dropped after none of the witnesses showed up. In the episode &quot;[[Chair Model]]&quot; Bob and three other members of &quot;The [[Five Families]],&quot; W.B. Jones, Bill Cress and Paul Faust convene to resolve a dispute over the parking lot brought before them by Kevin and Andy.  In &quot;[[Goodbye, Toby]]&quot; Bob attends the going away party for Toby and in a deleted scene is shown giving Phyllis a large sum of cash so that her debut as head of the Party Planning Committee will be a success.  In &quot;[[Crime Aid]],&quot; Bob attends Michael's auction intent on winning the [[Bruce Springsteen]] tickets, but after a spirited bidding war with Dwight, ends up buying a hug from Phyllis for $1000. In &quot;[[Blood Drive (The Office)|Blood Drive]]&quot;, he refers to Michael, Dwight, and Andy each as &quot;that jackass&quot;, &quot;that other jackass&quot; and &quot;that new jackass&quot; respectively. In &quot;[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]&quot;, Phyllis threatens to &quot;get Bob involved&quot; to resolve her Santa role rivalry with Michael. Jim is confused about what Bob would do at first, but appears mildly alarmed when Phyllis recants, &quot;Never mind, I shouldn't have said that.&quot;

===Mose Schrute===

'''Mose Schrute''' (played by writer [[Michael Schur]]) is Dwight's cousin, best friend, and house mate at the Schrute family beet farm. In &quot;[[The Injury]],&quot; Michael refers to Mose as Dwight's &quot;weirdo cousin&quot; who is &quot;27 years old (and) never left the beet farm;&quot; later, he is shown in the warehouse. Mose wears an Amish-style beard and clothing, and speaks and behaves in a naive and childlike manner, sometimes appearing mentally unstable and very socially awkward. Dwight easily dominates him mentally. The source of his mental imbalance was somewhat explained in the episode &quot;St. Patrick's Day,&quot; when Dwight explains, &quot;I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet nurse was my mother . . . Turned out fine for me. But Mose, same story . . . different ending.&quot; Mose can be seen in a photo on Dwight's desk.

He made his first live appearance in &quot;[[Initiation (The Office)|Initiation]],&quot; where he takes part in Dwight's misguided attempts to haze Ryan in the beet farm. Ryan decides he has had enough when Dwight tells him he must now wrestle Mose. Ryan storms off and Mose tells Dwight that Ryan seems nice. As an apology he leaves some eggs, bacon and a whittling in the shape of the [[Venus of Willendorf]] with Dwight. In &quot;[[Money (The Office)|Money]],&quot; when Pam and Jim stay at the Schrute Farms bed and breakfast, Pam looks out the window at night to see Mose using an outhouse. Dwight later tells Jim that Mose has had nightmares ever since &quot;the storm&quot;.  Like Dwight, Mose is a skilled [[table tennis]] player; at the end of &quot;[[The Deposition (The Office)|The Deposition]],&quot; Dwight and Mose play a high-skilled match in the warehouse at Dunder Mifflin.  In &quot;[[Did I Stutter?]]&quot;, Dwight's organizational chart shows Mose (who does not even work at the office) is in charge of Heindl, Shirley, Vater, and Mutter, though it is unclear exactly who they are and are likely other members of the Schrute family, with Vater and Mutter being German words for father and mother. In the final episode of Season 4, &quot;[[Goodbye, Toby]]&quot;, Mose again makes an appearance when he helps Dwight in his further misguided attempts at &quot;hazing&quot; Toby's replacement, Holly, on whom Michael has a crush. He also appears in &quot;[[The Surplus]]&quot; when Dwight is giving Andy and Angela a tour of the beet farm.  He is seen playing catch with Andy, eventually throwing the ball at Andy's head when Andy looks away to talk to Dwight and Angela. He also made an appearance in the season 6 episode, &quot;[[Koi Pond (The Office) |Koi Pond]]&quot; in the cold open. In &quot;[[Counseling (The Office) |Counseling]]&quot;, he is painting the Daycare Center Dwight is planning to open in the building.

===Katy Moore===

'''Katy Moore''' ([[Amy Adams]]) is a handbag saleswoman who stops by the office in &quot;[[Hot Girl (The Office)|Hot Girl]].&quot; Dwight considers her to be the ideal woman. Both Michael and Dwight make a move on her; Michael by flirting aggressively, and Dwight by showing interest in purchasing a handbag. However, she ignores their advances and later dates Jim for a few months. After Pam and Roy decide to set a date for their wedding, a devastated Jim breaks up with Katy on the &quot;[[Booze Cruise (The Office)|Booze Cruise]]&quot; episode when he ungraciously admits that the two will never be as deeply in love with each other as Roy and Pam seem to be when seeing them together. Along with Toby, Katy is a graduate of [[Bishop O'Hara High School]], where she was a [[cheerleader]]. She bonds with Pam's then-fiance Roy on the Booze Cruise when they realize they went to rival high schools and she cheered at games against the football team Roy played on.

===Thomas &amp; Peter Halpert===

'''Thomas Halpert ''' (Blake Robbins) and '''Peter Halpert''' (Tug Coker) are Jim's obnoxious older brothers who have lunch with Jim and Pam in &quot;[[Employee Transfer]]&quot;. Pam decides to meet with them before lunch to play a prank on Jim. Tom and Pete decide to make fun of her interest in art in front of Jim as a prank, as opposed to Pam's idea of losing her engagement ring. During lunch, they make numerous insults towards Pam's art career in front of Jim, who comes to her defense. After the argument escalates, Tom and Pete reveal it to be a prank, with Pam awkwardly confirming this. Afterward, Jim receives a text message from them welcoming Pam into the family, and Pam suggests they should &quot;prank&quot; Tom about being bald over Thanksgiving. They both attend Jim and Pam's wedding, and are shown to be frequent pranksters like Jim. They organize with Michael and Dwight to have everyone dance down the aisle in the style of the viral video, [[JK Wedding Entrance Dance]].

===Helene===

'''Helene''' ([[Shannon Cochran]] in Season 2, [[Linda Purl]] in Seasons 6 and 7) is Pam's mother. Pam gets excited when Helene comes to visit her at work in &quot;[[Sexual Harassment (The Office)|Sexual Harassment]]&quot;. Helene appears to get along with Roy very well, but is eager to meet Jim after Pam talked about him in private. In &quot;[[Stress Relief]]&quot;, it is revealed Helene and Pam's father William are going through a rough patch in their marriage and it eventually ends in divorce after Jim confesses to William his deep and abiding love for Pam, a feeling that William never felt with Helene. In &quot;[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]&quot;, Helene comes to the wedding and is disturbed when William comes with a new girlfriend who is half his age. Helene takes pity on Michael when he talks about his past relationships and invites him into her room after the wedding. In &quot;[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]&quot;, Michael confirms to Jim and Pam that he is dating Helene, much to Pam's horror and anger. Pam maintains a hostile attitude toward their relationship until they go out to lunch for Helene's birthday in &quot;[[Double Date (The Office)|Double Date]]&quot;, where she sees that Helene is happy with Michael. However, when Michael learns that Helene is turning 58 and has already done many things Michael hasn't done yet, he breaks up with her in front of Jim and Pam. In &quot;[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]&quot;, Helene comes to visit Pam at the hospital after she gives birth and has an awkward moment with Michael.

He later visits her at a playground in &quot;[[Sex Ed (The Office)|Sex Ed]]&quot;, where he attempts to discuss their past relationship and see if what they had was genuine. She bitterly points out his skewed sense of memory, to which Michael responds by insulting her and then walking off. Helene appears in three more episodes after that: in &quot;[[Christening (The Office)|Christening]], where she is seen in the background attending Cece's christening; in &quot;[[The Search (The Office)|The Search]]&quot;, with a voice-only part where she calls Jim on his cell phone to tell him that she unintentionally locked Cece in her car (with the keys inside it); and in &quot;[[Threat Level Midnight]]&quot;, where she is briefly seen in Michael's titular homemade film as a slutty nurse (to Pam's obvious discomfort).

[[Shannon Cochran]] portrayed Helene in &quot;[[Sexual Harassment (The Office)|Sexual Harassment]]&quot;, but she was unavailable to return in Season 6 because she was committed to a 12-month stage production tour of ''[[August: Osage County]]'', so the producers replaced her with [[Linda Purl]].

===Cecelia &quot;CeCe&quot; Halpert===

'''Cecelia Marie Halpert''' is Pam and Jim Halpert's daughter, who was born on March 4, 2010 in the episode &quot;[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]&quot;. Cecelia was born after 19 hours of labor at 8:31 pm, weighing 7 pounds and 2 ounces. After birth, Pam has trouble getting Cecelia to breast feed and at one point, Pam accidentally feeds the wrong baby. Cecelia finally breast feeds as Jim and Pam are leaving the hospital. In the episode &quot;[[St. Patrick's Day (The Office)|St. Patrick's Day]]&quot;, a photo of Cecelia is seen on Jim's computer monitor while he is at work. Later in the episode, Jim becomes worried that he isn't spending enough time with Cecelia and tells Jo, the CEO of Sabre, that he has an afternoon meeting in order to leave early. In the episode &quot;[[Andy's Play]]&quot;, Erin babysits Cecelia while Jim and Pam, along with the rest of the office staff, attend a community theater production in which Andy performs. To the Halperts' dismay, Erin is caught bringing Cecelia to the theater so she wouldn't miss Andy's performance. Jim and Pam take Cecelia home. Her parents call her &quot;Cece&quot;. In the season 7 episode &quot;[[Training Day (The Office)|Training Day]]&quot;, Jim and Pam tell the new boss in-training, Deangelo Vickers, about Cece when he mentions to have four kids. Jim and Pam continue to try and impress Deangelo by telling more and more about their baby when he eventually tells them that he does not care about Cece. Jim and Pam decide to bring Cece into work, which later proves to be of no benefit.

===Isabel Poreba===

'''Isabel''' (Kelen Coleman) is a dental hygienist and Pam's best friend from college who attends Jim and Pam's wedding as a bridesmaid. The night before the wedding, she takes a liking to Dwight when he talks about his farm and the two end up having a one night stand. She soon develops a crush on Dwight, which shocks Pam. However, Dwight blows her off on the day of the wedding when she tries to talk to him. In &quot;[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]&quot;, Isabel visits Pam and Jim in the hospital after Pam gives birth where they find that Pam had breastfed the wrong baby. Isabel leaves to drop some food at Jim and Pam's house where Dwight is fixing their kitchen. Dwight is surprised and asks if he could come in for a cleaning. In &quot;[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]&quot;, she and Dwight start to get to know each other better as the two share similar interests (Isabel's older brothers are police officers or are serving in the [[USMC]]).  Dwight decides Isabel would be better suited to have his children than Angela, with whom he had entered into a contract to have a child. When Dwight calls off the contract, Angela confronts Dwight and Isabel in the parking lot. Isabel smacks Angela on the head and scares her off. Dwight calls her an &quot;impressive specimen&quot; and passionately kisses her. It is presumed their relationship did not last as she has not been seen or mentioned since &quot;[[Happy Hour (The Office)|Happy Hour]]&quot;.

===Robert Lipton&lt;!-- Please do not add &quot;Senator&quot; to the title, per [[WP:NCP#Titles and styles]]--&gt;===

'''Robert Lipton''' ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]) is first introduced in &quot;[[WUPHF.com]]&quot; when sitting down next to Angela at Dwight's hay place. When Angela makes a joke, Robert starts to laugh and in the end we see them talking to each other and showing that they both enjoy each other.  In &quot;[[Classy Christmas]]&quot;, Angela announces that he is a senator, to which Oscar clarifies &quot;state senator.&quot; Angela brings Robert over to their Christmas party introducing him as her boyfriend. In a talking head interview, Oscar states that Robert is most certainly gay and then later spots Robert looking at Ryan's backside, which solidified his suspicions. Ryan comes to the same realization as Oscar when he notices that Robert had been viewing Ryan's [[Facebook]] photos in the early hours of the morning. It has been strongly implied in various episodes that he only is with Angela to help his public image. In &quot;[[Search Committee]]&quot;, he takes her out and proposes to her offscreen. They then both start planning a wedding.

At the beginning of the eighth season, it is revealed that he married Angela over the summer and that she is pregnant with his child.

===Jada Philbin===

'''Jada Philbin''' (Taylar Hollomon) is Darryl's daughter, whom he makes several references to, throughout earlier seasons with Darryl referring to her as the most important person in his life. Jada is officially introduced in &quot;[[Classy Christmas]]&quot; with Darryl trying to make the office Christmas party fun for her, which initially becomes disastrous. Jada is a fan of ''[[iCarly]]'' and wants to meet Santa Claus to tell him what she wants for Christmas. With Darryl's help, the two buy up all the snack chip bags in the vending machine and pass them out as gifts to the rest of the staff. Although Michael accidentally ruins Santa Claus by providing his own take on it, he later makes amends and dresses as the traditional Santa and has Jada tell him her list. She later appears in &quot;[[Search Committee]]&quot; when Darryl tries to make an impression on Jim by having Jada hug him in front of the staff, as a bid to get Darryl hired as the regional branch manager.

===Justine===

'''Justine''' (Erica Vittina Phillips) is Darryl's ex-wife, whom he had been on bad terms with, even speaking crudely and poorly of her to Kevin, who repeats his remarks verbatim at a staff meeting. The two are parents to Jada. Their relationship seems to be initially terrible, with the two seemingly at odds with each other in &quot;[[Classy Christmas]]&quot; when Darryl blames Justine for not letting his daughter spend time with him on Christmas. However, the two seem to reconnect in &quot;[[The Incentive]]&quot; and begin dating, bringing joy to Darryl. But the relationship is short-lived when during &quot;[[Lotto (The Office)|Lotto]]&quot;, Justine calls Darryl to personally congratulate a former warehouse employee working under Darryl. It's indicated that Justine was dating him before after having his number in her old cell phone, and asks Darryl for his number again. An offended Darryl hangs up on her.

==Other characters==
===Vikram===
'''Vikram''' ([[Ranjit Chowdhry]]) is a sales representative who worked with Michael at the Lipophedrine diet pill telemarketing company. Vikram is [[India|Indian]] and claims he was a surgeon back in India. He is a wise and diligent worker, seen winning the sales bonus at the telemarketing company and concerned about losing prime selling hours during his brief membership in the Michael Scott Paper Company. He is first seen in the episode &quot;[[Money (The Office)|Money]]&quot; when Michael tries telemarketing at night to earn extra income. He is friendly towards Michael, sharing his dinners and giving him good advice. Michael later recruits Vikram to work in his own company in &quot;[[Dream Team (The Office)|Dream Team]]&quot; only to have Vikram give up on the idea and return to his job after finding out how ill-conceived Michael's plan was.

===Hank Tate===

'''Hank Tate''' ([[Hugh Dane]]) is head of security at the [[Industrial park|office park]]. Hank is quiet and stern, and unenthusiastically carries out his duties from his desk at the front door of the office park. Since Dwight purchased the building, Hank's duties have expanded to include running the ramshackle coffee counter that was installed in the lobby. He is first seen sitting at his desk as Michael exits the building at the end of &quot;[[Halloween (The Office)|Halloween]].&quot; In &quot;[[Drug Testing (The Office)|Drug Testing]]&quot;, Michael &quot;pulls a few strings&quot; and makes Dwight official Security Supervisor for the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. Michael has Hank declare Dwight an &quot;honorary volunteer corporal in charge of assisting all activity security&quot;. An annoyed Hank says &quot;I don't think so&quot; to Dwight's requests to both have a gun or bring his [[bÅ|bo staff]]. In &quot;[[Night Out]]&quot;, Jim forgets to let Hank know that the office workers would be working late and Hank locks them and their cars behind the parking lot's gate. Unsure of Hank's name, Jim calls Hank's number on Toby's cell phone to ask him to come and unlock the gate. The other office workers realize that they never tipped Hank last Christmas (Jim forgot to collect it) and Hank will probably not come help them. Later, the Scranton Business Park cleaning crew arrives to unlock the gate, and Hank arrives some time later to find everyone had left without notifying him. When [[Toby Flenderson]] leaves the office at the end of Season 4, Michael brings Hank to escort him out, to Toby's annoyance. He plays the guitar in &quot;[[Crime Aid]]&quot; while selling CD's to help repay for the robbery; he uses the stage name &quot;Hank Doyle&quot;. Hank is also called upon by Michael to decide what the Dunder Mifflin staff should do with extra money in &quot;[[The Surplus]]&quot; but is abruptly dismissed after not being able to make a quick decision. During &quot;[[Two Weeks (The Office)|Two Weeks]]&quot;, Hank is ordered by [[Charles Miner (The Office)|Charles Miner]] to physically remove Michael from the office, which becomes slightly awkward for Hank. He also owns a 1/8 share of a rental property in Pittson.

===Mr. Brown===

'''Mr. Brown''' (played by producer/writer [[Larry Wilmore]]) is a consultant sent by corporate to mediate a healthy discussion of diversity issues with the office staff  after receiving complaints about Michael's inflammatory impersonation of a Chris Rock speech, in the episode &quot;[[Diversity Day]]&quot;. However, Michael's juvenile humor and off-the-wall antics take a toll on Mr. Brown. He tells Michael that corporate sent him to specifically give Michael the diversity training but he made copies of the form that proves Michael underwent training, for the rest of the staff so to not embarrass Michael in front of everyone. Michael signs the form as &quot;[[Daffy Duck]]&quot;. Mr. Brown is later seen in &quot;[[Gay Witch Hunt]],&quot; giving the Stamford branch the same diversity training he gave the Scranton Branch; he alludes to incidents at the Scranton branch as the reason he is in Stamford.

===Billy Merchant===

'''Billy Merchant''' (Marcus A. York), property manager of the [[Industrial park|office park]] in which Dunder Mifflin's Scranton office is located. Billy has used a wheelchair since the age of four. He is seen calm and professional, and seems to disregard Micheal's immaturity and rudeness while still extending generosity to him. He is invited to the office in &quot;[[The Injury]]&quot; to speak about being disabled after Michael burns his foot on a [[George Foreman Grill]], is offended by Michael's stupid and thoughtless remarks and quietly leaves, but also brings to Jim's attention the serious concussion Dwight has suffered from crashing his car. His voice is also heard on the office park's PA system announcing the free pretzels. Billy attends &quot;[[Casino Night]]&quot; with his girlfriend, a [[Chili's]] waitress, who Michael mistakes for his nurse. He participates in the &quot;[[Fun Run]]&quot; and later assists Michael in setting up an office (which is essentially a janitorial closet) for his new paper company in &quot;[[Dream Team (The Office)|Dream Team]].&quot; Billy shares his last name with original series co-creator [[Stephen Merchant]].

===Jessica===

'''Jessica''' (Alyssa Preston) is the receptionist at Vance Refrigeration. Curiously, she bears a resemblance to Phyllis, which may be the reason Phyllis suspects an affair between Bob and Jessica.

===Brenda Matlowe===
'''Brenda''' evaluates Michael Scott's &quot;Leadership Training Excercise&quot; in [[Booze Cruise]]. In [[The Carpet]], Jim asks her out on a date via voicemail. In a deleted scene from [[Drug_Testing_(The_Office)|Drug Testing]], she calls Jim back. However, as he is [[Jinx (children's game)|jinxed]] by Pam until he buys her a soda, he cannot answer. In a talking head interview, he writes on a piece of paper, &quot;She'll call back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dunderpedia: The Office Wiki|url=http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Brenda_Matlowe|work=Article on Brenda Matlowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth the Stripper===

'''Elizabeth''' (Jackie Debatin) is hired by Dwight to strip at Bob Vance's bachelor party in &quot;[[Ben Franklin (The Office)|Ben Franklin]]&quot;. Bob Vance refuses to let Elizabeth lap dance on him, and Michael starts to let Elizabeth do it for him, to the tune of [[Bad Company]]'s &quot;[[Feel Like Makin' Love (Bad Company song)|Feel Like Makin' Love]],&quot; before deciding that he would be cheating on Jan and awkwardly snubs her. Dwight makes Elizabeth answer phones after the failed bachelor party because the company paid for three hours of work from her, where she is placed in Oscar's vacant desk which disturbs Angela and enthralls Kevin. When Michael feels bad about betraying Jan, he asks Elizabeth (referring to her as &quot;stripper&quot;) whether or not he should tell her. She replies, &quot;Secret secrets are no fun, secret secrets hurt someone.&quot; When the office needs a medical person to receive a check for the proceeds of their fund-raiser, Elizabeth is hired to come back dressed as a &quot;nurse&quot; and receive Michael's check to help cure rabies during the Season 4 opener, &quot;[[Fun Run]].&quot; She is later seen flirting with Darryl.

He makes another appearance in &quot;[[Customer Survey]]&quot;, where he tries to convince Pam to not return to Scranton, but instead stay in New York to pursue her career in art. 

===Rolf===

'''Rolf''' ([[James Urbaniak]]) is introduced in the season 5 finale &quot;[[Company Picnic]]&quot; as Dwight's new best friend. Dwight claims to have met him in a shoe store after having heard him &quot;asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.&quot; Rolf and Dwight appear to share very similar personalities and interests. However, Rolf is much more outspoken than Dwight and at one point during the volleyball game has to be quieted by Dwight after telling [[David Wallace (The Office)|David Wallace]] and Charles Miner from corporate that &quot;You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!&quot; Dwight is also not happy when Rolf insults Angela for the second time during the volleyball game by calling her a whore. Rolf is told by Dwight to &quot;knock it off&quot; and obliges. Rolf is also seen again in the episode &quot;[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]&quot;. He is seen helping Dwight remodel Jim and Pam's kitchen.

===Nate===

'''Nate''' ([[Mark Proksch]]) is Dwight's handyman. He is introduced in the opening to the season 7 episode &quot;[[Sex Ed (The Office)|Sex Ed]]&quot;, when Dwight hires him from a group of undocumented-alien day laborers and has him remove a hornet's nest from the Dunder Mifflin parking lot (which he attempts to do using a blowtorch and then a baseball bat, leading to him getting severely stung). In &quot;[[WUPHF.com]]&quot;, he helps Dwight run the Hay Place attraction in the parking lot. In &quot;[[China (The Office)|China]]&quot;, he helps Dwight turn the office toilet paper to half-ply as a cost-cutting measure, and goes with him to check out the &quot;new building&quot; that Pam claims to have found. In the opening of &quot;[[Classy Christmas]]&quot;, he takes the staff Christmas photo. Nate re-appears in the season 8 episode &quot;[[Lotto]]&quot;, where he applies for a warehouse position after the rest of the warehouse staff quits. It is revealed in this episode that he has a hearing problem. He is now working in the warehouse, as seen in &quot;Doomsday&quot;.

===The Scranton Strangler===

'''The Scranton Strangler''' is a [[serial killer]] who strangles his victims. Although never seen on-screen, he has been referred to several times, starting with the [[The Office (U.S. season 6)|sixth season]] episode &quot;[[The Delivery (The Office)|The Delivery]]&quot;, where a newspaper heading reads &quot;The Scranton Strangler Strikes Again&quot;. In a deleted scene of &quot;[[Happy Hour (The Office) |Happy Hour]]&quot;, Michael tries to impersonate the Scranton Strangler to impress Pam's friend. In &quot;[[Body Language (The Office)|Body Language]]&quot;, Dwight talks about how the best possible fight move to fight the Scranton Strangler to Kelly. In the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] episode &quot;[[Costume Contest]]&quot;, Dwight dressed like the Scranton Strangler for [[Halloween]]. In &quot;[[Viewing Party]]&quot;, the officemates are watching a live broadcast of a police chase of the Scranton Strangler, and they get excited when the cars pass by on the road in front of the office building. In &quot;[[Classy Christmas]]&quot;, Toby is chosen as a juror for the Scranton Strangler's trial, which forces him to take a leave of absence and results in Holly Flax being appointed his temporary replacement. In &quot;[[Michael's Last Dundies]]&quot;, Toby states that the man he helped convict as the Scranton Strangler may be innocent, and that he has been sentenced to the [[death penalty]].

===Nellie Bertram===
'''Nellie Bertram''' ([[Catherine Tate]]) is a British woman who appears in the season 7 finale &quot;[[Search Committee]]&quot; as an interviewee for the manager position at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. In her interview, she tells the committee that if she's hired she would take down all the cubicle walls and that the staff would have no titles; everyone would have the same job (including her), and the staff would be known for their accomplishments. However, when Jim points out that there might be some rising conflicts because of that and asks her how she would handle the conflicts, she reverses her whole idea. She suggests putting up ''more'' cubicle walls, and making everyone somebody's boss, and that that person could fire the person below them, and at least once a month the lowest performing person would get axed. When asked by Gabe how she would compare an [[Accountant]] to [[Human Resources]], she says she would simply &quot;split the difference&quot;. Later, she again backtracks and posits the creation of a &quot;zen&quot; office.  The desks would be replaced with mats, and a Thai masseuse would administer fifteen minute foot massages. 

Later, in a talking-head interview, she tells the camera that she will get the job because she is an old friend of, and recommended for the job by, Jo Bennett. She even tells the camera that she thinks she is Jo's best friend (although, Jo is not her best friend).

It was announced that Catherine Tate will be returning to ''The Office'' to reprise her role as Nellie, who will be hired as the &quot;misguided special projects manager&quot;. It was noted that she will strike up a &quot;far from professional&quot; relationship with Robert California.&lt;ref&gt;http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/10/21/the-office-casting-catherine-tate-to-reprise-role-as-nellie/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fred Henry===
'''Fred Henry''' ([[Will Arnett]]) is an ex-Navy meteorologist who is interviewed for the Scranton branch manager's job in the season 7 finale &quot;Search Committee&quot;. While being interviewed, he claims that he has a three-step plan to double profits at the branch. However, it becomes clear he is merely bluffing, as when asked by the committee what the plan is, he tells them he won't give them the plan unless they give him the job. When Jim suggests that he give them ''part'' of the plan, Fred gives them &quot;part 3 of part 2&quot;, which is color-coding sent documents, before verbally trademarking his idea. Later, in a talking-head interview, he tells the camera he is sure he will be the new boss, but then realizes he doesn't know the name of the company he was interviewing at. He then turns around and looks at the directory, and then continues, believing '''Vance Refrigeration''' is the name.

===Merv Bronte===
'''Merv Bronte''' ([[Ray Romano]]) is a sad and somewhat depressive man who appears in the season 7 finale &quot;Search Committee&quot; as an interviewee for the Scranton branch manager's job. When in the lobby, Robert California tries to sabotage him by telling him the people in the office are like prisoners in a dying industry, leaving Merv to question himself if he even wants the job. While riding in the elevator he has a talking-head interview in which he confides to the cameraman &quot;If I get this job offer, I know I'm gonna take it. And if I take it I know I'm never going to quit, and then 25 years are going to go by and...I'm gonna die here&quot;. During his job interview, he asks if the company pays for relocation, as he wants to live further away from the company so there's no chance he'd run into any of the staff outside of the office. When Jim asks him why he is leaving his current job, Merv tells him it was because all the people at his job were &quot;jerkwads and jerk-offs&quot;, and proceeds to eat his lunch during the interview. Confused, Toby asks if they had inadvertently done something to upset him. In another talking-head interview after his job interview, he expresses regret over believing &quot;that weirdo in the lobby&quot; (Robert), saying that the people in the office are the nicest people that he has ever met.

Later, in his final talking-head interview, he says he feels like he sabotaged himself because he thinks he's afraid of being happy, and then reveals that he was supposed to start another job on the very day he was interviewed.

===Finger Lakes guy===
[[File:Jim Carrey on the Office.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Jim Carrey as the unnamed man who was dubbed &quot;Finger Lakes guy&quot;.]]
'''Finger Lakes guy''' ([[Jim Carrey]]) is a character that appears in the season 7 finale &quot;Search Committee&quot; as an interviewee for the Scranton branch manager's job.  According to Jim, he was one of the top candidates for the job along with Darryl and Andy. His real name is never revealed, although he is nicknamed &quot;Finger Lakes guy&quot; because he mentions during his (unseen) interview that if he gets the job he'll need to have his first two weeks off to travel to the [[Finger Lakes]], because (as he reveals to the documentary crew) he snuck away from his family while vacationing in the Finger Lakes in order to interview for the job.

His character presence creates a clash between universes, as his portrayer Jim Carrey has been mentioned by the characters before. Also, it should be noted that in ''The Office'' cold open of the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] episode &quot;[[Back from Vacation]]&quot;, Phyllis joked that Carrey had entered the conference room. In &quot;Search Committee&quot;, although it is not seen, Carrey ''did'' enter the conference room (to do his interview), he just did not enter as ''himself''.

===David Brent===
'''[[David Brent]]''' ([[Ricky Gervais]]) is a former office manager for Wernham Hogg paper in [[Slough, England]] (as seen in [[The Office (UK TV series)|the UK ''The Office'' series]]). He appears at the beginning of the season 7 episode &quot;[[The Seminar]]&quot;, where he meets Michael Scott outside an elevator, trades racist jokes with him, and asks whether there are any openings at Dunder Mifflin. In the season 7 finale &quot;Search Committee&quot; he appears as an interviewee (via videoconferencing from [[England]]) for the Scranton branch manager's job.
