'''Hossam el-Hamalawy''' ({{lang-ar|Ø­Ø³Ø§Ù Ø§ÙØ­ÙÙØ§ÙÙ}}, {{IPA-arz|Ä§oËsÃ¦Ëm elÄ§Ã¦mÃ¦ËlÃ¦Ëwi|IPA}}; AKA [[Arabic chat alphabet|3arabawy]] {{lang|arz|Ø¹Ø±Ø¨Ø§ÙÙ}}, {{IPA-arz|ÊÉÉ¾Ë¤ÉËbÉËwi|}}; born 14 July 1977) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[journalist]], [[blog|blogger]], [[photographer]] and [[socialist]] activist. He is a member of the [[Revolutionary Socialists (Egypt)|Revolutionary Socialists]], the [[Center for Socialist Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/hamalawy080211.html | title=Revolution 2.0: Interview with Hossam el-Hamalawy | publisher=MRZine | date=8 February 2011 | accessdate=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the [[Workers Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/5/2/headlines/egypt_celebrates_international_workers_day_for_first_time_since_1952 | title=Egypt Celebrates International Workersâ Day for First Time Since 1952 | publisher=Democracy Now | date=2 May 2011 | accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life and career ==

He is a graduate of the [[American University in Cairo]] where he was detained and [[torture]]d by Egyptian ruler [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s [[State Security Investigations Service]] (SSI) in 2000, allegedly with the institution's complicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9286/Egypt/Politics-/Students-of-Egypts-American-University-question-it.aspx | title=Students of Egypt's American University question its ties to Mubarak's regime | publisher=Ahram Online | date=7 April 2011 | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as &quot;influential&quot; according to a 2007 US intelligence report obtained by [[Wikileaks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cablesearch.org/cable/view.php?id=07CAIRO1283&lt;/ref&gt;

Hossam and television host [[Reem Maged]] were given a summons on Monday the 30th of May, 2011 to appear before military prosecution after Maged brought Hamalawy on her show where he criticized the role of military police, holding the head of the military police responsible for torturing activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/13270/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-journalists-to-be-questioned-tomorrow-by-.aspx |title=Egyptian journalists to be questioned tomorrow by military for denouncing the torture of activists - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

After the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egyptian revolution]] of 2011, el-Hamalawy was among many protesters who stormed and seized offices of the SSI in [[Nasr City]] and was able to visit the cell where he had been imprisoned, later writing on his [[Twitter]] feed that he could not stop crying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/middleeast/10cairo.html?hp | title=Egyptians Get View of Extent of Spying | publisher=The New York Times | date=9 March 2011 | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Entered the small compound where I was locked. Man, I can't believe it still... Many are literally crying. We can't find the interrogation rooms. This is a citadel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/spotlight/anger-in-egypt/2011/03/2011368410372200.html | title=A first step towards prosecutions? | publisher=Al Jazeera | date=6 March 2011 | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since storming the SSI offices, el-Hamalawy has become the main force behind a &quot;naming and shaming&quot; website &quot;(''Piggipedia'')&quot; targeting former SSI personnel who were involved in the alleged torture of dissidents. Their names are linked to allegations and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/egypts-activists-turn-tables-on-tormentors/2011/04/30/AFEdLV1G_print.html | title=Egyptâs activists turn tables on tormentors | publisher=The Washington Post | date=13 May 2011 | accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Policies and views == 

El-Hamalawy has criticized the newly appointed [[Ministry of Justice (Egypt)|Justice Minister]] [[Mohamed Abdel Aziz el-Gendy]], for his ties to the former [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]], in relation to the freezing of assets of the ousted dictator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypt-says-us-dragging-its-feet-on-freezing-mubarak-assets/2011/03/28/AFdCA35B_story.html | title=Egypt says U.S. dragging its feet on freezing Mubarak assets | publisher=The Washington Post | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; El-Hamalawy claims that the overthrow of Mubarak had been stirring as early as 2002, when pro-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] riots around [[Cairo University]] fought [[Central Security Forces]] chanting: &quot;Hosni Mubarak is just like [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/02/egypt-revolution-mubarak-wall-of-fear | title=Egypt's revolution has been 10 years in the making | publisher=Guardian | date=2 March 2011 | accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El-Hamalawy holds the view that Egyptian [[communism]] is trapped in a &quot;[[Stalinism|Stalinist]]&quot; legacy, an inverse of [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s theory of [[permanent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arabist.net/blog/2006/6/7/youssef-darwish-passes-away.html | title=Youssef Darwish passes away | publisher=The Arabist | date=7 June 2006 | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
