The '''Secretary of State for Defence''', popularly known as the '''Defence Secretary''', is the senior [[Government of the United Kingdom]] [[Political minister|minister]] in charge of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], chairing the [[Defence Council of the United Kingdom|Defence Council]].  It is a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] position.  The position was created in 1964 as successor to the posts of '''Minister for Coordination of Defence''' (1936â1940) and '''Minister of Defence''' (1940â1964).

==Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (1936â1940)==
The position of '''[[Minister for Co-ordination of Defence]]''' was a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]]-level position established in 1936 to oversee and co-ordinate the rearmament of Britain's defences.

The position was established by Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] in response to criticism that Britain's armed forces were understrength compared to those of [[Nazi Germany]].  This campaign had been led by [[Winston Churchill]] and many expected him to be appointed as the new minister, though nearly every other senior figure in the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] was also speculated upon by politicians and commentators.  Despite this, Baldwin's choice of the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Thomas Inskip, 1st Viscount Caldecote|Sir Thomas Inskip]] provoked widespread astonishment. A famous remark was &quot;This is the most cynical appointment since [[Caligula]] made his horse a consul&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;This quote has been made on many occasions and the original source is unclear. The highly influential [[polemic]] [[Guilty Men]] (whose relevant chapter is entitled &quot;Caligula's Horse&quot;) attributes it to a &quot;great statesman&quot; (page 74), whom some have surmised was Churchill. However Stewart, Graham ''Burying Caesar: Churchill, Chamberlain and the Battle for the Tory Party'' (London; Phoenix, 1999) (ISBN 0-7538-1060-3), page 487 attributes the originator of the quote to Churchill's non-politician friend [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Professor Frederick Lindemann]].&lt;/ref&gt; The appointment is now regarded as a sign of caution by Baldwin who did not wish to appoint someone like Churchill who would have been interpreted by foreign powers as a sign of the United Kingdom preparing for war, as well as a desire to avoid taking onboard a controversial and radical minister.

In 1939 Inskip was succeeded by [[First Sea Lord]] [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Lord Chatfield]].  When the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out, the new Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] formed a small [[War Cabinet]] and it was expected that Chatfield would serve as a spokesperson for the three service ministers, the [[Secretary of State for War]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] and the [[Secretary of State for Air]]; however political considerations resulted in all three posts being included in the Cabinet and Chatfield's role proved increasingly redundant. In April 1940 the position was formally wound up and the functions transferred to other Ministers.

==Ministers of Defence (1940â1964)==
The post of '''[[Minister of Defence]]''' was responsible for co-ordination of defence and security from its creation in 1940 until its abolition in 1964. The post was a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] level post and generally ranked above the three service ministers, some of whom, however, continued to also serve in Cabinet.

On his appointment as Prime Minister in May 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] created for himself the new post of Minister of Defence. The post was created in response to previous criticism that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of [[World War II]].  In 1946, the post became the only cabinet level post representing the military, with the three service ministers - the [[Secretary of State for War]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], and the [[Secretary of State for Air]], now formally subordinated to the Minister of Defence.
