==History==
Box.net was founded in 2005 as a college business project by Aaron Levie (CEO) and Dylan Smith (CFO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2010/august/207510.html I'm an Entrepreneur; Get Me Out of Here! | Entrepreneur.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated in April of that year. Originally based in [[Mercer Island, Washington]], Box.net moved to [[Palo Alto]], [[California]], in the summer of 2006.

Box received [[angel capital]] from [[Mark Cuban]] in 2005, then raised a [[Series A]] round of $1.5 million from [[Draper Fisher Jurvetson]] in 2006. In late 2007, it raised a Series B round of $6 million and then another $7.1 million in 2009 from [[U.S. Venture Partners]] and Draper Fisher Jurvetson, bringing total investment to $14.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[[Box.net#cite note-0]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2009, Box.net acquired Increo Solutions, the developer of collaborative online document and media viewing tools Backboard and Embedit.in. As a result of this acquisition, Box.net launched two new features in January 2010: an integrated content viewer and the ability to embed these files anywhere on the web.&lt;ref&gt;[[Box.net#cite note-3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the company closed a $48 million funding round led by [[Meritech Capital Partners]], [[Andreessen Horowitz]], and Emergence Capital Partners.  The $48 million included $10 million in debt financing from Hercules Technology Growth Capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-24/box-net-gets-48-million-equity-debt-investment-from-andreessen-meritech.html Box.net Receives $48 Million Investment, Led by Meritech â Bloomberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;There was no capital limit and we could've raised more,&quot; said Mr. Levie.&lt;ref&gt;Pui-Wing Tam, &amp; Amir Efrati.

Retrieved March 24, 2011, from ABI/INFORM Global. (Document ID: 2287815741).&lt;/ref&gt;

==API==
In December 2007 the company launched its OpenBox platform, which connects content from Box.net with other web-based applications and services.  Included in the launch were online services [[EchoSign]], [[Autodesk]], [[Zoho]], [[ThinkFree]], [[Scribd]], [[Picnik]], [[Zazzle]], [[Twitter]] and [[Myxer]]. Since then, new OpenBox services have been added from Salesforce, Google Apps, FedEx, Twitter, WatchDox, MindMeister, Fuze Meeting and others. There are now more than 60 OpenBox services available.

With the launch of its OpenBox platform, Box.net added the ability for developers to create services that will interact with a user's files on Box.net. The [[Application Programming Interface|API]] is implemented over conventional [[XML]]; documentation is available at the OpenBox Developer Documentation Site.

Box.net also launched  its OpenBox Mobile developer program in September 2009, enabling developers to make mobile content accessible to other apps and services. iPhone application developers that utilize OpenBox Mobile include iThoughts, iBlueSky, JotNot, iRec, Pixelpipe, Smart Recorder, Readdle and Kinoma.

==Products==
The core of the service is based around sharing, collaborating, and working with files that are uploaded to Box.net. Box.net offers 3 account types: Enterprise, Business and Personal.&lt;ref&gt;www.box.net/pricing&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of account, Box.net has a number of features such as unlimited storage, custom branding, administrative controls and 3rd party integrations with applications like Google apps, Gmail, NetSuite and Salesforce. The service also has a variety of social features such as discussions, groups and an update feed.
