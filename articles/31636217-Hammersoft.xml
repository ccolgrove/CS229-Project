The '''wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York''' (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]), '''and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]]''' took place on 26 April 1923 at [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Courtship and proposals==
Prince Albert, Duke of York â &quot;Bertie&quot; to the family â was the second son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being &quot;afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ezard|first=John|title=A life of legend, duty and devotion |newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2002|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he declared he would marry no one else, his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], visited [[Glamis Castle|Glamis]] to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was &quot;the one girl who could make Bertie happy&quot;, but nevertheless refused to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Airlie |first=Mabell |authorlink=Mabell Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie |title=Thatched with Gold |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |year=1962 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by [[James Stuart, 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn|James Stuart]], Albert's [[equerry]], until he left the prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 133â135&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert's sister, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary]], to [[Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood|Viscount Lascelles]].&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, pp. 135â136&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Longford |first=Elizabeth |authorlink=Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford |title=The Queen Mother |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1981 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, legally a [[Commoners in the United Kingdom|commoner]] though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp. 57â58; Shawcross, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedding==
Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]].

==Bride's dress==
Elizabeth's wedding dress featured embroidered with pearls and a silver thread, which was made from deep ivory chiffon moire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BousfieldToffoli2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bousfield|first1=Arthur|last2=Toffoli|first2=Garry|title=Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, 1900-2002: The Queen Mother and Her Century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t6PQ84ovPcMC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=26 September 2002|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=9781550023916|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to match the traditional [[Flanders lace]] provided for the train by Queen Mary.&lt;ref name=&quot;BousfieldToffoli2002&quot;/&gt; Elizabeth's dress, which was in the fashion of the early 1920s, was designed by Madame Handley Seymour, who had been a dressmaker to Queen Mary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/queen_mother.htm|title= The Duchess of York's Wedding Dress|publisher=Fashion Era|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strip of Brussels lace, inserted in the dress, was a Strathmore family heirloom. A female ancestor of the bride wore it a grand ball for &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, [[Charles Edward Stuart]].&lt;ref name=ladybetty&gt;{{cite news|last=Bronner|first=Milton|title=Medieval gown for Lady Betty|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HPRXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FkUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=wedding%20dress&amp;pg=2165%2C4832492|accessdate=30 April 2011|newspaper=The Toledo News-Bee|date=24 April 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver leaf girdle had a trail of spring green tulle, trailing to the ground; silver and rose thistle fastened it. According to an era news article: &quot;In the trimming the bride has defied all old superstitions about the unluckiness of green.&quot;&lt;ref name=ladybetty /&gt;

Unlike more recent dresses, details of this one were publicly revealed in advance of the wedding day.&lt;ref name=ladybetty /&gt; However, the dress was worked on until the last possible opportunity: the day before the wedding, Elizabeth divided her time between the wedding rehearsal and her dressmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dull grey skies and raw winds for Royal wedding|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5d9PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w1QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=wedding%20dress&amp;pg=5283%2C4928500|accessdate=30 April 2011|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=25 April 1923|agency=Associated Press|location=St. Petersburg FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Albert wore [[Royal Air Force uniform#Full dress|RAF full dress]] in the rank of [[group captain]], his senior service rank at the time of his marriage.

The newly formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] had wanted to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |authorlink=John Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Staughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert's marriage to a British commoner was considered a modernising gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp. 57-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their marriage, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was styled ''[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]] [[Duchess of York|The Duchess of York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Following a wedding breakfast at [[Buckingham Palace]] prepared by chef [[Gabriel Tschumi]], they honeymooned at [[Polesden Lacey]], a manor house in [[Surrey]], and then went to Scotland, where she caught &quot;unromantic&quot; [[whooping cough]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Albert to Queen Mary, 25 May 1923, quoted in Shawcross, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;
