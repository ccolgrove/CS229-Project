The team was referred to as the '''Orange Express''' and was led by Beaver legendary coach [[Ralph Miller]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange Express&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.oregonstate.edu/eclips/history/bballhistory01.html|title=OSU Sports History Minute|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonsportshall.org/osb81.html|title=1980-81 OSU Basketball Team|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/file_lib/1/18/200804_Orange_Distress_633441207175875741.pdf|title=Orange Distress|accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orange Express season was Beaver great, [[Steve Johnson (basketball)|Steve Johnson's]], last year at OSU. This season would be the first time in OSU history that the Beavers would win at [[Pauley Pavilion|UCLA]].

At 26-1 the team would go into the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] as a number one seed and were upset by number eight seed [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]] 50-48. Miller was awarded [[1980â81_NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_season#Major_coach_of_the_year_awards|UPI]] and [[1980â81_NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_season#Major_coach_of_the_year_awards|AP Coach of the Year]] honors and Steve Johnson would receive [[1981 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|All-American]] honors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange Express&quot; /&gt; Throughout 1980-83 OSU held a 77-11 record which at the time was only bested by [[DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball|DePaul's]] 79-6 record. This record would include a 35-1 record at [[Gill Coliseum]] including a school best 24 wins in a row.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange Express&quot; /&gt;
