'''The Pirate Bay''' (commonly abbreviated '''TPB''') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] website which hosts [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|.torrent]] files, which allow users to share electronic files, including multimedia, computer games and software via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. The Pirate Bay bills itself as &quot;The world's most resilient BitTorrent site&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=1 October 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/technology/01pirate.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Swedes%20charge%204%20in%20case%20involving%20copyright%20infringement%20of%20music%20and%20films|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080203103037/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/31/business/pirate.php|archivedate=3 February 2008|title=Swedes charge 4 in case involving copyright infringement of music and films |work=International Herald Tribune|date=31 January 2008|author=Pfanner, Eric }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently ranked as the 77th most visited website in the world and 14th in Sweden by [[Alexa Internet]]&lt;ref name=&quot;alexa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/thepiratebay.org |title= Thepiratebay.org Site Info | publisher= [[Alexa Internet]] |accessdate= 2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, has over 5 million registered users and, as of 2011, hosts more than 3.5 million torrent files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freakbits.com/the-pirate-bay-welcomes-its-4-millionth-user-1209 |title=The Pirate Bay Welcomes Its 4 Millionth User|publisher=FreakBits |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', The Pirate Bay is &quot;one of the world's largest facilitators of illegal downloading&quot; and &quot;the most visible member of a burgeoning international [[anti-copyright]] or pro-piracy movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-webscout29apr29,0,1261622.story?coll=la-home-entertainment |title=The Internet sure loves its outlaws&amp;nbsp;â Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date= 29 April 2007|accessdate=28 September 2008 | first=David | last=Sarno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially established in November 2003 by the Swedish [[anti-copyright]] organization [[PiratbyrÃ¥n]] (The Piracy Bureau), The Pirate Bay has been run as a separate organization since October 2004. The Pirate Bay was first run by [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Fredrik Neij]], who are known by their nicknames &quot;anakata&quot; and &quot;TiAMO&quot;, respectively. They have both been accused by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] with &quot;assisting in making copyrighted content available&quot;. On 31 May 2006, the website's servers in [[Stockholm]] were raided and taken away by Swedish police, leading to three days of [[downtime]].&lt;ref name=still /&gt; The Pirate Bay has been involved in a number of lawsuits, both as plaintiff and as defendant. On 17 April 2009, [[Peter Sunde]], [[Fredrik Neij]], [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] and [[Carl LundstrÃ¶m]] were found guilty of [[Accessory (legal term)|assistance]] to [[copyright infringement]] and sentenced to one year in prison and payment of a fine of 30 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (app. 4,200,000 [[United States dollar|USD]]; 2,800,000 [[Pound sterling|GBP]]; or 3,100,000 [[Euro|EUR]]), after a [[The Pirate Bay trial|trial]] of nine days. The defendants have appealed against the verdict and the judge was accused of bias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-trial-the-verdict-090417/ The Pirate Bay Trial: The Official Verdict â Guilty]. [[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]. Retrieved 17 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 November 2010, a Swedish appeals court returned the verdict, decreasing the original prison terms but increasing the fine to 46 million SEK.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppealVerdict&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hgV9yJkx_IcxxnMJEAZQkoA4ESwg?docId=CNG.221f09c221a1979e755e0b0622ce97cd.c01|title=Prison terms of Pirate Bay executives' shortened|publisher=AFP|date=26 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 May 2010, due to an injunction against their bandwidth provider, the site was taken offline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Injunction&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/196501/german_injunction_knocks_the_pirate_bay_offline_temporarily.html|title=German Injunction Knocks The Pirate Bay Offline Temporarily&amp;nbsp;â PCWorld|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the website was later restored with a message making fun of the injunction on their front page. On 23 June 2010 the group PiratbyrÃ¥n disbanded due to the death of Ibi [[Kopimi]] Botani, a prominent member and co-founder of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoneForGood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bays-founding-group-piratbyran-disbands-100623/|title=The Pirate Bay&amp;nbsp;â Disbands|publisher=[[TorrentFreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Out of date|date=May 2011}} &lt;!-- See talk page --&gt;

[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/21/wikileaks_bulletproof_hosting/ Wikileaks judge gets Pirate Bay treatment] ''The Register'', 21 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serious Tubes Networks]] is currently providing network connectivity to The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref name=torrentfreak-comcast&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2011 |author=Ernesto Van Der Sar |title=Comcast Offers Help to The Pirate Bay, Problems Fixed |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]] |url=http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-offers-help-to-the-pirate-bay-110512/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website setup===
The Pirate Bay allows users to search for and download  [[torrent file|BitTorrent files (torrents)]], small files that contain [[metadata]] necessary to download the data files from other users. The torrents are organized into categories: &quot;music&quot;, &quot;Video&quot; (including a 3D section), &quot;Applications&quot;, &quot;Games&quot;, &quot;Other&quot; and &quot;Porn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/browse|title=Browse torrents|publisher=thepiratebay.org|accessdate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the &quot;Porn&quot; category is only visible for registered and logged-in users who select the &quot;show pornographic torrents&quot; option in their settings page. However it is currently not necessary with a workaround, allowing unregistered users to search for the content, but not browse through it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/browse|title=Browse torrents|publisher=thepiratebay.org|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registration requires an email address and is free; registered users may upload their own torrents and comment on torrents.

The website features a browse function that enables users to see what is available in broad categories like Audio, Video, and Games, as well as sub-categories like Audio books, High-res Movies, and Comics. The contents of a category can be sorted by file name, the number of seeds or leechers, the date posted, etc.

According to [[PiratbyrÃ¥n]], The Pirate Bay is a long-running project of [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/101 |title=All your bus are belong to us!|author=&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;kopiermich|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the front page of The Pirate Bay features a drawing of a [[pirate]] ship with the logo of the 1980s anti-copyright infringement campaign, ''[[Home Taping Is Killing Music]]'', on its sails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marie |last=Lechner |date=7 December 2007 |title=La K7 bande encore |url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101117124-la-k7-bande-encore |work=[[LibÃ©ration]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical details===
Initially, The Pirate Bay's four [[Linux]] [[Server (computing)|servers]] ran a custom [[web server]] called Hypercube. An old version is open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3903397/hypercube_tracker_by_anakata |title=hypercube tracker by anakata |author=[http://thepiratebay.org/user/JooiZe/ JooiZe]|date=21 November 2007|work=Browse Torrents |publisher=thepiratebay.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- torrent still live--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=| url=http://junki.es/hypercube-dist.tar.bz2 |title=Hypercube-dist.tar.bz2 |format=BZ2 archive| date=15 November 2008 |publisher=Junki.es |accessdate=12 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website in an effort to reduce [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] usage, which was reported to be at 2 [[HTTP]] requests per [[millisecond]] on each of the four [[web server]]s,&lt;ref name=stay&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358|title=The Pirate Bay: Here to Stay?|date=13 March 2006 |first=Ann |last=Harrison |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|accessdate=21 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the [[front-end]] of the website. The website now runs [[Lighttpd]] and [[PHP]] on its dynamic front ends, [[MySQL]] at the database back end, [[Sphinx (search engine)|Sphinx]] on the two search systems, [[memcached]] for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions, and [[Varnish cache|Varnish]] in front of Lighttpd for caching static content. {{As of|September 2008}}, The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight BitTorrent trackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.thepiratebay.org/ |title=Technical specifications |publisher=The Pirate Bay |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2007, The Pirate Bay finished the move from Hypercube to [[Opentracker]] as its BitTorrent tracking software, also enabling the use of the [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] tracker protocol for which Hypercube lacked support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-switches-to-opentracker-071208/|title=The Pirate Bay Now Running on Opentracker |publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=8 December 2007|author=&quot;Ernesto&quot; }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed UDP [[multicast]] to be used to synchronize the multiple servers with each other much faster than before.&lt;ref&gt;Roettgers, Janko (15 July 2009) [http://www.salon.com/technology/the_gigaom_network/online_video/2009/07/14/post_pirate_bay_a_federated_tracker_network_emerges/index.html &quot;Post-Pirate Bay, a Federated Tracker Network Emerges&quot;], [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; Opentracker is free software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/ &quot;opentracker&amp;nbsp;â An open and free bittorrent tracker&quot;].

In June 2008, The Pirate Bay announced that their servers would support [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encryption (accessible via https://thepiratebay.org)&lt;!-- make explicit, once.--&gt; in response to Sweden's new wiretapping law.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlyckSSL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slyck.com/story1691_SSL_Encrpytion_Coming_to_The_Pirate_Bay|title=SSL Encryption Coming to The Pirate Bay|last=Mennecke|first=Thomas|date=22 June 2008|publisher=[[Slyck News]]|accessdate=10 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuarSSL&quot;&gt;Schofield, Jack (23 June 2008).

On 19 January 2009, The Pirate Bay launched [[IPv6]] support for their tracker system, using an IPv6-only version of [[Opentracker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/146|title=IPv6 support|author=bkp|work=Blog|publisher=The Pirate Bay|date=19 January 2009|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2009, The Pirate Bay shut off its tracker service permanently, stating that centralized trackers are no longer needed since [[distributed hash table]]s (DHT), [[peer exchange]] (PEX), and [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet links]] allow peers to find each other and content in a decentralized way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slyck.com/story1880_The_Pirate_Bay_Trackers_Go_Offline_Forever| title=The Pirate Bay Trackers Go Offline Forever| date=17 November 2009| author=Mennecke, Thomas |publisher=[[Slyck.com]] |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/23310/20091117/ |title=Scrapping tracker may negate Pirate Bay fines |author=Landes, David |publisher=[[The Local]] |work=thelocal.se |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
Petter Nilsson, a candidate on the Swedish political reality show ''Toppkandidaterna'' (''The Top Candidates''), donated 35,000 [[Swedish Krona|SEK]] (US$4,925.83) to The Pirate Bay, which they used to buy new servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/25 |title=The First State Financed Tracker |author=&quot;tbz&quot;|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2006|6}}, the website is financed through advertisements on their result pages.

In April 2007, a rumor was confirmed on the Swedish talk show ''Bert'' that The Pirate Bay had received financial support from right-wing entrepreneur [[Carl LundstrÃ¶m]]. This caused some furor since LundstrÃ¶m, an heir to the [[WasabrÃ¶d]] fortune, is known for financing several far-right political parties and movements like [[Sverigedemokraterna]] and [[Bevara Sverige Svenskt]] (''Keep Sweden Swedish''). During the talk show, [[PiratbyrÃ¥n]] spokesman Tobias Andersson acknowledged that &quot;without LundstrÃ¶m's support, Pirate Bay would not have been able to start&quot; and claimed that most of the money went towards acquiring servers and bandwidth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regrightwing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=28 September 2008|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/05/07/pirate_bay_accepted_right_wing_money/|title=The Pirate Bay admits links with right-wing benefactor |publisher=The Register|date=7 May 2007|author=Jibbenga, Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Konrad |last=Lischka |date=4 May 2007 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,480972,00.html |title=Piratenseite im Zwielicht: Rechtspopulist finanziert Internet-TauschbÃ¶rse |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |accessdate=28 September 2008}} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spiegel.de%2Fnetzwelt%2Fweb%2F0%2C1518%2C480972%2C00.html English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) claims that the website is extremely profitable, and that The Pirate Bay is more engaged in making profit than supporting people's rights.&lt;ref name=arsfabricated&gt;{{cite news |date=1 February 2008 |first=Ryan |last=Paul|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2008/02/pirate-bay-big-revenue-claims-fabricated-by-prosecutors.ars|title=Pirate Bay: big revenue claims fabricated by prosecutors |publisher=Ars Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website has insisted that these allegations are not true, stating, &quot;It's not free to operate a Web Site on this scale,&quot; and, &quot;If we were making lots of money I, [[Svartholm]], wouldn't be working late at the office tonight, I'd be sitting on a beach somewhere, working on my tan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daly, Steven|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2007/03/piratebay200703?currentPage=4 |title=Pirates of the Multiplex|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|month= March | year= 2007|accessdate=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to claims of annual revenue exceeding US$3 million made by the IFPI, the site's spokesman Peter Sunde argues that the website's high bandwidth, power, and hardware costs eliminate the potential for profit. The Pirate Bay, he says, may ultimately be operating at a loss.&lt;ref name=arsfabricated /&gt; In the 2009 trial, the defense estimated the site's yearly expenses to be 800,000 SEK (US$112,590.40).&lt;ref name=kuprijanko /&gt; It is possible to make donations to the Pirate Bay and the site also ran a fund intended to buy [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]], a platform with debated [[Micronation|micro-nation]] status.

===Raid===
{{Main|The Pirate Bay raid}}

On 31 May 2006, a raid against The Pirate Bay and people involved with the website took place as ordered by judge Tomas NorstrÃ¶m, later the presiding judge of the 2009 trial, prompted by allegations of copyright violations. Police officers shut down the website and confiscated its servers, as well as all other servers hosted by The Pirate Bay's [[Internet service provider]], [[PRQ]]. The company is owned by two operators of The Pirate Bay. Three people â [[Gottfrid Svartholm]], Mikael Viborg, and [[Fredrik Neij]] â were held by the police for questioning, but were released later that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 October 2008|url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/08/71543?currentPage=all|title=Secrets of The Pirate Bay |work=Wired|date=16 August 2006|author=Norton, Quinn }}&lt;/ref&gt; All servers in the room were seized, including those running the website of [[PiratbyrÃ¥n]], an independent organization fighting for file sharing rights, as well as servers unrelated to The Pirate Bay or other file sharing activities, including a Russian opposition news agency.

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) wrote in a press release: &quot;Since filing a criminal complaint in Sweden in November 2004, the film industry has worked vigorously with Swedish and U.S. government officials in Sweden to shut this illegal website down.&quot; MPAA CEO [[Dan Glickman]] also stated, &quot;Intellectual property theft is a problem for film industries all over the world and we are glad that the local government in Sweden has helped stop The Pirate Bay from continuing to enable rampant copyright theft on the Internet.&quot; The MPAA press release set forth its justification for the raid and claimed that there were three arrests; however, the individuals were not actually arrested, only held for questioning. The release also reprinted John G. Malcolm's allegation that The Pirate Bay was making money from the distribution of copyrighted material, a criticism denied by the Pirate Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay|url=http://www.mpaa.org/press_releases/2006_05_31.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Motion Picture Association of America]]|date=31 May 2006| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ludmVPre |archivedate=10 December 2009| accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the raid, The Pirate Bay displayed a message that confirmed that the Swedish police had executed search warrants for breach of copyright law or assisting such a breach. The closure message initially caused some confusion because on 1 April 2005, [[April Fool's Day]], The Pirate Bay had posted a similar message as a [[prank]], stating that they were unavailable due to a raid by the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau and [[IFPI]]. PiratbyrÃ¥n set up a temporary news [[blog]] to inform the public about the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piratbyran.blogspot.com/ |title=PiratbyrÃ¥n&amp;nbsp;â temporÃ¤r nyhetsfÃ¶rmedling |publisher=Piratbyran.blogspot.com |date= 1 May 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2008 |language=Swedish}} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//piratbyran.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_archive.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=UTF-8 English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 June 2006, The Pirate Bay was available once again, with their logo depicting a pirate ship firing cannon balls at the [[Hollywood sign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/tech/piratebay.html|title=The Pirate Bay |publisher=CBC|date=9 June 2006|author=Bowman, John |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchases===
In January 2007, when the micronation of [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] was put up for &quot;sale&quot;, the [[ACFI]] and The Pirate Bay tried to buy it. The Sealand government however did not want to be involved with The Pirate Bay, as it was their opinion that file sharing represented &quot;theft of proprietary rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=George |last=Stroumboulopoulos |date=16 January 2007 |title=Prince of Sealand |url=http://www.cbc.ca/thehour/videos.html?id=741185888 |work=[[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|The Hour]] |publisher=[[CBC Television]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Yam |date=22 January 2007 |title=Sealand Prince Says No to PirateBay.org |url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=5800 |work=[[DailyTech]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new plan was formed to buy an island instead, but this too was never implemented, despite the website having raised US$25,000, â¬15,000 in donations for this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/01/12/pirate_bay_buys_island/|title=The Pirate Bay plans to buy Sealand |work=The Register|date=12 January 2007|author=Libbenga, Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] news [[blog]], [[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]], reported on 12 October 2007 that the Internet domain ifpi.com, which previously belonged to the [[IFPI|International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], an anti-piracy organisation, had been acquired by The Pirate Bay. When asked about how they got hold of the domain, Sunde told TorrentFreak, &quot;It's not a hack, someone just gave us the domain name. We have no idea how they got it, but it's ours and we're keeping it.&quot; The website was renamed &quot;The International Federation of Pirates Interests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/ifpi-now-owned-by-the-piratebay-071012/ |title=Anti-Piracy Organisation Domain IFPI.com Now Owned by The Pirate Bay |publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]] |date=12 July 2007 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the IFPI filed a complaint with the [[World Intellectual Property Organisation]] shortly thereafter, which subsequently ordered The Pirate Bay to return the domain name to the IFPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mennecke | first = Thomas | title = The Pirate Bay Loses IFPI.com Domain | publisher = Slyck | date = 30 November 2007 | url = http://www.slyck.com/story1623_The_Pirate_Bay_Loses_IFPIcom_Domain | accessdate =8 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy photos===
In September 2008, the Swedish media reported that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the [[Christine SchÃ¼rrer|Arboga case]] had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://www.thelocal.se/14168/20080905/|title=Arboga autopsy photos on The Pirate Bay |work=The Local|date=5 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent.

Sunde had agreed to participate on the condition that the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=29 September 2008|url=http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=96231&amp;a=1245304&amp;lid=puff_1245314&amp;lpos=lasmer|title=Debatt ber Pirate Bay om ursÃ¤kt |publisher=SVT|language=Swedish|date=12 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/129|title=No more media relations|author=signing out&amp;nbsp;â bkp|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org|date=12 September 2008|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) requested assistance from the Swedish government to prevent video clips from the [[Beijing Olympics]] from being distributed via The Pirate Bay.

Some blogs stated that a group known as the AUH (Arga Unga Hackare, Swedish for &quot;Angry Young Hackers&quot;) were suspected of executing the attack, however the AUH stated on the ''Computer Sweden'' newspaper that they were not involved and would take revenge on those responsible for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofthought.wordpress.com/2007/05/11/the-pirate-bay-infiltrated/ |title=The Pirate Bay Infiltrated &quot; Power of Thought |publisher=Powerofthought.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.107659/ |title=&quot;AUH inte bakom hacket&quot; â Computer Sweden |publisher=International Data Group |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2009 the website of The Pirate Bay had [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber]] [[IPv4]] connectivity issues. There was widespread speculation this was a forced outage from the Swedish antipiracy group, accelerated somewhat by TPB adding contact details for the Swedish antipiracy group's lawyers to its [[RIPE NCC|RIPE]] database record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thepiratebay.org/blog/152 |title=Fiber problems |quote=The site and tracker were down during most of the night and morning due to a broken fiber connection|date=27 April 2009|author= TiAMO|publisher=The Pirate Bay|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-ips-assigned-to-prosecution-lawyers-090426/|title=Pirate Bay IP Addresses Assigned to Prosecution Lawyers|publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site and its forums were still available via [[IPv6]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=32588&amp;page=46 |title=The Pirate Bay&amp;nbsp;â fiber cut|publisher=suprbay.org |date= |accessdate=27 April 2009}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2009 one of The Pirate Bay's upstream providers was ordered to discontinue service for the website by a Swedish court in response to a [[civil action]] brought by several entertainment companies including [[Disney]], [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment|Universal]], [[Time Warner]], [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], [[Sony]], [[NBC]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. According to the Pirate Bay blog, this caused a [[downtime]] of 3 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/171|title=Wireless TPB|author=the spirit of TPB|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org|date=24 August 2009| accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some users were unable to access the site immediately following the relocation due to unrelated technical difficulties. The site was fully operational again for everyone within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 8 July 2010, a group of Argentinean hackers gained access to The Pirate Bayâs administration panel through a security breach via the backend of The Pirate Bay website. They were able to delete torrents and expose usersâ IP-addresses, emails and MD5-hashed passwords. The Pirate Bay was taken offline for upgrades.

===Finland===
On 26 October 2011, the district court of Helsinki ruled that [[Elisa Oyj]], one of the major internet service providers in Finland, must cease to provide copyrighted material from The Pirate Bay website by 18 November 2011 with the threat of a 100 000 â¬ fine.

===Germany===
On 13 May 2010, the Hamburg District Court ordered an injunction against CB3Rob Ltd &amp; Co KG (Cyberbunker) and its operator, Mr. Sven Olaf Kamphuis, restraining them from connecting The Pirate Bay site to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Cyberbunker prohibited from providing Internet access to the Pirate Bay|url=http://www.mpaa.org/resources/68638b79-4e58-4ea5-9d22-533ea318a5ab.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Motion Picture Association]]|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction application was brought by the [[Motion Picture Association]]âs member companies.

===Greece===
In Greece, from 15 February 2010 until late March 2010, Land [[Internet Service Provider]] [[Tellas]]/[[WIND Hellas]] blocked the site,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adslgr.com/forum/showpost.php?p=3325943&amp;postcount=14 Answer: Loading The Pirate Bay] ADSL Greece Forum. 16 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as a side effect of blocking applied in Italy, since apparently traffic is routed via the sister network [[Wind (Italy)|Wind Italy]] servers. Unlike in Italy, in Greece it is not required by law for ISPs to restrict access to The Pirate Bay.
Tellas/WIND Hellas managed to circumvent the problem as of 19 March 2010 so that access through the ISP is granted to their users, as well as to the rest of Greek internet users.

In January 2009, Irish ISP [[Eircom]], Ireland's most popular internet provider, was taken to court by the four large music labels [[EMI]], [[Sony]], [[Universal Music Group]] and [[Warner Music Group]] in order to have the ISP monitor its customers and spot illegal file sharing.&lt;ref name=eircomblock&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/160114/irish_isp_we_wont_block_the_pirate_bay.html|title= Irish ISP: We Won't Block The Pirate Bay|accessdate=3 March 2009 |first=Jeremy |last=Kirk |date= 24 February 2009 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight court days, the parties reached a settlement to introduce a [[Three strikes (policy)|three strikes policy]] to disconnect customers involved in copyright infringing activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Collins |date=29 January 2009 |title=Internet users face shutdown over illegal music downloads |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0129/1232923373331.html |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] continues to negotiate with other ISPs for a similar agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ciara |last=O'Brien |date=18 April 2009 |title=Pirate Bay may be dented but its ship sails on for more battle |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0418/1224244974327.html |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2009, Eircom however declared that access to The Pirate Bay would soon be blocked altogether,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=NEWS-qqqs=news-qqqid=39782-qqqx=1.asp|title=Music-swapping sites to be blocked by internet providers |accessdate=3 March 2009 |author=Weckler, Adrian |date= 22 February 2009|work= |publisher= The Sunday Business Post Online|archivedate=9 March 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090309010318/http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=NEWS-qqqs=news-qqqid=39782-qqqx=1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; but retracted that on 24 February 2009, stating that they would not block without a court order.&lt;ref name=eircomblock /&gt; Eircom reversed themselves again on 20 August 2009, announcing that they would block the website starting in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/eircom-to-block-pirate-bay-access-423241.html |title=Eircom to block Pirate Bay access |date=20 August 2009 |work=IrishExaminer.com |publisher=Examiner Publications, Thomas Crosbie Holdings Ltd. |location=Cork}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 August 2009 |title=Eircom to block Pirate Bay access from next month. |url=http://news.eircom.net/breakingnews/16288287/?view=Standard |publisher= Eircom.net&amp;nbsp;â Breaking News }}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 September 2009 Eircom blocked access to The Pirate Bay, though it is still accessible via proxy servers, and still accessible in Ireland to subscribers of other ISP companies.

===Italy===
In mid 2008, following the criminal charges raised in Sweden, the Italian Federation against Musical Piracy in [[Milan]] requested action in Italy. The deputy public prosecutor pursued the complaint in the [[Bergamo]] Court for Preliminary Investigations, which on 1 August 2008 decreed to block access from Italian ISPs to all Pirate Bay addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Willan |first=Philip |date=16 August 2008 |title=Judge Blocks Access to Pirate Bay |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/149904/judge_blocks_access_to_pirate_bay.html |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |publisher=IDG |accessdate=27 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.altalex.com/index.php?idnot=42855&amp;idstr=20 |title=Ordinanza 1 agosto 2008.

===Malaysia===
In June 2011, the [[Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission]] ordered the blocking of The Pirate Bay along with several other file-hosting websites via a letter, dated 30 May, to all Malaysian ISPs for violating Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987, which deals with [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|pirated content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/6/11/nation/8879884&amp;sec=nation |title=No more free downloads as MCMC blocks 10 file sharing sites |publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
On 21 July 2009, the Amsterdam district court held a [[preliminary injunction]] hearing against the persons thought responsible for The Pirate Bay. The hearing followed a subpoena from the Dutch record industry trade association [[BREIN]], who had an urgent complaint of intermediary copyright infringement. The defendants did not attend the hearing and hadn't arranged representation, so on 30 July 2009 the court entered an [[in absentia]] [[default judgment]] against them, accepting the complainants demands. It ruled that Neij, Kolmisoppi and Warg are &quot;to stop and keep stopped the infringements on copyright and related rights of Stichting Brein (foundation Brain) in the Netherlands&quot; within 9 August 2009, or face daily penalties of EUR 30,000, up to a maximum total of EUR 3,000,000.

On 2 October 2009, The Pirate Bay's hosting services moved to [[Ukraine]] and their traffic was routed through The Netherlands, but [[BREIN]] contacted the ISP NForce and service was stopped. In return, The Pirate Bay moved their hosting location to a nuclear bunker owned by [[CyberBunker]] just outside [[Kloetinge]] in the south of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=TFbunker/&gt;

===Norway===
[[Asker and BÃ¦rum District Court]] rejected demands from the recording artists' copyright organisation [[TONO]] against Norway's largest internet provider, [[Telenor]], to have The Pirate Bay blocked. In a court ruling on 6 November 2009 the court stated that in today's society it would be unnatural to demand of a private company that it should make judgments on whether a website complied with the law, since making such judgments is considered the responsibility of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Holwerda, Thom |title= Judge: Norwegian ISP Does Not Have to Block The Pirate Bay |url= http://www.osnews.com/story/22456/Judge_Norwegian_ISP_Does_Not_Have_to_Block_The_Pirate_Bay |work= [[OSNews]] |date= 7 November 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= JÃ¸rgenrud, Marius |title= Telenor slipper Ã¥ sperre Pirate Bay |url= http://www.digi.no/827920/telenor-slipper-aa-sperre-pirate-bay |work= [[Digi.no]] |location= Oslo, Norway |date= 6 November 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In May 2010, The Pirate Bay's Swedish internet service provider [[#Black Internet|lost an appeal]] against an order to stop providing service to the site. Although the service provider had already complied with an earlier order in August 2009 and The Pirate Bay was thereafter hosted elsewhere, in June 2010 the ISP chose also to block their customers from accessing The Pirate Bay in its new location. One of the judges in the case later commented that the court's order didn't require the ISP to control their customers' access to the site, but the ISP wanted to avoid any risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;localban&quot; /&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, The Pirate Bay is blocked by default by BT Mobile Broadband and other mobile broadband providers, as part of a system that blocks access to sites considered to be &quot;over 18&quot; status, implying the block is because it has pornographic torrents, not because of copyright infringement. Customers can remove the block by contacting their ISP.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Barry (21 April 2009). [http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/251609/bt-blocks-off-pirate-bay.html News: BT blocks off Pirate Bay].

===Facebook===
After The Pirate Bay introduced a feature in March 2009 to easily share links to torrents on the popular [[social networking]] site [[Facebook]], [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] found in May that Facebook had started blocking the links. On further inspection, they discovered that all messages containing links to The Pirate Bay in both public and in private messages, regardless of content, were being blocked. [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] lawyers commented that Facebook might be working against the US [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] by intercepting user messages, but Facebook chief privacy officer Chris Kelly said that they have the right to use blocks on links where there is a &quot;demonstrated disregard for intellectual property rights,&quot; following users' agreement on their terms of service. Links to other similar sites have not been blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eliot |last=Van Buskirk |date=30 March 2009 |title=The Pirate Bay Puts Bit Torrent on Facebook |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/03/the-pirate-ba-1/ |work=Epicenter |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singer |date=6 May 2009 |title=Facebook's E-mail Censorship is Legally Dubious, Experts Say |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/facebooks-e-mail-censorship-is-legally-dubious-experts-say/ |work=Epicenter |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Henning |last=Steier |date=7 May 2009 |title=Facebook spioniert Nutzer aus |url=http://www.20min.ch/digital/webpage/story/31623685 |work=[[20 Minuten]] |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
A court has overturned a 2010 ruling which said that blocking The Pirate Bay at the ISP level was âdisproportionateâ. The [[Antwerp]] Court of Appeal sided with the Belgian Anti-Piracy Federation in their quest to force two ISPs to block subscriber access to TPB. Belgacom and Telenet must implement a DNS blockade of the site within 14 days or face fines.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nurpa.be/files/20111004_BAF-Belgacom-Telenet-DNS-blocking.pdf|title=Antwerp Appeals Court Ruling: BAF vs Belgacom and Telenet - DNS Blocking (in Dutch, citing the original ruling it overturns)|publisher=nurpa.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the founders of The Pirate Bay lost their 2009 trial, the Belgian Anti-Piracy Foundation (BAF) began pushing two ISPs â Belgacom and Telenet â to block subscriber access to the famous torrent site.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt;

After year-long negotiations between the trio broke down, legal action was the inevitable outcome and in July 2010 their first battle came to a conclusion.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt;

The Antwerp Commercial Court decided that neither [[ISP]] would have to block TPB and went on to describe the notion of wholesale site blocking as âdisproportionateâ.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt;

The ISPs said it wasnât their position to decide which sites can and can not be accessed by their users. BAF accused them of providing a safe-haven to The Pirate Bay and filed an appeal. The Antwerp Court of Appeal overruled the decision of the Commercial Court and has ordered [[Belgacom]] and [[Telenet]] to initiate DNS blockades of 11 domains connected to The Pirate Bay within 14 days or face fines.&lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt;

A Pirate Bay spokesperson told that this measure will only have the opposite effect, as there are many ways to circumvent it. âThis will just give us more traffic, as always. Thanks for the free advertising.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activepolitic.com:82/News/2011-10-04a/Belgian_ISPs_Ordered_To_Block_The_Pirate_Bay.html|title=Belgian ISPs Ordered To Block The Pirate Bay|publisher=activepolitic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court order has a limitative list of domain names to block, which all include 'www.'. The equivalent URLs without 'www.' are also blocked by ISPs who want to comply with the &quot;spirit of the law&quot; even though the court order doesn't specify that. &lt;ref name=BelgianCourtRuling/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/10/08/2327227/belgian-court-order-may-be-too-specific-to-actually-block-pirate-bay-domain|title=Belgian Court Order May Be Too Specific To Actually Block Pirate Bay Domain|publisher=slashdot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activepolitic.com:82/News/2011-10-08/Belgium_May_Not_be_Blocking_The_Pirate_Bay.html|title=Belgium May Not be Blocking The Pirate Bay|publisher=activepolitic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NURPA, a nonprofit Belgian advocacy group which promotes and protects digital rights, freedom of expression, privacy and civil liberties, condemn the decision: âThe decision of the Antwerp Court of Appeal in the case against Belgacom BAF / Telenet sets a dangerous precedent for blocking of content by Internet service providers in Belgium. It is incompatible with the doctrine of proportionality advocated by the European Court of Human Rights,â says Loconte.&lt;ref name=NurpaReaction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nurpa.be/actualites/2011/10/BAF-belgacom-telenet-blocage-dns|title=BAF contre Telenet / Belgacom, les opÃ©rateurs devront bloquer The Pirate Bay (in french)|publisher=nurpa.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By imposing a site-wide blockade, Loconte says the Court of Appeal has disproportionately censored all content indexed by the site, including legitimately available material.&lt;ref name=NurpaReaction/&gt;

On Oct 5th, The Pirate Bay registered the domain name depiraatbaai.be, allowing Belgian users to access the site again, even without using alternative dns providers, proving the limits of the court ruling already described by the defendants in their arguments to the court.&lt;ref&gt;dns.be search for depiraatbaai.be&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
{{Main|The Pirate Bay trial}}
The Pirate Bay trial was a joint [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil]] prosecution in Sweden of four individuals charged for promoting the [[copyright infringement]] of others with The Pirate Bay site.&lt;ref name=kravets&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Kravets |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/01/pirate-bay-futu.html |title=Pirate Bay Future Uncertain After Operators Busted |work=Threat Level |publisher=[[Wired News]] Blogs |date=31 January 2008 |accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=larsson&gt;{{cite web |first=Linus |last=Larsson |url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.143146 |title=Charges filed against the Pirate Bay four|work=[[Computer Sweden]]|date=31 January 2008|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal charges were supported by a consortium of [[intellectual rights]] holders led by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry [[IFPI]], who filed individual civil compensation claims against the owners of The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael A. |last=Lindenberger |date=20 February 2009 |title=Internet Pirates Face Walking the Plank in Sweden |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1880981,00.html |work=[[TIME]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedish [[prosecutor]]s filed charges on 31 January 2008 against Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm, and Peter Sunde; and [[Carl LundstrÃ¶m]], a Swedish businessman who through his businesses sold services to the site. The prosecutor claimed the four worked together to administer, host, and develop the site and thereby facilitated other people's breach of copyright law. Some 34 cases of copyright infringements were originally listed, of which 21 were related to music files, 9 to movies, and 4 to games.&lt;ref name=larsson /&gt; One case involving music files was later dropped by the copyright holder who made the file available again on The Pirate Bay site. In addition, claims for damages of 117 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (US$13 million, â¬12.5 million) were filed.&lt;ref name=timescharges&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Harvey |date=18 February 2009 |url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article5754740.ece |title=Half of Pirate Bay charges dropped |publisher=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was decided jointly by a judge, who was a member of several pro-copyright organisations, and three appointed [[laymen]].&lt;ref&gt;

The trial started on 16 February 2009 in the [[TingsrÃ¤tt|district court]] (''[[tingsrÃ¤tt]]'') of [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The hearings ended on 3 March 2009 and the verdict was announced at 11:00 AM on Friday 17 April 2009: Peter Sunde, Fredrik Neij, Gottfrid Svartholm and Carl LundstrÃ¶m were all found guilty and sentenced to serve one year in prison and pay a fine of 30 million Swedish krona (app. [[Euro|â¬]]2.7 million or USD 3.5 million). All of the defendants appealed the verdict.

The appeal trial concluded on 15 October 2010 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Jenselius, Michael |title= Pirate Bay-rÃ¤ttegÃ¥ngen Ã¶ver&amp;nbsp;â dom i november |url= http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.346725/pirate-bay-rattegangen-over---dom-i-november |work= idg.se |publisher= [[IDG]] |language= Swedish |date= 18 October 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the verdict was announced on 26 November. The appeal court shortened sentences of three of the defendants who appeared in court that day. Neij's sentence was reduced to 10 months, Sunde's to eight, and LundstrÃ¶m's to four. However, the fine was increased from 32 to 46 million kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Kobie, Nicole |title= Pirate Bay trio lose appeal against jail sentences |url= http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/363178/pirate-bay-trio-lose-appeal-against-jail-sentences |work= pcpro.co.uk |publisher= [[PCPRO]] |date= 26 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations to other Swedish pirate organizations==
{{Main|Pirate Party|PiratbyrÃ¥n}}
There are three major pirate organizations in Sweden: the political [[Pirate Party]], which won 7.1 % of the Swedish votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elections2009-results.eu/en/sweden_en.html |title=European election results 2009 for Sweden|work= elections2009-results.eu|accessdate=13 July 2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two seats in [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-party-gets-second-seat-in-european-parliament-091104/|title=Pirate Party Gets Second Seat in European Parliament|publisher=[[Torrentfreak.com|Torrent Freak]]|date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]] [[PiratbyrÃ¥n]], and the BitTorrent tracker The Pirate Bay. Of these three, PiratbyrÃ¥n and The Pirate Bay share a common history but are now separate. Even though the Pirate Party started hosting The Pirate Bay on 18 May 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/pirate-party-hosting-pirate-bay-in-pro-p2p-political-gesture.ars |title=Pirate Party hosting Pirate Bay in pro-P2P political gesture |publisher=Ars Tehnica |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Pirate Party developed on a completely separate though parallel track and is unrelated to the other two.

==Failed acquisition==
On 30 June 2009 Swedish advertising company [[Global Gaming Factory X AB]] announced their intention to buy the site for [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 60 million (approximately $8.5 million [[United States dollar|USD]]) (30m SEK in cash, 30m SEK in [[Global Gaming Factory X AB|GGF]] stock).&lt;ref name=&quot;globalgamingfactory.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thepiratebay.org-blog-164&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog/164 |title=TPB might change owner|author=TPB|work=[http://thepiratebay.org/blog Blog]|publisher=thepiratebay.org |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pirate Bay founders stated that the profits from the sale would be placed in an [[offshore account]] where it would be used to fund projects pertaining to 'freedom of speech, freedom of information, and the openness of the Internet'.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalgamingfactory.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.globalgamingfactory.com/pressrelease-090630.pdf Acquisitions of The Pirate Bay and new file sharing technology, P2P 2.0](PDF).

Global Gaming Factory's letter of intent expired at the end of September 2009, without the transaction having taken place. This may be due to the company's current financial difficulties. PC World magazine regarded the deal's future as &quot;doomed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;RicknÃ¤s, Mikael (28 September 2009).
