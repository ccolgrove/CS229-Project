'''Val Joe &quot;Rudy&quot; Galindo''' (born September 7, 1969 in [[San Jose, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]] who competed in both [[single skating]] and [[pair skating]]. As a single skater, he is the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|1996 U.S. national champion]] and 1987 [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Champion]]. As a pairs skater, he competed with [[Kristi Yamaguchi]] and was the 1988 World Junior Champion and the 1989 &amp; 1990 U.S. National Champion.

==Biography==
Rudy Galindo is the third child of Jess and Margaret Galindo, having a brother, George, who was ten years older and sister, Laura, five years older.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; He began skating with his sister and, although the sport was expensive, his parents were supportive and forewent a chance to buy a house, settling instead for a larger trailer.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; 

Galindo was partnered with [[Kristi Yamaguchi]] by his coach, Jim Hulick, who died of AIDS-related cancer in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; The pair won the 1988 [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior]] title and the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. senior championships]] in 1989 and 1990. In singles, Galindo won the 1987 World Junior title before temporarily giving up the discipline in order to concentrate on pairs. However, in April 1990, Yamaguchi decided to end the partnership to focus on her singles career, and with no one of her caliber to partner with, Galindo returned to singles competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; 

His father died of a heart attack in 1993, his brother, George, died from AIDS in 1994, as did another coach, Rick Inglesi, in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; Galindo took eight months off after the [[1995 United States Figure Skating Championships|1995 U.S. Championships]]. However, with the following year's event in his hometown, presenting a chance to compete in front of his mother who no longer traveled, he decided to resume training in September 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; In January 1996, he won the men's title at the [[1996 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]] at the [[HP Pavilion at San Jose|San Jose Arena]], becoming the oldest male to win this title in 70 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; He went on to win a bronze medal at the [[1996 World Figure Skating Championships|1996 World Championships]]. His sister, Laura, was his coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt;

Galindo retired from eligible competition in the summer of 1996. After being diagnosed as [[HIV positive people|HIV positive]] and recovering from hip replacement surgery, Rudy continued to tour with the [[Champions on Ice|Tom Collins' Champions on Ice]] show until it went out of business in 2007.

Galindo coaches at Sharks Ice San Jose, the same rink where he trained during his competitive career.&lt;ref name=&quot;sjshof&quot;/&gt; He is to be inducted into the San Jose Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;sjshof&quot;/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Galindo is of Mexican descent by way of his grandparents on his father's side.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; He disclosed his [[homosexuality]] in [[Christine Brennan]]'s book ''Inside Edge: A Revealing Journey Into the Secret World of Figure Skating'' (ISBN 0-385-48607-3), which was published shortly before he won his national title in 1996. He is the first openly gay skating champion in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;si031196&quot;/&gt; He published his autobiography ''Icebreaker'' in 1997 (ISBN 0-671-00390-9).

In 2006, Galindo was a celebrity judge on the [[WE tv]] series ''[[Skating's Next Star]]'', created and produced by Major League Figure Skating and hosted by [[Kristi Yamaguchi]].
