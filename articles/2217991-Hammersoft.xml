The '''Ireland cricket team''' is the [[cricket]] team representing all of [[Ireland]]. Because of political difficulties, the [[Irish Cricket Union]] (ICU) was not elected to the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) until 1993, and qualified for the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time in 2007. The Irish Cricket Union is the governing body of Irish cricket. The Irish cricket team is made up of both professional cricketers and those who earn their living outside the sport. [[Cricket Ireland]], which succeeded the Irish Cricket Union as the sport's governing body in the country, introduced contracts for its players in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricketeurope4.net/DATABASE/ARTICLES2/articles/000072/007219.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and as of the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] 13 players have full-time contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/current/story/504058.html |title=Johnston says Ireland not ready for Tests |first=Brydon |last=Coverdale |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first match played by an Irish team was in 1855. Since then, Ireland have gained a reputation for [[giant-killing]]. Ireland played their first [[One Day International]] (ODI) in 2006 against England. Since then, they have gone on to play 61&amp;nbsp;ODIs, resulting in 29&amp;nbsp;victories, 28&amp;nbsp;defeats, 3&amp;nbsp;[[Result (cricket)#No result|no results]], and 1&amp;nbsp;[[tie (draw)|tie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Records/Ireland/Odis/Playing_Record.html |title=Ireland Playing Record in ODI Matches |publisher=CricketArchive}} Retrieved on 2 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights in Ireland's cricketing history include beating a touring West Indies side in 1928, 1969, and again in 2004, progressing to the second round of the 2007 World Cup&amp;nbsp;â in which they beat Pakistan and Bangladesh and tied with Zimbabwe&amp;nbsp;â and beating England in the 2011 World Cup.

Ireland take part in the [[ICC Trophy]], the [[European Cricket Championship]] (which they have won three times and hold the title of European champions), and the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]], which they have won consecutively three times since 2005. Until 2009, the team also competed in the [[Friends Provident Trophy]] against English counties. Ireland is an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate member]] of the ICC; Associates are the next level of team below those that play [[Test cricket]]. Due to their recent successes in the Intercontinental Cup and at the World Cup, they have been labelled the &quot;leading Associate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/tri-kenya/content/story/374302.html |title=Zimbabwe should avoid another banana skin |author=Martin Williamson |publisher=Cricinfo |date=17&amp;nbsp;October 2008}} Retrieved on 3&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland is currently one of the teams in [[2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One|Division 1]] of [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate Members]] of [[International Cricket Council]] who has [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|T20]] International status. After the tremendous success at International stage , Cricket Ireland has applied for [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Members|Full Membership]] from the [[International Cricket Council]]. Ireland have recently won the [[ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier 2008]] and [[2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier]] and qualified for [[2009 World Twenty20]] and [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Being a full member will allow Ireland to become a permanent [[One Day International]] playing nation and eventually grant them [[Test Cricket|Test]] status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricinfo.com/ireland/content/current/story/432837.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
Cricket was introduced to Ireland by the English in the towns of [[Kilkenny]] and [[Ballinasloe]] in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the game began to spread; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30&amp;nbsp;years are still in existence today.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/ICC_MEMBERS/IRELAND/HISTORY.html |title=A brief history of cricket: Cricket in Ireland |publisher=Cricinfo}} Retrieved on 3&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Irish national team played in 1855 against The Gentlemen of England in Dublin. In the 1850s, the Englishman Charles Lawrence was responsible for developing the game in Ireland through his coaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt; In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited for the first time by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (the M.C.C.) was in 1858.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt;

The game increased in popularity until the early 1880s. The land war in the 1880s resulting from the [[Irish Land Commission]] and a ban on playing &quot;foreign&quot; games by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] set back the spread of cricket. The ban was not lifted until 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt; Anyone playing foreign games such as cricket would be banned from the extremely popular Irish games such as [[hurling]] and [[Gaelic football]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt; Irish teams toured Canada and the USA in 1879, 1888, 1892, and 1909. On top of this, Ireland defeated a touring South African side in 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt; Their first match with [[First-class cricket|first-class]] status was played on 19&amp;nbsp;May 1902 against a London County side including [[W.G. Grace]]. The Irish, captained by [[Sir Tim O'Brien, 3rd Baronet|Sir Tim O'Brien]], won convincingly by [[The result in cricket|238 runs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/5/5899.html |title=f5558: London County v Ireland: Ireland in England 1902 |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 5&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before 1993===
After the 1902 tour of England, where four matches yielded one win, two draws and one loss, the Irish did not play first-class cricket again for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/ENG/1902_ENG_Ireland_in_England_1902.html |title=Ireland in England 1902 |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Irish had lost to the South Africans in 1894&amp;nbsp;â Ireland's first match against a Test-playing nation&amp;nbsp;â Ireland defeated South Africa in 1904; it was the team's first victory against a Test side.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish timeline&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/GENERAL/TIMELINES/ireland.shtml |title=A Timeline of Irish Cricket |publisher=CricketEurope4.net}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, the first annual first-class match between Ireland and [[Scotland cricket team|Scotland]] was held. An annual match against the M.C.C. was arranged and held from 1924 onwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt;

The Irish played yearly first-class games with the Scots, only interrupted by wars, up until 1999, but all their other cricket was dictated by whenever touring international sides found it convenient to visit Ireland. However, they sometimes surprised [[Test cricket|Test]] nations in these games, winning by 60 runs in a three-day game in [[Dublin]] over the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] in 1928, for example; it was Ireland's first match against the West Indies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irish timeline&quot;/&gt; In 1969, they defeated a West Indian side including [[Clive Lloyd]] and [[Clyde Walcott]] by nine wickets, after bowling them out for 25. The match was played at [[Sion Mills]] in [[County Tyrone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/30/30223.html |title=misc3695 Ireland v West Indians: West Indies in British Isles 1969 |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 16&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time Ireland defeated a touring side until 2003 when they beat Zimbabwe by 10 wickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/129584.html |title=Ireland overwhelm Zimbabwe in ten-wicket win |publisher=Cricinfo |date=2003-06-13 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scots and the Irish were mostly competing with [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] for the title as best non-Test nation at the time â indeed, Ireland drew with Sri Lanka in a rain-hit first-class match in 1979, Ireland scoring a total of 341/7 in two innings while Sri Lanka made 288/6 in one innings. Ireland joined the ICC as an [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate member]] in 1993, a year before Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/about-icc/history-1989-present.html |title=1989 â present â International Cricket Council |publisher=ICC-cricket.yahoo.com}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===ICC Trophy===
As a member of the ICC in 1994, Ireland were allowed to compete in the [[ICC Trophy]] for the first time. They won three of their seven games to finish seventh in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/ABN-AMRO_ICC_Trophy_1993-94.html |title=ABN-AMRO ICC Trophy 1993/94 points table |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in [[Malaysia]], they progressed to the semi-finals after a good showing in the group stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/Carlsberg_ICC_Trophy_1996-97.html |title=Carlsberg ICC Trophy 1996/97 points table |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but lost by seven runs to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/63/63787.html |title=icct345 Ireland v Kenya: Carlsberg ICC Trophy 1996/97 (Semi-Final) |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to lose the third place play-off with Scotland, thus missing a place at the [[1999 cricket World Cup]]. The 2001 tournament in Canada showed the batting skills of [[Ed Joyce]], who ended up with 359&amp;nbsp;runs at an [[Batting average#Batting average in cricket|average]] of 71.80 in eight innings with a highest score of 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2001/TOURNAMENTS/ICCTROPHY/statistics.shtml |title=ICC Trophy 2001: Tournament Statistics |publisher=CricketEurope4.net}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce, who had been signed by [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] two years earlier, could not save the team from a number of defeats, however. They lost to the [[United States cricket team|USA]] by six wickets in the first match in Canada, and also lost to [[Danish cricket team|Denmark]] by 12 runs. In the end, the Irish lost five matches, finishing eighth in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2001/TOURNAMENTS/ICCTROPHY/about.shtml |title=ICC Trophy 2001: Results |publisher=CricketEurope4.net}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2005 ICC Trophy]], which was hosted in Ireland&amp;nbsp;â the group stages in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], the final stages in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland]]&amp;nbsp;â saw the Irish improve drastically. Ed Joyce's four years in [[county cricket]], where he earlier in 2005 became the first batsman to hit 1,000 runs, gave him the experience to lift the Irish to big totals (he [[Batting average#Batting average in cricket|averaged]] 106 in four innings for Ireland), and even when he left for [[County Championship]] games with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], they managed to win, defeating [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] by four-wickets thanks to [[Peter Gillespie]], who hit a career highest score in the ICC Trophy with 64 not out&amp;nbsp;â his first fifty&amp;nbsp;â to anchor their chase to 239. Earlier, South African-born [[Andre Botha (cricketer)|Andre Botha]] had taken 4/47 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/IRELAND/2005_IRELAND_ICC_Trophy_2005.html |title=ICC Trophy 2005 |publisher=CricketEurope4.net}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final against Scotland, as they conceded a total of 324/9 after electing to bowl first. The return of Joyce did not help; even though he made 81 the Irish still lost the match by 47 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/icct/content/story/213443.html |title=Elementary for Watson as Scotland secure Trophy |author=Edward Craig |publisher=Cricinfo |date=13&amp;nbsp;July 2005}} Retrieved on 3&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce later that year qualified to play for [[English Cricket Team|England]], leaving the Irish cricket team. He is still hailed as one of the best players ever produced by Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/286433.html |title=Fuelled by team spirit |author=Dileep Premachandran |publisher=Cricinfo |date=21&amp;nbsp;March 2007}} Retrieved on 12&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ireland lost in the final, they had secured their place at the 2007 World Cup as well as an extra $500,000 over the next four years from the ICC to encourage development of Irish cricket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edward Craig&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/icct/content/story/213344.html |title=Scotland begin as slight favourites |author=Edward Craig |publisher=Cricinfo |date=12&amp;nbsp;July 2005}} Retrieved on 3&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercontinental Cup===
With the introduction of the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.com/icc-events/intercontinental-cup.html |title=ICC Intercontinental Cup |publisher=ICC-cricket.yahoo.com}} Retrieved on 23&amp;nbsp;July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland received a chance to play first-class on a regular basis. The competition was split into four divisions, with the top team from each division progressing to a knock-out stage. Whilst they beat the [[Netherlands cricket team|Netherlands]], Ireland lost their group match against Scotland in [[2004 ICC Intercontinental Cup|2004]] and failed to progress beyond the group stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004/OTHERS/ICC-CONT/ICC-CONT_POINTS.html |title=Intercontinental Cup 2004 points table |publisher=Cricinfo |year=2004}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland won their first Cup title in [[2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup|October 2005]] with a six wicket win over Kenya. An unbeaten century by [[Niall O'Brien (cricketer)|Niall O'Brien]], half centuries from [[Eoin Morgan]], [[Andre Botha (cricketer)|Andre Botha]], and [[Jeremy Bray]], along with four wickets each for [[Andrew White (cricketer)|Andrew White]] and [[Kyle McCallan]] were the principal contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/icccont/content/story/223519.html |title=Ireland secure Intercontinental glory  |publisher=Cricinfo |date=29&amp;nbsp;October 2005}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For its third edition, the tournament was revamped. The number of participating teams was reduced from 16 to 8 and was divided into two groups in stead of four.

Ireland, led by [[Trent Johnston]], emerged convincing winners by an innings and 115 runs at Grace Road, the four-day match concluding within two days. This made Ireland the first team to successfully defend the Continental Cup, confirming its current status as the most successful non-Test playing nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/icccont/content/story/295595.html |title=Ireland complete final rout  |date=23&amp;nbsp;May 2007}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===English county competition===
[[Image:100 1795 (2).jpg|right|thumbnail|right|Ireland compete against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] at [[Clontarf Cricket Club Ground|Castle Avenue]].]]
Ireland, along with Scotland and the Netherlands, has at times played in competitions for [[List of English First Class Cricket Counties|English county cricket sides]], including the [[Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]] and the [[Friends Provident Trophy]] (previously the [[C&amp;G Trophy]]). Since there is no nationality restriction in county cricket, non-Irish players have competed for Ireland in these matches. For example [[Hansie Cronje]] of South Africa competed for Ireland in the 1997 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2009/2009.html |title=Hanse Cronje |publisher=CricketArchive.com}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently New Zealander [[Jesse Ryder]] played for Ireland in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/newzealand/content/story/296125.html |title=Ryder no-show for Ireland  |date=28&amp;nbsp;May 2007 |publisher=Cricinfo}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Ireland beat [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] by five wickets in the C&amp;G Trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/4500887.stm |title=Last chance for the giant-killers |date=30&amp;nbsp;April 2005 |publisher=BBC Online | accessdate=5 January 2010}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2006 season, the C&amp;G Trophy was reorganised to include a round-robin stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas Ireland had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. For the 2006 tournament, they were bolstered by the signings of [[Saqlain Mushtaq]] and [[Shahid Afridi]], the two overseas players they were allowed when competing in English domestic competitions. Ireland recorded one win in their nine matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2006/ENG_LOCAL/C+G/C+G_2006_TABLE.html |title=Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy&amp;nbsp;â Points Table |year=2006 |publisher=Cricinfo}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their victory was over [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] on 30&amp;nbsp;April by 47&amp;nbsp;runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ireland/content/story/245844.html |title=Ireland spin their way to upset  |date=30&amp;nbsp;April 2006 |publisher=Cricinfo}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The C&amp;G Trophy changed its name to Friends Provident Trophy for the 2007 season. In 2007, Ireland played in the Friends Provident Trophy against nine English county sides. Of those nine matches, they lost six and the remaining three matches were abandoned due to rain. They finished bottom in the South Conference of the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/countycricket2007/engine/series/268020.html?view=pointstable |title=Friends Provident Trophy, 2007 |year=2007 |publisher=Cricinfo}} Retrieved on 10&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2008 season, the round-robin section of the trophy was changed from two divisions to three; Ireland were in the newly formed Midlands Division.

In 2009, Ireland inflicted [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire's]] lowest ever one-day total (58 all out) in a 94-run Friends Provident Trophy group A win at New Road. [[Peter Connell]] did the most damage in taking 5â19. It was the first time that Ireland had bowled out a county for less than a hundred.

===One Day Internationals before 2007===
As a result of their second place in the 2005 ICC Trophy, Ireland qualified for the 2007 World Cup and gained official ODI status until 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edward Craig&quot;/&gt; Ireland's inaugural ODI was played in Belfast at the [[Civil Service Cricket Club]], [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]], on 13&amp;nbsp;June 2006 against England. It was the first time Ireland had played the full England side. Tickets sold well for the game, with a full house of 7,500&amp;nbsp;attendees.

==Governing body==
{{main|Irish Cricket Union}}
The [[Irish Cricket Union]] (ICU)&amp;nbsp;â the governing body of Irish cricket&amp;nbsp;â was officially founded in 1923, although its predecessor had been active since 1890.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo history&quot;/&gt; [[File:Cricket Ireland flag.svg|250px|right|thumb|Flag of the Irish team]]In common with a number of other Ireland sporting governing bodies, the Union was formed to represent cricket throughout the island of Ireland, rather than just the [[Republic of Ireland]] and in common with its counterparts for [[Irish Rugby Football Union|rugby union]] and [[Irish Hockey Association|field hockey]], the Union therefore does not use the [[Irish tricolor]], but instead employs its own flag, which is used by such bodies as the [[International Cricket Council]] to represent the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/IRISHCRICKET/index.shtml Official Cricket Ireland site showing use of flag]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/icc_members/overview.php International Cricket Council official site]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it announced major changes to bring it in-line with the main cricket governing bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;major changes&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ireland/content/story/314284.html |title=ICU sets out major changes  |publisher=Cicinfo.com |date=8&amp;nbsp;October 2007}} Retrieved on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the World Cup, Irish cricket experienced a dip in success with poor results in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy as many players were unavailable.

Warren Deutrom, the chief executive of the ICU, has stated that it wants to &quot;seek actively to place Irish players into top-level cricket, by developing relationships with [especially] county cricket which will incorporate appropriate player release for Irish international duty, and feeder systems for developing Irish cricketers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;major changes&quot;/&gt; The reorganised ICU sought closer links with the English county teams, encourage the development of age group cricket, and to introduce a professional element into the Irish game.

Deutrom has commented that it is difficult for Ireland to become a [[Test cricket|Test team]] as Ireland have not received guidance on how it can be achieved. In June 2009, shortly before the start of the 2009 ICC Twenty20 World Cup in which Ireland defeated Bangladesh to progress to the second round of the tournament, he said &quot;Ireland has proved itself head and shoulders above the rest of the associate nations. Yet we are bumping up against a glass ceiling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/8081711.stm |title='Glass ceiling' frustrates Irish |publisher=BBC Online |date=3 June 2009 | accessdate=5 January 2010}} Retrieved on 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
