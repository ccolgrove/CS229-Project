'''Paint Shop Pro''' ('''PSP''') is a [[raster graphics editor]] and, later in the series, a [[vector graphics editor]] for computers running the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]] that was originally published by [[Minneapolis]]-based [[Jasc Software]]. In October 2004, [[Corel|Corel Corporation]] purchased Jasc Software and the distribution rights to Paint Shop Pro. PSP functionality can be extended by [[Photoshop plugins|Photoshop-compatible plugins]].

==History==
Originally called simply '''Paint Shop''', the first version, 1.0, was a basic picture converter between BMP, GIF and PCX formats, released in August 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cd.textfiles.com/nightowl/pdsi005/012B/ |title=See &quot;Paint Shop v1.0 - for Windows 3.0&quot; |publisher=Cd.textfiles.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paint Shop was originally distributed as [[shareware]] and is still available at many download sites (4.12 being a popular version). Newer versions are only commercially available. 

On November 28, 2007, Corel announced that the office in [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]], where Paint Shop Pro was created, would be shut down, with development moving to offices in California and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/11902066.html |title=Corel to close Eden Prairie office |publisher=Startribune.com |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picture tubes==
Picture tubes are graphic images with no background. They are often used as a starting point for complex images; that is, they are combined with other image elements to produce a final work. Tubes can also be regarded as graphic brushes based on a pre-created image; this was their original use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Bednarek |url=http://www.irt.org/software/sw003/index.htm |title=Discussion of introduction of tubes to JASC Paint Shop Pro 5 |publisher=Irt.org |date=2011-08-27 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of leaving a trace of color on the canvas, they would leave a trail of images.  Popular tube subjects include alphabets, human (also known as [[dollz]]), animal and toy figures, flowers, love messages and seasonal symbols.

The tube system originated with PSP Pro version 5. Native tube files may be in .tub, .psp, .pspimage, and .psptube formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/paintshoptutorialstubes/Paint_Shop_Pro_Picture_Tubes_Tutorials_and_Tips.htm |title=Discussion of Paint Shop Pro Picture Tubes, tutorials and tips |publisher=Graphicssoft.about.com |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XnView]], [[IrfanView]], and [[TubeEx]] are separate graphics programs that can open tube files (.tub) and save them as .png files for use in other programs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==License Management Software==
Versions XI, X2, X3 and X4 install a third party program named PSIService.exe, a [[Windows service]] called ProtexisLicensing. Written by [[Protexis]], this runs in the background and collects licensing information. This program communicates with a remote host.  Manually disabling the Protexis Licensing service may cause Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo to cease functioning.

==Criticisms==
===Pricing policy===
There have been criticisms of Corel's pricing policy that pitches international versions at higher prices than those charged in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burley |first=Ian |url=http://dpnow.com/4320.html |title=Features - Critical Focus: Software pricing - it's an international rip-off - Digital Photography Now |publisher=Dpnow.com |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy work-around for international customers is to purchase their software from Corel's online store. While on the site, changing your regional preference to United States changes the pricing to those charged in the US. Some software can be acquired almost 50% cheaper this way.
As of September 7th, 2011, Suggested Retail Prices of PaintShop Pro X4 on Corel eStores are respectively $79.99, â¬69.99 and â¤59.99.
