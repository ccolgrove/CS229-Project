'''Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG)''', is a [[reverse proxy]] and [[VPN]] solution that provides secure remote access to corporate networks for remote employees and business partners. It is part of the [[Microsoft Forefront]] offering. It incorporates various remote access technologies such as reverse proxy, VPN (especially [[VPN#Security mechanisms|SSL VPN]]), [[DirectAccess]] and [[Remote Desktop Services]]. UAG was released in 2010, and is the successor for '''Microsoft Intelligent Application Gateway (IAG)''' which was released in 2007. UAG also integrates DirectAccess which is a VPN-Like technology that provides seamless remote access to an organizational network via [[IPv6]] and [[IPSec]].

== History ==
Unified Access Gateway was originally developed by a startup company named ''Whale Communications'' in [[Rosh HaAyin]], [[Israel]]. One of the challenges it tried to solve in the nineties was to develop a remote access solution based on a VPN mechanism but without direct network access from the remote client to the [[Local area network|corporate network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This type of solution was specifically required by the Israeli military and government, to meet national information security standards.

The technology developed was called the [[Air Gap]] and the communication between the external network and internal network was managed by two separate 1U rack-mount servers linked together by a memory bank accessed through a [[SCSI]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 18 May 2006, Microsoft announced that it would be acquiring Whale Communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this acquisition, the product was renamed Microsoft Intelligent Application Gateway Server 2007. With this version, the SCSI-based Air Gap was dropped, and the product was unified as a single-server appliance. Instead of using the Air Gap as the security barrier, IAG used Microsoft's [[ISA Server]] firewall product. IAG was offered to the public as a pre-installed appliance by [[Celestix Networks]], [[IVO Networks]], [[Portcullis Systems]] and [[nAppliance]]. In 2009, with the release of Service Pack 2 for IAG, the product was also offered directly to the public from Microsoft in the form of a virtual appliance - a pre-installed VHD which could be run on [[Hyper-V]] or [[VMWare]].

In April 2008, Microsoft announced that the next generation of IAG will be named Forefront Unified Access Gateway. The product was released on 24 December 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010-released&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Technical overview==
&lt;!--{{Out of date|date=July 2010}} Updated and verified on Dec 3rd 2010 by Ben Ari, author of the first and only book on UAG--&gt;
Microsoft UAG provides secure socket layer (SSL) virtual private network (VPN), a Web application firewall, and endpoint security management (for compliance and security) that enable access control, authorization, and content inspection for a wide variety of line-of-business applications.

Included are customized granular access policy and security capabilities for Microsoft Exchange Server (2003, 2007 and 2010), Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server (2003, 2007 and 2010), Microsoft Terminal Services and Citrix Presentation Server. The product is highly customizable, and almost any application can be published With UAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Out of the box UAG Server is able to work with many authentication vendors such as [[RSA Security]], [[Vasco]], [[GrIDsure]], Swivel, ActivCard and [[Aladdin]]. It also works with numerous authentication systems and protocols such as Active Directory, RADIUS, LDAP, NTLM, Lotus Domino, PKI and TACACS+. Possible customizations include single-sign-on (SSO), as well as look-and-feel dynamic customization. With the current release of UAG with Update 2, the product also offers support for many third-party systems such as [[Linux]], [[Macintosh]] and [[iPhone]]. The product also supports [[Mozilla Firefox]].

UAG performs particularly well in providing a portal for web applications, such as [[web-based email]] and [[intranet]]s, but it also provides full SSL VPN network access using either [[ActiveX]] (when using Internet Explorer) or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] components (when using Firefox, [[Opera]], non Windows client such as [[Red Hat]] or Mac OS). These components can also perform end-point compliance checks before allowing access, to test for attributes on the PC such as domain name, [[antivirus]] definitions date or running processes.

The inclusion of [[DirectAccess]] with UAG has been a big influence on its success, as DirectAccess provides a very seamless VPN-like integration and is in high-demand by many organizations. DirectAccess is part of Windows, but UAG provides a very user-friendly configuration interface for it, making it easier to configure for administrators. UAG also adds two additional components - [[DNS64]] and [[NAT64]], which make deploying DirectAccess in an existing network easier, without the need to deploy [[IPv6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The product is sold in appliance form, from vendors such as [[IVO Networks]], [[Portcullis Systems]], [[Celestix Networks]], and [[nAppliance]]. It is also offered as an installable DVD. The product can be installed on [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft UAG hardware partners&quot;&gt;{{cite web
