'''RTP1''' is the first [[television network]] of [[RÃ¡dio e TelevisÃ£o de Portugal]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[public broadcasting]] corporation. The first television network (treated by many as a station) ever launched in Portugal, RTP1 was launched in [[1957]] as RTP (and today it is still sometimes marketed as such), and also having a brief period while it was known and marketed as '''Canal 1''' (Channel 1). It is one of the most watched television networks in the country. The network became a 24-hours service in [[2002]].

RTP1 has a generalist programming, composed mainly of news and talk shows, sports, factual, national and international fiction, such as films and TV series. Unlike sister channel [[RTP2]], RTP1 broadcasts commercial advertising, which, along with government grants, finances the network.

==Identity==
[[File:RTP1 old logo.svg|100px|thumb|left|RTP1's former logo (2002-2004)]]
[[File:Rtp1ident2009.jpg|200px|thumb|right|RTP1 current ident layout, in use since 7.1.2009]]
RTP1's logotype has been changed various times over the years. In 1990, RTP1 was renamed TV1, later Canal 1, and a permanent, opaque and coloured [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] &quot;'''CÂ·1'''&quot; was introduced in the upper-right corner of the channel until September 1991, when a smaller &quot;'''CÂ·1'''&quot; was placed on the upper-left corner. The logotype consisted of blue, [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] characters with a golden [[armillary sphere]] inside the &quot;C&quot;. Most Canal 1 idents were [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], accompanied by a voice-over chorus singing the name of the channel, and featured several motifs in a short space of time, such as British and American skylines, playing cards, roulettes, riots and astronauts.
On April 29, 1996, Canal 1 was again renamed RTP1, and the new logotype consisted of a white &quot;1&quot; in a light blue background, with the letters &quot;RTP&quot; underneath in white, overlaid in a dark blue background. RTP1 idents consisted mainly on a tridimensional representation of the logo in a blue moving curtain background, with the channel tune played in piano and organ as the background music.

In January 2002, RTP1's logo changed again, and the idents featured it forming from snow, fire and sand.

Since the logo was again changed on March 7, 2004, RTP1 has only used one ident at any period of time, instead of having a collection of idents (sister channel RTP2, for example).

On January 7, 2009, the channel changed its identity. Now it is a variety of mini-films reproduced inside the RTP logo on a black background.
