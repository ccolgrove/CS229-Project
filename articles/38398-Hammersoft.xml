'''''Stargate SG-1''''' (often abbreviated as '''''SG-1''''') is a [[Canadian science fiction television|Canadian]]-[[U.S. television science fiction|American]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] and [[military science fiction]] [[television series]] and part of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s [[Stargate|''Stargate'' franchise]]. The show, created by [[Brad Wright]] and [[Jonathan Glassner]], is based on the 1994 feature film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' by [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]]. The television series was filmed in and around the city of [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]]. In  the United States, [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] broadcast the first five seasons, from 1997 to 2002, and then the series moved to the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] for its last five seasons, from 2002 to 2007. The final episode premiered on [[Sky1]] in the United Kingdom on March 13, 2007, three months before its United States premiere. With ten seasons and 214 episodes, ''Stargate SG-1'' surpassed ''[[The X-Files]]'' in 2007 as the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, before being surpassed by ''[[Smallville]]'' in 2011 with 218 episodes in ten seasons.

The story of ''Stargate SG-1'' begins about a year after the events of the feature film, when the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] learns that a network of ancient alien devices called [[Stargate (device)|Stargates]] connects a vast multitude of planets within our Milky Way galaxy, facilitating near-instantaneous interstellar travel.  Later episodes reveal that this network is capable of spanning not just planets within the Milky Way, but with sufficient power, can provide intergalactic travel as well.  ''Stargate SG-1'' chronicles the adventures of the elite [[special forces|special force]] [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] squad, SG-1, the flagship team of over two dozen teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend Earth against alien threats such as the [[Goa'uld]], [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]], and later the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]. The composition of the SG-1 team is stable in the show's first five seasons but changes several times in the remaining seasons. The series expands upon many Ancient Earth mythologies such as [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian mythology]], [[Norse mythology]], and [[Arthurian legend]]. The 2008 [[direct-to-DVD]] films ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' and ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'' continue the adventures of SG-1.

The series was a ratings success for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and the Sci Fi Channel, and was particularly popular in Europe and Australia. Although it received little critical response, ''Stargate SG-1'' was honored with numerous awards and award nominations in its ten-season run. It also spawned the animated television series ''[[Stargate Infinity]]'' in 2002, the live-action spin-off TV series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' in 2004, and the live-action TV series ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' in 2009 which ended in the Spring of 2011. Merchandise for ''Stargate SG-1'' includes games and toys, print media, and an original audio series.

==Series overview==
{{Main|List of Stargate SG-1 episodes|Mythology of Stargate|Stargate Program}}
''Stargate SG-1'' resumes the plot of the [[Stargate (film)|original feature film]] and follows the present-day adventures of SG-1, a military team from Earth. SG-1 and two dozen other SG teams venture to distant planets using a fictional alien portal known as a [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]], which in the series is housed in a top-secret [[United States Air Force]] military base known as [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) underneath [[Cheyenne Mountain]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the [[Goa'uld]], a snake-like parasitic alien race that takes humans as unwilling hosts. As explained in the series' backstory, the Goa'uld transported human slaves from [[Earth]] to other habitable planets across the galaxy thousands of years ago and now pose as gods of Ancient Earth mythologies, particularly Egyptian mythology. SG-1 eventually learns that highly evolved human-like beings, known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier, before they used their extraordinary powers to [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascend to a higher plane of existence]], after which they pledged to not interfere in the lives of other species. The [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], who belong to the same race of ascended beings as the Ancients but who use their powers to subjugate other species, forcing them to worship the Ori and to believe a doctrine of religious fundamentalism, assume the role of the main antagonists in seasons 9 and 10.

===Goa'uld arc===
[[File:NORADNorth-Portal.jpg|thumb|The [[Cheyenne Mountain complex]] in Colorado, United States is home to Earth's fictional Stargate Command in the ''Stargate'' universe.]]{{Main|Goa'uld}}
The pilot episode, set two years after the events of the original feature film, introduces the Goa'uld [[System Lord]] and main villain [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] ([[Peter Williams (actor)|Peter Williams]]) as he attacks Earth's mothballed SGC military base through the Stargate and kidnaps a soldier. The SGC is brought back into action when the Stargate is revealed to be part of an interplanetary network connecting countless planets. SG teams are created to help defend Earth against the Goa'uld, who have interstellar pyramid warships and vast armies of [[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]] (hereditary slaves and human incubators to the Goa'uld) at their disposal. Earth's flagship team SG-1, which includes Apophis's defected First Prime (lead Jaffa soldier) [[Teal'c]], initiates several alliances with other cultures in the galaxy, such as the Goa'uld-like but truly symbiotic [[Tok'ra]], the advanced human [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]], the pacifist [[Nox (Stargate)|Nox]], the benevolent [[Roswell UFO Incident|Roswell]]-alien [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]], and remnants of the powerful Ancients. Another alien threat arises in the season 3 finale in the form of sentient machines called [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]]. Meanwhile, rogue agents of a shadowy intelligence agency on Earth, the [[NID (Stargate)|NID]], repeatedly attempt to take control of the Stargate and other alien technology. Despite Apophis's death in the beginning of season 5, the [[Goa'uld Empire]] remains a major foe in ''Stargate SG-1'' until the end of season 8. The only influential Goa'uld in the last two seasons of ''Stargate SG-1'' is the System Lord [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] ([[Cliff Simon]]), who is defeated in the direct-to-DVD film ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]''.

===Anubis arc===
{{Main|Anubis (Stargate)}}
After Apophis's defeat in the season 5 premiere, the half-Ascended Goa'uld System Lord [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] ([[David Palffy]]) becomes the main villain. He possesses much knowledge of the Ancients and their technology. While Earth builds its first interstellar spaceship (the ''[[Prometheus (Stargate)|Prometheus]]'') in seasons 6 and 7, Anubis creates an army of almost invincible [[Kull Warrior]]s and wipes out many of his fellow System Lords. In the season 7 finale, SG-1 discovers a powerful weapon in an Ancient outpost in Antarctica that annihilates Anubis's entire fleet and also sets the stage for the spin-off series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. Ba'al subsumes much of Anubis's power in season 8, while Anubis secretly regains control of his forces. Human-form Replicators begin to conquer the System Lords, but SG-1 finds and adjusts an Ancient weapon to destroy all Replicators throughout the galaxy. The end of season 8 reveals the benevolent Ascended Being [[Oma Desala]] ([[Mel Harris]]) to be responsible for Anubis's original ascension. When she engages Anubis in an eternal stalemated battle on the Ascended plane to prevent his acting on the mortal plane, the Replicators and most System Lords have already been annihilated, and the Jaffa win their freedom from Goa'uld rule.

===Ori arc===
{{Main|Ori (Stargate)}}
The original SG-1 team disbands after the events of season 8, but slowly reunites under new team leader [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Col. Cameron Mitchell]] after the SGC inadvertently draws the attention of the Ancient-like Ori from another galaxy to the existence of sentient life in the Milky Way. While the Ori send enhanced human beings named [[Prior (Stargate)|Priors]] to the Milky Way to spread a religion that will augment the Ori's power, Ba'al and some minor Goa'uld infiltrate Earth through the [[Trust (Stargate)|Trust]] (a coalition of rogue NID operatives) to rebuild their power. At the end of season 9, the Ori begin an evangelistic crusade with their warships and effortlessly wipe out the combined fleet of Earth and its allies. The leader of the Ori, [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]] ([[Morena Baccarin]]), is introduced in the premiere of season 10. SG-1 searches for the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]], an Ancient weapon that might defeat the Ori, while Ba'al and his clones attempt to find the weapon for their own purposes. With the help of the powerful Ancient [[Merlin (Stargate)|Merlin]] ([[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]]), SG-1 finds the construction plans of the Sangraal and sends a working version to the Ori galaxy. Shortly thereafter, Adria ascends. The direct-to-DVD film ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' ends the Ori arc.

He takes charge of Stargate Command (SGC) after his promotion to Brigadier General at the beginning of season 8.

O'Neill is reassigned to Washington, D.C. before season 9 and receives a promotion to Major General. He appears in a recurring role in seasons 9 and 10 of ''Stargate SG-1'', as well as in ''Stargate: Continuum'' and in seasons 1 and 3 of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.

O'Neill in the pilot episode. Following her promotion to Major in season 3, she is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel early in season 8 and assumes command of SG-1. The series repeatedly alludes to romantic feelings between Carter and O'Neill, but the relationship is never shown as consummated outside of alternate reality scenarios. Carter assists Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell in seasons 9 and 10. After her appearance in ''Stargate: The Ark of Truth'', she is promoted to Colonel and becomes the new commander of the Atlantis expedition in season 4 of ''Stargate Atlantis'', before joining SG-1 again for ''Stargate: Continuum''.

He joins SG-1 after the pilot episode in hopes of leading his race to freedom. Despite succeeding in this goal at the end of season 8, he remains a member of SG-1 until the end of the series. He also appears in both direct-to-DVD films and in season 4 of ''Stargate Atlantis'' as the commander of the starship George Hammond.
* [[Don S. Davis]] as [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]] (seasons 1â7 main, seasons 8â10 recurring) &amp;nbsp;â A United States Air Force Major General (later Lieutenant General) who commands Stargate Command in the first seven seasons.

===Conception===
[[File:Brad Wright Comic Con 2008.jpg|thumb|Brad Wright created ''Stargate SG-1'' with Jonathan Glassner.]]
{{main|Children of the Gods|Stargate SG-1 (season 1)}}
[[Brad Wright]] and [[Jonathan Glassner]] had worked together on the [[MGM]] television series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' since 1995. Upon hearing of MGM's plan to create a television spin-off series of the feature film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', Wright and Glassner independently and unbeknownst to each other approached MGM and proposed their concept for the television series. MGM president John Symes greenlit the project on the condition that Wright and Glassner work together as executive producers of the new show.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]]; [[Jonathan Glassner|Glassner, Jonathan]]; [[Michael Greenburg|Greenburg, Michael]]; [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson, Richard Dean]]; [[Michael Shanks|Shanks, Michael]] |date=2001 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 3 â Timeline To The Future â Part 1: Legacy Of The Gate | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was named ''Stargate SG-1'' after Wright flightily agreed to Symes's pitch question of whether the team should be called &quot;SG-1&quot;. MGM released posters titled ''Stargate SG-1'' within the next week without the knowledge of Wright or Glassner.&lt;ref name=dvdprofilewright&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]] |date=2006 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 9 â Profile On: Brad Wright | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Symes approached [[Michael Greenburg]] and [[Richard Dean Anderson]] of ''[[MacGyver]]'' fame.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy/&gt; Anderson agreed to become involved with the project if his character [[Jack O'Neill]] was allowed significantly more comedic leeway than [[Kurt Russell]]'s character in the feature film. He also requested ''Stargate SG-1'' to be more of an ensemble show, so that he would not be carrying the plot alone as on ''MacGyver''.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_4&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Richard Dean Anderson â Mr Anderson â Colonel O'Neill |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 46 |pages=4â9 |month=July |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American subscription channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] made a two-season commitment for 44 episodes in 1996.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy/&gt; Principal photography began in Vancouver in February 1997.&lt;ref name=dvdproductiondesign/&gt;

===Casting and cast changes===
After Anderson accepted the part, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner reviewed several thousand taped auditions and invited approximately 25 promising actors to screen tests in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=dvdproducingstargate&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]] and [[Jonathan Glassner|Glassner, Jonathan]] |date=2001 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 3 â Producing Stargate | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge are said to have gravitated towards each other during the casting process before they knew that they would ultimately be cast.&lt;ref name=dvdprofiledaniel&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Michael Shanks|Shanks, Michael]] |date=2001 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 3 â Profile On Daniel Jackson | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers found Judge the easiest to cast due to his muscular presence.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy/&gt; Shanks was cast because he did &quot;the perfect imitation of James Spader&quot;, according to Wright.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy/&gt; The producers knew Don S. Davis from his work as a stand-in and stunt-double for [[Dana Elcar]] in ''MacGyver'' and approached him to read for the role of George Hammond.&lt;ref name=dvdprofilehammond&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Don S.

Showtime's announcement to not renew ''Stargate SG-1'' after season 5 coincided with Michael Shanks's decision to leave the show due to concerns of being under-utilized,&lt;ref name=storm_61&gt;Storm 2005, pp. 61â63.&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] decided to continue the show and fill the void with a new character. Casting agents met Corin Nemec at the courtyard of MGM's [[Santa Monica]] offices by chance and offered him the role of Jonas Quinn.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_22&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Corin Nemec â Jonas Quinn |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 46 |pages=22â26 |month=July |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nemec's early appearances, beginning with the penultimate episode of season 5 &quot;[[Meridian (Stargate SG-1)|Meridian]]&quot;, evoked strong distrust by loyal fans,&lt;ref name=storm_61/&gt; Nemec was open to continue playing the character after season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_22 /&gt; However, the producers reached a new contract with Michael Shanks to return full time in season 7, leaving Nemec with a recurring role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2002-11/15/13.00.sfc |title=Stargate Cast Returning |publisher=scifi.com |date=November 15, 2002 |accessdate=2008-11-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060325043143/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2002-11/15/13.00.sfc|archivedate=March 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Don S.

Due to prior engagements, [[Claudia Black]] of ''[[Farscape]]'' fame could not accept the offers to guest-star on ''Stargate SG-1'' until the season 8 episode &quot;[[Prometheus Unbound (Stargate SG-1)|Prometheus Unbound]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=sg_mag_april07&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Vala Unveiled |journal=Official Stargate Magazine |pages=20â21 |date=April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers liked the on-screen chemistry between Black's Vala Mal Doran and Shanks's Daniel so much that they re-introduced her in a six-episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of Amanda Tapping at the beginning of season 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudolph 41&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rudolph |first=Illeane |title=Black Is Back |journal=[[TV Guide]] |issue=February 27 â March 5, 2006 |pages=41 |date=February 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Richard Dean Anderson left the show to spend more time with his daughter (his schedule had been reduced incrementally since season 6).&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 2003, p. 66, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the leading man was filled with [[Ben Browder]] (also of ''Farscape'' fame), who had met with the ''Stargate'' producers as soon as the introduction of new main characters for season 9 was discussed.&lt;ref name=tvzones64_12&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Ben Browder â Work in progress |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 64 |pages=12â16 |date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers had met him during sci-fi conventions and had previously discussed casting him in other ''Stargate'' roles.&lt;ref name=making_901&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi |url=http://www.gateworld.net/sg1/s9/making/901.shtml |title=In the Making â Avalon Part 1 |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date = July 2005|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers approached [[Emmy Award]]-winning actor Beau Bridges directly to play the role of Hank Landry.&lt;ref name=tvzones64_50&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Beau Bridges â Helping Bridge the Gap |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 64 |pages=50â52 |date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Black's guest appearances were so popular with the cast, crew and audience&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudolph 41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw_i_claudia&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/i_claudia.shtml |title=I, Claudia â GateWorld talks with Claudia Black |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=July | year=2006 |accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the actress returned for the last two season 9 episodes (with her pregnancy worked into the plot), and she joined the cast full time in season 10.

John Smith (seasons 4â10), and the writer team [[Joseph Mallozzi]] &amp; [[Paul Mullie]] (seasons 7â10).

Although ''Stargate SG-1'' employed freelance writers, most of the 214 ''Stargate SG-1'' episodes were written by Brad Wright (seasons 1â10), Jonathan Glassner (seasons 1â3), [[Katharyn Powers]] (seasons 1â6), Robert C. Cooper (seasons 1â10), [[Peter DeLuise]] (seasons 4â8), Joseph Mallozzi &amp; Paul Mullie (seasons 4â10), [[Damian Kindler]] (seasons 6â10), and [[Alan McCullough]] (seasons 9â10). [[Martin Wood]] and Peter DeLuise directed the most episodes, with 46 episodes (seasons 1â10) and 57 episodes (seasons 2â10), respectively. Wood and DeLuise regularly made cameo appearances in their episodes and notably played the [[show-within-a-show]] directors in the cameo-heavy milestone episodes &quot;[[Wormhole X-Treme!]]&quot; and &quot;[[200 (Stargate SG-1)|200]]&quot;. [[Andy Mikita]] had been an assistant director since the pilot episode and directed 29 episodes from season 3 through 10. ''SG-1'' director of photography [[Peter Woeste]] and camera operator [[William Waring]] directed 13 episodes each. Most staff writers and staff directors held producer positions. Several cast members contributed story ideas and directed ''SG-1'' episodes.

===Filming===
[[File:Bridge Studios.jpg|thumb|''Stargate SG-1'' was filmed at The Bridge Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.]]

The season 3 episode &quot;[[Crystal Skull (Stargate SG-1)|Crystal Skull]]&quot; was the first episode to be filmed on a virtual set.&lt;ref name=dvdsecrets/&gt;

The main setting of ''Stargate SG-1'', the fictional [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) at the (real) [[Cheyenne Mountain|Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station]] near [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], was filmed at stage 5 of The Bridge Studios.&lt;ref name=gw_bridge/&gt; Martin Wood filmed half a dozen stock shots of the real Cheyenne Mountain complex for use in the series approximately ten days before the premiere of the pilot episode.

The first seven seasons had 22 episodes each, which was reduced to 20 episodes for the last three seasons. Episodes of the first seasons were filmed over a period of 7.5 working days, which decreased to a targeted average of six working days in the last seasons.&lt;ref name=ac_803/&gt; All episodes were filmed in [[16:9]] wide-screen, although ''Stargate SG-1'' was broadcast in [[4:3]] aspect ratio in its first years.&lt;ref name=gw_rainmaker&gt;{{cite video |people=Woloshyn, Bruce |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/a_day_at_rainmaker.shtml |title=&quot;A Day At Rainmaker â GateWorld talks with Bruce Woloshyn |time=13&amp;nbsp;min |date = February 2005|accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to the broadcast of episodes in the wider 16:9 ratio gave directors more freedom in frame composition.&lt;ref name=ac_1019&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Will Waring|Waring, Will]] and [[Alan McCullough|McCullough, Alan]] |date=2007 |title=Stargate SG-1 Season 10 â Audio Commentary for &quot;[[Dominion (Stargate SG-1)|Dominion]]&quot; |time=7 &amp;nbsp;min |medium= DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three seasons of ''Stargate SG-1'' were filmed on [[16 mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm film]], notwithstanding scenes involving visual effects that had always been shot on [[35 mm film|35&amp;nbsp;mm film]] for various technical reasons.

===Production design===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stargate SG-1 Gates.png|thumb|Since the original Stargate prop from the feature film had severely deteriorated, a new prop was designed for the TV series.]] --&gt;
The art department generated all of the concepts and drawing for the prop department, the set decoration department, the construction department, the paint department, and the model shop. They also collaborated with the visual effects department.&lt;ref name=dvdsecrets&gt;{{cite video |people=Hudolin, Richard; [[Michael Greenburg|Greenburg, Michael]]; Smith, N. John |date=2001 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 3 â Timeline To The Future â Part 2: Secrets Of The Gate | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' employed about 200 Canadian union workers, although that number could exceed 300 when new sets were built.&lt;ref name=vs_success/&gt; Lead production designer Richard Hudolin joined the project in October 1996. Bridget McGuire, ''SG-1''{{'}}s art director since the pilot episode, took over as lead production designer in season 6.&lt;ref name=dvdproductiondesign/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 2003, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudolin flew to Los Angeles in 1996 to gather material from the feature film as reference and found the original Stargate [[Theatrical property|prop]] stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely deteriorated, he was able to take a detailed mold for ''Stargate SG-1'' production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, to lock the chevrons, and to be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy/&gt;&lt;ref name=dvdproductiondesign/&gt; Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper,&lt;ref name=dvdproductiondesign/&gt; a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.&lt;ref name=ac_403/&gt;

===Make-up and costumes===
Most ''SG-1'' main characters are US [[airmen]] and wear authentic [[United States Air Force]] uniforms. During missions, the members of the SG-1 team normally wear olive green [[Battle Dress Uniform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/sci-files/cinema/stargate/index.shtml |title=Science Fiction in the Cinema â Stargate |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |date=2006 |time=29&amp;nbsp;min}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis received a regular military-style haircut on set.&lt;ref name=tvzones58_28&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Christopher Judge â Judge For Yourself |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 58 |pages=28â32 |month=July |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 2003, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Tapping had her hair comparably short until the filming of the direct-to-DVD films. Playing a civilian, Michael Shanks adopted James Spader's hairstyle from the feature film but cut it short for the season 2 finale and subsequent seasons.&lt;!--Hair of AT and MS obvious--&gt; The Jaffa alien Teal'c (Christopher Judge) was the only main character whose look required more than basic make-up. His Egyptian look was reflective of the Goa'uld Ra from the feature film and was complemented with a forehead symbol and a gold skin tone, although his make-up process was simplified over the years.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_62&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Jan Newman â Born With It â Make-up |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 46 |pages=62â65 |month=July |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge shaved his head at home each day until the producers allowed him to let his hair grow in season 8.&lt;ref name=tvzones58_28/&gt; As a trained nurse, key make-up artist Jan Newman could make burns, cuts, bruises and the SG-1 team's other wounds look authentic.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_62/&gt;

For the look of aliens, the make-up department collaborated with prosthetics companies from Vancouver and Los Angeles, including Todd Masters. While the human origins of many alien races and human civilizations were left recognizable, the recurring [[Unas (Stargate)|Unas]] race required elaborate prosthetics and make-up work.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_62/&gt; To mirror the independent development of the fictional human civilizations after their displacement from Earth, the costume designers took elements of the respective Earth cultures, and combined them with modern fabrics, elaborate trims and chains that would give a historical yet otherworldly appearance.&lt;ref name=dvdcostumedesign&gt;{{cite video |people=McQuarrie, Christina |date=2001 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 3 â Costume Design: Christina McQuarrie | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The look of the Goa'uld such as Apophis was initially based on Ra in the feature film.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_62/&gt; For the design of the Ori and the Priors in season 9, the art department looked at Japanese and Samurai garments for costume design. Art director James Robbins found the face painting, scarification and burns of remote jungle tribes mystical, serving as inspiration for the face scarification of the Priors and the Doci. Early considerations of finger extensions and scarification on their hands were discarded as impracticable.&lt;ref name=tvzones64_24&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven |title=Stargate SG-1 Season 9 preview - Nine Lives |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 64 |pages=24â30; 44â48 56â60 |date=July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
''Stargate SG-1'' was one of the biggest employers in the Vancouver [[visual effects]] market,&lt;ref name=playback/&gt; spending $400,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest role was played by [[Rainmaker Digital Effects]],&lt;ref name=playback/&gt; whose senior digital compositing artist, Bruce Woloshyn, worked approximately 10 months a year in close collaboration with ''SG-1''{{'s}} visual effects supervisor/producer James Tichenor and visual effects supervisor Michelle Comens.&lt;ref name=gw_bruce/&gt; Many companies were hired to create the Stargate's water-like event horizon in the beginning, but Rainmaker eventually became the only company to create those visual effects.&lt;ref name=gw_rainmaker/&gt; Rainmaker's regular effects shots included the activation and use of the Stargate itself (with well over 300 event horizon shots in the first few years), the transport rings, and the blast shots of the staff weapons and zat guns. They created the visual effects for Goa'uld cargo ships and death gliders on a less regular basis.&lt;ref name=gw_bruce&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/bruce_woloshyn.shtml |title=GateWorld talks with Bruce Woloshyn |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=December |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
According to composer [[Joel Goldsmith]], ''Stargate SG-1'' had a traditional action-adventure score, &quot;with a sci-fi, fantasy flair&quot; that goes &quot;from comedy to drama to wondrous to suspense to heavy action to ethereal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117870437.html?categoryid=1329&amp;cs=1 |title=Sci-fi series: a musical odyssey |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=July 29, 2002 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had known Goldsmith since the second season of ''The Outer Limits'' before they approached him to work on the pilot episode of ''Stargate SG-1''. Goldsmith and [[David Arnold]], the composer of the original feature film score, discussed themes for a television adaptation. The main titles of ''Stargate SG-1'' were a medley of several themes from the feature film, although Goldsmith also wrote a unique end title for ''SG-1'' to establish the show as its own entity.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt; MGM eventually insisted on using Arnold's score in the pilot episode instead of Goldsmith's, but Brad Wright's 2009 direct-to-DVD recut of ''[[Children of the Gods]]'' uses Goldsmith's original score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sumner, Daren and Read, David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/breaking_the_ice_part_22.shtml |title=Breaking The Ice â GateWorld talks with Brad Wright (Part 2) |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=May |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each episode's score, Goldsmith simulated a real orchestra with a synthesizer palette of an eighty-piece symphony orchestra for budgetary reasons,&lt;ref name=joel/&gt; although he occasionally used two or three musicians for added orchestral authenticity.&lt;ref name=companion56_150_151/&gt; Goldsmith's long-time assistant Neal Acree started composing additional music for ''Stargate SG-1'' in season 8.&lt;ref name=gw_emotion/&gt; The amount of composed music varied between 12 and 33 minutes out of a 44-minute episode, with an average of around 22 to 26 minutes,&lt;ref name=gw_emotion&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/the_language_of_emotion.shtml |title=The Language of Emotion â GateWorld talks with Neal Acree |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=March |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the full symphonic score of ''SG-1'' more time-consuming to create than for general TV shows.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt; Since Goldsmith lived a thousand miles away from Vancouver, he and the producers discussed ideas over the phone&lt;ref name=companion56_150_151&gt;Gibson 2003, pp. 150â151.&lt;/ref&gt; and exchanged tapes via [[Federal Express]] for several years until the show switched to Internet file transfers.&lt;ref name=joel2&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/gate_harmonics_part_2_of_2.shtml |title=Gate Harmonics â GateWorld talks with Joel Goldsmith (Part 2) |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=November | year=2006 |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldsmith's reliance on Arnold's score decreased over the seasons when ''Stargate SG-1'' departed from the Goa'uld theme and introduced new characters and races. Goldsmith had a thematic approach to races and spaceships.&lt;ref name=joel&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/gate_harmonics_part_1_of_2.shtml |title=Gate Harmonics â GateWorld talks with Joel Goldsmith (Part 1) |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=November | year=2006 |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he wanted a mechanical, repetitive musical motif for the Replicators;&lt;ref name=joel2/&gt; Gothic, [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]], and Christian themes were the inspiration for the Ori motif.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt; The Ancient theme was deliberately carried over to ''Stargate Atlantis''. The end of &quot;Lost City&quot; has a basic melody that would become part of the main title of ''Atlantis'' per a suggestion by Goldsmith's assistant.&lt;ref name=joel2/&gt; Non-original music was rarely used on ''SG-1'', although Goldsmith chose the aria &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot; from [[Leoncavallo]]'s &quot;Pagliaccio&quot; for the season 3's &quot;[[Shades of Grey (Stargate SG-1)|Shades of Grey]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=gw_brad&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml |title=Interviews â Brad Wright |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=July |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Lily Frost]]'s song &quot;Who am I&quot; played in season 7's &quot;[[Fragile Balance (Stargate SG-1)|Fragile Balance]]&quot;, and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival|CCR]]'s song &quot;[[Have You Ever Seen the Rain?]]&quot; played in the series finale &quot;[[Unending]]&quot;.

===Opening title sequence===
[[File:King Tut Ankh Amun Golden Mask.jpg|thumb|The opening credits of ''Stargate SG-1''{{'s}} first five seasons show Ra's mask in close-up, as demonstrated here with [[Tutankhamun]]'s Golden mask.]]

''Stargate SG-1'' has had several opening title sequences, which are generally preceded by a [[teaser act]]. The credits are normally sixty seconds long. Richard Dean Anderson was the only ''SG-1'' actor whose name appeared before the show's title. Michael Shanks's name was moved near the end of the opening credits with the appendage &quot;as Daniel Jackson&quot; after his return to the show in season 7. Some DVD versions of early ''SG-1'' seasons have different opening credits than the television versions, as do the direct-to-DVD films. Composer Joel Goldsmith adapted [[David Arnold]]'s ''Stargate'' feature film score for ''SG-1''{{'}}s opening title theme, which remained the same during the run of ''Stargate SG-1'' and its direct-to-DVD films.

The first opening title sequence, used in the first five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over [[Ra]]'s mask. The ''Stargate SG-1'' producers had run out of time before the premiere of season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film.&lt;ref name=ac_402/&gt; [[Ra]]'s mask had been created in the feature film's model shop and had originally been filmed with a [[motion control photography|motion-control camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Dean Devlin|Devlin, Dean]] and [[Roland Emmerich|Emmerich, Roland]] |date=2001 |title=Audio Commentary for [[Stargate (film)|Stargate]] |medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly because [[Ra]]'s mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the show's move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for seasons 1-5.

The opening title sequence of the first two season 6 episodes shows a turning Stargate, for which a [[Frazier lens]] was put as close as 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch (3&amp;nbsp;mm) to the Stargate prop.&lt;ref name=ac_610/&gt; The opening credits of the following episodes intercut this material with live-action shots of the characters from previous seasons and ended with the SG-1 team stepping through the Stargate.

The opening credits of season 9 intercut shots of the Stargate with action sequences similar to the previous opening credits, although the Stargate was visibly computer-generated.

The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) cooperated closely with the ''Stargate SG-1'' producers. Before the beginning of the series, the USAF granted production access to the Cheyenne Mountain complex to film stock shots. They also read every script for mistakes and provided help with plausible background stories for all characters, ribbons, uniform regulations, hair advice, plotlines, and military relationships.&lt;ref name=dvdbeyond/&gt; The USAF flew up several [[T-38 Talon]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] and [[F-16]] fighter jets to Vancouver for various episodes and direct-to-DVD films.&lt;ref name=comiccon/&gt;&lt;ref name=tvzones46_66/&gt;&lt;ref name=ac_910/&gt; Many of the extras portraying USAF personnel were real USAF personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;air force press release&quot;/&gt;

Two successive [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chiefs of Staff of the USAF]], Generals [[Michael E. Ryan]] and [[John P. Jumper]], appeared as themselves in season 4's &quot;[[Prodigy (Stargate SG-1)|Prodigy]]&quot; and season 7's &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, respectively. General Jumper's second scheduled appearance in season 9's &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman]]&quot; was cancelled due to ongoing conflicts in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref name=ac_910&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Andy Mikita|Mikita, Andy]] and [[Damian Kindler|Kindler, Damian]] |date=2006 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 9 â Audio Commentary for &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman|The Fourth Horseman (Part 1)]]&quot; |medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Air Force Association]] recognized Richard Dean Anderson at its 57th annual dinner on September 14, 2004 for his work as actor and executive producer of the show, and for the show's positive depiction of the Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;air force press release&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Thar |first=Doug |publisher=Air Force Link |url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?storyID=123008593 |title=Air Force to honor actor, producer |date=September 9, 2004 |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stargate SG-1'' also received support from the United States and other international navies. Several scenes of season 4's &quot;[[Small Victories]]&quot; were filmed aboard and outside of a Russian [[Foxtrot class submarine|''Foxtrot''-class submarine]], which had been brought from [[Vladivostok]] to Vancouver.&lt;ref name=dvdproductiondesign/&gt; The [[United States Navy]] invited the cast and producers to film aboard the nuclear submarine [[USS Alexandria (SSN-757)|USS ''Alexandria'']] (SSN-757) and at their [[Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station]] in the [[Arctic]] for ''Stargate: Continuum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://stargate.mgm.com/news_detail.php?id=5 |title=SG-1 headed to the Arctic |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=[[MGM]] |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and allusions==
{{Main|Mythology of Stargate}}
[[File:La Tombe de Horemheb cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Many ''SG-1'' stories are built around Egyptian gods, such as (from left to right) Osiris, Anubis and Horus.]]
''Stargate SG-1'' takes place in a [[military science fiction]] environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy (the [[Goa'uld]]). However, it links alien races with well-known Earth mythologies, by use of the central Stargate device. Near-instantaneous interplanetary travel allows quick narrative shifts between the politics on Earth and the realities of fighting an interstellar war.&lt;ref&gt;Beeler 2008, pp. 267â269.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' gradually evolves the basic premise of the ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film into its own unique mythological superstructure,&lt;ref name=beeler_intro&gt;Beeler and Dickson 2005. &quot;Introduction&quot;, pp. 1â5.&lt;/ref&gt; expanding upon [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian mythology]] (notably the gods [[Apep]]/Apophis and [[Anubis]] as Goa'uld villains), [[Norse mythology]] (notably the god [[Thor]] as an [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard ally]]), and [[Arthurian legend]] (notably [[Merlin]] as an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient ally]] against the god-like [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]]), among others. ''SG-1'' introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members.&lt;ref&gt;Beeler 2008, pp. 273â277.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the show's extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered ''SG-1'' ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on the camaraderie among the SG-1 members.&lt;ref name=booker_181&gt;Booker 2004, pp. 181â182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The producers embraced humor and wanted ''SG-1'' to be a fun show that did not take itself too seriously.&lt;ref name=vs_success/&gt; Brad Wright regarded ''SG-1'' as a family show with adequate violence as opposed to random or gratuitous violence.&lt;ref name=gw_specialpilot/&gt; Christopher Judge did not consider ''SG-1'' as a &quot;message show by any stretch of the imagination, but occasionally there are messages there&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gbison 2003, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Aimed at a popular audience, ''Stargate SG-1'' emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referencing [[popular culture]], like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' had done before.&lt;ref name=hipple&gt;Hipple, Dave, &quot;Stargate SG-1: Self-possessed Science Fiction&quot;. In Beeler and Dickson 2005, p. 27â28.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Glassner had written ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' references into his own scripts since the first season, which the other writers imitated after Richard Dean Anderson began referencing the film on his own.&lt;ref name=dvduniverse&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Jonathan Glassner|Glassner, Jonathan]] |date=2002 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 4 â The Stargate Universe | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill references Richard Dean Anderson's favorite television series, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', throughout the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2005/06/anderson_to_guest_star_on_ithe_s.shtml |title=Anderson to guest star on The Simpsons |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=June 20, 2005 |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SG-1'' makes meta-textual references to the process of writing and filming a science fiction TV series in several episodes&lt;ref&gt;Beeler 2008, pp. 277-278.&lt;/ref&gt; and alludes to the main actors' previous TV roles in the pilot episode (Carter: &quot;It took us fifteen years and three supercomputers to [[MacGyver]] a system for the gate on Earth&quot;) and in a ''[[Farscape]]'' vignette in the milestone episode &quot;[[200 (Stargate SG-1)|200]]&quot;.

===Showtime and US syndication (1997â2002)===
The American subscription channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] ordered the first two seasons of ''Stargate SG-1'' with 44 episodes total in 1996.&lt;ref name=dvdlegacy/&gt; The two-hour pilot episode received Showtime's highest-ever ratings for a series premiere with an audience of approximately 1.5 million households in the 8 p.m. Sunday slot of July 27, 1997.&lt;ref name=nyt_farside/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richmond |first=Ray |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678643.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title='Stargate' Showtime's home run |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=August 1, 1997 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''SG-1'' producers, a broadcast network would have cancelled ''SG-1'' after a few episodes, but Showtime put no pressure on the show to &quot;deliver the meteoric ratings the way network shows do&quot;.&lt;ref name=spi_cruising/&gt; The show was consistently the channel's most-watched program (including theatrical movies),&lt;ref name=nyt_appeal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dempsey |first=John |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117790288.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=TV biz's gay pride parade |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=December 13, 2000 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; so Showtime ordered a third and fourth season of 22 episodes each in July 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Morgan |first=Richard |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117478828.html?categoryid=18&amp;cs=1 |title=MGM posts larger loss |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=July 27, 1998 |accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sci Fi Channel and US syndication (2002â2007)===
Since ''SG-1''{{'s}} ratings were good from a financial standpoint, the Sci Fi Channel picked up MGM's offer to continue the show into a sixth season, yet with a slightly reduced budget.&lt;ref name=tvzones46_66&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Eramo |first=Steven | title=Season Six Preview â Coming up, on SG-1... |journal=[[TV Zone]] |issue=Special 46 |pages=66â76 |month=July |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sci Fi aired new episodes of ''Stargate SG-1'' in the 9 p.m. Friday slot between ''[[The Dead Zone (TV series)|The Dead Zone]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'', while it aired older ''SG-1'' episodes in a four-hour block every Monday at 7 p.m. Episodes were broadcast in US syndication six months after their premiere on Sci Fi.&lt;ref name=&quot;v_levitates&quot;/&gt; The sixth season was supposed to be the show's last,&lt;ref name=tvzones46_4/&gt; but Sci Fi renewed ''SG-1'' at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;Storm 2005, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth and seventh seasons made ''Stargate SG-1'' Sci Fi's highest-rated original series with an average of 2 million viewers in over 1.3 million households,&lt;ref name=scifi_pr03&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/stargate/press/press_02.html |title= Sci Fi Channel Renews Stargate SG-1 For Eighth Season |publisher=scifi.com |date=July 23, 2003 |accessdate=2009-03-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; elevating Sci Fi into the top 10 cable networks in the United States.&lt;ref name=reelwest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelwest.com/happening/wire/2006/april/stargate.htm |title=Canadian Produced TV Series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; Films Landmark 200th Original Episode |publisher=reelwest.com |date = April 2006|accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next few years, the producers believed each current season to be the show's last and repeatedly wrote big series finales,&lt;ref name=spi_cruising&gt;{{cite web |last=McFarland |first=Melanie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/267484_tv21.html |title=On TV: 'Stargate SG-1' keeps cruising, despite the light years |publisher=''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' |date=April 21, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the success of ''Stargate SG-1'' put off their plans of ending the show to write a new ''Stargate'' feature film.&lt;ref name=duoefficiency/&gt; Sci Fi cut the length of an ''SG-1'' season from 22 to 20 episodes from season 8 onwards.

Originally envisioned as a replacement for ''SG-1'', the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' began airing in tandem with ''SG-1''{{'s}} eighth season in summer 2004, setting a series record of 3.2 million viewers for ''SG-1'' and a Sci Fi record as most-watched episode of a regular series ever (at the time) for ''Atlantis'' with 4.2 million viewers.&lt;ref name=duoefficiency&gt;{{cite web |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4735235-1.html |title=Duo found portal to sci-fi efficiency |publisher=Entertainment News Wire |date=August 9, 2004 |accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' joined the two ''Stargate'' series in January 2005, making Sci Fi the leader among basic cablers on Friday nights over the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name=v_pair/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/11/15/sci-fi-opens-the-gates-to-more-adventures/20041115scifi01/ |title=Sci Fi Opens The 'Gates' To More Adventures |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=November 15, 2004 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers considered replacing ''Stargate SG-1'' with a new show named ''Stargate Command'' after ''SG-1''{{'}}s eighth season,&lt;ref name=ac_901&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Robert C.

===International broadcast===
According to Wright and Cooper, the worldwide popularity of science fiction was a factor in ''SG-1''{{'s}} success and the good international reception helped keep the series on the air in the beginning.&lt;ref name=hr_global/&gt; Several newspapers reported in 2005â2006 that ''Stargate SG-1'' aired in over 100 countries with a weekly worldwide viewership of around 10 million,&lt;ref name=vs_success/&gt;&lt;ref name=spi_cruising/&gt;&lt;ref name=hr_global&gt;{{cite web |last=Brennan |first=Steve |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002728447 |title='Stargate' on global trek that spans 200 episodes |publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' |date=June 27, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave different numbers in 2004, saying that the show was broadcast in sixty-four countries with more than 17 million viewers a week.&lt;ref name=nyt_deepblue&gt;{{cite web |last=Gates |first=Anita |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/04/tv/cover-story-between-the-wraith-and-the-deep-blue-sea.html |title=Cover Story: Between the Wraith and the Deep Blue Sea |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=July 4, 2004 |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' had a particularly fervent response in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=duoefficiency/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt_deepblue/&gt;

''Stargate SG-1'' aired in the United Kingdom on [[Sky One]] with repeats on [[Sky Two]], [[Sky Three]], and [[Channel 4]].

===Home video release===
{{Main||1=List of Stargate SG-1 episodes#Series overview and home release|l1=Series overview and home release}}
''Stargate SG-1'' was first released on [[DVD]] in some European nations in volumes of typically four episodes each, beginning with &quot;The Best of Season 1&quot; as Volume 1 in the United Kingdom in 2000. Each following season was released as six individual volumes (except season 10 with five volumes), beginning with the first four episodes of season 2. Beginning in 2001, seasons 1 through 8 were released in five-disc [[amaray]] box sets in the United States. [[MGM Home Entertainment]] (Europe) began releasing complete season box sets (including season 1) alongside the individual volumes in 2002. The British season box sets were usually released half a year after a season's last volume release in the UK. ''Stargate SG-1'' was also released in DVD season box sets in Australia.

Most DVDs contain behind-the-scenes features, audio commentaries for nearly all episodes beginning with season 4, and production galleries. The box sets of the first eight seasons were re-released with slim packaging in all regions, beginning in the United States in summer 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://gateworld.net/news/2006/04/sony_switching_to_slim-line_isg-.shtml |title=Sony switching to slim-line ''SG-1'' DVD sets |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=April 3, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete series set was first released in the United States in October 2007, containing 50 discs from the ten seasons of ''Stargate SG-1'' and four bonus discs with content not part of the original sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/08/bonus_features_for_isg-1_complet.shtml |title=Bonus features for SG-1: Complete Series DVDs |date=August 3, 2007 |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |accessdate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30 million copies of DVDs had been sold by 2006.&lt;ref name=vs_success/&gt;

===Online distribution===
New episodes of ''Stargate SG-1'' were first released on [[iTunes]] in the US in August 2006, each time one day after their premiere on the Sci Fi Channel. The commercial-free episodes were priced $1.99 each, while a season pass with twenty episodes cost $37.99.&lt;ref name=v_swinging/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/istargatei_arrives_on_itunes.shtml |title=Stargate arrives on iTunes |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=August 20, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A release on iTunes UK followed in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/08/istargatei_comes_to_uk_itunes.shtml |title=Stargate comes to UK iTunes |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; All ten seasons of ''SG-1'' were available on iTunes and [[Amazon Unbox]] by January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/01/istargatei_expands_itunes_amazon.shtml |title=Stargate expands iTunes, Amazon presence |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=January 11, 2008 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' made its debut on [[hulu.com]] in March 2009, starting with the first season. At first, viewers in the United States could only watch episodes of the first seasons, but as of December 2009 all episodes of seasons 1 to 10 were available free of charge with a small number of commercials on Hulu, through January 31, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2009/03/stargate-sg-1-arrives-on-hulu/ |title=Stargate SG-1 arrives on [[Hulu]] |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free access to all SG-1 episodes continued until July 31, 2011, when the episodes were finally removed.

==Impact==
===Critical reception===
In his review for the pilot episode &quot;[[Children of the Gods]]&quot; in 1997, Will Joyner of ''[[The New York Times]]'' considered ''Stargate SG-1'' a &quot;challenging, if derivative, mix&quot; that is &quot;more than a ''Stargate'' [feature film] fan might expect but certainly less than one would hope for.&quot; He had a mixed opinion about the cast and was disturbed by ''SG-1''{{'s}} use of visual shock tactics to make up for its lower television budget.&lt;ref name=nyt_farside&gt;{{cite web |last=Joyner |first=Will |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/26/arts/through-a-gate-to-the-far-side-of-the-universe-a-tv-series.html |title=Through a Gate to the Far Side of the Universe: A TV Series |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=July 26, 1997 |accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the same episode, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Tony Scott criticized that &quot;superficial characters wander through their roles without stirring a modicum of conviction&quot; in a show that is &quot;essentially for young people&quot;. He mocked that the wooden acting, &quot;pedestrian writing, pulp-mag plotting, shopworn characters, hackneyed dialogue [...] and Mario Azzopardi's broad direction will all undoubtedly delight billions and billions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Tony |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117911984.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1 |title=Stargate SG-1 |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=July 28, 1997 |accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics responded negatively to the gratuitous use of sexual implication and female nudity in the pilot episode, which according to Wright had been filmed on Showtime's insistence despite his vocal opposition and was cut from the pilot's 2009 direct-to-DVD version.&lt;ref name=gw_specialpilot/&gt;

According to Sharon Eberson of the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], &quot;Stargate SG-1's&quot; place in the sci-fi universe can be measured in longevity, spot-on cast chemistry, rabid fans and tough subject it has tackled although she argued that the show was rarely a critical darling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eberson |first=Sharon |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07172/795812-237.stm |title='Stargate: SG-1' signs off, but we haven't seen the last of it |publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' |date=June 21, 2007 |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the show was the most-watched program on Showtime, it received almost no media mention outside hard-core science fiction circles in its first seasons.&lt;ref name=nyt_appeal&gt;{{cite web |last=Meisler |first=Andy |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/arts/television-radio-not-even-trying-to-appeal-to-the-masses.html |title=Television/Radio: Not Even Trying to Appeal to the Masses |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=October 4, 1998 |date=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' gained media attention when ''Stargate Atlantis'' was greenlit (the cover of the July 26, 2003 ''[[TV Guide]]'' issue notably called to &quot;Forget ''[[Star Trek|Trek]]''! ''Stargate SG-1'' is now sci-fi's biggest hit!&quot;), but the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' noted in 2006 that &quot;Nobody seemed to like [''Stargate SG-1''] but the fans; it somehow always slipped under the radar of most TV critics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/227758 |title=Best Bets |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=June 21, 2007 |accessdate=2009-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Melanie McFarland of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', ''SG-1''{{'s}} records did not earn it &quot;the kind of wide-ranging respect a successful series with a 200-episode run deserves&quot;; ''SG-1'' rarely occupied a slot on 'best show' lists because the show remained &quot;relegated to the back of the bus in terms of popularity&quot; behind the glory of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', although every week, the show attracts an average of 10 million viewers worldwide. It has also been pointed out by Cooper that &quot;By the way, neither did the original 'Star Trek' in its time, It wasn't until 30 years later that people started looking back at it and realizing it was a milestone. I think we secretly hope that 10, 15, 20 years from now, that 'Stargate' will be considered in the same way.&quot;&lt;ref name=spi_cruising/&gt; Scott D. Pierce from ''[[Deseret News]]'' said that the series never made a &quot;sort of cultural impact&quot; as ''Star Trek'' because the show was &quot;pretty derivative&quot; which he further stated it became &quot;more so over the years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=D.

Brad Wright used the term &quot;Gaters&quot; to refer to fans of ''Stargate SG-1'' in 2001,&lt;ref name=dvdbeyond&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]]; [[Jonathan Glassner|Glassner, John]]; [[Paul Mullie|Mullie, Paul]]; [[Stuart Tyson Smith|Smith, Stuart T.]]; Giannazzo, Tom |date=2001 |title=Stargate SG-1: Season 3 â Timeline To The Future â Part 3: Beyond The Gate | medium = DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term did not become widespread.

Until 2005, Gatecon was the main ''SG-1'' fan convention. It was held in the Vancouver area, with more actor and crew member participation than other conventions. ''SG-1'' conventions by [[Creation Entertainment]] were also marketed as &quot;The Official ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' Tour&quot;, which mostly took place in the United States until Creation Entertainment acquired the license for Vancouver conventions in 2005. Wolf Events organized many ''SG-1'' conventions in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Storm 2005, pp. 93â95.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stargate SG-1'' spawned the live-action spin-off TV series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', the animated ''[[Stargate Infinity]]'' and the second live-action spin-off ''[[Stargate Universe]]''. By ''SG-1''{{'s}} tenth season in 2006, ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' were said to have brought US$500 million in production to British Columbia.&lt;ref name=vs_success&gt;{{cite web |last=Andrews |first=Marke |url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/business/story.html?id=8cadeca7-c0a8-403f-b6d6-7c1f728a9aa7&amp;k=25558 |title=Stargate's success is out of this world |publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' |date=April 8, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; MGM executive vice president Charles Cohen described ''Stargate SG-1'' and its spinoff series as the television counterpart of their ''[[James Bond]]'' franchise, being very profitable and improving their image.&lt;ref name=mcn_200/&gt;

According to Stan Beeler and Lisa Dickson in their 2005 book ''Reading Stargate SG-1'', the only science fiction shows to exceed the staying power of ''SG-1'' are ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, although ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[Buffy (TV series)|Buffy]]''/''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'' might have comparable longevity.&lt;ref name=beeler_intro/&gt; Brad Wright cited continuity in the creative team and fan loyalty as reasons for the show's longevity.&lt;ref name=vs_success/&gt; With its 202nd episode, &quot;[[Company of Thieves (Stargate SG-1)|Company of Thieves]]&quot;, ''Stargate SG-1'' surpassed ''The X-Files'' as the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, before being overtaken by the [[Superman]]-inspired series ''[[Smallville]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sumner, Darren|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/05/smallville-bows-this-week-with-stargates-world-record/ |title=Smallville bows this week â with Stargate's world record |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Doctor Who'' fans dispute ''SG-1''{{'s}} listing in the 2007 [[Guinness World Records]] as the &quot;longest-running science fiction show (consecutive)&quot;, as 694 episodes of the British show were produced and shown consecutively between 1963 and 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;record&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2006/09/23/36558.shtml |title=Record breaker? |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2006-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5390372.stm |title=Dr Who 'longest-running sci-fi' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=September 28, 2006 |accessdate=2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
