'''Dave Attell''' (born January 18, 1965) is an American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] [[comedian]] and the host of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' and ''[[The Gong Show with Dave Attell]]''.

==Stand-up beginning==
Born in [[Queens, New York]], he grew up in [[Rockville Centre, New York]] and now lives in [[New York City]]. Attell's initial motivation to perform stand-up comedy is attributed to his indecisiveness as to what he should do after college. In 1987 he graduated from [[New York University]] with a degree in communications. Like many other fledgling comedians, he worked menial jobs during the day and put in his time at comedy clubs at night. He worked his first gig at Governor's in [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]] and, according to Attell, &quot;totally bombed&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} After years of honing his act, he found himself being described as &quot;the comedian's comedian&quot;. When working a club, the other comedians, such as [[Mike Royce]] (a producer/writer on ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''), [[David Juskow]] (a performer on ''[[TV Funhouse]]''), [[Kevin Brennan (comedian)|Kevin Brennan]] (from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and [[HBO]]'s ''One Night Stand'') and [[Jon Stewart]], would come in to watch his act. While the audience didn't always follow his up-front delivery, fellow comedians were refreshed by his originality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Attell often begins a joke in a relatively tame way, but then gets progressively stranger and ends in an obscene ''[[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]]''. For example: &quot;Sex is not important. What's important is that afterward part. When you're both naked and it's warm and you're watching the sun come up in the windshield. You look in her eyes, you look in her one good eye and help her strap on her leg and you know: you just fucked a pirate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Skanks for the Memories]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
Attell's first appearance on television was in 1988 on [[VH1]]'s ''[[Stand-Up Spotlight]]'', which also featured early appearances by [[Lewis Black]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Jeff Garlin]], [[Jay Mohr]] and [[Wanda Sykes]]. The show was hosted by [[Rosie O'Donnell]].

Perhaps his biggest break to date was achieved on November 23, 1993 when he made his first appearance on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]''. The appearance was seen by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]], who then recruited Attell to be a writer, and occasional performer, on ''SNL''. Attell can be seen behind [[Chris Farley]] during the famous &quot;Rudy Giuliani Inauguration&quot; sketch. Attell worked on the show for the '93-'94 season.

In 1995, Attell was featured on two [[HBO]] specials: alongside up-and-comers [[Louis C.K.]], [[Anthony Clark]], [[Eric Tunney]] and [[Dave Chappelle]], he was a featured performer on the 1995 ''[[Young Comedians Special]]'', hosted by [[Garry Shandling]]. He was also given his own 60-minute special on the channel's &quot;[[HBO Comedy Showcase]]&quot;. Subsequently, Attell was also given an episode of ''[[HBO Comedy Half-Hour]]'' in 1997.

Also in 1995, Attell appeared as Squiggly Dave on ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', kicking-off a long-standing relationship between Attell and [[Comedy Central]]. In 1999 the network issued Attell an installment in their ever-popular ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' series.

The same year the network signed him on as a regular commentator on their satirical news show ''[[The Daily Show]]''. When he arrived in 1999, the show was just finding its audience after the departure of host [[Craig Kilborn]] and the arrival of [[Jon Stewart]], an old friend of Attell's from the New York comedy circuit. The three-year stint gave Attell access to a mass audience on a regular basis (''The Daily Show'' has done much the same for comedians [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Lewis Black]] and others). Attell's series of commentary on the show was called &quot;The Ugly American&quot;.

In 2003, Attell began appearing semi-regularly on ''[[Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn]]''. The show featured many of the performers he works with every day at the underground comedy club the [[Comedy Cellar]] and is based on the conversations they would have off-stage at the Olive Tree Cafe, the restaurant above the club. The unscripted show was canceled in November 2004 due to poor ratings and controversial subject matter.

In 2007, Attell appeared in the Michael Addis film, ''Heckler.'' ''Heckler'' is a comedic feature documentary exploring the increasingly critical world we live in. Attell appeared on Comedy Central's ''Last Laugh'' in 2007.

In July 2008, Attell begins hosting ''The Gong Show with Dave Attell'' for [[Comedy Central]]. Like the [[The Gong Show|1970's version]], the show had a rotating panel of celebrity judges grading unusual acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Gong Show with Dave Attell| Comedy Central&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/gong_show/index.jhtml|title=The Gong Show with Dave Attell| Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlThe Gong Show with Dave Attell Television show - The Gong Show with Dave Attell TV Show - Yahoo!

In the short film ''[[The Office Party]]'', Attell once again played the role of &quot;Don&quot;. The film co-starred ex-''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]''/Outsider [[Ralph Macchio]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Carol Kane]] and [[Tate Donovan]]. The film was written and directed by ''Daily Show'' producer [[Chiara Edmands]].

''[[Pootie Tang]]'' saw Attell as the bumbling corporate lackey, &quot;Frank&quot;. The film was written and directed by fellow comedian [[Louis C.K.]]. It co-starred Lance Crouther, Wanda Sykes and Chris Rock among others.

Attell also played &quot;Efram the Driver&quot; in the Independent feature ''[[My Suicidal Sweetheart]]'', written and directed by filmmaking newcomer Michael Parness. The film co-starred Natasha Lyonne, David Krumholtz, Tim Blake Nelson, Lorraine Bracco, David Paymer and Rosanna Arquette.

He voiced the GPS on the Mystery Machine in the 2010 film [[Scooby-Doo! Abracadabra-Doo]].

==''Insomniac with Dave Attell''==
''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'' was one of Attell's television shows. Described by Attell as &quot;''[[Wild On!|Wild On E!]]'' for Ugly People&quot;, it featured Attell walking the streets of America's (later the world's) greatest (and some not-so-great) cities late at night, meeting the people in a haze of ecstatic inebriation. The show occasionally went overseas.

The American cities featured on the show were [[Albuquerque]], [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Atlanta]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] (2 times), [[Baltimore]], [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston (WV)]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Honolulu]], [[Houston]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Key West]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Little Rock]], [[Long Island]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Miami]], [[Myrtle Beach]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]] (4 times), [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Salt Lake City]].

The foreign cities featured on the show were [[Amsterdam]], [[Dublin]], [[London]], [[Montreal]], [[Tijuana]], [[Toronto]], and specials that took place in [[Berlin]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Tokyo]].

The most common activity (besides roaming the street aimlessly and visiting bars) was visiting workers on their night shifts. Instead of spending time with gas station attendants, he went searching for odd professions to highlight. Among them were crime-scene cleaners, bail bondsmen, cow-milkers, brothel-hookers, bicycle cops, coal miners, and porn overdubbers. Memorable episodes include a visit to Chicago's world-famous [[The Wieners Circle]], where the staff routinely got in cursing matches with their customers, and a visit to a Phoenix nudist camp.

Throughout the run of the show, Attell carried around a one-time-use film camera and took pictures of random events, which would be shown during the end-credits.

Attell has said that he decided to more-or-less end ''Insomniac'' because the show had gotten too popular to establish a level of spontaneity. As soon as he would walk into a bar with a camera crew, crowds would surround them, desperate to be on his television show. He has said, though, that people aren't so aware of his show overseas, so he would more than likely do a few specials in other countries.

==Present==
Attell can be seen touring occasionally. He is a mainstay on the New York comedy circuit and performs several times a week at the ''Comedy Cellar''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Attell's first one-hour special, ''Captain Miserable'', aired December 8, 2007 on [[HBO]].
