In 1948, the newly-established [[Republic of the Philippines]] sited an area now known as [[Quezon City]] as the nation's capital. The following year, the university acquired a 493-hectare area in the Diliman district of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;history hectare&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman History|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/oldsystem/ups_web_html/upd_hist.htm|accessdate=4 August 2010|quote=Archive of the original UP System's website.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new campus was named ''University of the Philippines Diliman'' and was assigned to be the university's seat of administration and main campus. Since its establishment in 1949, U.P. Diliman has expanded into offering more than 296 graduate, undergraduate and diploma courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/content.php?r=2&amp;c=18|publisher=University of the Philippines|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with nine (9) units declared as Centers of Excellence by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] as of 2009, currently the highest number recognized by this agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VIII.

This was one of the precursors to Marcos' declaration of [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellao|first=Janess Ann|title=âSigwaâ: Reliving the First Quarter Storm of 1970|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/main/2010/07/15/sigwa-reliving-the-first-quarter-storm-of-1970/|publisher=Bulatlat.com|accessdate=4 August 2010|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable research units of U.P. Diliman include: the [[Marine Science Institute]] (MSI), the [[National Institute of Geological Sciences]] (NIGS), the [[National Institute of Physics]] (NIP), the [[National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology]]-Diliman (NIMBB-Diliman), and the [[National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development]] (NISMED), which are all pioneers of science research and development in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;updil upsys&quot;/&gt; Its athletic teams, called the [[UP Fighting Maroons|Fighting Maroons]], are members of the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP). while its cheerdance group, [[UP Pep Squad|U.P Pep Squad]], represents the university in the [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]].

U.P. Diliman has a total land area of 493 hectares.&lt;ref name=&quot;history hectare&quot;/&gt; Much of this property is utilized by the university in the form of building infrastructures and research facilities, while the remaining area is forested, reserved for development and residential use, or unoccupied.

The main campus, the science and technology parks located on the eastern and western sides of the university, and the residential (Area 2) and Barangay U.P. Campus communities stretching from the western side to the northern tip of the university comprise the area most actively used by U.P. Diliman.

===The Oblation and Academic Oval===
[[File:UP Diliman Oblation statue 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|U.P. Diliman's Oblation statue as viewed from the University Avenue]]
[[File:UPD Oblation back.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Oblation Statue as viewed from Quezon Hall, the administration building]]
Coming from Commonwealth Avenue in [[Quezon City]], U.P. Diliman is connected by a road named as University Avenue. The avenue stretches 800 meters where traffic enters the campus, or going towards [[Carlos Garcia|C.P. Garcia]] St., which connects Commonwealth Avenue to Katipunan Avenue. At the end of University Avenue, the [[UP Oblation|Oblation]] Plaza of the Diliman campus faces the road. Behind it, the facade of the main building can be seen, the [[Manuel Quezon|Quezon]] Hall.
{{main|Oblation (University of the Philippines)}}
The '''[[Oblation]] statue''' ({{lang-tl|Pahinungod/Oblasyon}}) is the most iconic figure of the U.P. System. The statue was originally made by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]] [[Guillermo Tolentino|Guillermo E. Tolentino]] in 1935 in a collective effort by the students of the U.P. System.&lt;ref name=&quot;michael tan&quot;/&gt; During the 40th anniversary of the University of the Philippines, the Oblation was transferred to Diliman campus as a symbol of transfer of administrative seat. The Oblation was originally naked and made of concrete and stands 3.5 meters in height.&lt;ref name=&quot;michael tan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Michael|title=The Oblation|url=http://pinoykasi.homestead.com/files/2002articles/12192002_Oblation.htm|publisher=Pinoy Kasi!|accessdate=7 August 2010|date=19 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote morality and censorship, U.P. President Jorge Bocobo suggested to put a fig leaf to cover the genitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;upaagc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Oblation: History|url=http://upaagc.org/oblation.html|work=UP Alumni Association of Greater Chicago|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the Board of Regents ordered the statue to be cast in bronze, which was furnished in [[Italy]] and was put into display in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oblation by Napoleon Abueva|url=http://www.oblation.com.ph/history.htm|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several replicas of Tolentino's Oblation statue were created during the creation of new U.P. campuses, some were made by the National Artist [[Napoleon Abueva]]. U.P. Diliman's Oblation statue located in the Oblation Plaza is also a concrete-made replica of Tolentino's. The original statue is now put on display on the third floor of the university's Main Library.&lt;ref name=&quot;upaagc&quot;/&gt;

The main and largest road in the university is the '''Academic Oval''', sometimes known as '''Acad Oval'''. This road is composed of two joining avenues, the [[Manuel Roxas|Roxas]] and [[Sergio OsmeÃ±a|OsmeÃ±a]] Avenues. Having a total circumference of about 2.2 kilometers, the oval connects the rest of the colleges of the university from the main University Avenue. The avenue had its name from several colleges around the oval, namely the College of Mass Communication, College of Music, College of Engineering, College of Law, School of Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Education, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy and School of Library and Information Studies. The oval also covers Quezon Hall, the U.P. Theater, National Engineering Center, Student Activity Center/Vinzons Hall, Center for International Studies and Jorge B. Vargas Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;acad oval&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Villar|first=Eugene Alvin|title=U.P. Diliman Academic Oval|url=http://www.vistapinas.com/article/up-diliman-academic-oval|accessdate=7 August 2010|date=21 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Academic Oval is planted with over 500 [[acacia]] and fire trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;acad oval&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martinez|first=Glenn|title=A Sunday Walk around U.P.

During the centennial celebration of the U.P. System, U.P. President Emerlinda Roman rehabilitated the inner circle of the Academic Oval. The transformation included the paving of the inner Oval and creation of commemorative tiles around the walkway for an exchange of price. The efforts are collected and distributed to form the U.P. Diliman Faculty Development Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you love UP?  Then show it!|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/whatsup/upcentennial2.htm|publisher=UP Centennial Commission|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2008, however, the Academic Oval was turned into one-way in order to lessen traffic volume entering the university. According to Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Cynthia Grace Gregorio, this policy also promotes to lower air pollution by creating biking lanes on the inner side of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bibe Jr.|first=Cenon|title=UP reroutes traffic |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20080329-127076/UP-reroutes-traffic|accessdate=7 August 2010|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carillon Tower===
[[File:Carillon Tower.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The U.P. Carillon Tower]]
The only [[carillon]] tower in the [[Philippines]] and in [[Southeast Asia]] that is manually played by a [[clavier]] or a wooden keyboard, the '''U.P. Carillon''' towers about 130 feet tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 &quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Aurelio|first=Julie|title=Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20071216-107115/Bells_of_Diliman_ring_again_on_Dec_18|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=16 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.P. Carillon was originally constructed in 1940 by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]] [[Juan Nakpil]], [[UP Diliman College of Music|Conservatory of Music]] director Ramon Tapales and [[President of the University of the Philippines|UP President]] Bienvenido Gonzales with an initial idea of building a concrete structure that may tower the grounds of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;For UP the bells toll&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Santiago|first=Bettina|title=For UP the bells toll|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/54306|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, on 1 August 1952, the tower was finished and dedicated as the U.P. Carillon. Forty-eight bells with four [[octave]]s were installed by the Dutch carilloneeur Adrian Antonisse, with the efforts laid by the U.P. Alumni Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;For UP the bells toll&quot;/&gt; These bells were forged by Van Bergen Co. in [[Netherlands]] and the largest of the them weighs five tons, where the total cost of construction summed up to [[Philippine peso|PhP]] 200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;restoration&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of UP Carillon|url=http://www.upcarillon.org/history.html|work=The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from playing the U.P.'s anthem ''[[UP Naming Mahal]]'' (U.P. Beloved), the Carillon tuned many music such as the ''Magtanim ay Di Biro'' (Planting Rice, a Filipino folk song) and [[The Beatles]] sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;restoration&quot;/&gt; One of the most important tunings of the Carillon was when it played the [[socialism|socialist]] anthem ''[[The Internationale]]'' at the 1971 Diliman Commune.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anthem for dedicated youth&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=OrdoÃ±ez|first=Elmer|title=Anthem for dedicated youth|url=http://archives.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/05/yehey/opinion/20080405opi2.html|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Times|date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The UP Carillon rings again &quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cervantes|first=Behn|title=The UP Carillon rings again |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20080112-111831/The_UP_Carillon_rings_again|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletn|date=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, U.P. students declared the university as a republic and as a separate entity from the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;tinig&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Palatino|first=Mong|title=Pagbabalik-tanaw sa Diliman Commune|url=http://www.tinig.com/v26/v26mong.html|publisher=Tinig.com|accessdate=8 August 2010|language=Tagalog}} {{Google translation|en|tl|3=http://www.tinig.com/v26/v26mong.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to age and rust, the Carillon ceased to play in 1981. In 1988, the last symphonies of ''U.P. Naming Mahal'' and ''Push On U.P.!'' (U.P. Diliman's athletic cheer) from the tower was played during the December's Lantern Parade. Since then, the Carillon was never tuned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 &quot;/&gt; But as late as 2001, students say that they can hear the rhymes of ''[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]'' and ''Sing a Song of Six Pence'' despite that it was closed to prevent further mishaps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 &quot;/&gt;

In 2005, through the collective efforts of U.P. Alumni Association and various private donors, the U.P. Carillon Restoration Project of the U.P. Centennial Commission launched a fund-raising program to collect PhP 20 million to restore the Carillon, as a projection of using the tower again in the coming 100th year of the [[University of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of UP Carillon|url=http://www.upcarillon.org/about_project.html|work=The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years, the Project was able to collect PhP 14 million which will be used to clean-up and repair the tower itself and to replace the bells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restoring the UP Carillonâs history &quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=de Guzman Jr.|first=Marcos|title=Restoring the UP Carillonâs history |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20070609-70321/Restoring_the_UP_Carillon%92s_history|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=9 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Carillon was formally reintroduced to the public after two years of restoration. The original 48 bells were put into archives and are now replaced by 36 bells bought from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Petit &amp; Fritsen|Petit and Fritsen]] for PhP 12 million whereas the construction engineers were provided by the Royal Bell Philippines. According to project engineer Matthew Bergers, each bell was made from 80% bronze and 20% combination of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[phosphorus]]. At the same time, the largest of these bells weighs 635 kilograms and the smallest weighs 14 kilograms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 &quot;/&gt; The original wood claviers were replaced by heavy duty oakwood while all bells are designed to hold refurbished steel pipes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restoring the UP Carillonâs history &quot;/&gt; Another project engineer Eduardo Otacan also said that the new bells will have 3 octaves and they can be programmed using computers attached to the clavier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 &quot;/&gt;

At the same time, a small amphitheater named Carillon Plaza was constructed at the base of the tower. After about two decades of silence, the U.P. Carillon was heard again during the Lantern Parade of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 &quot;/&gt;

===Sunken Garden===
:''&quot;Sunken Garden&quot; redirects here. For other uses, see [[Sunken Gardens]].''
[[File:UP Diliman Sunken Garden.jpg|thumb|right|The Sunken Garden in UP Diliman.]]
The '''Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] Parade Grounds''', or commonly known as the '''Sunken Garden''', is a 5-hectare natural depression found on the eastern side of the campus and at the end of the Academic Oval circle. Sunken Garden is enclosed by the UP Diliman Main Library (also houses the School of Library and Information Studies), College of Social Sciences and Philosophy's Department of Psychology, College of Education, Student Activity Center/[[Wenceslao Vinzons|Vinzons]] Hall, College of Business Administration, School of Economics and College of Law. The Grounds was the original property of the UP-ROTC when Diliman campus was founded in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;luna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=General Antonio Luna Parade Grounds|url=http://www.uprotc.org/facility/gen-antonio-luna-parade-grounds.html|publisher=UP ROTC|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds acquired its name ''Sunken Garden'' due to its basin-shaped low-level formation that has the deepest point of 65 meters above sea level (contrary to university's height of over hundreds of meters above sea level).&lt;ref name=&quot;The truth behind the myth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sarmiento|first=Christine Joy|title=The truth behind the myth|url=http://dilimangenius.webs.com/maharlagmay.htm|work=UP College of Mass Communication|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunken Garden is usually the venue for sports tournament like [[frisbee]], [[soccer]], and [[volleyball]] clinics as well as the annual UP Fair. Sometimes, [[Reserve Officers Training Corps|ROTC]] trainings are done here by the Department of Military Science and Tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;luna&quot;/&gt;

The Sunken Garden actually sinks by about two inches every year. There are two possible reasons of this sinking: first, it is because of underground trenches that mingle with the campus' sewer system. These trenches branch from the rear side of NIGS building, Sampaguita Residence Hall, the UP Integrated School, down to the National Institute of Physics, until near the former Narra Residence Hall. These trenches then connects to the so-called Marikina [[Fault (geology)|Fault Line]], an active geologic structure that runs across the east of [[Metro Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geologic Map of Diliman, Quezon City and the Marikina Fault Line|url=http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/images/active/Hazard%20Maps/Active%20Fault%20Maps/Valley_fault_maps/diliman_q.pdf|publisher=Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology|accessdate=8 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that the depression was due to the emptying of former streams in the Sunken Garden that were prominent in the 1950s. These streams formerly run from the Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for the Commonwealth Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;The truth behind the myth&quot;/&gt;

===Administration===
[[File:UPD Quezon Hall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Quezon Hall (Administration Building)]]
UP Diliman is the fourth oldest and is the largest, in terms of student population, of all the seven major campuses of the [[University of the Philippines]]. The University of the Philippines is governed by the [[University of the Philippines#Board of Regents|Board of Regents]]' 11 members, of whom five are ''[[ex officio]]'', three are student, faculty, and staff representatives, and three are appointed by the [[President of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/pdf2/RA_9500.pdf|title=Republic Act 9500: An Act to Strengthen the University of the Philippines as the National University|publisher=University of the Philippines Website|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each campus of the University of the Philippines is headed by a chancellor. The first chancellor of UP Diliman was [[Senator of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Edgardo Angara|Edgardo J. Angara]], whose office was created on 26 April 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|page=3|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chancellor is assisted by five vice chancellors &amp;mdash; for academic affairs, administration, community affairs, research &amp; development, and student affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;officials diliman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Officials of UP Campuses|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/officials.htm#diliman|work=University of the Philippines|accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chancellor is Dr. [[Caesar A. Saloma]], who was appointed by the Board of Regents into position during its 1267th meeting on 2 March 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;saloma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/index188.html|title=Saloma is new UPD Chancellor|publisher=UP Newsletter|accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from heading the university, the chancellor also holds administrative duties that represent the Board of Regents at the campus level. The chancellor also serves as chairperson of the university council, an internal coordinating body composed of the chancellor himself, the university registrar who serves as secretary, and the professorial faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|page=12|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vice chancellor for academic affairs, on the other hand, assists the chancellor in coordinating curricular, instructional, library, and other programs of the university. The vice chancellor for administration assists the chancellor in the administrative management of the campus.  The vice chancellor for community affairs assists the chancellor in promoting relationships within the university and in dealing with local government and safety issues, while the vice chancellor for research &amp; development assists the chancellor in formulating guidelines and criteria for the university's research and development endeavors. Finally, the vice chancellor for student affairs assists the chancellor in promoting wellness and discipline among students in areas such as health, food services, and scholarship management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|pages=8â9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and institutes===
[[Image:MalcolmHall.jpg|thumb|right|The Malcolm Hall, named after the college's first dean, [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Justice]] [[George A. Malcolm|George Malcolm]] houses the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]].]]
The academic arms of the university are called [[college]]s, [[institute]]s, or [[school]]s. A number of colleges and schools offer a variety of undergraduate, graduate, and diploma programs, while some offer programs only within a specific field.  Most institutes offer no degrees, but provide research facilities for academic development.

Each college or school is headed by a dean, who is appointed by the UP Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the chancellor and the president of the university. The dean acts as the head of the faculty of his college and assumes administrative duties assigned by the Board. The dean has a  tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon reappointment. The associate dean, on the other hand, assists the dean in the administration of the unit. The tenure of the associate dean is determined by the Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the chancellor and the dean.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual p 10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|page=10|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of UP Diliman's academic arms assume the title of &quot;Institute&quot; (such as the Asian Institute of Tourism or the Institute of Islamic Studies) and function as their own units, with their own departments.  Some institutes are within colleges (such as the Institute of Civil Engineering within the College of Engineering). Some of UP Diliman's academic arms also assume the title of &quot;School&quot; (such as the School of Economics), which might function independently and have their own departments or which may operate as a unit within a particular college.

UP Diliman's institutes are headed by institute directors, who assume the duties assigned by the chancellor.  Each director has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon the reappointment of the chancellor.  A director cannot not be an academic head of any department or division under his institute.  Each college or school is composed of clusters of institutes or departments.  

The university's departments are headed by department chairs, who assume the duties assigned by the dean and the chancellor.  Each chair is appointed by the chancellor, as recommended by the dean or institute director, and has a tenure of three years, which may be extended for up to two terms upon reappointment.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual p 10&quot;/&gt;

Some units of the university are known as ''national institutes'', such as the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.  The status of being an institute is determined by the Board of Regents, but recognition as a national institute is governed by Philippine legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EO 889&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order 889: Establishing a System of National Centers of Excellence in the Basic Sciences|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1983/eo_889_1983.html|accessdate=9 August 2010|author=[[Ferdinand Marcos]]|date=23 March 1983|quote=The Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines is hereby authorized to organize the above-mentioned institutes, and such other additional institutes and laboratories in the future it may deem proper to create, from out of the existing staff, physical facilities and programs of the University and its constituent units.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of a national institute, also the director, is not appointed by the chancellor but by the president of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual p 10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|pages=10|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UP Diliman is composed of 26 colleges, schools, and institutes. Officially, these are called ''degree-granting units''.&lt;ref name=&quot;diliman colleges&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Academic Programs|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/acad.htm|work=UP Diliman|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these colleges is the [[UP Diliman College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]], established in 1908 and originally located in Manila.&lt;ref name=&quot;fine arts history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About CFA: Celebrating 100 years in 2008|url=http://up-cfa.com/the-college/|work=UP College of Fine Arts|accessdate=7 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the first college to operate on the Diliman campus is the [[UP Diliman College of Music|Conservatory of Music]] (then College of Music) in 1949.

== Culture, sports and traditions ==
The Diliman community is sometimes referred to as ''the Diliman Republic'' and a &quot;microcosm of the Philippines&quot;. It is the only university in [[Metro Manila]] that has its own [[jeepney]] transportation system due to its expansiveness. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) as well as a television station. Currently, the university only operates [[DZUP 1602]], a community AM radio station. The campus encompasses a number of residential areas and many students claim a sense of solidarity with the residents of these immediate communities.

U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System in the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP) and participates in all events. The [[Fighting Maroons]] have perennially placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP. 

Two of the most-awaited events in the campus are the Lantern Parade, held on the last week before the [[Christmas]] break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, groups within the University create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval. The U.P. Fair, organized by the [[UP Diliman University Student Council]], is a week-long event held at the Sunken Garden that features nightly music concerts, booths, and amusement park rides.

==Centennial Celebration==
[[Image:fireworks10.jpg|thumb|right|Fireworks display at UP Diliman's Centennial Kick-off Celebration.]]
On January 8, 2008, the [[University of the Philippines System]] (UP), with 7 constituent universities and 12 campuses offering 258 undergraduate and 438 graduate programs, began its centennial celebration at the Diliman campus. The university has produced 7 of 14 presidents, 12 chief justices of the Supreme Court, 34 of 35 national scientists and 36 of 57 national artists, and an estimated 250,000 alumni (15,000 doctors, 8,000 lawyers and 23,000 teachers).&lt;ref&gt;[http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view_article.php?article_id=110945  Inquirer.net, UP in next 100 years]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fernando Javier, 100, of  [[Baguio City]], oldest UP [[alumnus]] ([[Civil Engineering]] from [[University of the Philippines Manila]], 1933), carried the 100-torch relay at the UP academic oval in [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]. The 99th torchbearer was Michael Reuben Dumlao, youngest, a 6th-grader from the [[University of the Philippines Integrated School]] in UP Diliman. UP president Emerlinda Roman, first woman president, carried the 100th torch and ignited the centennial [[cauldron]] in the UP [[Oblation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080106-110642/UP_passes_torch_100-yr-old_to_6th_grader  Inquirer.net, UP passes torch: 100-yr-old to 6th grader]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cauldron featured 3 pillars representing the core values of Excellence, Leadership, and Service and 7 flowers representing the constituent universities, to wit, UP Manila, UP Diliman (together with UP Pampanga, its extension campus), UP Los BaÃ±os, UP Baguio, UP Visayas, UP Mindanao, and UP Open University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/YTCP20080109113844.html  www.mb.com.ph, UP alumni light perpetual flame at centennial rites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UPAA 2008 Centennial Yearbook===
The University of the Philippines Alumni Association announced its launching of a special three-volume UPAA 2008 Centennial Yearbook on June 21, 2008, the UPAA Grand Alumni-Faculty Homecoming and Reunion at the [[Araneta Coliseum]], [[Cubao]], Quezon City.
