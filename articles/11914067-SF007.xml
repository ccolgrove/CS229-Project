'''''Echo: Secrets of the Lost Cavern''''' is a computer [[adventure game]] released in 2005. It was developed by [[Kheops Studio]] and published by [[The Adventure Company]]. It is very similar to previous Kheops Studio games; the interface and gameplay are almost identical to ''[[Return to Mysterious Island]]''. The player takes the role of Arok, a 15 year old European [[Human|Homo sapiens]] from the [[Paleolithic]] period.

== Story ==
'''''Secret of the Lost Cavern''''' takes the player back into the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] period in prehistoric time, 15000 BC. At this time, our ancestors where able to communicate with one another, create fire, cook meat, cut flint, and make spears for hunting.

During this [[Stone Age]] adventure, the life of a young [[Hunting|hunter]], Arok, is revealed. While on a fruitless hunt, Arok discovers a [[cave]]rn marked with a strange symbol. It reminds him of a charismatic traveler, Klem, who ventured through the lands of his clan a few years before. Klem is a [[Painting|painter]] and [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] with the gift of speaking with the spirits of the world through the gorgeous paintings he creates on the walls of the caverns he passes. Arok spent many days with this [[Shamanism|shaman]] artist, fascinated by his creations and his stories. After noticing the painter's talent in the cavern, Arok decides not to return to his clan, but rather follow the path of his mentor...

== Gameplay ==
During this adventure, Arok will need to collect many items and survive the wilderness that lies ahead of him. He must learn how to build a spear thrower, lure a ferocious bear away from his lair, harpoon salmon, traverse raging rivers, and overcome many more obstacles.

== Characters ==
'''Arok''' is a 15 year old European homo sapien from the Paleolithic period. This young hunter became an adventurer after his chance meeting with a charismatic traveler back in his childhood.

'''Klem''' is a genius painter, the Michelangelo of his time. Possessing shamanistic powers and knowledge of sorcery, he enjoys an outstanding presence and charisma. He inspired Arok with a deep appreciation for art and adventure.

'''Tika''' is Klem's daughter. She lives in a [[caveman|troglodyte]] shelter by a river, next to the Lascaux cave where her father works. She guides the novice along with other talented painters to the famous lair. In spite of her young age, she has already acquired great knowledge of painting and tests Arok's ability with the tablet's riddle.

'''The Flintnapper''' is a straightforward and cheerful man who exudes a quiet strength. He gives Arok invaluable advice on how best to choose and cut flint. Through him, Arok also learns more about the lifestyle of Klem and his people.
