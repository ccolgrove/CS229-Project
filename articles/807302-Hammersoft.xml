Many of these sites are owned by the Trust - the most recent acquisition by the Trust is Catherton Common, in the [[Clee Hills]], which at 527 [[acre]]s is the largest Wildlife Trust nature reserve in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region. The Trust is currently fund-raising to purchase the [[leasehold]] of [[Pontesford]] Hill - it already owns the [[Freehold (law)|freehold]], along with neighbouring Earl's Hill.

==Headquarters==
The Trust has its main offices and [[visitor centre]] at 193 Abbey Foregate near the centre of Shrewsbury - they occupy the former &quot;Shrewsbury Quest&quot; museum, on the corner of Abbey Foregate and Old Potts Way, opposite [[Shrewsbury Abbey|The Abbey]] church. The site encompasses a restored medieval building known as the Old Infirmary and a 1730s building called Queen Anne House, as well as gardens, including a [[herb garden]] established when the site was the Shrewsbury Quest, and a fruit tree garden. The centre and its gardens is open to the public (usually Monday â Saturday) and has a shop as well as [[Meeting|conference]] rooms available for hire. Many Trust-run events take place here, including children's events during the summer holidays. Every year the centre receives approximately 25,000 visitors.

The Trust currently has 10 local branches active in the county:

*[[Bridgnorth]]
