'''San Fernando''' is a city located in the [[San Fernando Valley]], in northwestern region of [[Los Angeles, California]], [[United States]]. The population was 23,645 at the 2010 census, up from 23,564 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[Image:Mission San Fernando Postcard, circa 1900.jpg|thumb|left|325px|Mission San Fernando: in a circa 1900 postcard]]
The city was named for the nearby [[Mission San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a]], and was part of the [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] of [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]]. In 1874 [[Charles Maclay]], San Fernando founder, bought {{convert|56000|acre|km2|0}} of the Rancho. In 1882, cousins George K. Porter and Benjamin F. Porter of future [[Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, California|Porter Ranch]] each received one-third of the total land. 

In 1885, Maclay founded the Maclay School of Theology, a Methodist [[seminary]] in his newly founded town of San Fernando.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Thomas C.|coauthors=James C. Carper|title=Religious Higher Education in the United States: A Source Book|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1996|page=474|isbn=9780815316367|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lxr_PID7o2IC&amp;pg=PA474|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death it became an affiliate and moved to the campus of the [[University of Southern California]] and then the [[Claremont School of Theology]].

==Geography==
San Fernando is completely surrounded by the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], with the districts of [[Sylmar, Los Angeles, California|Sylmar]] to the north, [[Lake View Terrace, Los Angeles, California|Lake View Terrace]] to the east, [[Pacoima, Los Angeles, California|Pacoima]] to the south, and [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California|Mission Hills]] to the west.  It is served by the [[Golden State Freeway|Golden State]] (Interstate 5), [[Foothill Freeway|Foothill]] (Interstate 210), [[Ronald Reagan Freeway|Ronald Reagan]] (State Route 118), and [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego]] (Interstate 405) freeways.

While most of the towns in the surrounding [[San Fernando Valley]] agreed to annexation by Los Angeles in the 1910s, eager to tap the bountiful water supply provided by the newly opened [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]], San Fernando's abundant [[groundwater]] supplies allowed it to remain a separate city.  Even as the San Fernando Valley transformed itself from an agricultural area to a [[suburb]]an one in the decades after [[World War II]], San Fernando retained its independence.

As with much of the San Fernando Valley east of the [[Interstate 405 (California)|San Diego Freeway]], the city of San Fernando has seen a significant demographic shift in recent years; declining birth-rates, an aging population of middle-class whites, who once dominated the area in the 1950s, has contributed to the movement into other parts of the San Fernando Valley. There has also been movement into the [[Santa Clarita Valley|Santa Clarita]] and [[Antelope Valley]]s to the north. Income levels have declined as a result. [[Latinos]] became the majority population. Since late 2004, the city has been going through a series of planning development projects, that can be defined as [[gentrification]].
