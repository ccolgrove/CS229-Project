The '''[[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[New York Jets]] season''' was the franchise's 41st season in the [[National Football League]], the 51st season overall and the team's first season at [[New Meadowlands Stadium]]. The team improved on their 9â7 record from [[2009 New York Jets season|2009]] and reached the playoffs again. The Jets played their first pre-season game home against the [[2010 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] to open up Meadowlands Stadium. Many considered them AFC East favorites; head coach Rex Ryan went so far as to guarantee a Super Bowl victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fennelly|first=John|url=http://www.profootballnyc.com/2010/07/jets-cowboys-are-preseason-sb-favorites.html|title=NY Jets and NY Giants News and Opinion: Jets, Cowboys Are Preseason SB Favorites|publisher=Pro Football NYC|date=2010-07-26|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/sports/pro_sports/football/jets/100175939_Jets_notes__Rex_Ryan_guarantees_title.html|title=Jets notes: Rex Ryan guarantees title|publisher=NorthJersey.com|date=2010-08-07|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jets broke a team record with a franchise best 6 consecutive wins on the road with a win against the Lions, followed by a win against the Browns in week 10. In the same victory against the Browns, the Jets became the first team in NFL history to win back-to-back road games in overtime. The Jets were the last NFL team to be undefeated on the road, before suffering a 45â3 loss at the [[New England Patriots]] in Week 13. The Jets met the Patriots again five weeks later in the AFC Divisional Round back in Foxboro where New York defeated New England 28â21. The following week, the Jets lost 24â19 against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship.

The Jets' seventh game was an Interconference duel with the Packers. Punter [[Steve Weatherford]] made the game's most controversial decision in the first quarter, opting to attempt a fake punt and run for the first down on 4th and 18. Weatherford was stopped a yard short of the first down, giving the Packers ideal field position which eventually led to an early 3â0 Packers lead. &quot;He does it on his own,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;(The Packers) were caving that side down. This was something Steve did on his own. I don't think he realized we'd just been sacked. We told him before that it needed to be a manageable situation, not fourth-and-20 or whatever it was.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/jets/post/_/id/2595/when-in-doubt-punt-dont-run&lt;/ref&gt; In a game where defense ruled, the Packers lead 3â0 at halftime. With no challenges left after two failed attempts in the first half, [[Mark Sanchez]] threw a ball to [[Dustin Keller]] that was ripped out of his hands and ruled an interception in the 4th quarter. The replay showed that Keller made the catch and was down before losing possession, but with no challenges left the Jets were left with nothing. Green Bay took a 6â0 lead after the turnover. The Jets had two more chances to take the lead but had drives halted on 4th and longs. The Packers added on another field goal late to finalize a 9â0 win in the [[New Meadowlands Stadium]]. This marked the first time since 2006 the Jets were shutout.

With the loss, the Jets fell to 5â2.
