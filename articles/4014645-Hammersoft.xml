'''Chastity &quot;Chas&quot; Dingle''' (previously '''Livesy''') is a [[fictional character]] in the British [[ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Lucy Pargeter]].

==Storylines==
[[File:EarlyChasDingle.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Chas as she appeared in 2003]]
Chas Dingle arrives in Emmerdale dressed as a nun. She is hired by her father, [[Shadrach Dingle|Shadrach]], for her cousin [[Marlon Dingle|Marlon's]] stag night. Chas ends up locked in the back of a van with vicar [[Ashley Thomas]].

She moves into Wishing Well Cottage with the Dingle family and gets a job as Barmaid at the Woolpack.

Chas has a son, [[Aaron Livesy]] with her ex-husband Gordon, who she allowed custody. Aaron hated his mother, feeling that she had abandoned him. Every attempt to build a relationship had ended badly and eventually she gives up trying. She leaves Gordon and his second wife Sandra to become a family with Aaron and the baby Sandra was expecting. 

Chas makes friends with [[Carl King]] shortly after he and his family move into Holdgate Farm. They bond over the mutual feeling that they are parental failures as they are both were part-time parents and start dating. They fall in love but Carl's family don't appprove and take the opportunity to send him away after [[Paul Marsden (Emmerdale)|Paul Marsden]] dies. When Carl needs support due to feeling guilty for Paul's death, Chas offers it to him along with forgiveness. In return, Carl backs Chas up when his father [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom]] tries to evict her from Pear Tree Cottage.

Chas and Carl's relationship is rocky and during one separation, Carl has a one night stand with [[Chloe Atkinson]]. Thinking that she and Carl are an item, Chloe is horrified when Carl and Chas reconcile. Wanting to split the couple up permanently, she undermines Chasâs trust in Carl and writes a series of poison pen letters. Her ploy works and soon Carl and Chas split up again.

Trying to make Carl jealous, Chas has a brief fling with builder, [[Syd Woolfe]]. After Syd leaves the village, she dates Denzel Calburn, a local policeman. She cares for him but her feelings for Carl rise again and he splits up with her. Heartbroken and angry, Chas joins the army, leaving Carl, now single and desperate to make amends. After a drunken night with Chas's cousin, [[Delilah Dingle]], Carl suggests that they have a relationship but Del tells him to fight for Chas so he declares his love for her at an army wedding reception, infuriating Chas, especially as Carl trips whilst carrying her. He drops her and she breaks her leg and her injury ends her army career.
[[File:CHASDUNKSCHOLE.jpg|thumb|right|Chas proceeds to dunk Chloeâs head in a horseâs trough, threatening to drown her until she admits the truth (2005)]]
Carl sets up a romantic treasure hunt, featuring a videotaped marriage proposal, but Chas turns it down. Determined not to give up, Carl offers to do a wing walk to prove his devotion. Stunned by this, Chas agrees but her son Aaron tries to ruin their relationship by telling her about Carl sleeping with Del. She is furious but Del convinces her not to throw away her relationship with Carl because of their drunken one night stand. Chas gives up on Aaron after this.

Chas and Carl move into Home Farm and she works as a PA for King &amp; Sons, having done a business degree whilst in the army. They start make wedding arrangements when Tom and his girlfriend, [[Rosemary Sinclair]], bully Chas into leaving Carl and give her money to compensate. She spends weeks fretting over whether to tell Carl and, when encouraged by her cousin [[Eli Dingle|Eli]], confronts them at their wedding on Christmas Day. Chas berates and threatens Tom and this makes her a prime suspect when Tom is murdered later the same evening. Chas is cleared of suspicion and reconciles with Carl briefly but the relationship does not last.

Chas stays single for a while and gets a shock after waking up next to a dead man, Colin McFarlane. Chas and her friend [[Lexi Nicholls]] dare each other to sleep with a man they meet on that night. Chas and Lexi run away, leaving the staff to find Colin's body, fearing Chas would be suspected of murder but a post mortem reveals that Colin had died of natural causes.

Chas realises that Lexi was attracted to Carl and warns her to stay away from him. Carl and Lexi, however, begin dating. When Chas finds out, she ends her friendship with Lexi and punches Carl. Lexi tries to make amends but Chas rejects her, preferring the company of her other friends, [[Katie Sugden]], and her niece [[Debbie Dingle]].

When Chas realises that Katie has romantic feelings for [[Grayson Sinclair]], she confronts her but Katie denies it and ignores her. Chas is not happy but supports Katie when she offers to be a surrogate mother as Grayson's wife [[Perdita Hyde-Sinclair|Perdy]] cannot have children and she takes over as Grayson's hostess after he and Perdy split up. Katie discovers that Grayson was not the man she thought he was and in revenge she plans to give birth in London and put the baby up for adoption there. Chas intended to be her birth partner but Katie gives birth in the back of [[Matthew King (Emmerdale)|Matthew King]]'s car with Perdy and Matthew assisting.

Chas dates locum vet Josh Grainger briefly. The relationship goes well until the Dingles tease Josh about Chas and Shadrach moving in with him. Terrified at this prospect, Josh splits up with her and leaves the village. Chas does not see the joke at first but later admits it is. 

Laurel tells Chas that she has a half-sister, [[Genesis Walker]]. Shadrach had put her up for adoption after Gennie's mother died in childbirth. When Chas comes to terms with the revelation, she helps her father write to Gennie and feels neglected when Shadrach seems almost obsessed with his new daughter. Chas and Gennie become friends and Chas advises Gennie on how to look after her mother.

[[Donna Windsor-Dingle]] arrests Aaron for drug offences. Donna calls Chas and she goes to the police station to see him but he is not happy to see her. Driving him home, she drops him off and leaves, thinking he had had gone inside. But Aaron had actually run away as he was on the run from the criminal McFarlane family and had been sleeping rough. Aaron is eventually kidnapped by them after they track him down. Discovering this, Chas and the Dingles save him and take him home when his father, Gordon, and stepmother, Sandra, throw him out for his disruptive behaviour.

He moved into the Dingles' house and began building a relationship with Chas and her family. Chas wanted Aaron to stay with her and enrols him in the nearby school, trying to make amends with him until Lisa throws him out for encouraging Belle to steal. Aaron and Chas move in with Paddy Kirk for whom Chas worked as a receptionist. They get on well together and Chas and Paddy begin a romantic relationship. Chas is not sure whether Paddy is her type of man and wonders whether the relationship can work but Katie Sugden encourages her, telling her that Paddy is a kind and gentle man.

Carl's marriage to Lexi breaks down and he becomes determined to win Chas back. She resists for a while but after getting herself drunk, she has a one night stand with him. After some soul-searching with Katie, Chas decides to keep this secret, looking to build a future with Paddy. Carl, however, tells Paddy, who throws Chas and Aaron out after confronting her in the Woolpack. She stays briefly with Katie but moves in with Carl as Gennie makes her disapproval very clear as does Carl's half-sister [[Scarlett Nicholls]] and [[Nicola De Souza]]. Aaron is furious and after warning Chas that she had to choose - him or Carl - he moves in with the Dingles. Chas goes to try and make it up with him but Zak does not let her see him.

Chas and Carl go on a business trip to Italy. On her return, she is surprised but pleased to discover that Aaron is back living with Paddy. They come to an agreement but after Aaron disconnects the brakes on Carl's car, Carl and Chas lose their temper with Aaron and Chas tells him that she no longer wanted anything to do with him. Jimmy and Nicola take their daughter Angelica out in Carl's car and are nearly killed but Aaron, shocked at what he'd done, runs Jimmy off the road to warn him about the brakes.

Carl has an affair with [[Eve Jenson]]. Chas is heartbroken and plots revenge on Carl by proposing to him and telling him she was pregnant. Chas then plans a wedding for Christmas Day and plots to take Carl's money after he overspends, and leave him at the altar. Carl begs Chas for another chance, but she tells him that she doesn't trust him anymore and that they both know he would cheat on her again. The following day after fighting with Eve in the Woolpack, Chas moves in with Gennie and Katie at Victoria Cottage.

Chas convinces Diane Sugden, landlady of the Woolpack, that they both would benefit if Chas bought into the Woolpack as joint owner. After weeks of pestering (which include Chas helping out behind bar for free) Diane relents and needing the money, sells half the Woolpack to Chas.
