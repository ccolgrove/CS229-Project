The '''1996 Iowa Hawkeyes football team''' represented the [[University of Iowa]] in the [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|1996 college football season]]. 

==Season==
===Schedule===

Iowa finished tied for third place with Penn State in the conference and despite the head to head win, Penn State was selected to go to the Fiesta Bowl while Iowa was selected for the non-prestigious Alamo Bowl (which they won 27-0). Iowa's 21-20 win at Penn State (who finished ranked #7 in both polls) is often considered their biggest win of the year. Although they were blown out by Northwestern, they did give Ohio State a game.
