'''ImgBurn''' is a [[freeware]] program that allows the [[CD recorder|recording]] of many types of [[CD]]/[[DVD]] images to recordable media ([[Cue_sheet (computing)|.cue]] files are supported as of version 2.4.0.0).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imgburn.com/ The Official ImgBurn Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with version 2.0.0.0, ImgBurn can also burn files and data directly to CD/DVD. It supports padding DVD-Video files so the layer break occurs on a proper cell boundary (where possible).  As of version 2.5.1.0, ImgBurn includes optional [[adware]] in the installer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghacks.net/2010/03/17/dvd-burning-software-imgburn-updated-turns-adware/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
ImgBurn is an [[optical disc authoring]] software created by Lightning UK, the author of  [[DVD Decrypter]], after he was forced to stop development of DVD Decrypter in response to a [[cease and desist]] order from [[Macrovision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mennecke |first=Thomas |title=Macrovision Forces Removal of DVD Decrypter |publisher=Slyck |date=2005-11-24 |url=http://www.slyck.com/story1007.html |accessdate=2007-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ImgBurn is based on the optical disc burning engine of DVD Decrypter; however, it does not have the ability to circumvent copy protections of encrypted DVDs. As of version 2.3.0.0, ImgBurn can create image files from unencrypted CDs/DVDs. It cannot, however, remove [[Content Scramble System|CSS encryption]] or any other [[copy protection]]. It is possible to use third-party software such as [[DVD43]], an intermediate driver that operates between the hardware and software, for such purpose.
