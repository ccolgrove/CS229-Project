While incarcerated, Russell falls in love with his fellow inmate, Phillip Morris ([[Ewan McGregor]]). After Morris is released from prison, Russell escapes from prison four times in order to be reunited with Morris. The film was adapted from ''I Love You Phillip Morris: A True Story of Life, Love, and Prison Breaks'' by Steve McVicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/displayarticle.php?id=193045|title=Release Diary: March 19, 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Simon Reynolds|date=January 2009|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is the [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] of [[Glenn Ficarra]] and [[John Requa]]. It grossed a little over $20 million worldwide after its limited theatrical release.&lt;ref&gt;http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=iloveyouphillipmorris.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Steven Jay Russell]] ([[Jim Carrey]]) is on his deathbed, recalling the events of his life. He spent his early adult years in [[Virginia Beach]] as a police officer. He plays the organ at church, has unenthusiastic sex with his wife, Debbie ([[Leslie Mann]]), and spends his off hours searching for his biological mother, who gave him up as a child. Steven locates his biological mother, but she rejects him without explanation.

After a car crash, Steven leaves his family and previous life behind (though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter), and explores the world as his true self - a [[gay]] man. He moves to [[Miami]], finds a boyfriend ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]), and lives a luxurious lifestyle. To keep himself and his boyfriend in the style to which they have become accustomed, Steven becomes a con man. Steven is caught and sent to prison, where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris ([[Ewan McGregor]]). 

Steven cannot bear to be separated from Phillip. After being released, he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer, then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as [[chief financial officer]] of a large company.

Steven eventually gets caught [[embezzlement|embezzling]] from the company, and goes back to prison. Phillip is also sent to jail as an accomplice, and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again. Months later, Phillip learns from another inmate that Steven is dying of [[AIDS]]. Heartbroken, Phillip calls Steven while he is in the infirmary and confesses that while he is still upset with Steven for lying to him, he still loves him. Phillip is later told that Steven has died.

Sometime later, Phillip is taken to meet with his lawyer and finds Steven waiting for him. Steven describes how he faked having AIDS and dying in order to see Phillip again, and promises to never lie to him again. He runs one last con to break Phillip out out of jail, only to be caught when he runs into an old coworker. 

The end of the movie explains that the real-life Phillip Morris was released from jail in 2006, but Steven is still imprisoned, on 23-hour lockup, only having one free hour a day to shower and exercise.

The last scene shows Steven laughing joyfully while running across the prison yard, guards in pursuit, in another attempt to be with Phillip.
