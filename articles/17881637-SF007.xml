'''Citrix XenApp''' (formerly '''Citrix WinFrame Server''', '''Citrix MetaFrame Server''' and '''Citrix Presentation Server''') is a [[thin client]] product that allows users to connect to their corporate applications. XenApp can host applications on central servers and allow users to interact with them remotely or stream and deliver them to user devices for local execution.

== Technical description ==
XenApp began life as an application hosting solution. Since 2007, XenApp has included application virtualization and streaming technologies that enable application delivery to user devices.

=== Network protocol ===
The core XenApp application hosting technology utilizes [[Citrix Systems]]' proprietary presentation layer protocol or [[thin client]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] called [[Independent Computing Architecture]] (ICA).

Unlike [[framebuffer]]ed protocols like [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]], ICA transmits high-level window display information, much like the [[X Window System|X11]] protocol, as opposed to purely graphical information. The Citrix Display Driver is installed in Session Space and captures high level [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] draw commands, which can be replayed on GDI-capable clients, for example Windows-based clients. Clients are available for several [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[Microsoft Windows CE|CE]], [[16-bit]], [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] platforms), [[Mac OS]], [[Linux]], and other [[Unix-like]] systems.

Citrix MetaFrame version 3.x and 4.x servers listen for client connections on [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 2598, by default.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX104147&amp;searchID=44199488 CTX104147 - Explaining ICA Session Reliability, Common Gateway Protocol, on TCP Port 2598 - Citrix Knowledge Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=citrix_port1&gt;[http://www.brianmadden.com/content/content.asp?ID=266 Goodbye 1494, Hello 2598! Citrix Enhances ICA and Changes its Default Port - From BrianMadden.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the Session Reliability feature is disabled, then the server will listen on port 1494.  Older MetaFrame servers (those running MetaFrame version 2.x or earlier) do not have the Session Reliability feature, and therefore always default to port 1494.remotely.

Both local and hosted application delivery methods in XenApp use existing network transmission protocols including [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]], [[Server Message Block|SMB and CIFS]].

=== Server components ===
The Citrix Developer Network contains a set of software development kits that enable custom development for XenApp. These SDKs include the following:

* Citrix XenApp SDK
* Citrix Virtual Channel SDK
* Citrix ICA Client Object SDK
* Citrix Web Interface SDK
* Citrix Simulation API SDK

XenApp components, including application hosting servers, if any, reside on a [[Microsoft Windows]] computer, which can be either standalone or part of a larger cluster (farm) of Citrix servers. It is important to note that in addition to concurrent user Citrix [[licensing]], there must exist a Terminal Server Client Access License ([[Client Access License|CAL]]) and a Windows Server CAL from Microsoft for each client connection.  Both products must be adequately licensed for the environment to function correctly.

=== Client components ===
There is a web-based Citrix client, freely available under the name Web Interface for XenApp. The Web Interface client may be used as a secure ICA [[proxy server|proxy]] over HTTPS when combined with [[Citrix Secure Gateway]], both of which are included in the base XenApp product. XenApp also supports three [[UNIX]] variants: [[HP-UX]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[IBM AIX|AIX]] which are included in Enterprise and Platinum editions of XenApp.

== UNIX version ==
Presentation Server for UNIX is available for Solaris (SPARC and x86), AIX, and HP-UX. Patches typically come out first for the Solaris version. The product started as MetaFrame for Solaris 1.0 which was released in March 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MetaFrame for UNIX (MFU) 1.1 added support for AIX and HP-UX and came out in the fall of that year and Feature Release 1 came out about a year later. The next version came out in the first half of 2003. It was originally planned as MFU 1.1 Feature Release 2 but was rebranded MetaFrame Presentation Server for UNIX 1.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, references to MFU 1.1. FR2 can still be found (e.g. in the license key). Presentation Server for UNIX (PSU) 4.0 was released in the first half of 2005 and was the first version to be bundled with the Presentation Server suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing customers paying for upgrades and new versions (known as Subscription Advantage) can however continue to get just the UNIX version. Existing MFU 1.x installs cannot be upgraded to PSU4; instead a clean install is required.

== Competition ==
Citrix XenApp competitors include Microsoft [[Remote Desktop Services|Terminal Services]] for [[Windows Server 2008]], [[Quest Software]] vWorkspace, [[Systancia]] AppliDis Fusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.datamonitor.com/store/Product/News.aspx?productid=8851481F-71C3-4B2C-8CE8-4F8882343B42 |title=Systancia offers application and desktop virtualization in a single product |publisher=DataMonitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xenocode|Spoon]] Server and [[Ericom Software]] WebConnect. XenApp is built on top of the Windows Terminal Server platform which was originally developed by Citrix in the early-mid 90s. [[Win4Lin]] Virtual Desktop Server provided similar functionality for serving sessions from Linux servers, while Sun's application virtualization offering, the [[Sun Secure Global Desktop]], serves to provide a complete solution allowing for the delivery of both Windows and Unix applications on all major platforms.
