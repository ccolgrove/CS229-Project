|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Sookie Stackhouse is a telepathic waitress in a small-town restaurant and the main protagonist of the series. Because of her ability, she has difficulty forming lasting human relationships. She becomes involved in a romantic relationship with a vampire, Bill, upon discovering that she can't read his mind. This relationship with a supernatural being causes a lot of controversy in her small town. Through Bill, she finds herself entering into a world of creatures and supernatural conflict that surpasses her worst nightmares. She has lived with her grandmother, Adele Stackhouse, since childhood, after the death of her parents. After Adele's death Sookie inherits the home. It is revealed in season 3 that Sookie is part faerie, another race of supernaturals that are widely believed to have been driven to extinction by vampires who drained them of their blood to obtain the ability to walk in the sun and not burn. The faeries commonly refer to this as &quot;stealing their light&quot; and hence have a distinct fear and hatred of vampires. It is from the faeries that Sookie inherited her telepathic powers, magical light and apparently delicious tasting blood. Sookie comes into contact with a community of faeries living in a hidden world in Bon Temps and after learning of Bill's betrayal at the end of season 3, goes to join them in their magical world only to learn it was a trick by the fae in order to keep all the humans with faery DNA in the faery world. Sookie returns to Bon Temps to learn a year passed when for her it was only several minutes.

|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Bill Compton is a vampire romantically involved with Sookie. Turned during the American Civil War against his will, Bill shows more compassion for human life than many other vampires. He is outwardly expressive of his emotions and holds onto memories of his past human life, behaviors that are unique amongst his vampire peers. While not an extremely old vampire, Bill is quite powerful and was referred to by Russell Edgington as one of the most promising vampires in the Americas. Bill risks his life and standing in vampire society to protect Sookie from those who wish to take advantage of her faery ancestry. It is revealed in season 3 and hinted at in season 2 that Bill's original purpose for returning to Bon Temps was to discover if Sookie was a faerie and if so deliver her to Queen Sophie Anne to whom he was loyal at the time, so that she could drain Sookie's blood and gain the ability to walk in the sun and not burn. She may have realized Sookie's faerie ancestry from Hadley, Sookie's cousin who is a favorite human companion of the queen, who may have inadvertently revealed information about Sookie's powers. Once Sookie discovers what she believes to be the true reason for Bill's interest in her, she banishes him from her life. Shortly after the queen arrives at Bill's house in Bon Temps expecting him to hand Sookie over to her; when he refuses the two begin a duel to the death. By making a deal with Nan Flanngan, Bill has the queen killed by human snipers and becomes the new king of Louisiana. 

In early episodes it is revealed that Bill had a human wife and two children (Tom and Sarah) before he became a vampire. A short time after being turned Bill returns to his family in his desperation to see them one last time. He discovers that his son has recently died of an illness (pox). Upon seeing his tears of blood at the death of his son his wife becomes hysterical at which point Lorena, the vampire who turned Bill, steps in and glamors her. Bill too glamors her and with Lorena leaves his human family forever. The fates of Bill's wife and young daughter, who was not present during his return home, are unclear though Adele Stackhouse makes reference to the recently deceased previous owner of Bill's family home as the last Compton in Bon Temps, who may have been a descendent of Bill's daughter. Though, in episode 4 of the fourth season, Bill involves into sexual relationship with Portia Bellefleur (sister of Sheriff Bellefleur) and upon meeting her grandmother, he finds out that she is a decendent of his daughter Sarah and consequently breaks up with Portia.

| [[Sam Merlotte]] || [[Sam Trammell]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]], [[True Blood (season 2)|2]], [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || -
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Sam Merlotte is the owner of Merlotte's, where Sookie works. During the first season, Sam is characterized by his adoration and loyalty towards Sookie Stackhouse. When Bill Compton becomes involved with Sookie, he openly disapproves of their relationship and, despite initial support of vampire rights, feels as though vampires and humans should be separate whether they're equals or not. Sam is a shape shifter and is often seen watching over Sookie in the form of a dog, and the first supernatural introduced to the series that isn't a vampire. It is presumable that Bill is aware that Sam is a shifter, suggesting in one episode that Sam is the only one who can protect Sookie while he is away and displaying a coldness to Sam in his dog form. Due to his nature, Sam is targeted by a [[maenad]] in the second season. As Sam was adopted as a baby, in the third season he explores his family background and meets his somewhat backward birth family which consists of his alcoholic father, his manipulative mother and crude younger brother. Sam's mother and brother both have the ability to shape shift though his father does not. Sam's adopted parents abandoned him when he was a teenager after witnessing his first transformation into a beagle. He returned home to find they had moved, leaving behind all his possessions. It is from his adopted father, on his death bed, that he learns the identities of his birth parents though he is warned by his adopted mother that they are bad people and he is better off not knowing them. Sam suffers from anger issues and has a darker hidden past.

| [[Jason Stackhouse]] || [[Ryan Kwanten]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]], [[True Blood (season 2)|2]], [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || -
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Jason Stackhouse is Sookie's not-too-bright, self-involved brother, who is vigilant in defending and protecting Sookie. He supervises a road crew during the day, and is known for bedding the women of Bon Temps at night. During the first season, he is the prime suspect in the murders of four women, all of whom have a connection to him. After the death of his V-addict girlfriend Amy, he comes to believe that he is responsible for the murders. He is then recruited by the Fellowship of the Sun, an anti-vampire church, who approve of what they believe to be his crime of killing fangbangers. During the second season, Jason briefly becomes an active member of the Fellowship, but later leaves it. In the third season, he develops a relationship with a supernatural creature, Crystal Norris, and thinks of joining the police. Crystal is forced to leave town with her fiance but Jason pledges to find her. Like his sister Jason is also part faerie though he does not appear to have inherited any of the special abilities that Sookie possesses. However, some speculate that his potential faerie &quot;ability&quot; is the sexual magnetism that many faeries possess. In season 4 he is a deputy on the Bon Temps police force and caretaker of the werepanthers of Hotshot.

| [[Tara Thornton]] || [[Rutina Wesley]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]], [[True Blood (season 2)|2]], [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || -
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Tara Thornton has been Sookie Stackhouse's best friend since they were children. Tara grew up in a very abusive home with an alcoholic mother, and consequently finds it difficult to fit in with normal society or to trust people. She is very adept at reading people and constantly distances herself from others by speaking her observations candidly and plainly. As a result, she has difficulty holding down a job until she becomes a bartender at Merlotte's. In the first season, Tara deals with her alcoholic mother and ultimately pays for her mother to have a faux exorcism from &quot;Miss Janette&quot; who turns out to be a cashier at a pharmacy in a nearby town who was scamming them. Before discovering the scam, Tara returns to Miss Janette for her own exorcism which she believes will put her life on track. During the exorcism ritual Tara sees herself as a child with black eyes, though this is later revealed to have been Marianne's consciousness attracted by the spiritual power of ritual. In the second season, she is under the influence of the [[maenad]] Marianne Forrester, who manipulates her intense relationship with a man named Eggs (Benedict). Eggs is shot dead by Jason while admitting forcefully to Andy Bellefleur his guilt to the murders Marianne forced him to do while under her influence. Having lost the only man she ever loved Tara attempts suicide in the third season by taking pills though the attempt is thwarted by Lafayette. 

Tara is later abducted by a delusional vampire who believes she loves him. He holds her captive for many days, even taking her to the mansion of Russell Edginton, for whom he works, where he plans to turn her into a vampire. She eventually escapes the vampire by tricking him into letting her drink his blood so she would have the power to smash his skull with one of the weapons that adorned the wall of their room. However this does not kill him and he comes after her, eventually being killed by Jason at Merlotte's. Tara ends up traumatized by her experience and after discovering that Jason had been the one who killed Eggs, cuts off her hair and leaves Bon Temps. In season 4, Tara has moved to New Orleans and working as a cage fighter, and is in a relationship with another fighter, Naomi. In the season 4 finale, Tara is shot in the side of her head while trying to save Sookie from Debbie. Sookie picks her up from a pool of her own blood, cradling her and screaming for help. It is currently unknown whether she is alive or not.

|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Lafayette Reynolds, Tara's cousin, is a short order cook at Merlotte's, a drug dealer, a member of Jason Stackhouse's road crew, and a gay prostitute. During the first season, he is seen selling vampire blood. Due to this, Eric captures and tortures him in the second season, only to instruct him on selling vampire blood once again in the third season, at the queen's orders. In the third season, Lafayette is introduced to a male witch, Jesus, who becomes his romantic interest. Jesus works as a nurse for Lafayette's mother, Ruby ([[Alfre Woodard]]), who is aggressively Christian and mentally ill, though she often has moments of unexpected clarity. In season 4 Lafayette begins to explore wicca with his fellow lover/witch Jesus. Lafayette is killed at the end of the first novel in the series. In ''True Blood'', he is saved due to the popularity of his character and to help expand Tara Thornton's role in the series. 

In casting, Alan Ball had concerns that the character's sexuality would be a dominating trait, &quot;because you don't want to bring in someone who's going to play that in a phony way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lafayette Philly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hiltbrand |first=David|title=Actor brings extended life to 'True Blood' character |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/20100704_Actor_brings_extended_life_to__True_Blood__character.html|work=Philadelphia Enquirer|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelsan Ellis says that it took him a few episodes to find the character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ellis Vibe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Rhett|first=Starrene |title=Nelsan Ellis (Lafayette) Talks 'True Blood,' Gay Marriage, Tyler Perry |url=http://www.vibe.com/content/nelsan-ellis-lafayette-talks-true-blood-gay-marriage-tyler-perry|work=Vibe Magazine|accessdate=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis says that he based many of Lafayette's mannerisms on his mother and his sister,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lafayette Philly&quot; /&gt; and that the costuming also helps him get into character.

| [[Eric Northman]] || [[Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]], [[True Blood (season 2)|2]], [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || -
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Eric Northman is the Sheriff of Area 5, a vampire district in Louisiana. A Swedish Viking warrior in life, he is over 1,000 years old and is a powerful member of the vampire community. He runs the vampire bar, Fangtasia, in Shreveport, and develops an interest in Sookie Stackhouse after discovering her unique ability to read minds during the first season. He requests Sookie's services in finding a thief in the first season, then enlists her aid again in the second, seeking to retrieve his maker Godric, an ancient vampire gone missing in [[Dallas]]. His attraction to Sookie becomes more apparent as he tricks her into consuming his blood. In the third season, however, he protects Sookie from werewolf attacks and becomes intent on revenge on vampire king Russell Edgington, after discovering that Russell was the vampire who killed his human relatives before Eric became a vampire. Eric's father is shown to have worn a crown which was taken by Russell Edgington to add to his collection which suggests that Eric's family may have been early Swedish nobles or royalty. In season 4 he buys Sookie's house while she is away in Fae and is cursed by Marnie while trying to shut down her coven. He is left without memory of who he is and is taken in by Sookie. Eric demonstrates more sensitivity with Sookie and the two fall in love. He is confronted by Marnie again who possesses him to kill Bill. Sookie uses her powers to stop Eric from killing Bill, releasing him from Marnie's control and restoring his memories from before and during his amnesia. While his old personality has returned, he is still in love with Sookie. Eric and Bill then team up to stop Marnie. After stopping her, Eric and Bill are both rejected by Sookie, who loves them both. When Nan visits, she reveals that both Eric and Bill have been sentenced to the True Death. However, she reveals she is starting a rebellion against the Authority after having been sentenced herself and asks them to join. When she threatens Sookie, Eric decapitates her guards to distract her so Bill can stake her.

| [[Pamela Swynford De Beaufort|Pam]] || [[Kristin Bauer]] || [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]], [[True Blood (season 2)|2]]
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Pamela Swynford De Beaufort, commonly referred to as simply Pam, made into a vampire by Eric about a century before the events of the series, is introduced during the first season as his loyal (albeit lazy) assistant and the bouncer at Fangtasia. Though Pam's background has largely not been explored within True Blood, she and Eric occasionally speak to one another in Swedish. She also has claimed that she used to be a prostitute &quot;a long, long time ago&quot;. Cynical and apparently devoid of feelings for anyone except Eric, she is often by his side though she does not accompany him to Dallas in the second season, presumably she was told to run Fangtasia in Eric's absence. After Lafayette is healed by Eric's blood, Pam enlists him to sell V for Eric. Throughout the series, Pam often displays lesbian tendencies and is even seen performing a sexual act on the new female dancer at Fangtasia who later becomes jealous of Pam for her close relationship with Eric. In season three Pam was briefly held captive and tortured by the Magister, who was trying to find out who was selling V though she revealed nothing, further proving for fierce loyalty to Eric. She wept tears of blood when Eric attempted to burn Russell Edgington in the sun and himself in the process. This was the first time she had been seen to show deep emotions. In season four, after she finds out about the incident with Eric and the witches, she goes after them and demands that Marnie removes the spell she cast on Eric. Marnie tries to cooperate at first, but is once again possessed by the witch Antonia's spirit, and casts a spell on Pam to make her face rot, which leaves Pam horrified.

| [[Jessica Hamby]] || [[Deborah Ann Woll]] || [[True Blood (season 2)|2]], [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]]
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Jessica Hamby is a young vampire &quot;made&quot; by Bill as a part of his punishment for murdering a fellow vampire at the end of the first season. Having been raised in an overly strict Christian family, she relishes the freedom that comes with being a vampire, but her petulant attitude often tries Bill's patience. At Bill's request, for most of her part in season 1 she lives at Fangtasia with Pam and Eric who apparently let her feed on a man with tattoos and body piercings, though they quickly become frustrated and annoyed by her and return her to Bill not long after. During season two, Jessica finds a love interest in Hoyt Fortenberry, but he ends their involvement after she attacks his obnoxious mother. During the third season, Jessica makes several young-vampire mistakes, such as accidentally draining a person to death. She eventually rekindles her romance with Hoyt and moves in with him. Jessica is a character exclusive to the series; she does not appear in the ''Southern Vampire Mysteries''. Jessica is increasingly frustrated by the constant regrowth of her hymen after sex, remarking angrily that she will be a virgin forever.

|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Bud Dearborne is the sheriff of Renard Parish and an old friend of Sookie and Jason's deceased parents. While he is well respected in the town of Bon Temps, he goes out of his way to show his distaste for vampires and vocally objects to Sookie's relationship with Bill. He doesn't believe Jason is the murderer in the first season. Despite the blatant prejudice he shows Bill, he regularly scolds Andy for being unfair and biased in his dealings with suspects. In the second season, he investigates the murders of Miss Jeanette and Daphne. His attempts at identifying and locating their killer is complicated by the outrageous behavior of Bon Temps' residents while under Maryann's influence. In the third season, Bud resigns after yet another murder takes place and leaves Andy Bellefleur in charge.

|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Andy Bellefleur is a police detective in Bon Temps who is somewhat incompetent at his job and is regularly disrespected by the town's citizens. He is a recovering alcoholic. He is assigned to investigate the series of murders that occur during the first season. Throughout the season, Jason Stackhouse is Andy's primary suspect even when evidence doesn't point toward him being responsible. He is suspended from his duties in the second season, but makes a comeback as he claims to have shot Eggs, whom the town believes responsible for murders committed by Maryann. In the third season, he takes over from Sheriff Dearborne and reluctantly trains Jason in being a police officer. For most of Maryann's reign of terror he manages to keep from falling under her influence until the night she is killed by Sam. Andy is one of the few Bon Temps residents who remembers what Maryann had done, although his knowledge of who and what she was appears limited as he was heavily intoxicated a lot of the time. In season 4 he is shown to have an addiction to V &quot;vampire blood&quot;. It is also revealed in season 4 that his sister Portia is a direct descendant of Bill Compton, this would also mean that Andy too is a direct descendant of Bill's.

|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Hoyt Fortenberry is Jason's best friend, who works on the road crew. Sweet and good-hearted, he is the only person whose thoughts are consistently kind when Sookie eavesdrops and is unprejudiced against vampires. He is extremely shy around women, and takes the prospect of forming a relationship seriously. For the majority of the first season he is bossed around by his mother, but eventually stands up to her. In the second season, he begins a relationship with Jessica, a newly turned vampire and Bill Compton's vampire-ward. He breaks up with her after she attacks his mother, but they rekindle their romance during the third season and are shown to be living together in the fourth season. Hoyt breaks up with Jessica due to her difficulties having a normal relationship and her growing feelings for Jason, though he is unaware of the latter.

|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Arlene Fowler is a waitress at Merlotte's. A four-time divorcee, she is a single mother of two. While she has a good heart, she is often apt to resort to bigotry (directed at vampires) and openly disapproves of Sookie's relationship with Bill. Arlene often makes remarks that have distinctly racist undertones though this often appears to be unintentional. Toward the end of the first season, she becomes engaged to her boyfriend Rene, who later turns out to be a murderer and is later killed in self defense by Sookie when he attacks her. During the second season, she develops a relationship with Terry Bellefleur but soon discovers she is pregnant with what she believes to be Rene's baby in season three. She soon becomes depressed and afraid that her baby will grow up to be a serial killer and then, with the aid of the new waitress at Merlotte's, she secretly attempts to have a miscarriage using a mysterious brew, to no avail. While initially Terry believed the baby was his, when Arlene informs him that it is Rene's Terry tells her the baby's paternity is no issue to him and her fear of her unborn child's future seems to slacken, knowing that there will be a good man in its life though it is unknown if her intention to miscarry still lingers. After the birth of her baby she remains adamant that her baby is evil due to Rene's genetics

He is one of the few who are kind to Bill and he finds him to be a kindred soul as Bill is a veteran like him. While working at Merlotte's, he begins to show interest in Arlene, and the two become romantically involved during the second season. Due to Maryann's influence, their relationship appears to progress more quickly than Terry wants. In the third season, Arlene reveals she's pregnant with Rene's baby, but Terry still wants to be the child's parent.

He even tells Marcus he's open to moving up in the pack to please Debbie. His relationship with Debbie becomes strained when she senses Alcide might have feelings for Sookie after he saves her life. In addition, Alcide doesn't want the same things that Debbie does, such as a family and being more involved with the pack. Alcide also loses faith in Marcus after Marcus beats Tommy to death. He and Sam eventually team up to exact vengeance on Marcus. Seeing Marcus in his bedroom with Debbie becomes the last straw for Alcide and after Sam beats up Marcus, Alcide breaks his windpipe to protect Sam and formally breaks it off with Debbie.

| Lorena Krasiki|| [[Mariana Klaveno]] || [[True Blood (season 2)|2]], [[True Blood (season 3)|3]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]]
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Lorena is the vampire who &quot;made&quot; Bill. She is first introduced briefly in season 1 when Bill, fresh from the field of battle in the 1860s, came to her small house in the woods seeking assistance. Pretending to be a lone widow at the time to seduce men and then feed on them she let him in and proceeded to seduce him, when he refused her advances she attacked him and after becoming intrigued by him eventually turned him into a vampire. A lonely yet malevolent being, Lorena quickly becomes emotionally dependent on Bill. Through her influence he becomes a crazed killer and together they revel in the torture of humans before draining them of their blood, often having sex as their victims bleed to death watching. When Bill realizes the monster he has become he forces Lorena to release him and leaves her. 

The two do not meet again for over 70 years when in season 2 she is summoned to the vampire hotel in Texas by Eric who, in his desperation to find Godric, schemes with her to hold Bill captive while Sookie infiltrates the Fellowship of the Sun so that he cannot interfere. Lorena is coerced into Eric's plan. Her love and longing for Bill has intensified over the years and as she holds him captive the two share memories of their twisted past together. Bill eventually escapes after hitting her over the head with a plasma television. Lorena makes an appearance at the party after Godric is freed from the Fellowship of the Sun and challenges Sookie who aggressively defends her relationship with Bill and warns Lorena off him. When she tries to attack Sookie she is stopped by Godric who again comments on her old age and how she has not bettered herself in all that time he then orders her to leave his area which she begrudgingly does but not before an emotional departing with Bill outside. 

Lorena returns in season 3 when Bill is captured by Russell Edgington. At the time she appears to have been living as a guest in Russell's mansion. Upon seeing Lorena Bill becomes enraged and hurls a lamp at her, bursting her into flames. Lorena of course survives this. Russell leaves Bill to Lorena and though at first Bill resists her advances, the two end up having very violent sex in which he twists her neck 180 degrees. After this he calls Sookie and ends their relationship though he did so only to protect her and delude Lorena who believes he has returned to her. Eventually Bill's deception becomes apparent and she resolves to kill him due her instruction from Russell. She spends a lengthy and very emotional time torturing him in the servants house in the mansion grounds before allowing werewolves to feed on his blood. When Sookie escaped from Russell and bursts into the room to save Bill, Lorena attacks her but Sookie gets the upper hand and plunges a piece of wood into Lorena's chest, thus killing her.

|{{anchor|Rene Lenier|Drew Marshall}}Rene Lenier/Drew Marshall || [[Michael Raymond-James]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]] || [[True Blood (season 3)|3]], [[True Blood (season 4)|4]]
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Rene Lenier was the main antagonist of Season 1. Rene Lenier is introduced as a [[Cajun]] resident of Bon Temps, a co-worker and friend of Jason; although it is not revealed until the season finale. Initially, he is portrayed as a protagonist that approves of Sookie dating a vampire. He becomes engaged to Arlene and is widely respected in Bon Temps. However, Sookie eventually comes to suspect that he is the perpetrator behind a series of murders involving women associated with vampires. She finds out Rene, whose real name was Drew Marshall, had previously lived in [[Bunkie, Louisiana]], but fled the town after killing his sister Cindy, a &quot;fangbanger&quot;. Now speaking with a trained Cajun accent and living under a fake identity, he used Jason as an unwitting source for knowledge about women who've slept with vampires. Towards the end of the season, some characters beside Sookie realize Rene is the murderer, hence when he ultimately comes after Sookie, both Sam and Bill jump to her rescue. Sookie kills Rene in self-defense, but Arlene later learns she is pregnant with his child and becomes greatly concerned over carrying an &quot;evil child&quot;. 

Rene appears before Arlene in the season 4 finale and warns her about &quot;him&quot;. Whether he's sincere and whether it was Terry he meant is left ambiguous. 
|-
|{{anchor|Maryann Forrester}}Maryann Forrester || [[Michelle Forbes]] || [[True Blood (season 2)|2]] || [[True Blood (season 1)|1]]
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Maryann Forrester was the main antagonist of Season 2. Maryann Forrester is a wealthy [[maenad]], who initially presents herself as a social worker. Drawn to Bon Temps due to the potent energy she attributes to a ritual performed by a faux [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo doctor]], she takes an interest in Tara and has Tara move in with her. She introduces Tara to Benedict Talley, a troubled man she had previously taken in to take care of and used to kill several of her victims. Throughout the second season, Maryann's true nature becomes apparent: she is devoted to [[Dionysus]] and intends to find a suitable supernatural creature to kill in his honor, hoping to bring him to earth once again. She finds pleasure in hosting giant orgies, creating mayhem and chaos and witnessing pure lust. She controls the actions of the inhabitants of Bon Temps by putting a bizarre spell on them, which turns their eyes completely black and has them do her bidding. Sookie, however, is unaffected by Maryann's spell. Maryann turns into a full-blown antagonist when she settles into Sookie's house and orders the Bon Temps residents to capture Sam Merlotte, whom she intends to sacrifice in her tribute to Dionysus. She ultimately succeeds in capturing Sam and has Eggs slide a knife in his heart, but Bill saves Sam. Sam, shifting into a white bull, has Maryann believe Dionysus has returned to earth. Hence Maryann drops her supernatural shields and Sam, still in the guise of a white bull, is able to kill Maryann for good. After she is killed the town returns to their senses and have no memory of what they had done under Maryann's influence and remember her simply as the elegant woman who threw wild parties.
|-
|{{anchor|Russell Edgington}}Russell Edgington || [[Denis O'Hare]] || [[True Blood (season 3)|3]] || -
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Russell Edgington was the main antagonist of Season 3. A 2800-year-old vampire, Russell is the vampire king of Mississippi. He was born a Celt, though he speaks in German when angered. It is implied that he allied himself with Hitler during WWII, telling Eric Northman, &quot;Adolf was right; there is a Master Race...it's just not the '''human''' race.&quot; Though often gentle and polite, he is also shown to be wrathful, manipulative, and somewhat mentally unstable (particularly after the death of his consort Talbot) not recognizing the power that &quot;the Authority&quot; suposedly have over vampires in general, and secretly defying them (as shown when he kills the Magister). His great age means he is much stronger and faster than Eric or Bill, who he effortlessly defeats in single combat. He can also fly.

He abducts Bill in season three in hopes of gathering intel on the queen of Louisiana, with whom he hopes to enter into a [[lavender marriage]], not to conceal his orientation, but instead, to merge their respective kingdoms. After discovering that Sookie has unusual abilities, Russell takes an interest in her. When Bill is no longer of use to him, he orders for his execution, but Sookie thwarts his plans. After Eric kills Russell's consort Talbot in retaliation for Russell murdering Eric's human family centuries ago, Russell becomes hysterical and kills an anchorman on live television to address a statement to the world, in which he announces his view that vampires and humans aren't equals and vampires will rule over them. This has widespread fallout as shown in season 4 with the vampires focusing hard on improving their image. Eric, Sookie and Bill manage to dispose of Russell at the end of the third season by tricking him and burying him underneath concrete. 

In the season 4 finale it is implied that Russell has escaped the concrete, when Alcide finds a mysterious hole in a parking garage floor with silver chains discarded near it.

|{{anchor|Marnie Stonebrook}}Marnie Stonebrook || [[Fiona Shaw]] || [[True Blood (season 4)|4]] || -
|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Marnie Stonebrook was the main antagonist of Season 4. Marnie Stonebrook is a local shop-owner and palm-reader, and leader of the Wiccan coven to which Holly Cleary and Jesus Velasquez belong. A timid character, she comes under the influence of the spirit of Antonia, whose great power allows her to raise a bird from the dead. Seeing an apparent necromancer as a threat to vampires, Bill Compton sends Eric Northman to break up the meetings, but Antonia possesses Marnie to cast a spell on him wiping Eric's memories. Marnie is unsure how the spell worked, but attempts to reverse it under pressure from Pam. When Pam, impatient, becomes menacing, Antonia again inhabits Marnie, and casts a spell on Pam, disfiguring her. Marnie's students quickly abandon her as a result. Bill has Marnie captured and imprisoned in his mansion, but she admits while glamored that she has no idea how to reverse either spell. She is then fully taken over by Antonia, who plans to kill all vampires. Tara runs into her walking down a road while waiting for Pam to attack her, and they band together to get revenge on vampires. Antonia gathers the coven of Wiccans to fight against the vampire race. When the battle becomes to extreme, the others want out but she forces them to stay. After the massacre of the Tolerance Festival, Antonia is disheartened by seeing innocent casualties and leaves Marnie's body, but Marnie convinces her to rejoin her as collateral damage is to be expected, revealing a shift in her attitudes. After Marnie cold bloodedly kills a member of the coven Antonia wants out, but Marnie puts a binding spell on her drawing her back in. Jesus performs a ritual to free Antonia's spirit from Marnie. Bill shoots Marnie, killing her. However, Marnie's spirit appears before Lafayette and enters his body. She kills Jesus to steal his power and then tries to burn Eric and Bill at the stake. With the help of Holly, Sookie and Tara, the spirits of Antonia and Adele appear and convince Marnie it is time to leave the realm of the living, which she does.

|-
|colspan=&quot;5&quot;| Adele Stackhouse (nÃ©e Hale), commonly referred to as &quot;Gran&quot;, is Jason and Sookie's paternal grandmother. Her husband is missing, pressumed dead. A widow living on her own, she raised Jason and Sookie following their parents' death. Sookie keeps living with her after becoming an adult and later inherits Gran's house. She is portrayed as a very kind-hearted, motherly figure, with even Tara Thornton's mother crediting her for raising Tara when she couldn't. She is one of the few characters who supports Sookie's relationship with Bill, and is greatly interested in Bill's historic knowledge of Bon Temps, as she is head of the &quot;Descendants of the Glorious Dead&quot;, an organization devoted to honoring the memory of the Civil War. Mid-season, Adele is brutally killed by Rene Lenier, who originally came to her house to murder Sookie. Adele had a brother, Bartlett Hale ([[Cheyenne Wilbur]]), whose pedophilic affinity for Sookie when she was a child prompted Bill to kill him. At the time he had been disowned by Adele after she too discovered his desires for her granddaughter and the two had apparently not spoken for many years. In the season 4 finale, Adele's spirit appears to take Marnie's spirit out of Lafayette.

During the first season, she convinces Tara to fund an exorcism to expel a demon that she is convinced lives inside her. She blames the demon for her actions, claiming he targeted her for her closeness with Jesus. Tara reluctantly agrees to pay for Lettie Mae's exorcism, after which Lettie Mae visually and mentally improves and develops into a faithful member of the local Christian community. The woman that performed the exorcism, Miss Jeanette, is exposed as a fraud and later killed by Maryann, but Lettie Mae refuses to believe her exorcism was unreal. In the second season, she assists her gay nephew Lafayette in taking Tara away from Maryann's detrimental influence but is later manipulated by Tara, who wants to go and save Eggs from Maryann, and holds a gun on Lafayette and Sookie while Tara runs to help him. This dissolved the short truce she had with Lafayette who was visibly scared during the experience due to the shock of his torture at the hands of Eric the vampire. In the third season, Lettie Mae is oblivious to a suicide attempt of her daughter as she happily &quot;converses&quot; with the reverend who had come by to speak religiously with Tara. When Tara pays her mother a visit on her way to leave Bon Temps for good, she discovers Lettie Mae is having an affair with her church's married reverend who had previous appeared apprehensive of her subtle advances. In an episode of the fourth season, it's discovered that she's now the reverend's wife. Lettie Mae's sister is Lafayette's mother. She comments to Tara that she pities her for having to raise a sexual deviant, which is the only reference she makes to her sister in the series.

He is featured mainly in the second season, as Jason decides to join his church. In the second season, his church holds Eric's maker Godric, who came to them voluntarily, in custody with the intention of burning him to death publicly. When Sookie and Bill start investigating Godric's disappearance, Newlin orders Sookie's abduction, but it fails. Later, when Sookie visits his church in disguise, he recognizes her and locks her in his basement. Godric and the Texas vampires, however, thwart his plans of burning everyone associated with Godric, lecturing him on vampires showing more humanity than Newlin and his humans. In the third season, he makes recurring appearances on television, especially after Russell Edgington slaughters an anchorman on live television and Newlin sees his chance to call for the death of all vampires once again. An earlier interview with Nan Flanagan reveals Newlin was being investigated by the IRS and apparently going through a divorce seen in the postmortem of the episode &quot;I Got a Right to Sing the Blues&quot;.

Jason and his V-addicted girlfriend Amy abduct him so as to use him as a V-reservoir, but as Jason tries to free Eddie, he is staked by Amy.

== Additional characters ==
===Supporting vampire characters===
{{small|In order of first appearances}}

==== Nan Flanagan ====
'''Nan Flanagan''' is the spokesperson for the [[American Vampire League]] and has intermittently been shown being interviewed on televised news programs within the series. She presents a beautiful, unthreatening view of vampires to the human community at large. She denounces acts of violence committed against vampires (especially those perpetrated by the Fellowship of the Sun during the second season) and denies allegations of vampire attacks on humans based on a lack of evidence. Off the air, she is revealed to be much more aggressive and not possessed of particularly lofty ideals. In &quot;I Will Rise Up&quot;, it is implied that she is a high-level bureaucrat within the vampire community, a position that gives her the authority to fire [[#Godric|Godric]]. Although she has power over sheriffs, Sophie-Anne, in &quot;I Got A Right To Sing The Blues&quot;, says that Flanagan and the League have no authority over vampire monarchs. A &quot;documentary&quot; on the fifth disc of the season one DVDs shows pictures of Nan Flanagan with both President Roosevelts (Teddy and Franklin) and possibly appearing in a painting by George Seurat. The season three episode &quot;Everything is Broken&quot;, she conducts an interview with Eric on behalf of the Authority regarding Russell, King of Mississippi. She later issues Eric the Authority's order to go after Russell and kill him. Nan is shown to deal out harsh words and punishments with ease in her mission to make vampires equals with humans. Despite this, she is secretly a hypocrite; after stating out loud that she only drinks True Blood, Nan Flanagan is shown to have a woman in her limousine that she feeds upon. She has a more prominent role in Season 4 as she has elected Bill Compton the Vampire King of Louisiana and the two work together rigorously to restore a positive image of vampires into the minds of humans after Russell created an extremely negative one. During the vampire war against witches, she and Bill become at odds with each other when she appears to be more concerned with their image instead of their survival. She would prefer not to kill any humans to ruin their image while Bill believes that killing the necromancer Marnie/Antonia would better ensure their survival. In the season 4 finale, Nan reveals she knows about Sookie's blood. She also reveals to Bill and Eric that she quit both the AVL and the Authority and is making plans to overthrow the latter. She tries to recruit Bill and Eric and they refuse. When she threatens Sookie, revealing that she's knows what Sookie is, Eric kills her guards while Bill kills Nan herself.

Nanâfirst appearing in episode 1.01: [[Strange Love (True Blood)|Strange Love]]âis portrayed by [[Jessica Tuck]], and appears as a supporting character during the first three seasons, and as a series regular in season four, of ''True Blood''.

==== Liam, Malcolm, and Diane ====
'''Liam''', '''Malcolm''', and '''Diane''' are vampire acquaintances of Bill Compton who live together in a &quot;nest&quot; (a small coterie of vampires; living together in this way often makes the members more brutal and callous about human life) and come to live in Bon Temps during the first season. They all despise mainstreaming and have no regard for human life. Malcolm is the oldest of the three; indeed, he is older than Bill, and assumes a leadership role in the nest. He likes to party and has a human lover named Jerry. Sookie discovers, telepathically, that Jerry has [[hepatitis D]] and is trying to infect the nest. Liam pays Maudette Pickens a large sum of money to have sex with her, and is videotaped in the act. Diane slept with Bill shortly after she was turned in the 1930s, and has been trying to seduce him ever since. All three vampires are killed in a fire set by Royce Williams and his associates, Chuck and Wayne. Sookie initially thinks Bill was caught in the fire as well. 

Liam, Malcolm and Dianeâfirst appearing in episodes 1.01: [[Strange Love (True Blood)|Strange Love]] (Liam) and 1.02: The First Taste (Malcolm and Diane)âare portrayed by [[Graham Shiels]], [[Andrew Rothenberg]], and [[Aunjanue Ellis]], respectively. They appear as supporting characters during the first season of ''True Blood''.
{{-}}

==== Longshadow ====
'''Longshadow''' is the bartender at Fangtasia. In season one, Sookie discovers that he's been stealing money from the bar when she reads the mind of a waitress working there named Ginger. Longshadow glamors Ginger when she discovers what he's been doing. Bill stakes Longshadow in order to save Sookie's life when he attacks her for revealing his treachery, and this murder means that Bill now must be punished by the local vampires. 

Longshadowâfirst appearing in episode 1.04: Escape from Dragon Houseâis portrayed by [[Raoul Trujillo]], and appears as a supporting character during the first season of ''True Blood''.
{{-}}

==== Chow ====
'''Chow''' is the bartender at the Shreveport Vampire Bar, Fangtasia. Chow is introduced in the series as the new bartender after Longshadow is staked by Bill. When they first meet in season one, Bill admits that he prefers Longshadow after Chow boasts of having a lower [[Par (score)|par]] in a golf video game for [[Wii]]. 

Chowâfirst appearing in episode 1.09: Plaisir d'Amourâis portrayed by [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]], and appears as a supporting character during the first two seasons of ''True Blood''.
{{-}}

==== The Magister ====
'''The Magister''', was a vampire judge who presided over all the vampires of North America. He was from the [[Iberian peninsula]] and was turned during the late ninth century. He was feared because of his political power and advanced age. During the first season, he tried and sentenced Bill for murdering Longshadow, a fellow vampire. As punishment for the crime, he forced Bill to sire Jessica in order to replace the vampire he had killed during a time when their numbers are so important. In season three, he tasked Sophie-Anne and Eric with finding out who was selling vampire blood and their source. Although he was suspicious that they were the actual culprits he nonetheless took their innocence at face value. In episode 7, he was forced by King Russell to officiate the marriage between him and Queen Sophie-Anne. After the deed was done, Russell used The Magister's cane to decapitate him. 

The Magister-first appearing in episode 1.10: I Don't Wanna Knowâis portrayed by [[Zeljko Ivanek]], and appears as a supporting character during season one and three of ''True Blood''.
{{-}}

==== Godric ====
'''Godric ''' was the vampire sheriff of Area 9, a designation for an area that includes Dallas, Texas. Despite being 2,100 years old, he still has the human body of a teenager. He is also covered in tattoos. He is depicted as being friendly toward humans, interested in their well-being, and supportive of a peaceful co-existence between vampires and human beings. Eric Northman claims &quot;there are none above him in the [[New World]]&quot;, referring (erroneously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Denis OâHare: Russellâs Older Than Godric |author=Aemac |date=March 22, 2010 |url=http://www.trueblood-news.com/denis-ohare-russells-older-then-godric |accessdate=August 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to the physical power he has accumulated as one of the oldest vampires in the Americas. He and Eric investigated Nazi Germany's use of werewolves in [[World War II]].

When he goes missing, Eric sends [[Sookie Stackhouse]] and [[#Hugo Ayers|Hugo]] to the Dallas area to look for him. It is discovered that he is being held prisoner by the Fellowship of the Sun for a ritual execution. While infiltrating the Fellowship, Sookie is captured and attacked by one of their members, Gabe. As Gabe is attempting to rape Sookie, Godric appears and rescues her by breaking Gabe's neck. Conflict at the Fellowship comes to a head with a standoff between the Fellowship members and a vampire force led by Stan (one of Godric's lieutenants). Godric is able to defuse the incident without bloodshed. However, the Fellowship retaliates by sending a suicide bomber to his home, destroying three vampires and killing two human companions.

When asked how a vampire as powerful as he is could have been captured by humans, Godric reveals that he was taken into their custody willingly, believing that allowing himself to be killed by anti-vampire fanatics will bring about some sort of reconciliation, and atonement for his many crimes against humans during his long life. He takes the blame for what [[#Nan Flanagan|Nan Flanagan]] describes as a &quot;PR disaster&quot;, as well as for the deaths from the bombing. He resigns as sheriff at her recommendation. After such a long life, Godric finds himself weary of his existence and saddened that humans and vampires refuse to work together and coexist, so decides he has been alive long enough. As his maker, Godric is greatly loved and revered by Eric, who begs him not to kill himself&amp;mdash;to no avail. He &quot;meets the sun&quot; at dawn on the roof of the Hotel Carmilla, surprised and inspired by the fact that a &quot;human&quot;, [[Sookie Stackhouse]], would accompany him and shed tears at his end.

In the season three finale, Godric's spirit apparently appears to Eric and tries to get him to embrace peace and forgiveness during his battle with Russell. He expresses his sadness at Eric's actions when he and Bill bury Russell alive, rather than allow Russell the peace that true death would bring.

When he was in Scandinavia, he watched [[Eric Northman]] fight in battle skillfully. After the battle he killed Eric's two surviving comrades and offered the mortally wounded Viking a chance to become a vampire.

Godricâfirst appearing in episode 2.05: Never Let Me Goâis portrayed by [[Allan Hyde]], and appears as a supporting character during seasons two, three, and four&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/02/true-blood-exclusive-look-whos-returning/|title=''True Blood'' Exclusive: Look Who's Returning!|work=TV Line|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''True Blood''.
{{-}}

==== Isabel ====
'''Isabel Beaumont''' is a lieutenant of Godric's introduced during the second season. She and Stan bicker constantly throughout the investigation in Dallas, much to Eric's frustration. At one point, Stan mentions that she has been working for Godric for forty years. She has a human boyfriend, Hugo, who accompanies Sookie when she infiltrates the Fellowship of the Sun, but is revealed to be a traitor to the vampires. In a conversation with Eric, she describes her interest in Hugo as being like &quot;a science experiment&quot;, however even after the discovery of Hugo's treachery she admits to still loving him (prompting Godric to reduce his punishment from execution to banishment).

But she is very powerful and full of useful information about supernatural creatures. Sophie-Anne is forced in to a marriage of convenience with Russell Edgington who wishes to possess her territory. Hadley informs Sophie-Anne of Sookie's ability at some point before the series and she subsequently sent Bill Compton to Bon Temps to seduce her and procure her for Sophie-Anne.

He lures the Queen to his home and tells her only one of them will leave alive. The pair fight briefly, only for Bill to reveal armed forces who were hiding inside the house the entire time. After calling him a traitor, Sophie-Anne is violently gunned down and killed with wooden bullets by the armed forces who are revealed to be Nan Flanagan's.

Bill kills Longshadow to prevent him from harming Sookie, and Ginger is traumatized from having to watch. Pam reluctantly glamors her again to solve the problem, deciding that further deterioration of her mind is preferable to transforming her into a vampire to ensure her silence.

She tells Sookie the location of Lafayette when held at gunpoint by her in Episode 3 and lets Sam Merlotte, Lisa and Colby Fowler into Fangtasia before dark after Sam bribes her in Episode 11.

Claudine was a fairy first introduced in &quot;Hitting the Ground&quot;. She had stated that she, and others like her, had protected and, on occasion, saved Sookie from danger. 
When Sookie is comatose after being drained by Bill, she meets Claudine in a dream. Claudine gives her glowing water to drink and asks her if she wants to come to her &quot;home&quot;. As the portal to her is a pond, Sookie is afraid to enter as she does not know how to swim. Sookie hears in Claudine's thoughts that &quot;the water did not kill them&quot;. This implies that Claudine knows how Sookie's and Jason's parents died. When Bill comes to Sookie's hospital bed, night comes to the dream realm. The other Fairies in the dream enter the pond and Claudine warns Sookie to not let 'him' take her &quot;light&quot;. (&quot;Hitting the Ground&quot;) 
A few days later, Bill enters the dream realm Sookie had visited. There he is met by Claudine, who first thinks that he has killed Sookie. After a short chase Bill pins Claudine down, but seems unable to control himself. Before he can feed on her, Claudine uses the same light power Sookie is capable of, and throws him a few meters away. Bill convinces Claudine that Sookie is alive and he would never harm her, and also pleads to Claudine to reveal the true nature of what Sookie and Claudine are, so that Sookie can protect herself. (&quot;Everything Is Broken&quot;)

The next night when Sookie visits her grandmother's grave, Claudine and other faes appear to her. Claudine tells Sookie she is not alone and she should come with them. Sookie holds out a glowing hand to Claudine and the two women disappears along with the other fairies. (&quot;Evil is Going On&quot;)

Claudine magically transports Sookie to her home dimension, known as Faery. Sookie inquires if Claudine is head of the fairies. Claudine laughs this off and tells Sookie she is actually her fairy godmother. Sookie snipes that she didn't do a very good job to which Claudine replies &quot;You're still alive aren't you?&quot; Claudine then leaves Sookie so she can go and mingle with the other fairies and recently transported part fairies such as old acquaintance Barry and her grandfather Earl.

When Sookie realizes that Faery is a trap for the part humans, she is confronted by queen of the fairies, Mab. As Mab tries to force feed Sookie a Lumiere fruit in order to magically manipulate Sookie into seeing Faery as a bright, peaceful place, Claudine looks on guiltily. When Sookie accidentally uses her powers to uncover the true barren world of Faery and the true, grotesque face of the fairies to all those around; Sookie and Earl try to find a way of escaping Faery and its malevolent inhabitants. As Sookie runs off, a distressed Claudine calls out for her until she is ordered by Mab to go after them. (&quot;She's Not There&quot;)

Claudine arrives at Sookie's front porch and demands that Sookie come with her back to Fairy Land. She tells Sookie about the times she helped save her life, however Sookie replies with a no. In a flash, Eric Northman captures Claudine and begins to feed from her. With amnesia, Eric doesn't know how to stop drinking her blood. He kills her, making her true form appear and to lose her light, thus disappearing in thin dust. (&quot;If You Love Me, Why Am I Dyin'?&quot;)

===Additional characters, introduced in season 4===
====Antonia GavilÃ¡n de LogroÃ±o====
Antonia was a powerful witch that originally lived in northern Spain (specifically, in the city of [[LogroÃ±o]]) during the latter portion of the sixteenth century. In 1610, at the height of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].  She became a necromancer in order to save her village from fever, not only as healer she as well served as a midwife. Later Antonia was fed on by vampires hiding out as priests within the local Catholic church, raped by the vampire Luis (now one of Bill's sheriffs in Louisiana) at his maker's behest, burned at stake and killed. As she was being burned, she and her fellow witches cast a spell that brought all vampires within 20 miles of LogroÃ±o out of ground and into the sun, destroying them, an act that she replicates in Bontemps four centuries later, after inhabiting Marnie's body inside Bill's compound. She eventually becomes disheartened over the collateral damage done in her war against the vampires and leaves Marnie's body. Marnie, however, convinces Antonia to re-bond with Marnie, as the latter wishes to continue the war, with Antonia as her source of power. After Marnie kills a member of their coven, Antonia sees that Marnie has become evil and leaves her body, but Marnie puts a binding spell on her and draws her back in. Antonia is finally freed from Marnie by Jesus, and all the spells she has performed have been broken. She is portrayed by [[Paola Turbay]] and Fiona Shaw (when possessing Marnie).
