&quot;'''Holiday in Cambodia'''&quot; was the second single by the American [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[Dead Kennedys]]. The record was released in May 1980 on Alternative Tentacles with &quot;[[Police Truck]]&quot; as the b-side. The title track was re-recorded for the band's first album, ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'' (1980), and the version that appeared on this single, as well as the single's b-side, are available on the rarities album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]'' (1987). The cover picture of the single is taken from the [[6 October 1976 Massacre]] in [[Thailand]], and depicts a member of the rightist crowd beating the corpse of a student protester with a metal chair.

The song attacks both Eastern [[totalitarianism]] and Western [[complacency]]. The song's lyrics offer a satirical view of young, self-righteous Americans (So you been to school/For a year or two/And you know youâve seen it all/In daddyâs car/Thinkinâ youâll go far...) and contrast such a lifestyle with a brutal depiction of the [[Pol Pot]] regime of [[Cambodia]] (Well youâll work harder/With a gun in your back/For a bowl of rice a day/Slave for soldiers/Till you starve/Then your head is skewered on a stake). 

The re-recording of this song that appears on ''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables'' is different from the single version, being fifty-five seconds longer and featuring an extended guitar noise intro as well as an extended solo. While the original performance includes the satirically quoted word &quot;niggers&quot;, subsequent performances by the reformed Dead Kennedys, and other artists listed here have substituted the word &quot;brothers&quot; in its place. Biafra, however, has often in the past and currently, replaced the word with &quot;blacks&quot;.
In October 1998, [[Jello Biafra]] was sued by former members of the Dead Kennedys. According to Biafra, the suit was a result of his refusal to allow &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; to be used in a commercial for [[Levi's]] [[Dockers]]; Biafra opposes Levi's due to what he believes are their unfair business practices and [[sweatshop]] labor. However, the other members claimed that their royalties had been defrauded. &quot;The record industry has been skimming royalties owed artists since the beginning,&quot; according to Dead Kennedys guitarist East Bay Ray. &quot;This case is no different from blues musicians being taken advantage of in the twenties and thirties. Many people doubted the claims we made against our former record label back in 1998 but with this announcement there is no denying we were the victims here.&quot; [http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.htm#071304 Record Label Drops Legal Action]
