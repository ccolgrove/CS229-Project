'''Post-production''' is part of [[filmmaking]] and the [[video production]] process. It occurs in the making of [[film|motion pictures]], [[television program]]s, [[radio program]]s, [[advertising]], [[sound recording and reproduction|audio recordings]], [[photography]], and [[digital art]]. It is  term for all stages of production occurring after the actual end of shooting and/or recording the completed work.

Post-production is, in fact, many different processes grouped under one name. These typically include:
* [[Video editing]] the picture of a [[television program]] using an [[edit decision list]] (EDL)
* Writing, [[Re-recording (filmmaking)|(re)recording]], and editing the [[soundtrack]].
* Adding visual [[special effect]]s - mainly [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and digital copy from which [[release print]]s will be made (although this may be made obsolete by [[digital cinema|digital-cinema]] technologies).
* [[Sound design]], [[Sound effect]]s, [[Dubbing_(filmmaking)#Automated_dialogue_replacement_.2F_post-sync|ADR]], Foley and Music, culminating in a process known as sound re-recording or mixing with [[professional audio]] equipment.
* Transfer of [[Color motion picture film]] to [[Video]] or [[DPX]] with a [[telecine]] and [[color grading]] (correction) in a [[color suite]].

Typically, the post-production phase of creating a film takes longer than the actual shooting of the film, and can take several months to complete because it includes the complete editing, color correction and the addition of music and sound. The process of editing a movie is also seen as the second directing because through the post production it is possible to change the intention of the movie so intense. Furthermore through the use of [[Color grading|color correcting]] tools and the addition of music and sound, the atmosphere of the movie can be heavily influenced for instance a blue-tinted movie is associated with a cold atmosphere and the choice of music and sound increases the effect of the shown scenes to the [[audience]].

Post-production was named the one of the 'Dying Industries' by IBISWorld.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/03/28/top-10-dying-industries/] Top 10 Dying Industries, blogs.wsj.com/economics By Phil Izzo&lt;/ref&gt;  The once exclusive service offered by high end '''post houses''' or '''boutique facilities''' have been eroded away by [[video editing software]] that operates on a [[non-linear editing system]] (NLE).  However, traditional (analogue) post-production services are being surpassed by digital, leading to sales of over $6 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pellresearch.com/Market-Analysis/Video-Postproduction-Services.htm] Pell Research Report on Video Postproduction Services - cited with permission&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital revolution has made the [[video editing]] [[workflow]] process immeasurably quicker, as practitioners moved from time-consuming (tape to tape) [[linear video editing]] [[online editing]] suites, to computer hardware and [[video editing software]] such as [[Adobe Premiere]], [[Final Cut Pro]], [[Avid]], [[Sony Vegas]] and [[Lightworks]].
