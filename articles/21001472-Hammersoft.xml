[[Image:US Route 20 southbound entering Lee MA.jpg|thumb|right|294px|&lt;center&gt;Southbound entering [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
The cross-country '''U.S. Route 20''' runs its easternmost {{convert|153|mi|km}} in the U.S. state of [[Massachusetts]].  The highway crosses the state border from [[New Lebanon, New York]] into [[Hancock, Massachusetts]], and runs eastward into [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], where it ends at [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] in [[Kenmore Square]].  It spends the vast majority of its journey paralleling the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], which has largely superseded US-20 for through travel.  Still, US-20 directly serves many towns and local business areas which the Turnpike bypasses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/kefkafloyd/valleyroads/us20.html Roads and Highways of the Pioneer Valley - US 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Route 20 is the longest numbered highway in the entire country, and also holds the distinction of being the longest numbered highway in the state, edging out [[Route 28 (Massachusetts)|Route 28]] by merely a mile (Route 28 is {{convert|151.92|mi|km}} long).&lt;ref name=inventory/&gt;

Parts of US 20 between the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and Boston areas were also an alignment of the [[Boston Post Road]], an early colonial highway designated in 1673 for carrying mail between [[New York City]] and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Holbrook, ''The Old Post Road: The Story of the Boston Post Road'', (McGraw-Hill, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; US 20 is still locally known as the &quot;Boston Post Road&quot; in the towns of Marlborough, Sudbury, and Weston.&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=42.352201,-71.530437&amp;daddr=Boston+Post+Rd%2FUS-20&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFV2ChgIdNn_A-w&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=0&amp;sz=14&amp;sll=42.350933,-71.517906&amp;sspn=0.031018,0.054932&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.34129,-71.406326&amp;spn=0.248182,0.439453&amp;z=11 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route description&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapquest.com MapQuest]&lt;/ref&gt;==
===Berkshire County===
U.S. Route 20 begins its eastward trek crossing the New York state border into [[Hancock, Massachusetts]], passing through the southern edge of the Pittsfield State Forest before entering [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] and meeting the northern end of [[Route 41 (Massachusetts)|Route 41]].  The highway enters town and meets [[US 7 (MA)|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]].  US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]].  In Lenox, [[Route 7A (Massachusetts)|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast.  The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Route 102 (Massachusetts)|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Route 8 (Massachusetts)|Route 8]].  Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket.  Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].
===Hampden County===
US-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]].  US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Route 23 (Massachusetts)|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]].  US-20 crosses the [[US-202]]/[[Route 10 (Massachusetts)|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Route 187 (Massachusetts)|Route 187]] just to the east.  US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]].  Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by [[Route 20A (Massachusetts)|Route 20A]]), to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20.  Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''.  US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/kefkafloyd/valleyroads/us20.html Roads and Highways of the Pioneer Valley - US 20]&lt;/ref&gt;, where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road.  US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Route 21 (Massachusetts)|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]].  In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Route 181 (Massachusetts)|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Route 32 (Massachusetts)|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8.  US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east.  Before leaving Palmer, [[Route 67 (Massachusetts)|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Route 19 (Massachusetts)|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.

===Worcester County===
US-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Route 148 (Massachusetts)|Route 148]].  The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Route 131 (Massachusetts)|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3.  I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Route 49 (Massachusetts)|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Route 169 (Massachusetts)|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Route 31 (Massachusetts)|Route 31]].  Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Route 12 (Massachusetts)|Route 12]].  Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange.  US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Route 146 (Massachusetts)|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Route 122A (Massachusetts)|Route 122A]]).  The route continues through Millbury, crossing over [[Route 122 (Massachusetts)|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11.  Leaving Millbury, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Route 140 (Massachusetts)|Route 140]] south of town.  The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9.  Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Route 135 (Massachusetts)|Route 135]] in the town center.  Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north.  US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].
===Middlesex County===
US-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs.  The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Route 85 (Massachusetts)|Route 85]] in the process.  It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Route 27 (Massachusetts)|Route 27]]/[[Route 126 (Massachusetts)|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]].  US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], where the Boston Post Road designation ends.  Immediately upon crossing the town line, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston.  US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Route 117 (Massachusetts)|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117.  US-20 also meets the western end of [[Route 60 (Massachusetts)|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham.  The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to an intersection with [[Route 16 (Massachusetts)|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. US-20 becomes North Beacon Street at this point and continues southwest as it crosses into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[North Beacon Street Bridge]].

===Suffolk County (Boston)===
[[File:US20end.jpg|thumb|right|US&amp;nbsp;20 eastbound approaching Kenmore Square, Boston]]

US-20 continues as North Beacon Street upon crossing into Boston, immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] and crossing under the Mass Pike (no interchange).  US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] neighborhood of Boston.  Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance.  US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Route 30 (Massachusetts)|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection.  At this point, the [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]/[[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] border lies just feet south of the road, and US-20 passes through [[Boston University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/maps/ Boston University maps, retrieved August 5, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;.  US-20 crosses [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] at the southern end of the [[Boston University Bridge]], crossing over the Mass Pike for the final time.  Route 2, via Mountfort Street, Park Drive, and Beacon Street, turns from south to east to meet US-20 at [[Kenmore Square]].  Upon meeting Route 2 again, US-20 meets its eastern terminus, with Route 2 taking Commonwealth Ave its final stretch to the [[Boston Public Garden]] and Route 28, where Route 2 meets its own end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Boston&amp;state=MA&amp;address=Kenmore+Square MapQuest Maps:]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Route 20 officially ends in Kenmore Square at the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue, Beacon Street, and Brookline Avenue.

'''Route 20A''' is a [[state highway]] located entirely within [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The route, an alternate route of U.S. Route 20, parallels the section of U.S. 20 concurrent with [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]]. The western terminus is at U.S. 20 and [[Interstate 91]] in downtown Springfield east of where U.S. 20 crosses the [[Connecticut River]] on the [[North End Bridge]]. The eastern terminus is at U.S. 20 and I-291 northeast of the city.

This alignment provides an alternate to Interstate 291, which overlaps US 20 for much of its length, but was originally an alternate to old US 20, which ran down State Street and Boston Road. This route was therefore never part of US 20, but has served as an alternate to two separate routes.
