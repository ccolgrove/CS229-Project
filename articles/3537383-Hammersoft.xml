'''Joliet Catholic Academy''' ('''Joliet Catholic''' or '''JCA''') is a coed [[Catholic]] High School located in [[Joliet, Illinois]].  It is located in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Joliet]].  One of the oldest Catholic high schools in the Chicago area, Joliet Catholic is perhaps best known for its prowess in [[high school football|football]].  Since the advent of the [[Illinois High School Association]] (IHSA) state football playoffs in 1974, JCA has won more state football titles than any other team in the state, with 13 as of 2007.

The modern school is itself the result of a merger between the all girls '''St. Francis Academy''' and the all male '''Joliet Catholic High School''', which itself was formerly known as DeLaSalle High School for Boys.  It is this merger that results in the school's shared affiliation with the [[Carmelites]] and the {{Disambiguation needed|Franciscan Sisters|Joliet Franciscan Sisters|date=June 2011}}.

==History==
The Joliet Franciscan Sisters opened St. Francis Academy in 1869 as an all girls school.  The academy was founded in a small stone building convent by Mother [[Mary Alfred Moes]], who later would help found the [[Mayo Clinic]].  In 1923, the school moved to the campus of the [[University of St. Francis]], which had opened in 1920.  In 1956, the school moved to the building at 1200 N. Larkin, which is the current site of JCA.

[[George Mundelein|George Cardinal Mundelein]], Archbishop of Chicago, had the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]] create a new high school for boys as a part of their renovation of St. Patrick Church in Joliet.  The school opened in 1918 as ''DeLaSalle High School for Boys'' with only two classrooms in the parish center, but moved to a new building in 1927.  In 1933, the Carmelites took possession of the school, at which time, the school became Joliet Catholic High School.

In the summer of 1990, Joliet Catholic High School and St. Francis Academy merged to form the modern Joliet Catholic Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jca-online.org/current_students/index.htm &quot;History of JCA&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
In terms of [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses, the school offers [[AP Biology|Biology]], [[AP Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[AP U.S. History|U.S. History]], [[AP United States Government and Politics|Government and Politics]], and [[AP European History|European History]].  The school also offers one of the two courses in [[Advanced Placement English Language and Composition|AP English]] and [[AP Calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jca-online.org/pdf_files/curriculum_guide.pdf Curriculum guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are no AP courses offered in foreign languages, students who take a fourth year of study in Spanish, French, or Latin may opt to take the appropriate AP test.

==Athletics==
The mens teams at the school are referred to as the ''Hilltoppers'', the same named used by the former Joliet Catholic High School, while the girls teams retain the name used by St. Francis Academy; the ''Angels''.  The school is a member of the [[East Suburban Catholic Conference]].

The school sponsors teams for men and women in [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], [[soccer]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]], and [[volleyball]].  Men also compete in [[baseball]], [[high school football|football]], and [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]], while women also compete in [[softball]], and [[cheerleading]].  The school also has a competitive dance team, which does not compete under the auspices of the [[Illinois High School Association]] (IHSA).

The football team host home games at [[Joliet Memorial Stadium]].
