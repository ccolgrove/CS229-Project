Providence is a [[Charleroi Metro]] station, build on a viaduct and located in [[Marchienne-au-Pont]] (part of the [[Charleroi]] municipality), in fare zone 1. The station has only one entrance (on its western end), equipped with escalators and stairs.

About 300 m east of the station (toward [[Dampremy (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Dampremy]], as space was insufficient for 2 tram tracks because of the presence of industrial buildings, both tracks are merged into a single one for a couple of metres. At this point, speed is restricted to 25 kph.

The name of the station comes from the now defunct ''[[Forges de la Providence]]'' steel factory which was located in front of where the station now is, and also gave its name to the adjacent street.

== Nearby points of interest ==

The station is located on the [[Sambre]] river bank, in a dense industrial area which explains the low passenger flow through the station.
