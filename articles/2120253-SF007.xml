'''CloneDVD''' is a proprietary [[DVD]] cloning software, developed by [[Elaborate Bytes]], that can be used to make backup copies of any [[DVD]] movie not  [[copy protection|copy-protected]] (for this reason it is often used in conjunction with [[AnyDVD]], a tool that includes disabling such protections). The program is able to [[transcode]] a [[dual layer]] DVD movie to fit it onto a [[DVD-R]],  [[DVD Plus R|DVD+R]] or [[DVD+R DL]] (Double Layer) disc. Users also have the choice to strip audio streams, subtitles and chapters. By moving a quality bar (or by selecting a standard optical disc format) the user can make the DVD fit its target medium. Another feature of this software is its ability to save the contents of the disc as an [[ISO image]], or as individual DVD files (i.e. in a VIDEO_TS [[directory (file systems)|directory]]). Conversely, CloneDVD can write a DVD from an [[ISO image]] and from a directory of individual DVD files. Consequently, CloneDVD can process a folder of DVD files (i.e. on another storage medium) and convert it into an [[ISO image]].  It cannot, however, convert an [[ISO image]] directly into a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] of DVD files, but this is possible to do by first mounting the image into a virtual drive using a [[disk image emulator]], such as [[Virtual CloneDrive]]. CloneDVD supports DVD recording speeds of up to [[CD-ROM#Transfer rates|18x]].
