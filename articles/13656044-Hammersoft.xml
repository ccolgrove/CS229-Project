After being sworn in as premier, Dunderdale announced that she would not be seeking the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a [[Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leadership election, 2011|leadership election]] was held in the spring of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/03/nl-dunderdale-premier-sworn-in-123.html|title=Dunderdale becomes 1st woman to lead N.L.|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporeation|date=2010-12-03|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However on December 17, 2010, Dunderdale announced that she was reconsidering running for the leadership of the party and that she would make a final decision after Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/1969-12-31/article-2052364/Dunderdale-may-reconsider-running-for-premier-fulltime/1|title= Dunderdale may reconsider running for premier full-time|publisher= The Telegram|date=2010-12-17|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 19, 2011, Dunderdale met with [[Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador|Lieutenant Governor]] [[John Crosbie]] and requested  a dissolution of the [[46th General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador|46th General Assembly]] with an [[Newfoundland and Labrador general election, 2011|election to follow on October 11, 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunderdale kicks off N.L. election campaign|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/09/19/nl-nlvotes2011-dunderdale-launch-writ-919.html|accessdate=19 September 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an overwhelming lead in public opinion polls, for both Dunderdale and her party, and with roughly $1,000,000 in the bank, pundits considered the election hers to lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=David|title=Four more years versus four more seats|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nlvotes2011/story/2011/09/19/nl-cochrane-four-years-seats-919.html|accessdate=19 September 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunderdale released her party's platform in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]] on September 22, 2011. While Dunderdale stressed the need for fiscal restraint, the platform included $135,000,000 in new spending a year. The platform included continuing the freeze on post-secondary education and eventually eliminating loans in favour of needs-based grants, phasing out the payroll tax over six years, investing a third of any surplus into unfunded public pension funds, reviewing the province's income tax rates to ensure they are progressive and competitive, continuing to make payments on the provinceâs direct debt, creating a population growth strategy, moving forward with the Muskrat Falls hydro development, and improving health care wait times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Energy - PC Policy Blue Book|url=http://newenergynl.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PC-Blue-Book_Web.pdf|publisher=Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PC Blue Book promises to cost $135 million a year|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-09-22/article-2755465/PC-Blue-Book-promises-to-cost-$135-million-a-year/1|accessdate=17 October 2011|newspaper=The Telegram|date=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blue Book vows cautious spending hikes|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nlvotes2011/story/2011/09/22/nl-blue-book-tories-817.html|accessdate=17 October 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On election night the Progressive Conservatives won 37 of the province's 48 seats, six less seats then the party held before the election. The Liberal Party won six seats, while the NDP were elected in five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunderdale leads N.L.

On October 28, 2011, Dunderdale's new [[Executive Council of Newfoundland and Labrador|cabinet]] was sworn in at [[Government House (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Government House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunderdale unveils leaner cabinet|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/10/28/nl-new-cabinet-1028.html|accessdate=1 November 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the elimination and restructuring of [[Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|government departments]] she reduced her cabinet to 16 members, including herself, down from 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Streamlined' cabinet to reflect new priorities|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/10/28/nl-cabinet-dunderdale-1028.html|accessdate=1 November 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunderdale created the Department of Advanced Education and Skills, which takes on the majority of the responsibilities of the now defunct Department of Human Resources, Labour and Employment. She eliminated the Department of Business and merged it with the Department of Innovation, Trade and Rural Development to create the Department of Innovation, Business and Rural Development. She also restructured the former departments of Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs and Intergovernmental Affairs to create the Department of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Premier Dunderdale Appoints New Cabinet,  Announces Departmental Restructuring|url=http://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2011/exec/1028n01.htm|accessdate=1 November 2011|newspaper=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod|first=James|title=Dunderdale shuffles, cuts the cabinet deck|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-10-29/article-2791008/Dunderdale-shuffles-cuts-the-cabinet-deck/1|accessdate=1 November 2011|newspaper=The Telegram|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour disputes===
Upon entering the premier's chair Dunderdale was faced with an ongoing dispute between the province's doctors and government over contract negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/02/nl-doctor-expectations-1202.html|title= Doctors not expecting a deal Friday|publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-12-02|accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 14 doctors announced their resignations over the government's latest offer of a 31&amp;nbsp;percent wage increase that they felt was not enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/11/05/nl-thirteen-doctors-1105.html|title= Resigning doctors vow to leave N.L.|publisher =Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-11-03|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At her swearing in as premier Dunderdale stated that earlier that week she had asked Health Minister Jerome Kennedy and Finance Minister Tom Marshall to meet with the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association (NLMA) later that day to work out a resolution to the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2010-12-04/article-2017309/NLMA-says-change-in-govt-leadership-provides-window-of-opportunity-to-settle-contract/1||title= NLMA says change in gov't leadership provides 'window of opportunity' to settle contract|publisher= The Telegram|date=2010-12-04|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the meeting Dunderdale announced she hoped to have a deal signed with the province's doctors before Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/04/meeting-doctors.html |title=Meeting brings hope in N.L. doctors dispute|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-12-04|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunderdale also announced soon after being sworn in that she wanted to end a year long strike on the [[Burin Peninsula]] that involved 15 home care workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/07/dunderdale-labour-approach-127.html|title= Dunderdale calls for new approach on labour|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-12-07|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had been called on to settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the workers are not direct employees of provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/02/burin-strike-surplus-122.html|title= Burin strike about 'pennies,' NAPE says|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-12-02|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/09/burin-strikers-accept-deal-129.html#socialcomments|title= Burin strikers unanimously take deal|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-12-09|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2010, Dunderdale along with Ministers Kennedy and Marshall joined the NLMA president to announce that a tentative agreement between the provincial government and doctors had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/12/16/nl-doctors-deal-1216.html|title= Doctors reach tentative N.L. \contract deal.|publisher =Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2010-12-16|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offer included 100&amp;nbsp;percent [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Canadian]] parity within the first two years of the agreement, pay equity for salaried specialists, and retention bonuses for fee-for-service rural physicians. As a result of the new deal, the 13 of the 14 doctors who tendered their resignations ''en masse'' in November rescinded their resignations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2010-12-16/article-2048073/NLMA-board-recommending-acceptance-of-new-offer-from-government/1|title= NLMA board recommending acceptance of new offer from government|publisher=The Telegram|date=2010-12-16|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy and environmental policy===
One of the major focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the development of the first phase of the Lower Churchill Project--Muskrat Falls. Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multi-billion dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a loan guarantee for Muskrat Falls. The loan guarantee would reduce the cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricty rates for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/02/02/nfld-dunderdale-harper.html|title=PM meeting 'good first step': Dunderdale|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-02-02|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/03/21/nl-threnespeech-321.html|title=Throne speech focuses on Lower Churchill, families|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-03-21|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a campaign stop in St. John's during the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]] Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] while Harper committed to the loan guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lower Churchill deserves support: Harper|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/03/31/harper-stjohns-exln-331.html|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister [[Joe Oliver (politician)|Joe Oliver]] announced a [[Memorandum of Agreement]] for the loan guarantee and said that the final agreement would be in place by November 30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feds step up for Lower Churchill megaproject|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/08/19/nl-feds-lower-churchill-muskrat-falls-819.html|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiscal policy===
In her first budget as premier the province recorded a $485 million surplus. Although her government had been warned by the province's [[Auditor General of Newfoundland and Labrador|Auditor General]], [[John Noseworthy]], that spending must be controlled program expenses increased by 4.9 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.L. too dependent on oil: audit|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/01/21/auditor-oil-debt-12.html|accessdate=2011-05-23|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sizzling&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/04/19/nl-budget-2011-main-surplus-419.html|title='Sizzling' economy powers N.L. budget surplus|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-04-19|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending was focused on infrastructure, health care, social programs, [[Nalcor Energy]] as well as other areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the [[Harmonized Sales Tax]] (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Although the province recorded nearly a half billion dollar surplus the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;sizzling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Budget 2011|url=http://www.budget.gov.nl.ca/budget2011/|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A $59 million surplus was projected for the 2011-2012 fiscal year in the in the April budget, but in August Finance Minister Tom Marshall announced that due to higher than expected oil production the province's revenues were expected to increase by $600 million. Marshall stated that the unexpected revenue would be used to pay down the province's $8.2 billion debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Windfall looming with boosted oil production|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/08/17/nl-oil-production-increase-windfall-817.html|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million. The added surplus would be paid directly to the province's debt, reducing the debt to $7.7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall Update 2011-2012|url=http://www.fin.gov.nl.ca/fin/publications/fallupdate2011-12.pdf|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishery policy===
In February 2011, Dunderdale's government rejected a report prepared by an independent committee that called for a massive downsizing of the fishing industry. The report by the Steering Committee for Fishing Industry Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was released by the province, and called for $450 million to be spent to achieve substantial cuts in the industry. Fisheries Minister [[Clyde Jackman]] dismissed the report almost immediately after it was released and said the $450 million price tag was to expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=N.L. fishery report recommends massive cuts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/02/25/nl-report-cuts-.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties and union leaders were highly critical of the government for dismissing the report, with NDP leader [[Lorraine Michael]] calling for Jackman to resign as minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/02/28/nl-ndp-jackman-228.html|title=NDP calling for N.L. fisheries minister to resign|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-02-28|accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the October 2011, provincial election, Dunderdale said &quot;We've got too many people chasing too few fish, and these plants are going to collapse and fail because they're not on sound economic models&quot;. She said there was overcapacity in the fishing industry and that fish processing plants would need to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod|first=James|title='What about that fish plant, bây?â|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-09-24/article-2759146/%26lsquo%3BWhat-about-that-fish-plant,-b%26rsquo%3By%3F%26rsquo%3B/1|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackman, who represents a district that relies heavily on the fishing industry, continued to face much criticism for his performance in the fisheries portfolio and was only re-elected by 40 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters greet Dunderdale in Burin|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2011-10-01/article-2764750/Protesters-greet-Dunderdale-in-Burin/1|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The Telegram|date=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macvicar|first=George|title=Jackman pulls out a squeaker for third term|url=http://www.southerngazette.ca/News/2011-10-13/article-2774300/Jackman-pulls-out-a-squeaker-for-third-term/1|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The Southern Gazette|date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after winning a majority government, Dunderdale stated in an interview that tough decisions were looming in the industry. She again stated there was overcapacity and structural problems in the fishery and that her government was ready to make the tough decisions that were long overdue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tough decisions looming on fisheries|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/10/12/nl-fishery-dunderdale-1012.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunderdale swore in her new cabinet weeks after the election and shuffled Jackman to the Department to Education, [[Darin King]] succeeded him as the Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herridge|first=Paul|title=King ready to face challenges in the fishing industry|url=http://www.southerngazette.ca/News/2011-11-08/article-2797963/King-ready-to-face-challenges-in-the-fishing-industry/1|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The Southern Gazette|date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, provincial government-appointed auditors backed up claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) that they were losing millions of dollars each year operating the fish plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marystown plant money-losing operation: external audit|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/11/25/nl-oci-audit-1125.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their [[Marystown]] and [[Port Union, Newfoundland and Labrador|Port Union]] fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;fish&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Marystown, Port Union plants closed permanently|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/12/02/nl-oci-plants-future-1202.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal security===
On February 7, 2011, the premierâs office announced that due to several incidents since Dunderdale became premier in December that police bodyguards were protecting her. After her office contacted the [[Royal Newfoundland Constabulary]] (RNC) to report the incidents the RNC felt it was necessary to take precaution and assign security to the premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/02/07/nl-duderdale-security-207.html|title=Bodyguards protecting Dunderdale|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-02-07|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunderdale spoke on the issue the following day, she said that due to privacy reasons she was partially reluctant to take on a bodyguard but respects the RNCâs decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;mum&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/02/09/dunderdale-security-police-209.html|title=Dunderdale mum on police security|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-02-09|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.&lt;ref name=&quot;mum&quot;/&gt;

===Public opinion===
During the first several months of her tenure as premier public opinion polls showed that Dunderdale and her Progressive Conservative Party were able to maintain the high level of support the party experienced under Williams. Between February and March 2011, three opinion polls were released. A [[CJON-TV|NTV]]/Telelink poll showed that 53 percent of those surveyed would vote for the Progressive Conservative, 17 percent chose the Liberals, 5 percent chose the New Democrats, and 24 percent were undecided. The poll also found that even with 18 percent of those surveyed undecided 65 percent felt Dunderdale was the best choice for premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntv.ca/video/?p=11323|title=Provincial Tories Still Have Big Lead: Poll|publisher=NTV News|date=2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] (Angus Reid) poll which was released two weeks later, showing the approval ratings of Canada's premiers, listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visioncritical.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2011.03.02_Premiers_CAN.pdf|title=Saskatchewanâs Wall Becomes Most Popular Premier in Canada|publisher=Vision Critial/Angus Reid|date=2011-03-02|accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released in March also showed that 73 percent of those surveyed would vote for the Progressive Conservatives, down 2 percent from November 2010. This compared to 18 percent for the Liberal Party and 8 percent for the NDP. 64 percent of those surveyed felt Dunderdale was the best person to be premier of the province; this result was 12 percent lower than what Williams had received in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cra.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/11-1-NL-Press-Release.pdf|title=Support for the Progressive Conservative Party Remains High|publisher=Corporate Research Associates|date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/03/07/nl-poll-tories-dunderdale-307.html|title=PCs, Dunderdale Still Dominate: Poll|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-03-07|accessdate=2011-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially maintaining most of the record high support that Williams received during the majority of his tenure as premier, Dunderdale and the PC Party saw a substantial drop in support following the Spring sitting of the House of Assembly. A CRA poll released in June showed support for the party had fallen to 57 percent, down from 73 percent in three months. Dunderdaleâs own popularity also took a hit, however 51 percent of those surveyed still felt she was the best choice for premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tories drop, NDP surge in new poll|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2011/06/07/nl-poll-pcs-liberals-ndp-607.html|accessdate=2011-06-07|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Support for Dunderdale and her party stabilized in the months following.
