The '''2008 NBA All-Star Game''' was an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]] basketball game played on February 17, 2008 at the [[New Orleans Arena]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], home of the [[New Orleans Hornets]]. The game was the 57th edition of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and was played during the [[2007â08 NBA season]]. This was the first time that New Orleans had hosted the All-Star Game and was the city's first major professional sporting event (outside of regular season games) since the area was devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. The city was awarded in an announcement by commissioner [[David Stern]] on May 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/neworleans_060522.html|title=New Orleans to Host NBA All-Star 2008|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com|date=May 22, 2006|accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2453969 |title=New Orleans to host 2008 NBA All-Star Game |work=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |date=May 22, 2006 |accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other reported contenders for the 2008 contest was [[Air Canada Centre]] at [[Toronto]], who withdrew the bid early in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/PR_allstar_deferral_050219.html|title=Raptors Defer 2008 All-Star Application|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com/Raptors|date=April 19, 2005|accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] defeated the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] 134â128. The East led early but blew a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter; however, in the end, pulled out the win due to the strength of [[Ray Allen]] and  [[LeBron James]]. Allen scored 28 points in the game, 14 of those points coming in the deciding quarter and James finished with a near [[triple-double]] 27 points, nine assists and eight rebounds. Through fan voting James took home the [[NBA All-Star Game MVP]] award, the second of his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280217032 East All-Stars 134, West All-Stars 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

All of this year's All-Star participants joined over 2,500 members of the NBA Family for the NBA Cares All-Star Day of Service. The volunteers participated in a variety of service projects at ten different sites throughout New Orleans.

The inaugural [[NBA Development League]] Dream Factory Friday Night is modeled after the popular NBA All-Star Saturday Night. It included perennial NBA fan favorite events such as a Three-Point Shootout and Slam Dunk competition, while introducing H.O.R.S.E. and an interactive game of Hot-Shot with fans. Twelve D-League players, including an NBA-assigned player and five others with NBA experience, took to Center Court to showcase their skills throughout the eveningâs competitions.

===Eastern Conference roster===
The [[Boston Celtics]], the team with the league's best record, came into New Orleans with three players. [[Kevin Garnett]], top vote-getter in the league with 2,399,148 votes, was selected as a starter, while [[Paul Pierce]] and [[Ray Allen]] (replacing injured [[Washington Wizards]] forward [[Caron Butler]])&lt;ref name=&quot;allenbutler&quot;&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2008/news/story?id=3234156 Boston's Allen named All-Star replacement for Washington's Butler]&lt;/ref&gt; were selected as reserves by the coaches of the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]&lt;ref name=&quot;asstartersannouncement&quot;&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2008/news/story?id=3213093 Garnett, Kobe, Iverson headline All-Star starters roster]&lt;/ref&gt; Garnett did not play due to injury and [[Toronto Raptors]] forward [[Chris Bosh]] replaced him as starting power forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;boshannouncement&quot;&gt;[http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/2008/02/16/bosh_allstar_starter/ Garnett absence makes Bosh a starter in All-Star Game]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Detroit Pistons]] forward [[Rasheed Wallace]] replaced [[Chris Bosh]] as the backup power forward. The Pistons, who at the time had the second-best record in the league, also had guards [[Chauncey Billups]] and [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]] participating.

[[Cleveland Cavaliers]] [[small forward]] [[LeBron James]] and [[Miami Heat]] [[shooting guard]] [[Dwyane Wade]] started for the third straight year and fourth overall for the East with two million votes each.&lt;ref name=&quot;asstartersannouncement&quot;/&gt;  [[Center (basketball)|Center]] [[Dwight Howard]] was voted to be a starting All-Star for the first time in his career after averaging 22 points and 15 rebounds for the first half of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;asstartersannouncement&quot;/&gt; [[Shaquille O'Neal]] was not voted in as a center for the first time in 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2008/news/story?id=3226305 Riley suggests Shaq should be given All-Star role; O'Neal disagrees]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jason Kidd]] was voted in as the starting point guard for the East amid speculation that he would be traded to the Western conference ([[Dallas Mavericks]]).

===Western Conference roster===
[[Los Angeles Lakers]] guard [[Kobe Bryant]], 2007 All-Star MVP, was the top vote-getter in the West with nearly 2,000,500. However days before the game, he was examined by Lakers' doctors and revealed a torn [[ligament]] in his right pinky finger.&lt;ref name=&quot;bryantinjury&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/la-sp-stars16feb16,1,707403.story?ctrack=2&amp;cset=true  Kobe will play in All-Star game]&lt;/ref&gt; Deciding to put off required surgery until after the season, the Lakers appealed to the league to replace Bryant but league policy stated Bryant must play after playing in the last game before the break.&lt;ref name=&quot;bryantinjury&quot;/&gt;

[[Denver Nuggets]] guard [[Allen Iverson]] was voted an All-Star for the second time since moving to Denver.&lt;ref name=&quot;denverduo&quot;&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_8070864 Iverson, Anthony voted in as All-Star Game starters]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with him, teammate [[Carmelo Anthony]] earned a starting nod at forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;denverduo&quot;/&gt; Power forward [[Tim Duncan]] made his tenth straight appearance and center [[Yao Ming]] his sixth (Yao Ming was voted to All-Star Game 2007 but did not play).&lt;ref name=&quot;asstartersannouncement&quot;/&gt;

=== [[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] Slam Dunk Contest===
[[Gerald Green]] returned to defend his crown won in last year's All-Star game. Young NBA stars [[Rudy Gay]], [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Jamario Moon]] were also invited. What made the Slam Dunk contest unique in 2008 was the introduction of the fan vote. While judges (in this particular contest, [[Karl Malone]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Julius Erving]], [[Darryl Dawkins]] and [[Dominique Wilkins]]) still scored dunks on a scale from one to fifty and selected those who would move on to the next round, fans had the last word.
NBA viewers for the first time could decide the winner of the Sprite Slam Dunk contest, under the tag line &quot;They Dunk. You Decide.&quot; For five minutes after the final round, polls were open on [[NBA.com]] and through [[Short message service|SMS]] [[Text messaging|TXT]] and the dunker with the most votes at the end of the time limit was the winner.
[[Dwight Howard]] won the contest, grabbing 78% of fan votes.

===D-League All-Star Game===
Twenty of the [[NBA Development League]]'s top players were selected to the D-League All-Star Game rosters by a combination of fan balloting on the official D-League website and voting by the 14 head coaches of D-League teams. The selections were divided up into two teams, the Red Team and the Blue Team, by members of the NBA and NBA D-League's Basketball Operations staff. Players who have been selected by coaches and fans must be on an active roster of a D-League team. [[Los Angeles D-Fenders]] head coach [[Dan Panaggio]] and [[Idaho Stampee]] head coach [[Bryan Gates]] were selected as the coach for the Blue Team and the Red Team respectively. Both coaches earned the honor by securing the best records in the D-League through January 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/dleague/allstar2008/coaches_080204.html|title=Bryan Gates and Dan Panaggio To Coach 2008 D-League All-Star Game Presented by Spalding|date=February 4, 2008|work=NBA.com/DLeague|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D-League Dream Factory Friday Night===
====H.O.R.S.E.====
Two preliminary rounds of two games each were played with the winners of the first two rounds competing in a final round for the title of H.O.R.S.E. Champion. Each round was capped at five minutes, and utilized a 24-second shot clock. Contestants were outfitted with a wireless microphone in order for fans to hear the player call his shot.

[[Lance Allred]] faced Fort Wayneâs [[Jeremy Richardson]]. Both players were tied at the time limit, but Allred managed to advance in sudden death when Richardson could not convert on his attempt. In the other first-round matchup, [[Utah Jazz]] assignee [[Morris Almond]] advanced over Sioux Fall's Kasib Powell, as he held an H-O advantage at the time limit. In the final, Allred earned the victory over Almond when he sank a bank shot from just outside the elbow, leaving Almond facing an H-O deficit as time expired.

==== Hot-Shot ====
Hot-Shot contestants took to the floor to compete in a race against the clock to score the most points with the help of a D-League fan. Each team had one minute to tally the highest score from four designated shooting spots on the court, including a one-point layup, a two-point foul shot, a three-pointer from behind the arc, and a five-point half-court shot, with the fan only eligible to shoot from the lay-up position. Two teams competed simultaneously, one on each end of the court, during the first round with the winners advancing to a final round of head-to-head competition where the stakes were high â the fan from the winning squad had an opportunity to be a judge in the Slam Dunk Contest.

In the first round, Bakersfieldâs [[Andre Barrett]] came out on top with a total of 24 while Dakotaâs [[Carlos Powell]] checked in second with 23 points. [[Billy Thomas]] (20 points) and [[Randy Livingston]] (5 points) were eliminated after the first round.

In the second and final round, Powell and his teammate Will, a New Orleans resident, won the title with a total of 24, edging Barrett and companyâs total of 21.

==== Three-Point Shootout ====
Each contestant had 60 seconds to sink up to 21 three-pointers from seven shooting stations assembled around the three-point line. Each station had two orange balls (worth one point each) and one &quot;money&quot; ball (worth two points) which may  only be attempted after both orange balls have been shot. Fans enjoyed one preliminary round and a championship round featuring the contestants with the top two scores from the first round.

[[Adam Harrington (basketball)|Adam Harrington]] dominated the contest, posting the highest score of all four competitors in the first round, and then edging [[Kaniel Dickens]] in the final round to earn the victory. Dickens advanced to the final via a 30-second shootout with Josh Gross after two players tied for the second best total in the opening round.

==== Slam Dunk Contest ====
The Slam Dunk Contest, which consisted of two rounds of two dunks each, began with each dunker submitting his top two dunks and selecting a fan from the crowd who chose the first dunk to be performed in the first round of competition. A composite total of the scores from the first round of dunks of competition was tallied for each dunker and the dunkers with the two highest scores competed in a championship round consisting of two dunk attempts. Contestants were allowed one replacement dunk per attempt.

The [[Idaho Stampede]] pair of [[Brent Petway]] and [[Mike Taylor (basketball)|Mike Taylor]] emerged from the first round and headed to the finals. Petway emerged as the victor after he completed a spectacular through-the-legs dunk that brought down the house at Jam Session and earned a perfect 50 score. Taylor attempted to counter with a show-stopping dunk of his own, but failed to convert on his two alloted attempts. Fort Wayne's [[Eric Smith (basketball)|Eric Smith]] and Iowa's Doug Thomas also performed some impressive dunks, but did not record high enough scores from the judges to advance to the final round.
