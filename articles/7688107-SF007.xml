'''Update Manager''' is a program that updates all installed software and their associated [[Software package (installation)|package]]s, with important software updates for security or recommended patches. It also informs users when updates are available, listing them in alphabetical orders so that users can choose which updates to install, if any. It was originally written for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] although it is now part of the standard Debian operating system and other APT-based systems. 

The Update Manager cannot uninstall updates, although this can be accomplished by other package managers such as [[Ubuntu Software Center]] and more technically advanced ones such as [[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]].
 
In Ubuntu, the Update Manager is used to update the operating system to new versions which are released every six months for standard releases or every two years for Long Term Support releases. This functionality is included by default in the desktop version but needs to be added to the server version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Upgrade&quot;&gt;[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LucidUpgrades LucidUpgrade].&lt;/ref&gt;
