Inspired by several prominent soul singers in her family, including mother [[Cissy Houston]] and cousins [[Dionne Warwick]] and the late [[Dee Dee Warwick]], as well as her godmother, [[Aretha Franklin]], Houston began singing with [[New Jersey]] church's junior gospel choir at age 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;jetAug85&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=prQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=whitney%20houston&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal = [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] | title=Whitney Houston Sings Her Way to Stardom with Hit Album, Road Tour | page = 59 | publisher = Johnson Publishing Company | volume = 68 | issue = 24 | date = August 26, 1985 | accessdate = February 7, 2011 | issn = 0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; After she began performing alongside her mother in night clubs in the [[New York City]] area, she was discovered by [[Arista Records]] label head [[Clive Davis]].

The movie's [[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|original soundtrack]] won the 1994 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. Its lead single, &quot;[[I Will Always Love You]]&quot;, became the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling single]] by a female artist in music history. With this album, Houston became the first act (solo or group, male or female) to sell more than a million copies of an album within a single week period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic Bio&quot; /&gt; The album also makes her the only female act in the top 10 list of the best-selling albums of all time, at number four.

==Biography==
===1963â76: Early life===
Whitney Houston was born in what was then a middle-income neighbourhood of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], the third and youngest child of John and gospel singer [[Cissy Houston]].&lt;ref name=Driven&gt;{{cite episode |title = Whitney Houston |series = Driven |network = [[VH1]] |airdate = November 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is mostly [[African-American]], with some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native-American]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] ancestry. Her mother, along with cousins [[Dionne Warwick]] and the late [[Dee Dee Warwick]] and godmother [[Aretha Franklin]] were all notable figures in the gospel, rhythm and blues, pop, and [[soul music|soul]] genres. Houston was raised a [[Baptist]], but was also exposed to the [[Pentecostal]] church. After the [[1967 Newark riots]], the family moved to a middle class area in [[East Orange, New Jersey]] when she was four.&lt;ref name=&quot;Driven&quot; /&gt; 

At the age of eleven, Houston began to follow in her mother's footsteps and started performing as a soloist in the junior gospel choir at the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, where she also learned to play the piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Whitney &amp; Bobby â Addicted to Love |date=September 2005| publisher= Vibe Magazine | url= http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/vibe_sep2005.htm| accessdate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first solo performance in the church was &quot;Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=lLQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;vq=WHITNEY&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal = [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] | page = 59 | title = Whitney Houston Tells what God Gave Her | publisher= Johnson Publishing Company | volume = 69 | issue = 22 | date=February 17, 1986|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | issn = 0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Houston was a teenager, she attended a Catholic girls high school, [[Mount Saint Dominic Academy]], where she met her best friend Robyn Crawford, whom she describes as the &quot;sister she never had.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://books.google.com/books?id=qyYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 &quot;Too Cool for School&quot;], ''[[Vibe (magazine)]]'', p. 78, June 2007.

===1977â84: Early career===
Houston spent some of her teenage years touring nightclubs where her mother Cissy was performing, and she would occasionally get on stage and perform with her. In 1977, at age 14, she became a backup singer on the [[Michael Zager Band]]'s single &quot;Life's a Party&quot;. Zager subsequently offered to obtain a recording contract for the young singer, but Cissy declined, wanting her daughter to finish school first. Then in 1978, at age 15, Houston sang background vocals on [[Chaka Khan]]'s hit single &quot;[[I'm Every Woman]]&quot;, a song she would later turn into a larger hit for herself on her monster-selling ''[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|The Bodyguard]]'' soundtrack album. She also sang back-up on albums by [[Lou Rawls]] and [[Jermaine Jackson]]. In the early 1980s, Houston started working as a fashion model after a photographer saw her at [[Carnegie Hall]] singing with her mother. She appeared as a lead vocalist on a [[Paul Jabara]] album, entitled ''[[Paul Jabara &amp; Friends|Paul Jabara and Friends]]'', released by [[Columbia Records]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Vince |last=Ripol|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hbftxqrgldje|title=Paul Jabara &amp; Friends Album Review|publisher=Allmusic|date=|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain-1990&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| first= Joy | last= Duckett Cain | title= The Soul of Whitney |date=December 2023| publisher= Essence Magazine | url= http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/essence_1990.htm| accessdate= February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the first women of color to grace the cover of the magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Traister |first = Rebecca |title = Didn't She Almost Have It All |publisher = Salon.com | date = April 13, 2006 |url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/04/12/whitney_houston/index.html |accessdate = December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also featured in layouts in the pages of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''Young Miss'', and appeared in a [[Canada Dry]] soft drink TV commercial.&lt;ref name=jet0716&gt;{{Cite journal | journal = [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |author = |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ra8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;vq=whitney&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Singer Whitney Houston a Model of Success| page = 32 | publisher= Johnson Publishing Company |volume = 78 | issue = 14 | date=July 16, 1990|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | issn = 0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her striking looks and girl-next-door charm made her one of the most sought after teen models of that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;jet0716&quot;/&gt; While modeling, she continued her burgeoning recording career by working with producers Ben Dover, [[Bill Laswell]] and [[Martin Bisi]] on an album they were spearheading called ''One Down'', which was credited to the group [[Material (band)|Material]]. For that project, Houston contributed the ballad &quot;Memories&quot;. Robert Christgau of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called her contribution &quot;one of the most gorgeous ballads you've ever heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Christgau |first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Christgau |title = Material she was a great song writer|publisher = RobertChristgau.com | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Material|accessdate = December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston had previously been offered several recording agencies (Michael Zager in 1980, and [[Elektra Records]] in 1981). In 1983, Gerry Griffith, an A&amp;R representative from [[Arista Records]] saw her performing with her mother in a New York City nightclub and was impressed. He convinced Arista's head [[Clive Davis]] to make time to see Houston perform. Davis too was impressed and offered a worldwide recording contract which Houston signed. Later that year, she made her national televised debut alongside Davis on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | journal = [[Ebony (magazine)|EBONY]] | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JtkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=whitney%20houston&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Whitney Houston For Talented Young Star, Singing Is A Family Tradition |publisher= Johnson Publishing Company | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | date=December, 1985|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | issn = 0012-9011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Houston signed with Arista in 1983 but did not begin work on her album immediately. The label wanted to make sure no other label signed the singer away. Davis wanted to ensure he had the right material and producers for Houston's debut album. Some producers had to pass on the project due to prior commitments.&lt;ref name=Billboard86&gt;{{Cite news|first=Bud|last=Scoppa|title=The Long Road To Overnight Stardom|date=December 1986|publisher= Billboard Magazine&quot; The Year In Rock '86|url=http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/billboard1986artistoftheyear.htm| accessdate= March 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston first recorded a duet with [[Teddy Pendergrass]] entitled &quot;[[Hold Me (Teddy Pendergrass &amp; Whitney Houston song)|Hold Me]]&quot; which appeared on his album, ''[[Love Language]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ron | last=Wynn |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:d9fwxqr5ld6e|title=''Love Language'' Album Review|publisher=Allmusic|date=|accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single was released in 1984 and gave Houston her first taste of success, becoming a Top 5 R&amp;B hit. It would also appear on her debut album in 1985.

===1985â86: Rise to international prominence===
With production from [[Michael Masser]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], and [[Narada Michael Walden]], Houston's debut album ''[[Whitney Houston (album)|Whitney Houston]]'' was released in February 1985. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine praised Houston, calling her &quot;one of the most exciting new voices in years&quot; while ''The New York Times'' called the album &quot;an impressive, musically conservative showcase for an exceptional vocal talent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Don | last= Shewey | title= Music Review: ''Whitney Houston'' | date = June 6, 1985| publisher= ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/whitney-houston-19850606| accessdate= March 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Holden | first = Stephen | title = Critic's Choice; Pop Music | newspaper = New York Times | pages = A2 | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = May 12, 1985 | accessdate =March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arista Records promoted Houston's album with three different singles from the album in the US, UK and other European countries. In the UK, the dance-funk &quot;Someone for Me&quot;, failed to chart in the country, was the first single while &quot;[[All at Once (Whitney Houston song)|All at Once]]&quot; was in such European countries as the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], where the song reached top 5 on the singles charts, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim Freeman | url = http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=8yQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;lr&amp;hl=en&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PT54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | title = Whitney Houston's Success Is Global | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | volume = 97 | issue = 23 | date = June 8, 1985 | accessdate = March 15, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the soulful Ballad &quot;[[You Give Good Love]]&quot; was chosen as the [[lead single]] from Houston's debut to establish her in the black marketplace first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Paul Grein | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/entertainment/ca-9249_1/3 | title = Houston Hits: Master Plan, Blind Luck | publisher = [[Tribune Company]] | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = June 8, 1986 | accessdate = October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the US, the song failed to get enough attention to become a hit but in the US, gave the album its first major hit as it peaked at #3 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and #1 on the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&amp;B]] chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard86&quot;/&gt; As a result, the album began to sell strongly, and Houston continued promotion by touring nightclubs in the US. She also began performing on late-night television talk shows, which were not usually accessible to unestablished black acts. The jazzy ballad &quot;[[Saving All My Love for You]]&quot; was released next and it would become Houston's first #1 single in both the US and the UK. She was now an opening act for singer [[Jeffrey Osborne]] on his nationwide tour. &quot;Thinking About You&quot; was released as the promo single only to R&amp;B-oriented radio stations, which peaked at number ten of the US R&amp;B Chart. At the time, MTV had received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black, latin, and other racial minorities while favoring white acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Whitney Houston|Series=Headliners And Legends|serieslink=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036702/|airdate = August 11, 2000|season=|number=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third US single, &quot;[[How Will I Know]],&quot; peaked at #1 and introduced Houston to the MTV audience thanks to its video. Houston's subsequent singles from this, and future albums, would make her the first African-American female artist to receive consistent heavy rotation on MTV.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot; /&gt; By 1986, a year after its initial release, ''Whitney Houston'' topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart and stayed there for 14 non-consecutive weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard861227&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | url = http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=tiQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = 1986 Overview: Charts | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | volume = 98 | issue = 52 | date = December 27, 1986 | accessdate = March 17, 2011 | issn = 0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final single, &quot;[[Greatest Love of All]],&quot; became Houston's biggest hit at the time after peaking #1 and remaining there for three weeks on the Hot 100 chart, which made her debut the first album by a female artist to yield three #1 hits.

===1987â91: ''Whitney'', ''I'm Your Baby Tonight'' and &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;===
With many expectations Houstonâs second album, ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'', was released in June 1987. The album again featured production from Masser, Kashif and Walden as well as [[Jellybean Benitez]]. Many critics complained that the material was too similar to her previous album. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said, &quot;the narrow channel through which this talent has been directed is frustrating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Vince |last=Aletti | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/whitney-19870813 | title = Review: ''Whitney'' | publisher = [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media, LLC]] | date = August 13, 1987 | accessdate = March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the album enjoyed commercial success. Houston became the first female artist in music history to debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart, and the first artist to enter the albums chart at number one in both the US and UK, while also hitting number one or top ten in dozens of other countries around the world. The album's first single, &quot;[[I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)]],&quot; was also a massive hit worldwide, peaking at #1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and topping the singles chart in many countries such as Australia, Germany and the UK. The next three singles, &quot;[[Didn't We Almost Have It All]],&quot; &quot;[[So Emotional]],&quot; and &quot;[[Where Do Broken Hearts Go]]&quot; all peaked at number one on the US Hot 100 chart, which gave her a total of seven consecutive number one hits, breaking the record of six previously shared by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Bee Gees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal= [[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] |author =| url = http://books.google.com/?id=WLADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq | title = Whitney Breaks Record For Consecutive No.1 Tunes|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company | volume = 74 | issue = 5 | date=May 2, 1988|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | issn = 0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |first= Jeff |last=Silberman |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=JQ8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Arista Records: A Quarter Century Of Achievements|publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | volume = 112 | issue = 20 | date=May 13, 2000 | accessdate=January 12, 2010 | issn = 0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston became the first female artist to generate four number-one singles from one albu.

===1992â94: Marriage to Bobby Brown and ''The Bodyguard''===
Throughout the 1980s, Houston was romantically linked to [[American football]] star [[Randall Cunningham]] and actor Eddie Murphy, whom she dated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norment-1991&quot; /&gt; She then met R&amp;B singer [[Bobby Brown]] at the 1989 Soul Train Music Awards. After a three year courtship, the two were married on July 18, 1992. Nearly a year later, Houston gave birth to their daughter Bobbi Kristina Houston Brown, her first and only child, his fourth. Brown would go on to have several run-ins with the law, including some jail time.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Kenner, [http://www.vibe.com/news/online_exclusives/2006/09/when_bobby_met_whitney_the_timeline/ When Bobby Met Whitney: The Timeline], ''Vibe'', September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the commercial success of her albums, movie offers poured in, including offers to work with [[Robert De Niro]], [[Quincy Jones]], and [[Spike Lee]]; but Houston felt the time wasn't right.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norment-1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] | date = May 1991 | author = Lynn Norment | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=UdQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;hl=ko&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Whitney Houston talks about the men in her life â and the rumors, lies and insults that are the high price of fame | publisher = Johnson Publishing Company | volume = 46 | issue = 7 | issn = 0012-9011 | pages = 111â118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houstonâs first film role was in ''[[The Bodyguard]]'', released in 1992 and co-starring [[Kevin Costner]]. Houston played Rachel Marron, a star who is stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard to protect her. ''USA Today'' listed it as one of the 25 most memorable movie moments of the last 25 years in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[USA Today]] | author = Susan Wloszczyna | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/top25-movies.htm | title = Hollywood highlights: 25 movies with real impact | publisher = [[Gannett Company, Inc.]] | date = July 2, 2007 | accessdate = October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie is also notable for not mentioning or needing to explain its interracial aspect.

In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 1993, the singer commented that &quot;people know who Whitney Houston isâI'm black. You can't hide that fact.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS93&quot; /&gt; Houston received a [[Razzie Award]] nomination for Worst Actress. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said Houston is &quot;doing nothing more than playing Houston, comes out largely unscathed if that is possible in so cockamamie an undertaking&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rita Kempley, | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thebodyguardrkempley_a0a2f7.htm | title = The Bodyguard | work = [[The Washington Post]] | publisher = [[The Washington Post Company]] | date = November 25, 1992| accessdate = October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The New York Times'' commented she lacked passion with her co-star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE6DE1E3DF936A15752C1A964958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq | arthur = Janet Maslin | title = Review/Film: The Bodyguard; Tragic Flaw Meets Pampered Pop Star Over Multiple Risks | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] | date = November 25, 1992 | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the film's mixed reviews, it was hugely successful at the box office, grossing more than $121 million in the U.S. and $410 million worldwide, making it one of the top 100 grossing films in film history at its time of release, though it is no longer in the top 100 due to rising current ticket prices since the time the film was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm?page=3&amp;p=.htm| title=All Time Box Office Domestic Grosses|publisher=boxofficemojo.com | date=| accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's soundtrack also enjoyed big success. Houston executive produced and contributed six songs for the motion picture's [[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|adjoining soundtrack album]]. ''Rolling Stone'' said it is &quot;nothing more than pleasant, tasteful and urbane.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | first= Arion | last= Berger | title= ''The Bodyguard'' Review| date=February 18, 1993| publisher= [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media, LLC]]| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/albums/album/209469/review/6210412/the_bodyguard| accessdate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack's lead single was &quot;[[I Will Always Love You (Whitney Houston version)|I Will Always Love You]],&quot; written and originally recorded by [[Dolly Parton]] in 1974.

===1995â97: ''Waiting to Exhale'', ''The Preacher's Wife'' and ''Cinderella''===
In 1995, Houston starred alongside [[Angela Bassett]], [[Loretta Devine]], and [[Lela Rochon]] in her second film ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', a motion picture about four African-American women struggling with relationships. Houston plays the lead character Savannah Jackson, a TV producer in love with a married man. She chose the role because she saw the film as &quot;a breakthrough for the image of black women because it presents them both as professionals and as caring mothers&quot;.&lt;ref name=prissy/&gt; After opening at number one and grossing $67 million in the US at the box office and $81 million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=waitingtoexhale.htm |title=Waiting to Exhale (1995) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=March 2, 1996 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it proved that a movie primarily targeting a black audience can cross over to success, while paving the way for other all-black movies such as ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' and the [[Tyler Perry]] movies that have become popular in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/africanambib2.html African American Filmmakers, African American Films: A Bibliography of Materials in the UC Berkeley Library], UC Berkeley Library (last visited February 15, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ascher-Walsh, [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,284411,00.html &quot;Back in the Groove?&quot;], ''Entertainment Weekly'', August 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicole LaPorte, [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918919.html?categoryid=1055&amp;cs=1 &quot;Diary of a Mad Niche Hit&quot;], ''Variety'', March 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also notable for its portrayal of black women as strong middle class citizens as opposed to stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= Jack E. | last= White | title= Heavy Breathing |date=January 15, 1996| publisher= Time Magazine | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983966,00.html| accessdate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews were mainly positive for the ensemble cast. ''The New York Times'' said &quot;Ms. Houston has shed the defensive hauteur that made her portrayal of a pop star in 'The Bodyguard' seem so distant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 22, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Houston was nominated for an [[NAACP Image Award]] for &quot;Outstanding Actress In A Motion Picture,&quot; but lost to her co-star Bassett.

The film's accompanying soundtrack, ''[[Waiting to Exhale: Original Soundtrack Album]]'', was produced by Houston and Babyface. Though Babyface originally wanted Houston to record the entire album, she declined. Instead, she &quot;wanted it to be an album of women with vocal distinction&quot;, and thus gathered several African-American female artists for the soundtrack, to go along with the film's strong women message.&lt;ref name=prissy&gt;{{Cite news| first= Christopher John | last= Farley | title= No More Prissy |date=December 4, 1995| publisher= Time Magazine | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983795-2,00.html| accessdate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the album featured a range of contemporary R&amp;B female recording artists along with Houston, such as [[Mary J Blige]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Patti Labelle]], and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]]. Houston's &quot;[[Exhale (Shoop Shoop)]]&quot; peaked at #1, and then spent a record eleven weeks at the #2 spot and eight weeks on top of the R&amp;B Charts. &quot;Count On Me&quot;, a duet with [[CeCe Winans]], hit the US Top 10; and Houston's third contribution, &quot;[[Why Does It Hurt So Bad]]&quot;, made the Top 30. The album debuted at #1, and was certified 7Ã Platinum in the United States, denoting shipments of seven million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa.org&quot;/&gt; The soundtrack received strong reviews as ''Entertainment Weekly'' said &quot;the album goes down easy, just as you'd expect from a package framed by Whitney Houston tracks.... the soundtrack waits to exhale, hovering in sensuous suspense&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Entertainment Weekly]] December 1, 1995 pg.73&lt;/ref&gt; and has since ranked it as one of the 100 Best Movie Soundtracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first= Chris | last= Willman | title= 100 Best Movie Soundtracks| date=October 12, 2001| publisher= Entertainment Weekly| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,254121,00.html| accessdate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Newsday'' called it &quot;the most significant R&amp;B record of the decade.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Later that year, Houston's children's charity organization was awarded a VH1 Honor for all the charitable work

In 1996, Houston starred in the holiday comedy ''[[The Preacher's Wife]]'', with [[Denzel Washington]]. She plays a gospel-singing wife of a pastor ([[Courtney B. Vance]]). Houston earned $10 million for the role, making her one of the highest paid actress in Hollywood at the time and the highest earning African American actress in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Charles.

''The San Francisco Chronicle'' said Houston &quot;is rather angelic herself, displaying a divine talent for being virtuous and flirtatious at the same time&quot; and that she &quot;exudes gentle yet spirited warmth, especially when praising the Lord in her gorgeous singing voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stack, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/12/13/DD36582.DTL Human Comedy's Divine in 'Preacher's Wife'], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', December 13, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Houston was again nominated for an [[NAACP Image Award]] and won for Outstanding Actress In A Motion Picture.

Houston recorded and co-produced, with Mervyn Warren, the film's accompanying gospel soundtrack. ''[[The Preacher's Wife: Original Soundtrack Album]]'' included six gospel songs with [[Georgia Mass Choir]] that were recorded at the Great Star Rising Baptist Church in Atlanta. Houston also duetted with gospel legend [[Shirley Caesar]]. The album sold six million copies worldwide and scored hit singles with &quot;[[I Believe in You and Me]]&quot; and &quot;[[Step by Step (Annie Lennox song)|Step by Step]]&quot;, becoming the largest selling gospel album of all time. The album received mainly positive reviews.

In 1997, Houston's production company changed its name to BrownHouse Productions and was joined by [[Debra Martin Chase]]. Their goal was &quot;to show aspects of the lives of African-Americans that have not been brought to the screen before&quot; while improving how African-Americans are portrayed in film and television.&lt;ref name=brownhouse&gt;[http://www.classicwhitney.com/interview/ebony_nov1997.htm Whitney scores as producer and star].

===1998â2000: ''My Love Is Your Love'' and ''Whitney: The Greatest Hits''===
After spending much of the early and mid 1990s working on motion pictures and their adjacent soundtrack albums, Houston's first studio album in eight years, the critically acclaimed ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]'', was released in November 1998. Though originally slated to be a greatest hits album with a handful of new songs, recording sessions were so fruitful that a new full-length studio album was released. Recorded and mixed in only six weeks, it featured production from [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and [[Missy Elliott]]. The album debuted at number thirteen, its peak position, on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=LgoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ko&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The ''Billboard'' 200 chart listing for the week of December 5, 1998 | page = 126 | volume = 110 | issue = 49 | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | issn = 0006-2510 | date = December 5, 1998 | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a funkier and edgier sound than past releases and saw Houston handling urban dance, [[hip hop music|hip hop]], mid-tempo [[R&amp;B]], [[reggae]], [[torch song]]s, and ballads all with great dexterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=IwoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;vq=whitney%20houston&amp;hl=ko&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Houston Finds a New Groove with Arista Set | author = Melinda Newman | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | pages = 1, 86 | volume = 110 | issue = 44 | issn = 0006-2510 | date = October 31, 1998 | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From late 1998 to spring of 2000, the album spawned several hit singles: &quot;[[When You Believe]]&quot; (US #15, UK #4), a duet with Mariah Carey for 1998's ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' [[The Prince of Egypt (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], it also became an international hit as it peaked in the Top 10 in several countries and won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song#1991-2000|Academy Award for Best Original Song]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/71st-winners.html | title = The 71st Academy Awards (1999) Nominees and Winners | publisher = [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | date = March 21, 1999 | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Heartbreak Hotel (Whitney Houston song)|Heartbreak Hotel]]&quot; (US #2, UK# 25) featured [[Faith Evans]] and [[Kelly Price]], got a [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards|1999 MTV VMA]] nomination for [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards#Nominations|Best R&amp;B Video]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | url = http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1999/ | title = 1999 MTV Video Music Awards | publisher = MTV Network | date = September 9, 1999 | accessdate = July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number one on the US R&amp;B chart for seven weeks; &quot;[[It's Not Right But It's Okay]]&quot; (US #4, UK #3) won Houston her sixth [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=whitney+houston&amp;title=&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All | title = Past Winners Search: Whitney Houston | publisher = [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] | date = February 23, 2000 | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]&quot; (US #4, UK #2) with 3 million copies sold worldwide;&lt;ref name=&quot;mliylsingle01&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | author = | url = http://books.google.co.kr/books?id=fwgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;lr&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; single; triple platinum worldwide | page = 137 | volume = 111 | issue = 47 | publisher = Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | date = November 20, 1999 | accessdate = September 25, 2010 | issn = 0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[I Learned from the Best]]&quot; (US #27, UK #19).&lt;ref name=&quot;whitneyhoustonbillboardhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/#/artist/whitney-houston/chart-history/4849 | title = Whitney Houston ''Billboard'' chart history | publisher = billboard.com | date = | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitneyhoustonukcharthistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/whitney%20houston/ | title = Artist Chart History: Whitney Houston | publisher = [[The Official Charts Company]] | date = | accessdate = October, 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These singles became international hits as well, and all the singles, except &quot;When You Believe,&quot; became number one hits on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance/Club Play]] chart.

===2000â05: ''Just Whitney'', and personal struggles===
Though Houston was seen as a &quot;good girl&quot; with a perfect image in the '80s and early '90s, by the late '90s, her behavior changed. She was often hours late for interviews, photo shoots and rehearsals, and canceling concerts and talk-show appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/biography Whitney Houston Biography], ''Rolling Stone'' (last visited February 15, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McShane-20000406&quot;&gt;Larry McShane, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/ent3.htm &quot;Whitney Houston Gets Bad Press&quot;], ''Washington Post'', April 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; With the missed performances and weight loss, rumors about Houston using drugs with her husband circulated. On January 11, 2000, airport security guards discovered marijuana in both Houston's and husband Bobby Brown's luggage at a Hawaii airport, but the two boarded the plane and departed before authorities could arrive. Charges were later dropped against her and Brown,&lt;ref&gt;TCM Breaking News, [http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2001/09/11/story23275.asp &quot;Fears for Whitney Houston Grow&quot;], September 11, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; but rumors of drug usage between the couple would continue to surface. Two months later, Clive Davis was inducted into the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]]. Houston had been scheduled to perform at the event, but did not attend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dansby-20000607&quot;&gt;Andrew Dansby, [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/whitneyhouston/articles/story/5924161/whitney_insider_tells_of_drug_use_failed_intervention &quot;Whitney Insider Tells of Drug Use, Failed Intervention&quot;], ''Rolling Stone'', June 7, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Houston was scheduled to perform at the Academy Awards but was fired from the event by musical director and long time friend [[Burt Bacharach]]. Her publicist cited throat problems as the reason for the cancellation. In his book ''The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards'', author Steve Pond revealed that &quot;Houston's voice was shaky, she seemed distracted and jittery, and her attitude was casual, almost defiant,&quot; and that while Houston was to sing &quot;[[Over the Rainbow]]&quot;, she would start singing a different song.&lt;ref&gt;Movie &amp; TV News @ IMDB.com, [http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2004-12-23#celeb5 &quot;Houston's Oscar Confusion&quot;], December 23, 2004.

In August 2001, Houston signed the biggest record deal in music history with Arista/[[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. She renewed her contract for $100 million to deliver six new albums, on which she would also earn royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last= Lafranco with Mark Binelli and Fred Goodman|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938443/the_rolling_stone_money_report|title=The Rolling Stone Money Report: The pop stars who earned the most last year â and how they did it|publisher= [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media, LLC]] |date=July 4, 2002|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BbUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=whitney+houston+%24100+million+contract&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=whitney%20houston%20%24100%20million%20contract|title= Whitney Houston Signs $100 Million Contract with Arista Records (p18)|publisher=''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]''|date=August 20, 2001|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | first=Gail|last= Mitchell|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MQ0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=whitney+houston+%24100+million+contract+six+albums&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=|title=Arista Aims New Houston Album At 'Core Urban' Fans| publisher = Nielson Business Media, Inc. |date=December 14, 2002|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later made an appearance on ''[[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]]''. Her extremely thin frame further spurred rumors of drug use. Houston's publicist said, &quot;Whitney has been under stress due to family matters, and when she is under stress she doesn't eat.&quot;&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{Cite news| first= Sharon | last= Knolle | title= Reports of Whitney Houston's Death Denied |date=September 13, 2001 | publisher= ABC News | url= http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=102477&amp;page=1| accessdate= March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer was scheduled for a second performance the following night but canceled.&lt;ref&gt;Lynette Holloway, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E2D91231F932A25752C1A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print &quot;In Switch, Whitney Houston Has to Sell an Album&quot;], ''New York Times'', November 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, Houston's rendition of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; would be re-released after the terrorist attacks of September 11. The song peaked at #6 this time on the US Hot 100, topping its previous position.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitneyhoustonbillboardhistory&quot;/&gt; Houston donated her portion of the proceeds.

In 2002, Houston became involved in a legal dispute with John Houston Enterprise. Although the company was started by her father to manage her career, it was now actually run by company president Kevin Skinner. Skinner filed a [[breach-of-contract]] [[lawsuit]] and sued for $100 million (but lost), stating that Houston owed the company previously unpaid compensation for helping to negotiate her $100 million contract with Arista Records and for sorting out legal matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458015/20021008/houston_whitney.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Whitney Houston Sued For $100 Million By Dad's Company |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |work=MTV.com |date=October 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston stated that her 81-year-old father had nothing to do with the lawsuit. Although Skinner tried to claim otherwise, John Houston never appeared in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_19_102/ai_93457202 |title=Whitney Houston is sued for $100 million by her father's entertainment company â Entertainment |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |work=Jet Magazine |date=October 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston's father later died in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Roger.

Also in 2002, Houston did an interview with [[Diane Sawyer]] to promote her then-upcoming album. The interview was the highest-rated television interview in history. During the prime-time special, Houston spoke on topics including rumored drug use and marriage. She was asked about the ongoing drug rumors and replied, &quot;First of all, let's get one thing straight. [[Crack cocaine|Crack]] is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is wack.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer-Houston-Interview-2002&quot; /&gt; The line would become infamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14824108/|title=Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown separate|date=September 13, 2006|publisher=msnbc.msn.com|accessdate=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston did, however, admit to using other substances at times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawyer-Houston-Interview-2002&quot; /&gt;

In December 2002, Houston released her fifth studio album, ''[[Just Whitney...]]''. The album included productions from then-husband [[Bobby Brown]], as well as Missy Elliott and Babyface, and marked the first time Houston did not produce with [[Clive Davis]] as Davis had been released by top management at BMG. Upon its release, ''Just Whitney...'' received mixed reviews.&lt;ref&gt;MetaCritic.com, [http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/houstonwhitney/justwhitney &quot;Just Whitney&quot; by Whitney Houston] (last visited February 15, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The album debuted at number 9 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and it had the highest first week sales of any album Houston had ever released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=4849&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=556398 |title=Music News, Reviews, Articles, Information, News Online &amp; Free Music |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four singles released from the album, didn't fare well on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, but became [[Hot Dance Club Play]] hits. ''Just Whitney...'' was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the United States, and sold approximately three million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Certification Searchable Database|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|date=January 10, 2003|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, Houston released her first Christmas album ''[[One Wish: The Holiday Album]]'', with a song listing of traditional holiday songs. Houston produced the album with [[Mervyn Warren]] and Gordon Chambers. A single titled &quot;[[One Wish (for Christmas)]]&quot; reached the Top 20 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and the album was certified gold in the US. Having always been a touring artist, Houston spent most of 2004 touring and performing in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]], and [[Russia]]. In September 2004, she gave a surprise performance at the [[World Music Awards]], in tribute to long time friend [[Clive Davis]]. After the show, Davis and Houston announced plans to go into studio to work on her new album.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cashmere, [http://www.whitney-houston.com/news/articles/180904a.htm &quot;Whitney Back With Clive Davis&quot;], Pops by Paul Cashmere, September 17, 2004, available at whitney-houston.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2004, husband Bobby Brown starred in his own reality TV program, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'' (on the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo network]]), which provided a view into the domestic goings-on in the Brown household. Though it was Brown's vehicle, Houston was a prominent figure throughout the show, receiving as much screen time as Brown. The series aired in 2005 and featured Houston in, what some would say, not her most flattering moments. The ''Hollywood Reporter'' said it was &quot;undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barry Garron, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8409211/ &quot;'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting&quot;], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot and continued Houston's successful forays into film and television.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php &quot;Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season&quot;], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was not renewed for a second season after Houston stated she would no longer appear in it, and Brown and Bravo could not come to an agreement for another season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=12515 &quot;Brown Reality Show Cancelled&quot;], ''SFGate'', The Daily Dish, January 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed the song &quot;I Look to You&quot; on the German television show ''Wetten Dass.'' Three days later, she performed the worldwide first single from I Look To You, [[Million Dollar Bill]], on the French television show Le Grand Journal. Houston appeared as guest mentor on ''[[The X Factor (UK series 6)|The X Factor]]'' in the United Kingdom.

In January 2010, Houston was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards, one for Best Female Artist and one for Best Music Video. She won the award for Best Music Video for her single &quot;I Look to You.&quot; On January 16, she received the BET Honors Award for Entertainer citing her lifetime achievements spanning over 25 years in the industry. The 2010 BET Honors was held at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]] in [[Washington, DC]] and aired February 1, 2010. [[Jennifer Hudson]] and [[Kim Burrell]] performed in honor of her, garnering positive reviews. Houston also received a nomination from the Echo Awards, Germany's version of the Grammys, for Best International Artist. In April 2010, the UK newspaper ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' reported that Houston was thinking about recording her eighth studio album and would like to collaborate with [[will.i.am]] (of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]), her first choice for a collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a212730/houston-eyes-william-collaboration.html |title=Houston eyes will.i.am collaboration |publisher=Digitalspy.co.uk |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houston also performed the song &quot;I Look to You&quot; on the 2011 [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] ''Celebration of Gospel'', with [[Gospel music|gospel]]âjazz singer [[Kim Burrell]], held at the Staple Center, Los Angeles. The performance aired on January 30, 2011. Early in 2011, she gave an uneven performance in tribute to cousin Dionne Warwick at music mogul Clive Davis' annual pre-Grammy gala. In May 2011, Houston enrolled in rehabilitation center again, as an out-patient, citing drug and alcohol problems. A representative for Houston said that it was a part of Houston's &quot;longstanding recovery process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/05/whitney-houston-rehab-alcohol-drugs.html|title =Whitney Houston in outpatient rehab for alcohol, drugs|last =D'Zurilla|first =Christie|publisher =''Los Angeles Times''.

In September 2011, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Houston will produce and star (alongside [[Jordin Sparks]] and [[Mike Epps]]) in the remake of the 1976 film ''[[Sparkle (2012 film)|Sparkle]]''. It was also reported that Houston will play Sparks's &quot;not-so encouraging mother&quot;. Houston will have executive producer credits on top of acting credits according to Debra Martin Chase, producer of ''Sparkle''. She stated Houston deserves the title considering she's been there from the beginning in 2001 when Houston obtained ''Sparkle'' production rights. R&amp;B singer [[Aaliyah]]'s death in a 2001 plane crash derailed production which would have began in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/news/whitney-houston-in-talks-to-star-alongside-1005349412.story Billboard].

On October 7, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding [[Arista Records]] along with [[J Records]] and [[Jive Records]]. With the shutdown, Houston (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release her future material on the [[RCA Records]] brand.

Houston's vocal stylings have had a significant impact on the music industry.

During the 1980s, MTV was coming into its own and received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by black artists. With Michael Jackson breaking down the color barrier for black male artists, Houston did the same for black female artists.
