&quot;'''Wide Open Spaces'''&quot; is a [[country music|country]] song from the [[Dixie Chicks]], written by [[Susan Gibson]].  Appearing as the title song on the band's 1998 album ''[[Wide Open Spaces]]'', it was released as a single in August of that year,&lt;ref name=&quot;dccd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/hitdisc.shtml#wos | title=Dixie Chicks Complete Discography: Wide Open Spaces | publisher=The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page | date=2000-04-12 | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hit number one on the [[US Hot Country|U.S. Country singles chart]], spending four weeks there in November 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;dccd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dixiechicks.com/06_historical.asp | title=Historical Dixie Chicks | publisher=[[Dixie Chicks]] | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also placed to number 41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. Pop singles chart]].  It reached number one on Canada's country music chart, their first chart-topper there and presaging a long history of support for the band.

In 2001, the [[RIAA]] placed &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; at number 259 on its 365 [[Songs of the Century]] list.  In 2003, [[CMT]] named it number 22 in its 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music list.

==History==
[[Amarillo, Texas]]-based [[Susan Gibson]] wrote the song's first lyrics in 1993, on her first visit back home after leaving for [[forestry school]] at the [[University of Montana â Missoula|University of Montana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ranger&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.ac-ranger.com/media/storage/paper733/news/2006/10/19/ArtsEntertainment/Susan.Gibson.Returns.To.wide.Open.Spaces-2377573.shtml | title=Susan Gibson returns to 'Wide Open Spaces' | author=Nelson, Rachel | publisher=''[[The Ranger]]'' | date=2006-10-19 | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mont&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.umt.edu/montanan/s08/onhermind.asp | title=Montana On Her Mind | author=Stephens, Patia | publisher=''[[The Montanan]]'' | date=Spring 2008 | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She left the notebook containing the lyrics at home by mistake when she returned to school; her mother found it and included it in a [[care package]], inspiring Gibson to complete a song along the themes of leaving home.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranger&quot;/&gt; She first performed it in local clubs around the University of Montana, where it was sometimes requested.&lt;ref name=&quot;mont&quot;/&gt; 

By the late 1990s, Gibson was lead singer of the [[alt country]] band The Groobees.&lt;ref name=&quot;tracy&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Tracy | first=Kathleen | title=The Dixie Chicks: Photo Biography | publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2000 | isbn=1-550-22418-2}} p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  They recorded an album, ''Wayside'', that included &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ranger&quot;/&gt; and which would be released in 1999.  It was [[record producer|produced]] by [[Lloyd Maines]], father of new Dixie Chicks lead singer [[Natalie Maines]].  

[[Image:WideOpenSpacesSongSheetMusic.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cover of the published sheet music for the song]]
Lloyd Maines identified with the tale of a daughter leaving home, and thought it would match Natalie's vocal character well; he brought the song to the group,&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;/&gt; who tested it in concert a few times to a strong response.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranger&quot;/&gt;  Both the Chicks and [[Sony Music]] agreed with Lloyd Maines' assessment, not only recording it but making it the title tune of the Maines-era group's first album as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;tracy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;/&gt;

The youthful, romantic, adventurous sense of independence featured in &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; helped key much of the group's new image; it thus became one of their [[signature song]]s and proved very popular among young teenage girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;dccd&quot;/&gt;  The lyric speaks of possibilities yet undiscovered:

:''She needs wide open spaces,
:''Room to make her big mistakes
:''She needs new faces â
:''She knows the high stakes

The lyric has been considered an exemplar of the songwriting strategy in which lines are not repeated in either the verses or chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Braheny | first=John | title=The Craft and Business of Songwriting: A Practical Guide to Creating | publisher=[[Writer's Digest Books]] | year=2006 | isbn=1-582-97466-7}} p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Texas, [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-flavored arrangement&lt;ref name=&quot;dccd&quot;/&gt; in the recording begins with a [[fiddle]] riff, with the band soon joining in.  Verses are sung by [[Natalie Maines]] by herself, with [[Drum kit|drums]], [[fiddle]], and soft [[guitar]] and [[piano]] carrying the accompaniment.  Choruses feature sisters [[Emily Erwin]] and [[Martie Seidel]] backing Maines with [[harmony vocals]], and also add a [[banjo]] line.  The instrumental break features Erwin and Seidel on [[mandolin]] and fiddle respectively.  The main fiddle riff then brings the recording to a close.

Emily Erwin was proud that the group's hits such as this were still able to incorporate the banjo, an instrument the Nashville establishment often frowned upon as being too hillbilly.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, ''Photo Biography'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Susan Gibson and &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; has been considered an example of the influence of the [[West Texas]] influence in country music songwriting;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Brink, Pamela H. | chapter=West Texas Family Music Making | title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains | editor=David J. Wishart (ed.) | publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]] | year=2004 | isbn=0-803-24787-7}} p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson herself considers Amarillo to be &quot;where the wide open spaces are. Amarillo has the most beautiful sunsets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ranger&quot;/&gt;  Gibson's childhood family drives from Amarillo to [[Missoula, Montana]] also trace the song's lyric and settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;mont&quot;/&gt;  

The song gained Nashville respect, as it was named the [[Country Music Association Awards]] Single of the Year in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmt&quot;/&gt;  It also won Gibson the ''[[American Songwriter]]'' Professional Country Songwriter of the Year award in early 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;cmt&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1472932/susan-gibson-nets-top-award-for-wide-open-spaces.jhtml | title=Susan Gibson Nets Top Award for &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; | author=Morris, Edward | publisher=[[CMT]] | date=2000-01-28 | accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] award the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;cmt&quot;/&gt;  Although the song itself was not nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] (the album was, as was its previous single, &quot;[[There's Your Trouble]]&quot;, both of which won in their categories),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/1999/grammys/bigpicture.html | title=41st annual Grammy nominees and winners | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=1999-02-24 | accessdate=2008-07-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080613094347/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/1999/grammys/bigpicture.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was included on the various artists ''[[Grammy Nominees#1999|1999 Grammy Nominees]]'' [[compilation album]].

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; portrayed the Dixie Chicks in a [[Rocky Mountains]] setting, cavorting through wide open fields of [[wildflowers]] and the like.  Interspersed were scenes of the then-all blonde Chicks on tour:  in performance, backstage, and on their tour bus (the last showing the slogan &quot;Ain't Skeerd&quot; on the outside).  The performance was filmed at [[West Fest]], an annual event in [[Winter Park, Colorado]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickerson&quot;&gt;Dickerson, James L. (2000) ''Dixie Chicks: Down-Home and Backstage''. Taylor Trade Publishing, Dallas, Texas. ISBN 0-87833-189-1. pp. 108â109.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Chicks appeared four years running.&lt;ref name=&quot;tracy&quot;/&gt;  The mountain scenes were done around Winter Park as well, and included background shots of some of the Chicks exercising their [[trampoline]] talents. It was directed by Thom Oliphant, who previously directed &quot;There's Your Trouble,&quot; and would later co-direct &quot;Without You.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Dickerson&quot;/&gt;  

This effort was directed by [[Thom Oliphant]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dickerson&quot;/&gt; and was named the [[Country Music Association Awards]] Music Video of the Year in 1999.  It was placed at #32 on [[CMT]]'s 2004 ranking of the 100 Greatest Videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/78625/episode_countdown.jhtml | title=100 Greatest Music Videos | publisher=[[CMT]] | date=2004 | accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The commercial success of the single and album gave songwriter Gibson something of a windfall, which she celebrated by going to [[San Marcos, Texas]] and buying gifts for everyone she knew.&lt;ref name=&quot;hudson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Hudson | first=Kathleen | title=Women in Texas Music: Stories and Songs | publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] | year=2007 | isbn=0-292-71734-2}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  She would later say the song was both innocent and personal for her, in the latter detailed so much that she was surprised another artist would relate to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;sast&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=More than 'Wide Open Spaces' | author=Boyd, John | publisher=''[[San Angelo Standard-Times]]'' | date=2005-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She would say of the song's recording by the Chicks that it was &quot;beautiful [with] stunning musicianship and very professional production ... [a] gorgeous recording.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mont&quot;/&gt;  And of the song's popularity, Gibson would say, &quot;So much of the success of that song belongs to [the Dixie Chicks] ... but pairing that song with that group is what made 'Wide Open Spaces' what it is. It really was just a magical combination of right place, right time, right group. I'm glad it happened to me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sast&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; has been a constant on the Chicks' concert tours, and indeed was the only song from ''Wide Open Spaces'' still in the [[set list]] as of the 2006 [[Accidents &amp; Accusations Tour]].  ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that in one such 2006 performance, in light of the still-ongoing [[Dixie Chicks political controversy]], &quot;songs like 'Wide Open Spaces' ..., about women leaving home and striking out on their own, sounded more than ever like mission statements.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/arts/music/03chic.html | title=Strong, Independent and Taking Their Own Advice | author=Sanneh, Kelefa | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2006-08-03 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | authorlink=Kelefa Sanneh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gibson also continues to perform it at her live performance outings.

The song appears on the game ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' edition ''[[CMT presents Karaoke Revolution Country]]''.
