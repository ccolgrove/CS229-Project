A '''mobile phone''' (also known as a '''cellular phone''', '''cell phone''' and a '''hand phone''') is a device that can make and receive [[telephone call]]s over a [[Radio Link Protocol|radio link]] whilst moving around a wide geographic area.  It does so by connecting to a [[cellular network]] provided by a [[mobile network operator]], allowing access to the [[PSTN|public telephone network]].  By contrast, a [[cordless telephone]] is used only within the short range of a single, private base station. 

In addition to telephony, modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other [[GSM services|services]] such as [[text messaging]], [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications ([[infrared port|infrared]], [[Bluetooth]]), business applications, gaming and photography. Mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as [[smartphone]]s.

The first hand-held mobile phone was demonstrated by [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Dr Martin Cooper]] of [[Motorola]] in 1973, using a handset weighing around 1 kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inventor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heeks | first = Richard | year = 2008 | title = Meet Marty Cooper â the inventor of the mobile phone | journal = BBC | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/8639590.stm | pages = 26â33 | doi = 10.1109/MC.2008.192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the [[Motorola DynaTAC|DynaTAC 8000x]] was the first to be commercially available. In the twenty years from 1990 to 2010, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew from 12.4 million to over 4.6 billion, penetrating the [[Information and communication technologies for development|developing economies]] and reaching the [[bottom of the pyramid|bottom of the economic pyramid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Heeks | first = Richard | year = 2008 | title = ICT4D 2.0: The Next Phase of Applying ICT for International Development | journal = IEEE Computer | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | url = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.192 | pages = 26â33 | doi = 10.1109/MC.2008.192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmapper.org/display.php?selected=333 |title=The world as you've never seen it before |publisher=Worldmapper |date= |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/15/business/main6209772.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Number of Cell Phones Worldwide Hits 4.6B | date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cell-phones-approach-total-penetration-globally-with-smartphones-moving-toward-market-dominance-2011-11-15 | work=Market Watch | title=Cell Phones Approach Total Penetration Globally, With Smartphones Moving Toward Market Dominance | date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of mobile phones}}
[[File:Mobile phone evolution.jpg|thumb|An evolution of mobile phones]]
[[Radiophone]]s have a long and varied history going back to [[Reginald Fessenden]]'s invention and shore-to-ship demonstration of radio telephony, through the [[Second World War]] with military use of radio telephony links and civil services in the 1950s.

The first mobile telephone call made from a car occurred in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], USA on June 17, 1946, using the [[Bell System]]'s [[Mobile Telephone Service]]. The equipment weighed {{convert|80|lb}}, and the [[AT&amp;T]] service, basically a massive party line, cost US$30 per month (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|30|1946|r=2}}}} today) plus 30â40 cents per local call, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.30|1946|r=2}}}} to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.40|1946|r=2}}0}} today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech Talk: Where'd it Come From, Anyway?|publisher=PC World|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/147698/tech_talk_whered_it_come_from_anyway.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the worldâs first partly ''automatic'' car phone system, Mobile System A (MTA), was launched in Sweden. MTA phones were composed of [[vacuum tube]]s and [[relay]]s, and had a weight of 40&amp;nbsp;kg. In 1962, a more modern version called ''Mobile System B (MTB)'' was launched, which was a [[push-button telephone]], and which used [[transistors]] to enhance the telephoneâs calling capacity and improve its operational reliability, thereby reducing the weight of the apparatus to 10&amp;nbsp;kg. In 1971, the [[MTD (mobile network)|MTD]] version was launched, opening for several different brands of equipment and gaining commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8ZRo-lxUDwkC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Mobile+System+A+(MTA)#v=onepage&amp;q=m%C3%A4kitalo&amp;f=false |title=Mingtao Shi, ''Technology base of mobile cellular operators in Germany and China'', page 55 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2007-09-11|accessdate=26 August 2010|isbn=9783798320574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilen50ar.se/eng/FaktabladENGFinal.pdf |title=Facts about the Mobile |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]], a [[Motorola]] researcher and executive is considered to be the inventor of the first practical mobile phone for ''handheld'' use in a non-vehicle setting, after a long race against [[Bell Labs]] for the first portable mobile phone. Using a modern, if somewhat heavy portable handset, Cooper made the first call on a handheld mobile phone on April 3, 1973 to his rival, Dr. [[Joel S. Engel]] of [[Bell Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shiels |first=Maggie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2963619.stm |title=BBC interview with Martin Cooper | work=BBC News | date=21 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first commercial automated cellular network was launched in Japan by [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] in 1979, initially in the metropolitan area of Tokyo. Within five years, the NTT network had been expanded to cover the whole population of Japan and became the first nationwide [[1G]] network. In 1981, this was followed by the simultaneous launch of the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) system in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/mobilen/engelska/1980_90.shtml |title=Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology |publisher=Tekniskamuseet.se |date= |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMT was the first mobile phone network featuring international [[roaming]]. The first 1G network launched in the USA was Chicago-based [[Ameritech]] in 1983 using the [[Motorola DynaTAC]] mobile phone. Several countries then followed in the early-to-mid 1980s including the UK, Mexico and Canada.

In 1991, the second generation ([[2G]]) cellular technology was launched in Finland by [[Radiolinja]] on the [[GSM]] standard, which sparked competition in the sector as the new operators challenged the incumbent 1G network operators.  

Ten years later, in 2001, the third generation ([[3G]]) was launched in Japan by [[NTT DoCoMo]] on the [[WCDMA]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UMTS World |url=http://www.umtsworld.com/umts/history.htm |title=History of UMTS and 3G development |publisher=Umtsworld.com |date= |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by 3.5G, 3G+ or turbo 3G enhancements based on the [[High-Speed Packet Access|high-speed packet access]] (HSPA) family, allowing [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS networks]] to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity.

==Features==
{{Main|Mobile phone features|Smartphone}}
[[Image:Mobil uvnitr.png|thumb|A [[printed circuit board]] inside a [[Nokia 3210]] ]]
All mobile phones have a number of features in common, but manufacturers also try to differentiate their own products by implementing additional functions to make them more attractive to consumers. This has led to great innovation in mobile phone development over the past 20 years.

The common components found on all phones are:
* A battery, providing the power source for the phone functions.
* An input mechanism to allow the user to interact with the phone. The most common input mechanism is a [[keypad]], but [[touch screen]]s are also found in some high-end smartphones.
* Basic [[GSM services|mobile phone services]] to allow users to make calls and send text messages.
* All [[GSM]] phones use a [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] to allow an account to be swapped among devices. Some [[CDMA]] devices also have a similar card called a [[Removable User Identity Module|R-UIM]].
* Individual GSM, WCDMA, iDEN and some satellite phone devices are uniquely identified by an [[International Mobile Equipment Identity]] (IMEI) number.

Low-end mobile phones are often referred to as [[feature phone]]s, and offer basic telephony, as well as functions such as playing music and taking photos, and sometimes simple applications based on generic [[Managed code|managed]] platforms such as [[Java ME]] or BREW. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications became known as [[smartphone]]s. The first smartphone was the [[Nokia 9000 Communicator]] in 1996 which added [[PDA]] functionality to the basic mobile phone at the time. As miniaturization and increased processing power of microchips has enabled ever more features to be added to phones, the concept of the smartphone has evolved, and what was a high-end smartphone five years ago, is a standard phone today.

Several phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM [[BlackBerry]] focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the SonyEricsson Walkman series of musicphones and Cybershot series of cameraphones; the [[Nokia Nseries]] of multimedia phones, the [[Palm Pre]] the [[HTC Dream]] and the Apple [[iPhone]].

Some mobile phone can make [[mobile payment]]s via direct mobile billing schemes or through [[contactless payment]]s if the phone and [[point of sale]] support [[Near Field Communication]] (NFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banktech.com/blog/archives/2007/06/mobile_payments.html |title=Mobile Payments: Look to Korea |author= Feig, Nancy |publisher=banktech.com |date=25 June 2007| accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the co-operation of manufacturers, network operators and retail merchants to enable contactless payments through NFC-equipped mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1350709 |title=End of the credit card?

Other features that may be found on mobile phones include [[GPS navigation]], music (MP3) and video ([[MP4]]) playback, [[Radio Data System|RDS]] radio receiver, alarms, memo recording, [[personal digital assistant]] functions, ability to watch [[streaming video]], video download, [[video calling]], built-in cameras (1.0+ [[Mpx]]) and [[camcorder]]s (video recording), with [[autofocus]]{{dubious|date=December 2011}} and flash, [[ringtone]]s, games, [[Push to talk|PTT]], [[memory card reader]] (SD), [[USB]] (2.0), dual line support, infrared, [[Bluetooth]] (2.0) and [[WiFi]] connectivity, [[instant messaging]], Internet e-mail and [[Web browser|browsing]] and serving as a [[wireless modem]]. 

[[Nokia]] and the University of Cambridge demonstrated a bendable cell phone called the [[Nokia Morph|Morph]].&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, Marguerite. [http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9878005-7.html &quot;Nokia demos bendable cell phone&quot;]. [[CNET Networks|CNET News]], February 25, 2008. Retrieved 20 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some phones have an electromechanical [[transducer]] on the back which changes the electrical voice signal into mechanical vibrations. The vibrations flow through the cheek bones or forehead allowing the user to hear the conversation. This is useful in the noisy situations or if the user is hard of hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieumart.com/mito-228-unique-handphone-can-hear-with-the-cheek.html Mito 228: Unique Handphone, Can Hear with the cheek], IeuMart.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software and applications===
[[Image:Toshiba tg01.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Toshiba TG01]] phone with touchscreen feature]]
{{See also|Mobile Industry Processor Interface}}
The most commonly used data application on mobile phones is [[SMS]] text messaging. The first SMS text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993.

Other non-SMS data services used on mobile phones include mobile music, downloadable logos and pictures, gaming, gambling, adult entertainment and advertising. The first downloadable mobile content was sold to a mobile phone in Finland in 1998, when Radiolinja (now Elisa) introduced the downloadable ringtone service. In 1999, Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo introduced its mobile Internet service, [[i-Mode]], which today is the world's largest mobile Internet service.

The first mobile news service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000. [[Mobile news]] services are expanding with many organizations providing &quot;on-demand&quot; news services by SMS. Some also provide &quot;instant&quot; news pushed out by SMS.

Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payments systems, on the mobile operators Globe and Smart. Today, mobile payments ranging from [[mobile banking]] to mobile credit cards to mobile commerce are very widely used in Asia and Africa, and in selected European markets.

===Power supply===
[[Image:Uganda mobile phone charging service.jpg|thumb|Mobile phone charging service in Uganda]]

Mobile phones generally obtain power from [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] batteries. There are a variety of ways used to charge cell phones, including [[USB]], portable batteries, mains power (using an [[AC adapter]]), cigarette lighters (using an adapter), or a [[Dynamo#Modern uses|dynamo]]. In 2009, the first wireless charger was released for consumer use.&lt;ref name=&quot;goingcellular&quot;&gt;[http://goingcellular.com/accessories/powermat-wireless-charger-now-available-441525/ goingcellular.com]&amp;nbsp;â Powermat wireless charger now available&lt;/ref&gt; Some manufacturers have been experimenting with alternative power sources, including [[solar cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androidphonez.com/charge-mini-solar-panel.html Charge Use Mini Solar Panel | Android Phones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Various initiatives, such as the EU [[Common External Power Supply]] have been announced to standardize the interface to the charger, and to promote energy efficiency of mains-operated chargers. A star rating system is promoted by some manufacturers, where the most efficient chargers consume less than 0.03 watts and obtain a five-star rating. 

[[Image:PSU no load 5 star rating chart.jpg|thumb|The world's five largest handset makers introduced a new rating system in November 2008 to help consumers more easily identify the most energy-efficient chargers]]

'''Battery'''

A popular early mobile phone battery was the [[Nickelâmetal hydride battery|nickel metal-hydride]] (NiMH) type, due to its relatively small size and low weight. [[Lithium ion battery|Lithium ion]] batteries are also used, as they are lighter and do not have the [[Memory effect#Voltage depression due to over-charging|Voltage depression due to long-term over-charging]] that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers use [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithiumâpolymer batteries]] as opposed to the older Lithium-Ion, the main advantages being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid.&lt;ref name=&quot;batteryguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |title=Cell Phone Battery Guide |publisher= |date= |url=http://www.funsms.net/cellphone_battery_guide.htm |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SIM card===
{{Main|Subscriber Identity Module|Removable User Identity Module}}
[[Image:Typical cellphone SIM cards.jpg|thumb|Typical mobile phone [[SIM card]]]]

[[GSM]] mobile phones require a small [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] called a Subscriber Identity Module or [[SIM Card]], to function. The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|service-subscriber key (IMSI)]] used to identify a subscriber on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device.

A SIM card contains its unique serial number, internationally unique number of the mobile user ([[IMSI]]), security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to and two passwords (PIN for usual use and PUK for unlocking).

SIM cards are available in three standard sizes. The first is the size of a credit card (85.60&amp;nbsp;mm Ã 53.98&amp;nbsp;mm x 0.76&amp;nbsp;mm, defined by [[ISO/IEC 7810]] as ID-1). The newer, most popular miniature version has the same thickness but a length of 25&amp;nbsp;mm and a width of 15&amp;nbsp;mm (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-000), and has one of its corners truncated (chamfered) to prevent misinsertion. The newest incarnation known as the 3FF or micro-SIM has dimensions of 15&amp;nbsp;mm Ã 12&amp;nbsp;mm. Most cards of the two smaller sizes are supplied as a full-sized card with the smaller card held in place by a few plastic links; it can easily be broken off to be used in a device that uses the smaller SIM.

The first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker [[Giesecke &amp; Devrient]] for the Finnish wireless network operator [[Radiolinja]]. Giesecke &amp; Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Elisa (ex. Radiolinja).

Those cell phones that do not use a SIM Card have the data programmed in to their memory. This data is accessed by using a special digit sequence to access the &quot;NAM&quot; as in &quot;Name&quot; or number programming menu. From there, information can be added, including a new number for the phone, new Service Provider numbers, new emergency numbers, new Authentication Key or A-Key code, and a Preferred Roaming List or PRL. However, to prevent the phone being accidentally disabled or removed from the network, the Service Provider typically locks this data with a Master Subsidiary Lock (MSL). The MSL also [[SIM lock|locks]] the device to a particular carrier when it is sold as a [[loss leader]].

The MSL applies only to the SIM, so once the contract has expired, the MSL still applies to the SIM. The phone, however, is also initially locked by the manufacturer into the Service Provider's MSL. This lock may be disabled so that the phone can use other Service Providers' SIM cards. Most phones purchased outside the U.S. are unlocked phones because there are numerous Service Providers that are close to one another or have overlapping coverage. The cost to unlock a phone varies but is usually very cheap and is sometimes provided by independent phone vendors.

A similar module called a [[Removable User Identity Module]] or RUIM card is present in some CDMA networks, notably in China and Indonesia.

'''Multi-card hybrid phones'''

A hybrid mobile phone can take more than one SIM card, even of different types. The SIM and RUIM cards can be mixed together, and some phones also support three or four SIMs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trisimphones.com/category/ht-g78 Example of a Triple SIM hybrid phone].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trisimphones.com/quad-sim-phones/the-latest-f160-quad-sim-quad-standby-tv-java-phone-with-qwerty-keyboard The Latest F160 Quad Sim Quad Standby TV Java Phone with Qwerty Keyboard | Tri Sim Phones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 onwards they became popular in India and Indonesia and other emerging markets,&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110429/wr_nm/us_handsets {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on-net calling rate.  In Q3 2011, [[Nokia]] shipped 18 million of its low cost dual SIM phone range in an attempt to make up lost ground in the higher end smartphone market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/11bbf530-fb11-11e0-bebe-00144feab49a.html#axzz1bTfJxgTz |title=Nokia boosted by sales of cheap handsets |date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Display===
Mobile phones have a [[display device]], some of which are also [[touch screen]]s. The [[Two-dimensional display size|screen size]] varies greatly by model and is usually specified either as width and height in pixels or the diagonal measured in [[inch]]es.

Some mobiles have more than one display, for example the [[Kyocera Echo]], an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]] with a dual 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch screen. The screens can also be combined into a single 4.7&amp;nbsp;inch [[tablet computer|tablet style computer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/225179/the_kyocera_echo_the_phone_that_wants_to_be_your_tablet.html Kyocera Echo Phone Review | PCWorld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central processing unit===
Mobile phones have [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments.

Mobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [[hertz]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://www.cpu-world.com/Glossary/C/CPU_Frequency.html
 | accessdate =1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the [[memory hierarchy]] also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.

In February 2010, there were 4.6 billion mobile phone subscribers, a number that is estimated to grow.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews&quot; /&gt;

Prior to 2010, [[Nokia]] was the market leader.  However, during that year competition emerged in the Asia Pacific region with brands such as Micromax, [[Nexian]], and i-Mobile and chipped away at Nokia's market share.  Android powered smartphones also gained momentum across the region at the expense of Nokia.  In [[India]], their market share also dropped significantly to around 31 percent from 56 percent in the same period.  Their share was displaced by Chinese and Indian vendors of low-end mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20101229/tc_pcworld/nokia8217smarketsharedropsfurtherinindia {{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 worldwide sales were 1.6 billion units, an increase of 31.8 percent from 2009.  The top five manufacturers by market share were Nokia followed by Samsung, LG Electronics, ZTE and Apple. The last three replaced RIM, Sony Ericsson and Motorola who were previously among the top five list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/mobile-technology/rim-knocked-out-of-top-five-global-mobile-phone-sellers/article1886134/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=RIM knocked out of top five global mobile phone sellers | date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nokia Market Share Slides â Gartner http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110209-705792.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Outside the top five a significant market share increase from 16.5 percent to 30.6 percent was achieved by many smaller and new brands. 

In Q1 2011, Apple surpassed Nokia as the world's biggest handset vendor by revenue, as Nokia's market share dropped to 29 percent in Q1 2011, the lowest level since the late 1990s. In June 2011, Nokia announced lower expectations for sales and margin due to global competition in both low-and-high end markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110706/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_nokia Nokia continues declining] Retrieved 2011-07-07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of mobile phones==
===In general===
Mobile phones are used for a variety of purposes, including keeping in touch with family members, conducting business, and having access to a telephone in the event of an emergency. Some people carry more than one cell phone for different purposes, such as for business and personal use. Multiple SIM cards may also be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plansâa particular plan might provide cheaper local calls, long-distance calls, international calls, or roaming. The mobile phone has also been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society, for example:
* A study by [[Motorola]] found that one in ten cell phone subscribers have a second phone that often is kept secret from other family members. These phones may be used to engage in activities including extramarital affairs or clandestine business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1602044.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Millions keep secret mobile |publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2001 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some organizations assist victims of domestic violence by providing mobile phones for use in emergencies. They are often refurbished phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By RICHARD BROOKSThe Press-Enterprise |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/sbcounty/stories/PE_News_Local_S_helpphones13.3d74734.html |title=Donated cell phones help battered women &amp;#124; San Bernardino County &amp;#124; PE.com &amp;#124; Southern California News &amp;#124; News for Inland Southern California |publisher=PE.com |date=13 August 2007 |accessdate=4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The advent of widespread text messaging has resulted in the [[cell phone novel]]; the first literary genre to emerge from the cellular age via [[text messaging]] to a website that collects the novels as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodyear |first=Dana |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/12/22/081222fa_fact_goodyear |title=Letter from Japan: I â¥ Novels |publisher=The New Yorker |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mobile telephony]] also facilitates activism and public journalism being explored by [[Reuters]] and [[Yahoo!]]&lt;!--What does this sentence mean?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/you-witness-news |title=You Witness News |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and small independent news companies such as [[Jasmine News]] in Sri Lanka.
[[File:Bangalore India Cellphone Cellphone Repair Kiosk.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A cellphone repair kiosk in Mumbai]]
* The [[United Nations]] reported that mobile phones have spread faster than any other technology and can improve the livelihood of the poorest people in developing countries by providing access to information in places where [[landline]]s or the Internet are not available, especially in the [[least developed countries]]. Use of mobile phones also spawns a wealth of micro-enterprises, by providing work, such as selling airtime on the streets and repairing or refurbishing handsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/assets/print?aid=USTRE69D4XA20101014 | work=Reuters | first=Jonathan | last=Lynn | title=Mobile phones help lift poor out of poverty: U.N. study}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Mali and other African countries, people travel from village to village to let friends and relatives know about weddings, births and other events, which is avoided if the villages are within mobile phone coverage areas. In many African countries, mobile phone coverage is greater than land line penetration, so most people own a mobile phone. In the smaller villages without electricity, phones are recharged using a [[solar panel]] or motorcycle battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observers.france24.com/content/20101115-no-electricity-charge-cell-phone-just-use-motorcycle-mali No electricity to charge your mobile phone? Just use your motorcycle! | The Observers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The TV industry has recently started using mobile phones to drive live TV viewing through mobile apps, advertising, [[social tv]], and [[mobile TV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/01/31/4-ways-smartphones-save-tv/ 4 Ways Smartphones Can Save Live TV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 86% of Americans use their mobile phone while watching TV.
* [[Branchless banking]] has been successful in Kenya, South Africa and Philippines. A pilot project in [[Bali]] was launched in 2011 by the [[International Finance Corporation]] and an [[Indonesian]] bank [[Bank Mandiri]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/01/branchless-banking-start-bali.html Branchless banking to start in Bali | The Jakarta Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In parts of the world, mobile phone sharing is common. It is prevalent in urban India, as families and groups of friends often share one or more mobiles among their members. There are obvious economic benefits, but often familial customs and traditional gender roles play a part.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, Jonathan, and Steenson, Molly Wright. &quot;Beyond the Personal and Private: Modes of Mobile Phone Sharing in Urban India.&quot; In ''The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices'', edited by Scott Campbell and Rich Ling, 231â250. Piscatawy, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Burkina Faso, it is not uncommon for a village to have access to only one mobile phone. The phone is typically owned by a person who is not natively from the village, such as a teacher or missionary, but it is expected that other members of the village are allowed to use the cell phone to make necessary calls.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Hans and Kibora, Ludovic. &quot;The Domestication of the Mobile Phone: Oral Society and New ICT in Burkina Faso&quot;. Journal of Modern African Studes 46 (2008): 87â109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===For distributing content===
In 1998, one of the first examples of selling media content through the mobile phone was the sale of [[ringtone]]s by Radiolinja in Finland. Soon afterwards, other media content appeared such as news, video games, jokes, horoscopes, TV content and advertising. Most early content for mobile tended to be copies of legacy media, such as the banner advertisement or the TV news highlight video clip. Recently, unique content for mobile has been emerging, from the ringing tones and [[ringback tones]] in music to &quot;mobisodes,&quot; video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones.

In 2006, the total value of mobile-phone-paid media content exceeded Internet-paid media content and was worth 31 billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;source Informa 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The value of music on phones was worth 9.3 billion dollars in 2007 and gaming was worth over 5 billion dollars in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netsize.com/Ressources_Guide.htm |title=Downloads_Guide |publisher=Netsize |date= |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of media on the mobile phone has also produced the opportunity to identify and track [[Social marketing intelligence#Alpha users|alpha users]] or hubs, the most influential members of any social community. AMF Ventures measured in 2007 the relative accuracy of three mass media, and found that audience measures on mobile were nine times more accurate than on the Internet and 90 times more accurate than on TV.{{Or|date=August 2009}}

===Whilst driving===
{{Main|Mobile phones and driving safety}}
[[Image:Hand held phone in car.JPG|thumb|right|Texting in stop-and-go traffic in New York City]]Mobile phone use while driving is common but controversial. Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accident. Because of this, many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving. Egypt, Israel, Japan, Portugal and Singapore ban both handheld and hands-free use of a mobile phone; others âincluding the UK, France, and many U.S. statesâban handheld phone use only, allowing hands-free use.

Due to the increasing complexity of mobile phones, they are often more like mobile computers in their available uses. This has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials in distinguishing one usage from another as drivers use their devices. This is more apparent in those countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage, rather those who have banned handheld use only, as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver. This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally on a phone call when, in fact, they were using the device for a legal purpose such as the phone's incorporated controls for car stereo or [[satnav]].

A recently published study has reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety.&lt;ref&gt;de Waard, D., Schepers, P., Ormel, W. and Brookhuis, K., 2010, ''Mobile phone use while cycling: Incidence and effects on behaviour and safety'', ''Ergonomics'', Vol 53, No. 1, January 2010, pp 30â42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schools===
Some schools limit or restrict the use of mobile phones. Schools set restrictions on the use of mobile phones because of the use of cell phones for cheating on tests, harassment and bullying, causing threats to the schools security, distractions to the students, and facilitating gossip and other social activity in school. Many mobile phones are banned in school locker room facilities, public restrooms and swimming pools due to the built-in cameras that most phones now feature.

===Tracking and privacy===
{{seealso|Mobile phone tracking}}

Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. While the phone is turned on, the geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known [[multilateration]] to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several [[cell towers]] near the owner of the phone.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-phone-locate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by mobile phone|date=August 3, 2005|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews-phone-locate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,509211,00.html|title=Cell Phone Tracking Can Locate Terrorists&amp;nbsp;â But Only Where It's Legal|last=Miller|first=Joshua|date=March 14, 2009|work=FOX News|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movements of a mobile phone user can be tracked by their service provider and, if desired, by law enforcement agencies and their government. Both the [[SIM card]] and the handset can be tracked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4738219.stm| title=Tracking a suspect by mobile phone| publisher=BBC News| date=August 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

China has proposed using this technology to track commuting patterns of Beijing city residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2011/03/china_said_it_may_begin.html| author=Cecilia Kang| title=China plans to track cellphone users, sparking human rights concerns| publisher=The Washington Post| date=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the UK and US, law enforcement and intelligence services use mobiles to perform surveillance.  They possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely in order to listen to conversations that take place near to the person who holds the phone.&lt;ref name=&quot;roving-bugs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/FBI-taps-cell-phone-mic-as-eavesdropping-tool/2100-1029_3-6140191.html|title=FBI taps cell phone mic as eavesdropping tool|last=McCullagh|first=Declan |coauthors=Anne Broache|date=December 1, 2006|work=CNet News|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uk-mobile-bug&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/7166b8a2-02cb-11da-84e5-00000e2511c8.html|title=Use of mobile helped police keep tabs on suspect |last=Odell|first=Mark|date=August 1, 2005|work=Financial Times|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
{{Main|Mobile phone radiation and health}}
{{See|Mobile phones on aircraft}}
The effect mobile phone radiation has on human health is the subject of recent interest and study, as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world. Mobile phones use [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[microwave]] range, which some believe may be harmful to human health. A large body of research exists, both [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] and experimental, in [[animal model|non-human animals]] and in humans, of which the majority shows no definite causative relationship between exposure to mobile phones and harmful biological effects in humans. This is often paraphrased simply as the balance of evidence showing no harm to humans from mobile phones, although a significant number of individual studies do suggest such a relationship, or are inconclusive. Other [[Wireless electronic devices and health|digital wireless systems]], such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.

On 31 May 2011, the [[World Health Organization]] confirmed that mobile phone use may represent a long-term health risk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IARC CLASSIFIES RADIOFREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS AS POSSIBLY CARCINOGENIC TO HUMANS|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf|work=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World Health Organization&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/features/qa/30/en|title= What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?|accessdate=19 January 2008|date= 5 December 2005|work= Online Q&amp;A|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;, classifying mobile phone radiation as a &quot;carcinogenic hazard&quot; and &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; after a team of scientists reviewed peer-review studies on cell phone safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnwhocarcinogenic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/05/31/who.cell.phones/index.html|title= WHO: Cell phone use can increase possible cancer risk|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of past cell phone use cited in the report showed a &quot;40% increased risk for [[gliomas]] (brain cancer) in the highest category of heavy users (reported average: 30 minutes per day over a 10âyear period).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cell-phones-cause-cancer-2011-5 |title=World Health Organization: Cell Phones May Cause Cancer|accessdate=31 May 2011|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reversal from their prior position that cancer was unlikely to be caused by cellular phones or their base stations and that reviews had found no convincing evidence for other health effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Health Organization&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile telephones and their base stations|accessdate=19 January 2008|year= 2000|month= June|work= Fact sheet NÂ°193|publisher= [[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain countries, including France, have warned against the use of cell phones especially by minors due to health risk uncertainties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL0223157720080102|title=France warns against excessive mobile phone use|accessdate=10 May 2010|date=2 January 2008|publisher=Reuters|author=Brian Rohan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least some recent studies have found an association between cell phone use and certain kinds of brain and salivary gland tumors. Lennart Hardell and other authors of a 2009 meta-analysis of 11 studies from peer-reviewed journals concluded that cell phone usage for at least ten years âapproximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumor on the same ('ipsilateral') side of the head as that preferred for cell phone use.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khurana|first=VG|coauthors=Teo C, Kundi M, Hardell L, Carlberg M|title=Cell phones and brain tumors: A review including the long term epidemiologic data|journal=Surgical Neurology|volume=72|issue=3|pages=205â214|doi=10.1016/j.surneu.2009.01.019|pmid=19328536|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a mobile phone can spread [[infectious disease]]s by its frequent contact with hands. One study came to the result that [[pathogenic bacteria]] are present on approximately 40% of mobile phones belonging to patients in a hospital, and on approximately 20% of mobile phones belonging to hospital staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.ajic.2010.10.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future evolution: Broadband Fourth generation (4G)==
{{Main|4G|5G}}
The recently released 4th generation, also known as ''Beyond 3G'', aims to provide [[broadband wireless access]] with nominal data rates of 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s to fast moving devices, and 1 Gbit/s to stationary devices defined by the [[ITU-R]]&lt;ref name=&quot;4Groadmap&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first = Kim|last = Young Kyun|coauthors = Prasad, Ramjee|title = 4G Roadmap and Emerging Communication Technologies|publisher = Artech House 2006|pages = 12â13|isbn=1-58053-931-9|year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4G systems may be based on the [[3GPP]] LTE ([[Long Term Evolution]]) cellular standard, offering peak bit rates of 326.4 Mbit/s. It may perhaps also be based on [[WiMax]] or [[Flash-OFDM]] wireless metropolitan area network technologies that promise [[broadband wireless access]] with speeds that reaches 233 Mbit/s for mobile users. The radio interface in these systems is based on all-IP [[packet switching]], [[MIMO]] diversity, [[multi-carrier modulation]] schemes, [[Dynamic Channel Assignment]] (DCA) and [[channel-dependent scheduling]]. A 4G system should be a complete replacement for current network infrastructure and is expected to be able to provide a comprehensive and secure IP solution where voice, data, and streamed multimedia can be given to users on a &quot;Anytime, Anywhere&quot; basis, and at much higher data rates than previous generations. 

In March 2011, [[KT (telecommunication company)|KT]] from South Korea announced that they has expanded its high-speed wireless broadband network by [[4G]] [[WiBro]] cover 85 percent of the population. It is the largest broadband network covered in the world, followed by Japan and US with 70 percent and 36 percent respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. Korea expands high-speed wireless coverage|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110302/tc_afp/skoreatelecomktsmartphones}} {{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In early 2011, 4G mobile phones were released by [[Motorola]], [[HTC]] and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmandroid.com/2011-ces-smartphones/214/ 2011 CES Smartphones Include Motorola Atrix, HTC Thunderbolt, and Samsung Infuse 4G | GSM Android&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
{{Expand section|date=December 2011}}
{{seealso|Mobile phone recycling}}

According to [[Inform, Inc.]], a Swiss assessment has found that 40-50% of the environmental impact of a mobile phone occurs during the manufacturing of the electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secret-life.org/cell_environment.php|title=The Secret Life Series - Environmental Impacts of Cell Phones|publisher=Inform, Inc.|accessdate=3 December 2011|
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average user replaces their mobile phone every 11 to 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/engineering-information-technology/e-waste-research-group/facts-figures|title=E-waste research group, Facts and figures|publisher=Griffith University|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth911.com/recycling/electronics/e-waste-harmful-materials/|title=E-waste: Harmful Materials|publisher=Earth911.com|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discarded phones then contribute to [[electronic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arp.net.au/envcha.php|title=Mobile Phone Waste and The Environment|publisher=Aussie Recycling Program|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mobile phone manufacturers within Europe are subject to the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|WEEE directive]] and some countries{{which|date=December 2011}} have introduced [[mobile phone recycling|recycling schemes]].{{cn|date=December 2011}}
