== Ethnicity ==
Diamont began using his mother's maiden name when he began acting and modeling after an agent suggested that it was more &quot;rhythmical&quot;, but in fact because it was less obviously Jewish sounding.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/page_view_story.asp?intarticleid=16906&amp;intcategoryid=5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 15, 2006 edition of [[Soap Opera Digest]], Diamont discusses his Jewish background and discloses that he did not fully embrace his Jewish heritage until later in life. Coincidentally, his storyline on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (head written by [[Lynn Marie Latham]] &amp; [[Scott Hamner]]) has paralleled his personal life in some ways. The show has revealed that the persona of &quot;Brad Carlton&quot; is actually &quot;George Kaplan&quot;. (For the sake of the dramatic, the show has explained this by disclosing that George/Brad had to hide his past, and his Jewishness, for his own safety.)
