'''1062 ABC Riverland''' is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station based in [[Renmark, South Australia]], broadcasting to the [[Riverland]] and [[Murray Mallee|Mallee]] region.

The station began broadcasting as '''5MV''' in [[1957]].  It originally broadcast on 1593&amp;nbsp;kHz.  It moved to 1305&amp;nbsp;kHz in [[1988]], before changing to 1062 in [[1996]].

In the early years it carried a mix of programming including local news and specific rural information aimed at âthe fruit blockers and those on the landâ. Fully fledged morning current affairs programming was introduced in [[1989]]. Later the same year ''The Voice of Greece'' with Jim Grifsas became the first non-[[English language|English]]-speaking program on the station.

1062 ABC Riverland was the first regional station in Australia to have digital studios installed.
