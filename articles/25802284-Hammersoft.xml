The '''humanitarian response to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]''' included national governments, charitable and for-profit organizations from around the world which began coordinating [[humanitarian aid]] designed to help the Haitian people. Some countries arranged to send relief and rescue workers and humanitarian supplies directly to the earthquake damage zones, while others sought to organize national fund raising to provide monetary support for the nonprofit groups working directly in Haiti. [[OCHA]] and [[ReliefWeb]] are coordinating and tracking this on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jan/14/haiti-quake-aid-pledges-country-donations ], [[The Guardian]], 14 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;   As of March 21, 2010, [[Reliefweb]] have reported a total relief funding of $2.5 billion given and a further $1.3 billion pledged.&lt;ref&gt;Reliefweb: Haiti Earthquakes funding tracker http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fts.nsf/doc105?OpenForm&amp;rc=2&amp;emid=EQ-2010-000009-HTI&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of countries sent large contingents of disaster relief, medical staff, technicians for reconstruction and security personnel. Notably, the governments of the [[United States]], [[Israel]] ,the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Canada]], [[Brazil]], [[Italy]] and [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;Tom Fawthrop. [http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2010/01/201013195514870782.html Cuba's Aid Ignored By The Media?], AlJazeera.net, February 16, 2010. Retrieved July 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; sent over 1,000 military and disaster relief personnel each, with the United States being by far the largest single contributor to the relief efforts. The international community also committed numerous major assets such as field hospitals, naval vessels, a hospital ship, aircraft carriers, transport aircraft and emergency facilities soon after the extent of the disaster became apparent.

Progress in responding to the almost unprecedented scale of disaster was hampered by numerous factors, including major loss of life, multiple large aftershocks, devastated civil infrastructures, collapsed buildings blocking streets, the lack of electricity for gasoline station pumps, plus the loss of the capitol's seaport and air traffic control facilities. Additionally, the significant damage to the Haitian government ministries, all of which suffered varying degrees of destruction and personnel deaths, further impeded coordination of the disaster response.

In April 2010, the Haiti government asked that massive food distribution in the Petionville camp cease in order to allow the normal economy to resume.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Commonwealth realms ===
Queen [[Elizabeth II]], monarch of each of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, made a donation to the relief effort and issued a personal message of condolence to the President of Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Press Association| title=Brown urges Haiti quake donations| newspaper=The Guardian| date=14 January 2010| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/feedarticle/8899053| accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Overview.aspx| last=Royal Household| title=Latest News and Diary &gt; The Queen's message to The President of Haiti| publisher=Queen's Printer| accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU ===
In early January 2010 the [[EU]] released â¬3&amp;nbsp;m in emergency funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0113/haiti.html |title=RTÃ News: Charities appeal for Haiti earthquake aid |publisher=Rte.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Council]] and its member nations later announced more than â¬429 million ({{US$|600,000,000}}) in emergency humanitarian aid, rehabilitation aid and medium-to long-term reconstruction aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sapa-AFP |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=91461 |title=EU earmarks over â¬420 million for Haiti |publisher=Businessday.co.za |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid was to be provided as detailed:
;Humanitarian Assistance
The EU pledged â¬122 million in humanitarian assistance:
Emergency relief aid package: â¬30 million (incl. a â¬3 million ECHO fast-track decision). Commission funds were to be distributed via UN agencies, international NGOs and the Red Cross.
â¬92 million from member countries.
;Support for Early Recovery and Reinforcing State Capacity.
The European Commission pledged to provide â¬100 million for short term recovery and rehabilitation.
;Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.
The European Commission pledged to provide â¬200 million from the 10th and 9th EDF funds for Haiti. They would be in addition to bilateral contributions from EU Member States' budgets.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/9&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |Factsheet on Haiti earthquake|source=EU Commission|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union thus pledged at least â¬429 million to Haiti in both emergency and humanitarian aid to help the medium and long term work of rebuilding the country devastated by the earthquake. In addition, the 27 countries decided to send some 150 troops from the European Gendarmerie to ensure that humanitarian aid would reach the people affected by the earthquake.

The financial contribution of the EU as a whole totaled â¬429 million, broken down as:
*â¬92 million coming from contributions made by Member States,
*â¬30 million from the European Commission itself,
*â¬107 million from existing EU funds that were being redirected to Haiti, and another
*â¬200 million shuffled for the medium and long term rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;
