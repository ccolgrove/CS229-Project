}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youngstown is located in a region of the United States that is often referred to as the [[Rust Belt]]. Traditionally known as a center of steel production, Youngstown was forced to redefine itself when the U.S. steel industry fell into decline in the 1970s, leaving communities throughout the region without major industry.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno (1999), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]] showed that Youngstown had a total population of 66,982,&lt;ref name=&quot;American FactFinder2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|title=American FactFinder2|accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it Ohio's ninth largest city. 

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the Youngstown-[[Warren, Ohio|Warren]]-[[Boardman, Ohio|Boardman]] [[Youngstown-Warren-Boardman, OH-PA Metropolitan Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) contains 565,773 people and includes Mahoning and [[Trumbull County, Ohio|Trumbull]] counties in Ohio, and [[Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Mercer County]] in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;American FactFinder2&quot;/&gt; The [[Steel Valley (Ohio-Pennsylvania)|Steel Valley]] area as a whole has 763,207 residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;combined&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro_general/2007/CSA-EST2007-alldata.csv|title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Combined Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2007 |accessdate=2007-07-10 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:Image David Tod, Abbots History of Ohio.jpg|left|thumb|Governor David Tod]]

Youngstown was named for New York native [[John Young (pioneer)|John Young]], who surveyed the area in 1796 and settled there soon after.&lt;ref name=&quot;vind-yo-10-15-24&quot;&gt;
{{cite news
  | title = Knowing Youngstown: John Young's Land Purchase
  | work = The Youngstown Daily Vindicator
  | page = 7
  | date = October 15, 1924
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 1797, Young purchased the township of 15,560&amp;nbsp;acres (63&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) from the [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve Land Company]] for $16,085.&lt;ref&gt;Aley (1975), pp. 28â29.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1797 establishment of Youngstown was officially recorded on August 19, 1802.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 15â16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area constituting present-day Youngstown was part of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], a section of the [[Northwest Territory]] reserved for settlers from the state of [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue13&quot;&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the area's early settlers came from Connecticut, Youngstown attracted a significant number of [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] settlers from neighboring [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 16â17.&lt;/ref&gt; The first European Americans to settle permanently in the area were Pittsburgh native James Hillman and wife Catherine Dougherty.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1798, Youngstown was the home of several families who were concentrated near the point where Mill Creek meets the Mahoning River.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue13&quot;/&gt;

As the Western Reserve's population grew, the need for administrative districts became apparent. In 1800, territorial governor [[Arthur St. Clair]] established Trumbull County (named in honor of Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]]), and designated the smaller settlement of Warren as its administrative center, or &quot;[[county seat]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 17â18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, Trumbull County was divided into townships, with Youngstown Township comprising much of what became Mahoning County.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Youngstown was incorporated in 1848, and in 1867 Youngstown was chartered as a city. It became the county seat in 1876, when the administrative center of Mahoning County was moved from neighboring [[Canfield, Ohio|Canfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Aley (1975), pp. 98â99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of coal by the community in the early 19th century paved the way for the Youngstown area's inclusion on the network of the famed [[Erie Canal]]. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 33â35.&lt;/ref&gt; Local industrialist [[David Tod]], who was later Ohio governor during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], persuaded [[Lake Erie]] steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The arrival of the railroad in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 35â36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Youngstown's industrial development changed the face of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from [[Wales]], Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]], Italy, and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Syria]]. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of [[Ku Klux Klan]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] Americans in neighboring [[Niles, Ohio|Niles]] led Ohio Governor [[A. Victor Donahey]] to declare martial law.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (1990), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, however, the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field.&lt;ref&gt;Aley (1975), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the metropolitan area's ethnic diversity is reflected in businesses such as a [[Jew]]ish [[delicatessen]], Italian eateries, and [[Middle East]]ern restaurants. Urban neighborhoods are dotted with [[church (building)|churches]], [[synagogue]]s, and [[mosque]]s.

The growth of industry attracted people from within the borders of the United States, and from [[Latin America]]. By the late 19th Century, [[African Americans]] were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] was established in 1871.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aley46&quot;&gt;Aley (1975), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, local attorney [[William R. Stewart]] was the second African American elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Aley (1975), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national [[Steel Strike of 1919]], local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the [[Southern United States|South]], many of whom were Black.&lt;ref&gt;Brody (1960), pp. 254â255.&lt;/ref&gt; This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno (1999), pp. 155â156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linkon and Russo (2002), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative [[sharecropping]] system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Lemann (1991), pp. 3â58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's population became more diverse since the end of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers.&lt;ref&gt;Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 41â42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the [[Hispanics in the United States|Latino]] population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, [[St. Rose of Lima]] [[Roman Catholic]] Church and the First Spanish [[Baptist]] Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aley46&quot;/&gt; While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s. In response to subsequent challenges, the city has taken well-publicized steps to diversify economically, while building on some traditional strengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasser&quot;&gt;{{cite news

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 34.2&amp;nbsp;square miles (88.7&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²); 33.9&amp;nbsp;square miles (87.8&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) is land and 0.3&amp;nbsp;square mile (0.9&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) is water. The total area is 1.02%&amp;nbsp;water.

Youngstown is in the [[Mahoning Valley]] on the [[Glaciated Allegheny Plateau]]. At the end of the last [[Ice Age]], the [[glacier]]s left behind a uniform plain with valleys caused by the [[Mahoning River]] crossing the plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aley89&quot;&gt;Aley (1975), pp. 8â9.&lt;/ref&gt; Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aley89&quot;/&gt;

According to the 2000 Census numbers, Youngstown has 32,177 households and 19,724 families in the city. The population density is 893/kmÂ² (2,312.9/sq&amp;nbsp;mi). There are 37,159 housing units at an average density of 1,096.3 per square mile (423.2/kmÂ²).&lt;ref name=&quot;areaconnect&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://youngstown.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm | title = Youngstown, Ohio, Statistics and Demographics (U.S. Census 2000) | publisher = AreaConnect | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial makeup of the city is roughly 43% White, 45% Black or African American, and 9% [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or Latino of any race, though [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]] are the dominant Latino group.&lt;ref name=&quot;areaconnect&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/39/3988000.html Youngstown Ohio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Records suggest that 27.2% of the households have children under the age of 18. Of these, 33.2% are married couples living together, 22.9% have a female householder with no husband present, and 38.7% are non-families. Meanwhile, 34.0% of all households comprise a single person, and 14.7% of households comprise a person over 65 years of age living alone. The average household size is 2.39 and the average family size is 3.07.&lt;ref name=&quot;areaconnect&quot;/&gt;

In Youngstown, the population leans toward greater numbers of youths, as is often the case in U.S. inner-city areas with higher [[birth rates]]. Survey data show the following: 25.8% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 17.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 36 years. For every 100 females, there are 91.9 males; for every 100 females aged 18 and over, there are 87.8 males.&lt;ref name=&quot;areaconnect&quot;/&gt;

The median household income is $24,201, and the median family income $30,701; but the average per capita income for the city is $13,293. Males have a median income of $29,900 and females $21,050. About 24.8% of the population lives below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 37.3% of those under the age of 18 and 13.3% of those 65 and older are living below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;areaconnect&quot;/&gt;

The [[United States Census Bureau]]'s 2006 Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement Current Population Survey estimates a median household income of $21,850. Analysis by CNNMoney states that Youngstown has the lowest median income of U.S. cities with more than 65,000 residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnmoney&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Christie, Les |url = http://money.cnn.com/2007/08/28/real_estate/wealthiest_states/index.htm |title = The richest (and poorest) places in the U.S. |publisher = CNN |date=August 31, 2007 |accessdate = 2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[Image:sheet&amp;tube.jpg|left|thumb|Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube and Viaduct]]
Endowed with large deposits of coal and iron as well as &quot;old growth&quot; hardwood forests needed to produce charcoal, the Youngstown area eventually developed a thriving steel industry. The area's first blast furnace was established to the east of town in 1803 by James and Daniel Heaton.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, the availability of fossil fuels contributed to the development of other coal-fired mills, including the Youngstown Rolling Mill Company, which was established in 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, Youngstown was the site of several iron industrial plants, notably David Tod's [[Brier Hill]] Iron &amp; Coal Company.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The iron industry continued to expand in the 1890s, despite the depletion of local natural resources. Numerous rail connections ensured a consistent supply of coal and iron ore from neighboring states.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 66â67.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, local industrialists began to convert to steel manufacturing, amid a wave of industrial consolidations that placed much of the Mahoning Valley's industry in the hands of national corporations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue94&quot;&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the establishment of [[U.S. Steel]] in 1901, the corporate entity absorbed Youngstown's premier steel producer, the National Steel Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue94&quot;/&gt; One year earlier, however, a group of city investors took steps to ensure high levels of local ownership in the area's industrial sector. Led by local industrialists [[George D. Wick]] and [[James A. Campbell]], they organized what became the [[Youngstown Sheet and Tube|Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue94&quot;/&gt; among the nation's most important regional steel producers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fuechtmann16&quot;/&gt; The firm significantly expanded its operations in 1923, when it acquired plants in [[South Chicago]] and [[East Chicago, Indiana]]. This impulse to support local ownership surfaced again in 1931, when Campbell, as chairman of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, attempted to merge the firm with [[Bethlehem Steel]], in a bid to create the nation's second-largest steel corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;vind-yo-09-21-33b&quot;&gt;

In the late 1930s, the community's steel sector gained national attention once again, when Youngstown became a site of the so-called &quot;Little Steel Strike&quot;, an effort by the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]], a precursor to [[United Steelworkers]], to secure contract agreements with smaller steel companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;shellock&quot;&gt;{{cite news

=== Decline of steel ===
{{details|Deindustrialization of Youngstown, Ohio}}
Between the 1920s and 1960s, the city was known as an important industrial hub that featured the massive furnaces and foundries of such companies as Republic Steel and U.S. Steel. At the same time, Youngstown never became economically diversified, as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Akron, or Cleveland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuechtmann16&quot;&gt;Fuechtmann (1989), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s, the city was left with few substantial economic alternatives. The 1969 corporate merger between the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company and the [[New Orleans]]-based Lykes Corporation proved to be a turning point in the demise of the local steel industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuechtmann4143&quot;&gt;Fuechtmann (1989), pp. 41â43.&lt;/ref&gt; The merger and subsequent takeover of Youngstown Sheet and Tube burdened the community's primary steel producer with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuechtmann4143&quot;/&gt; Further, the deal placed control of the company outside of the Mahoning Valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuechtmann4143&quot;/&gt; The September 19, 1977, announcement of the closure of a large portion of [[Youngstown Sheet and Tube]], an event still remembered by many Youngstowners as &quot;Black Monday&quot;, is widely regarded as the death knell of the old area steel industry. This was followed by the withdrawal of U.S. Steel in 1979 and 1980, and the bankruptcy of Republic Steel in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno (1999), pp. 9â10.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to revive the local steel industry proved unsuccessful. Shortly after the closure of most of Youngstown Sheet and Tube's area operations, local religious leaders, steelworkers, and activists such as [[Staughton Lynd]] participated in a grassroots effort to purchase and refurbish one of the company's abandoned plants in neighboring [[Campbell, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuechtmann5&quot;&gt;Fuechtmann (1989), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This project met with failure in April 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fuechtmann5&quot;/&gt; In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns, the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs, 400 satellite businesses, $414 million in personal income, and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno (1999), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector.&lt;ref&gt;Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 131â132.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-steel economy ===
Youngstown is the site of several steel and metalworking operations, though nothing on the scale seen during the &quot;glory days&quot; of the &quot;Steel Valley&quot;. The largest employer in the city is [[Youngstown State University]] (YSU), an urban public campus that serves about 15,000 students, located just north of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.regionalchamber.com/local-largestempl.htm | title = Youngstown-Warren area largest employers | publisher = Youngstown-Warren Regional Chamber of Commerce | accessdate = 2007-02-18}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blow dealt to the community's industrial economy in the 1970s, was slightly mitigated by the presence of auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the [[Studebaker Avanti|Avanti]], an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by [[Studebaker]] to compete with the [[Corvette]], was manufactured in an industrial complex located on Youngstown's Albert Street. However, this company didn't last long in Youngstown, moving after just a few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Avanti&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Washington |first=Frank |year=1989 |month=April 3 |title=Buffing Up an Old ClassicâAvanti Drives Again |journal=Newsweek |volume=CXIII |pages=46 |accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mainstay, though, of Youngstown's industrial economy has long been the GM Lordstown plant.The  [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]' [[Lordstown Assembly]] plant is the largest industrial employer in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;/&gt;  One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and [[Cavalier]]. Recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility, it is the current home of the Cavalier's successor, the 2011 [[Chevrolet Cruze]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GM&quot;&gt;Lyne, Jack (2002).

The largest industrial employers within the Youngstown city limits are V&amp;M Star Steel Company (formerly North Star Steel), in the Brier Hill district, and Exal Corporation, located on Poland Avenue. The latter has recently expanded its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== New growth ===
[[Image:Youngstown003.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Youngstown at night]]
Youngstown's downtown, which once underscored the community's economic difficulties, is a site of new business growth. The [[business incubator|Youngstown Business Incubator]], located in the heart of the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies, which have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. One such companyâTurning Technologiesâhas been rated by ''Inc. Magazine'' as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/inc5000/2007/lists/top100-industry-software.html|title=Top Inc. 5000 Companies by Industry 2007 -- Software|publisher=Inc. Magazine|accessdate=2008-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the incubator secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling&quot;/&gt;

=== Businesses started in Youngstown area ===
Extensive coverage of Youngstown's economic challenges has overshadowed the city's long entrepreneurial tradition. A number of products and enterprises introduced in Youngstown later became national household names. Among these is Youngstown-based [[Schwebel's Bakery]], which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.schwebels.com/about.asp | title = It all began in 1906, in a small kitchen in Campbell, Ohio... | publisher = Schwebel's Baking Company | accessdate = 2007-02-17

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the popular franchise of [[Handel's Homemade Ice Cream &amp; Yogurt]] was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, the suburb of Boardman became the site of one of the country's first modern shopping plazas, which was established by Youngstown-born developer [[Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fast-food]] chain, [[Arby's]], opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and [[Arthur Treacher's Fish &amp; Chips]] was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city's downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store [[Phar-Mor]], which was established by Youngstown native [[Michael I. Monus|Mickey Monus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;

=== Post-steel image in popular culture ===
A large segment of the American public associates Youngstown with the economic malaise that befell much of the industrial northeast after the collapse of its manufacturing sector. The decline of Youngstown's steel industry and its adverse effects on local workers were the subjects of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ballad, &quot;[[Youngstown (song)|Youngstown]]&quot;, featured on his ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 1â2.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lyric, Springsteen addresses &quot;my sweet Jenny,&quot; a reference to the Jeanette Blast Furnace, owned by [[Youngstown Sheet and Tube|Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company]], which sat along the [[Mahoning River]] in the Brier Hill area of the city and was dynamited in 1977. Springsteen made Youngstown the first stop on his solo [[Ghost of Tom Joad Tour]], playing to a sold-out audience at [[Stambaugh Auditorium]] on January 12, 1996.

Another pop culture reference to Youngstown came via the HBO television show [[The Sopranos]] in 2002. In the show's fourth season premiere episode, entitled &quot;[[For All Debts Public and Private]]&quot;, the character [[Paulie Gualtieri]] is imprisoned in Youngstown for possessing a weapon that was used in an unsolved Youngstown murder. This episode's use of Youngstown as a setting seems to reference the city's association with crime and mob-related violence.

===Rebirth of Steel===
In 2010, [[Vallourec and Mannesman Tubes]] broke ground for a $620 million-dollar pipe mill north of it's existing business V&amp;M Star. The facility is 1 million square feet in area and will produce tube goods to service natural gas exploration in the [[Marcellus Formation]], which is the largest gas field discovered in the past decade, estimated to provide enough natural gas to supply the [[United States]] for 100 years. Production is expected to begin in 2012.

== Government ==
Youngstown is governed by a [[List of mayors of Youngstown, Ohio|mayor]] who is elected every four years and limited to a maximum of two terms. Mayors are traditionally inaugurated on or around the second of January. The city has tended to elect [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] mayors since the late 1920s because of the local unions' support for Democratic candidates for office.&lt;ref&gt;Blue ''et al.'' (1995), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Youngstown's current mayor is Charles Sammarone, who replaced [[Jay Williams (politician)|Jay Williams]], the city's first African-American mayor and its first [[Independent (politician)|independent]] mayor since 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;skolnick&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Residents elect an eight-member city council, which includes representatives of the city's seven wards and a council president. The council, in turn, appoints a city clerk. The council traditionally meets every first and third Wednesday of the month. City council meetings are generally held from the third week in September to the third week in June. Meanwhile, the board of control oversees contracts for public projects within the municipal limits. The Youngstown Police Department and [[Youngstown Fire Department]] fall under the board's supervision, as do the parks, civil service, community development, health, planning, and water departments.

Youngstown's finance department oversees all municipal finances and supervises the departments of economic development and income tax. The city's department of public works has sweeping supervisory responsibilities and oversees the departments of engineering, building inspection, building and grounds, signal and sign, demolition and housing, litter and recycling, street, and water waste treatment. The city's law department represents the city on all legal issues, serving as counsel to all municipal departments.

== Education ==
=== Public ===
The [[Youngstown City School District]] manages all public education within the city. As of 2007, the school district was engaged in a process of reconfiguration, consolidating existing schools while building some new ones. District high schools once included South, North, [[Chaney High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Chaney]], [[Rayen High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Rayen]], East, [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Woodrow Wilson]], Youngstown Early College, and Choffin Career and Technical Center. This roster has changed, however. Chaney expanded, while Rayen and Wilson were closed to make way for a newly built [[East High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|East High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-yo-03-14-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news

(The two high schools share a heated and longstanding rivalry in athletics.) Several additional Catholic schools operate in Mahoning, Trumbull, Columbiana, Portage, Stark, and Ashtabula counties.

There is also Akiva Academy on Gypsy Lane in Youngstown.

Youngstown hosts a small number of charter schools and one [[Montessori]] school. The Montessori School of the Mahoning Valley, which recently celebrated its 35th year, offers alternative learning environments for students ranging from preschool to eighth grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montessori-youngstown.com/about.htm About our school.] The Montessori School of the Mahoning Valley.

== Attractions ==
=== Covelli Centre ===
{{Main|Covelli Centre}}
Despite the impact of regional economic decline, Youngstown offers an array of cultural and recreational resources. Moreover, the community's range of attractions has increased in recent years. The newest addition is the Covelli Centre, a venue for Tier I Jr. A hockey games, concerts, &quot;on ice&quot; shows, and other forms of entertainment.

=== Theater ===
The community's culture center is [[Powers Auditorium]], a former [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] movie palace&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-03-19-30&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Ford Recital Hall was built in 2006 as an addition to newly renovated Powers Auditorium. Imposing and [[Neo-classical architecture|neo-classical]] [[Stambaugh Auditorium]], located on the city's north side, has served for decades as a site of concerts and is often rented for private events. The facility also hosts the Stambaugh Youth Concert Band.&lt;ref name=&quot;stam&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stambaughonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=32| title=Stambaugh Auditorium Homepage|publisher=Stambaugh Auditorium |accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oakland Center for the Arts]], located in the downtown area, is a venue for locally produced plays. This institution is complemented by the [[Youngstown Playhouse]], which is located on the city's south side. The Youngstown Playhouse, Mahoning County's primary community theater, has served the area for more than 80 years, despite intermittent financial problems. Well known theatrical personalities from the Youngstown area include comedic actor [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-yo-07-20-74&quot;&gt;{{cite news

=== Museums ===
The [[Butler Institute of American Art]] is located on the northeastern edge of the Youngstown State University campus. This institution was established by industrialist [[Joseph G. Butler, Jr.]], in 1919 as the first museum in the country dedicated to American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
   | url = http://www.butlerart.com/ | title = About the Butler | publisher = Butler Institute of American Art | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the street from the Butler Institute stands the [[McDonough Museum of Art]], YSU's University Art Museum and the Mahoning Valley's center for contemporary art. The McDonough, established in 1991, features regular changing exhibitions by regional, national and international artists and provides public access to the work of students, faculty and alumni from the Department of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://mcdonoughmuseum.ysu.edu/htmlpgs/information.html |title = McDonough Museum of Art |publisher = Youngstown State University |accessdate = 28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clarence R.

[[Image:Youngstown 021.jpg|thumb|left|The Butler Institute of American Art]]
To the immediate north of YSU is the Arms Family Museum of Local History. The museum, housed in a 1905 [[American Craftsman|Arts &amp; Crafts style]] mansion on the main artery of Wick Avenue, is managed by the Mahoning Valley Historical Society. Once the estate of a local industrialist, the museum maintains period rooms that showcase the original contents of the household, including furnishings, art objects, and personal artifacts. The museum mounts rotating exhibits on topics related to local history. Recently, the museum opened the &quot;Anne Kilcawley Christman Hands-on History Room&quot;. The MVHS Archival Library operates in the estate's former carriage house, located near the back of the site.

Located just south of the YSU campus is the [[Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor]], which sits on a grade overlooking the downtown area. This museum, owned and operated by the [[Ohio Historical Society]], focuses on the Mahoning Valley's history of steel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the city's north side the Youngstown Steel Heritage Foundation is constructing the Tod Engine Heritage Park, featuring a collection of steel industry equipment and artifacts.  The main exhibit is a 1914 William Tod Co. rolling mill steam engine that was built in Youngstown and used at the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Brier Hill Works.  The Tod Engine is one of three remaining rolling mill engines in the United States and is a Mechanical and Materials Engineering Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Parks ===
Youngstown's most popular resource is [[Mill Creek Park]], a five-mile (8&amp;nbsp;km)-long stretch of landscaped woodland reminiscent of [[Rock Creek Park]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Mill Creek Park is the oldest park district in Ohio, established as a township park in 1891. The park's highlights include the restored 19th&amp;nbsp;century Lanterman's Mill, the rock formations of Bear's Den, scores of nature trails, the [[Fellows Riverside Gardens]] and Education Center, the &quot;Cinderella&quot; iron link bridge, and two 18 hole Donald Ross golf courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;mvhs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:cinderellabridge.jpg|right|thumb|Mill Creek Park's &quot;Cinderella&quot; iron link bridge]] Mill Creek Park encompasses approximately {{convert|2600|acre|km2}}, {{convert|20|mi|km}} of drives and {{convert|15|mi|km}} of foot trails. Its attractions include gardens, streams, lakes, woodlands, meadows, and wildlife.

Fellows Riverside Gardens' popular lookout point offers visitors contrasting views of the area. From the south side, the canopied woodlands overlooking Lake Glacier are visible; from the north side, visitors are presented with a view of downtown Youngstown. The park features two 18-hole golf courses. The North Course is situated on rolling terrain, while the South Course features narrow, tree-lined fairways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.millcreekmetroparks.com/golf.htm | title = Championship Golf | publisher = Mill Creek Metro Parks| accessdate = 2007-11-02

In 2005, Mill Creek Park was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vind-yo-06-14-2006&quot;&gt;

A smaller recreational area called [[Wick Park]] is located on the historic north side.  Wick Park's periphery is lined with early 20th-century mansions built by the city's industrialists, business leaders, and professionals during Youngstown's &quot;boom&quot; years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pellegrini&quot;/&gt;  Stambaugh Auditorium, a popular venue for concerts and other public events, is located near the park's southwestern edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;stam&quot;/&gt;  Several cemeteries (notably historic Oak Hill Cemetery) and small recreational spaces are scattered throughout the city.

Youngstown has enjoyed a long tradition of professional and semi-professional sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.centerforworkingclassstudies.org/uploads/Documents/Baseball.html | title = Company Sports Teams and the Early Industrialization of Youngstown, Ohio | publisher = Youngstown State University | accessdate = 2007-03-08}} {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier decades, the city produced scores of minor league baseball teams, including the [[Youngstown Ohio Works]], [[Youngstown Champs]], [[Youngstown Indians]], [[Youngstown Steelmen]], [[Youngstown Browns]], [[Youngstown Gremlins]], and Youngstown Athletics. Local enthusiasm for baseball was such that the community hosted championship games of the National Amateur Baseball Federation throughout the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ward&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Youngstown Hardhats]], which competed in the Middle Atlantic Football League in the 1970s and early 1980s. For three seasons, Youngstown was home to the [[Mahoning Valley Thunder]] of the now-defunct [[af2]], the minor league for the [[Arena Football League (1987â2008)|Arena Football League]] until 2009 when the franchise ceased operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;vind-yo-03-31-2007&quot;&gt;

Youngstown's Covelli Centre was the home of the [[Youngstown SteelHounds]] hockey team (when it was the '''Chevrolet Centre'''), which played in the [[Central Hockey League]] until May 2008.

In early 2007, the &quot;Championship Wrestling Experience&quot; began holding events in the area that featured stars like &quot;Jake the Snake&quot; Roberts and Jerry Lynn. These wrestlers have appeared at the &quot;Salute to Wrestling&quot; event held in July for the [[Mahoning Valley Scrappers]].

The community has a lengthy tradition of collegiate sports. The Youngstown State University Penguins, a major regional draw, compete in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]]. The Penguins, noted participants in FCS (I-AA) football, play their games at [[Stambaugh Stadium]] and enjoy one of the more supportive fan bases. All other YSU athletic teams compete in the [[Horizon League]]. The Youngstown State men and women's basketball teams hold their games at Youngstown State's [[Beeghly Center]]. The teams average about 2,500 fans per game, a number which has been on the rise the past two seasons with a new style of play under Head Coach Jerry Slocum. In addition, the YSU baseball and softball teams have enjoyed local support and success. The baseball team reached the NCAA super-regionals in 2005, and the softball team did so in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;ysusports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ysu.edu/sports|title = YSU Sports Homepage |publisher = Youngstown State University |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Youngstown has produced a significant number of [[boxing]] champions, including bantamweight [[Greg Richardson (boxer)|Greg Richardson]], lightweights [[Ray Mancini|Ray &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Mancini]], [[Harry Arroyo]], and middleweight [[Kelly Pavlik]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-12-05-99&quot;&gt;

=== Building on tradition ===
One of the city's most recent sports-related attractions is the [[Covelli Centre]] (formerly the Chevrolet Center and during planning the Youngstown Convocation Center), which was funded primarily through a $26 million federal grant. Located on the site of an abandoned steel mill, the large, high-tech facility opened in October 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;skolnick3&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's main tenants are the [[Youngstown Phantoms]], which play in the [[United States Hockey League]],  and the Mahoning Valley Thunder, an af2 arena football team which began play in 2007.  Previously, it was home to the Youngstown Steelhounds hockey team, who played in the [[Central Hockey League|CHL]]. The city plans to develop vacant land adjacent to the Centre. Plans included using the space for a park, riverwalk (the Mahoning River flows through the site), amphitheater, or athletic stadium for the city's public and private high schools.

Such investments reflect wide appreciation of Youngstown's athletic tradition, which has produced noted figures in a variety of sports. Prominent athletes with connections to the city include former world boxing champions Greg Richardson, [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[lightweight]] champion Harry Arroyo,&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-12-05-99&quot;/&gt; [[College Football Hall of Fame]] [[End (football)|end]] [[Bob Dove]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-09-21-75&quot;&gt;

=== Former attractions ===
Several of the city's recreational resources disappeared amid the economic hardships that began in the late 1970s.  Among these was ''[[Idora Park, Youngstown|Idora Park]],'' an amusement park that served as a convenient alternative for residents who preferred not to travel to larger parks in Northern Ohio and Western Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Knepper (1989), p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; (These included ''[[Conneaut Lake Park]]'' in [[Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania]], ''[[Geauga Lake]]'' in [[Aurora, Ohio]], ''[[Cedar Point]]'' in [[Sandusky, Ohio]], and ''[[Kennywood]]'' in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].) The park, which closed in 1984, held sentimental value for many local residents and enjoyed a degree of historical significance. Former Youngstown resident [[Jack Warner]] noted in his autobiography that the [[Warner Bros.|Warner brothers]] took their first step into the movie business when they screened a used copy of ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' at ''Idora Park'' and other local venues.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1964), pp. 49â54.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early 20th century to the mid-1970s, Youngstown was the retail center of the Mahoning Valley. There were two flagship department stores in the downtown area, including [[Strouss|Strouss Hirshberg's]] (later absorbed by [[Kaufmann's]], now part of [[Macy's]]) and  [[McKelvey's]] (later [[Higbee's]], now part of [[Dillard's]]). Specialty shops lined the main artery of West Federal Street, and the district had four upscale [[movie theater]]s, including the Palace Theater, the Warner Brothers' first Theater, the State Theater, and the Paramount Theater. These businesses were the first to close as a result of declining attendance in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

In the early 1970s, the appearance of two suburban malls (the [[Southern Park Mall]], in Boardman, and the [[Eastwood Mall (Niles)|Eastwood Mall]], in Niles) hastened the closure or relocation of many businesses that remained. The collapse of the community's steel industry at the end of the decade created additional challenges for downtown business owners; and throughout the 1980s and 1990s, efforts to revive the former retail hub were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Linkon and Russo (2002), pp. 42â46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redevelopment ==
[[Image:Youngstown1 003.jpg|thumb|left|The George Voinovich Center (left) and Mahoning County Children's Services Center (right)]]
Youngstown's cityscape includes relatively few contemporary buildings, and from certain angles, the downtown area appears to have changed little since the 1960s. Yet, downtown Youngstown has seen modest levels of new construction. Recent additions include the [[George Voinovich]] Government Center and state and federal courthouses: the Seventh District Court of Appeals and the [[Nathaniel R. Jones]] Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse. The latter features an award-winning design by the architectural firm, [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert A. M. Stern Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Battisti and Nathaniel R. Jones Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse | publisher = U.S. General Services Administration | accessdate = 2007-02-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Federal Street, a major downtown thoroughfare that was closed off to create a pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The downtown area has seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-yo-09-21-06&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and business development ===
[[Image:Youngstown1 002.jpg|thumb|right|The re-opened Federal Street]]
In 2004, construction began on a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and a grant from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation (CIC) have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by out-of-town investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. Further, a nonprofit organization called Wick Neighbors is planning a $250 million [[New Urbanist]] revitalization of Smoky Hollow, a former ethnic neighborhood that borders the downtown and university campus. The neighborhood will eventually comprise about 400 residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a central park.&lt;ref name=&quot;skolnick2&quot;&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2007-02-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction for the project began in 2006.

New construction has dovetailed with efforts to cultivate business growth. One of the area's more successful business ventures in recent years has been the Youngstown Business Incubator. This nonprofit organization, based in a former downtown department store building, fosters the growth of fledgling technology-based companies. The incubator, which boasts more than a dozen business tenants, has recently completed construction on the Taft Technology Center, where some of its largest tenants will locate their offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;shilling&quot;/&gt;

=== Crime control ===
Meanwhile, the city has attempted to come to terms with its troubling reputation for crime and corruption. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Youngstown was nationally identified with gangland slayings that were often committed with car bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;heltzel&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city, however, has accelerated measures to limit the influence of organized crime upon all sectors of municipal life. For some observers, the climax of this ongoing effort was the arrest, trial, and 2002 conviction of former U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[James A. Traficant Jr.|James A. Traficant, Jr.]] (D), on bribery, tax fraud, and racketeering charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;clines2&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the municipal government has responded to a rise in gang- and drug-related violence by increasing the presence of police in urban neighborhoods. In the course of enforcing traffic laws and issuing warrants, police and state troopers have apprehended serious criminal offenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;vindy-yo-02-16-07&quot;&gt;{{cite news

=== Renewal plan ===
In line with these efforts to change the community's image, the city government, in partnership with the university, has organized an ambitious urban renewal plan titled Youngstown 2010. The stated goals of Youngstown 2010 include the creation of a &quot;cleaner, greener, and better planned and organized Youngstown&quot;. In January 2005, the organization unveiled its &quot;master plan&quot;, which took shape in the course of several public meetings that featured input from citizens. The plan, which received national attention, is consistent with efforts in other metropolitan areas to address the phenomenon of urban depopulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasser&quot;/&gt; Given that the communities to the south and west of the city continue to enjoy a measure of economic prosperity, supporters of such projects hold out hope for the revitalization of Youngstown.

== Transportation ==
The Youngstown area is served by the Western Reserve Transit Authority (WRTA) bus system, which is supported through Mahoning County property and sales taxes. WRTA, whose main terminal is located in the downtown area, provides service throughout the city and into surrounding Mahoning and Trumbull counties. The downtown terminal serves as the Youngstown area's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] terminal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrtaonline.com/ WRTA Youngstown.] Western Reserve Transit Authority. Retrieved on 2007-03-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the vicinity of the WRTA terminal is a former [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] station. The historic terminal building, which has been converted into a banquet hall, served as a train station from 1995 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banquetatthebno.com/index2.html Rental information.] The B &amp; O Station Banquet Hall. Retrieved on 2007-03-07 {{Wayback|url=http://www.banquetatthebno.com/index2.html|date =20070702170744|bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local railroads now serve freight trains exclusively.

The only airport within the city limits is the [[Lansdowne Airport]], located on the city's east side. This facility is used for general aviation. The metropolitan area's main airport is the [[Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport]] (YNG), located in nearby [[Vienna, Ohio]]. The only commercial route available at this airport is a flight to [[Orlando, Florida]] through [[Allegiant Air]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yngwrnair.com/index.html Homepage.] Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport Homepage (2006). Retrieved on 2007-03-07&lt;/ref&gt; Most valley residents take advantage of larger airports such as [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]], [[Akron-Canton Regional Airport]], and [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].

== Media ==
Youngstown features diverse media, including television, print and radio. Newspapers include ''The Buckeye Review'' (bi-monthly/ African-American), ''The Business Journal'' (bi-monthly/business), ''The Catholic Exponent'' (bi-monthly/religious), ''Daily Legal News'' (daily/legal), ''The Jambar'' (bi-weekly/college), ''The Jewish Journal'' (monthly/Jewish), ''The Metro Monthly'' (monthly/news, features, calendar), ''The Morning Journal'' (daily/[[Columbiana County]] news), ''The Review'' (weekly/news, features), ''Senior News'' (monthly/seniors), ''The Journal'' (weekly/Struthers, Campbell and Lowellville), ''Parent Magazine'' (monthly/children's), ''Peace Action Youngstown'' (quarterly/peace activism), ''The Town Crier'' (weekly/suburban news), ''Record Courier'' (daily/Portage County news), ''Akron Beacon Journal'' (daily/regional news), ''The Plain Dealer'' (daily/regional news), ''Pittsburgh Post Gazette'' (daily/regional news), ''Warren [[Tribune Chronicle]]'' (daily/regional news), and the  ''[[The Vindicator]]'' (daily/regional news).

Youngstown is served by 10 television stations, three of which are repeaters of TV stations in other cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;radiostationworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://radiostationworld.com/locations/United_States_of_America/Ohio/tv_information.asp?m=you | title = Ohio TV Information | publisher = Radio Station World | accessdate = 2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fourth coming in the near future from Pittsburgh NBC affiliate [[WPXI]] in nearby [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]] that would easily penetrate Youngstown pending [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] approval.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/tvq?list=0&amp;facid=73910&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual for a mid-sized city located near large metro areas such as Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Nearby Akron, with a larger population than Youngstown and Warren combined, has no local television stations and relies on Cleveland for its local news. The community's 273,480 television households make the Youngstown market the nation's 106th largest, according to Nielsen Media Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsenmedia.com/nc/portal/site/Public/menuitem.55dc65b4a7d5adff3f65936147a062a0/?vgnextoid=bc0e47f8b5264010VgnVCM100000880a260aRCRD|publisher=[[Nielsen Media Research]] | title = Sampling the Population | date=2006-09-23 | accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks including: [[WFMJ-TV]] (channel 21, [[NBC]]), [[WYTV]] (channel 33, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WYFX-LP]] (channel 17/62 &amp; 27.2 on WKBN-DT2, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), [[WKBN-TV]] (channel 27, [[CBS]]), [[WYTV-DT2|MY-YTV]] (channel 33.2, [[My Network TV|MNTV]]), and [[WFMJ-DT2|WBCB]] (channel 21.2, [[The CW Television Network|The CW]]). WFMJ-TV and its [[digital subchannel]] WBCB are both locally owned &amp; operated by the [[Maag family]], owners of ''The Vindicator''. The rest of Youngstown's commercial television stations are either owned &amp; operated by [[New Vision Television]] or operated by NVT through a [[shared services]] agreement, which is essentially a [[local marketing agreement]] under different legal terms. [[Western Reserve Public Media]], which airs on channel 45 (WNEO) from [[Alliance, Ohio]] and channel 49 (WEAO) from Akron, is a member of [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].

Youngstown is served by 37 different [[radio station]]s in the metropolitan area which makes it the 119th largest radio market in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;arbitron&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.arbitron.com/radio_stations/mm001050.asp | title = Arbitron Radio Market Rankings: Spring 2008 | publisher = arbitron.com | accessdate = 2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations include 17 on the [[AM broadcasting|AM band]] and 20 on the [[FM broadcasting|FM band]]. The majority of the most powerful and popular radio stations in the Youngstown-Warren market are divided between two conglomerates: [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]] and [[Cumulus Media]].
