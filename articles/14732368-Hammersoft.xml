==Notable moments==
===September 17, 1960===
In the two clubs' very first meeting, the New York Titans hosted the Boston Patriots at New York's [[Polo Grounds]]. [[Al Dorow]] of the Titans erupted to three touchdown throws and led the Titans to a 24-7 lead in the third quarter. But [[Butch Songin]] and 109 rushing yards by Patriots runners clawed Boston back to trail 24-21 in the fourth quarter, then [[Chuck Shonta]] finished off the Titans when punter [[Rick Sapienza]] fumbled the snap. The ball bounced around wildly until [[Chuck Shonta]] picked up the ball at the 25 and ran in for a touchdown. The Titans complained that linebacker [[Jack Rudolph (American football)|Jack Rudolph]] had kicked the ball, which was illegal, during the chase for the ball but the play stood. 
===October 2, 1966===
The then-Boston Patriots tied the Jets 24-24 at [[Fenway Park]], for the only dead-heat in the rivalry's history. The Patriots led 24-7 after three quarters but two [[Joe Namath]] touchdowns and a [[Jim Turner (placekicker)|Jim Turner]] field goal tied the game. It would also be the last time the Patriots did not lose to the Jets until October 1971. &lt;ref name=&quot;pro-football-reference.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/junk/boxscores/Boston-Patriots-1966.htm Boston Patriots 1966 Season box scores]&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 17, 1966===
The Jets knocked the Patriots out of the playoffs in [[Shea Stadium]] as three [[Joe Namath]] touchdown throws (including a 77-yard strike to [[George Sauer, Jr.]]) led the Jets to a 38-28 win, despite [[Vito Parilli]] throwing for 379 yards. &lt;ref name=&quot;pro-football-reference.com&quot;/&gt;

===1974 season===
It was a tale of two season halves. On October 13 at [[Shea Stadium]] the Patriots shut out the now-1-4 Jets 24-0 as [[Sam Cunningham]] rushed in two touchdowns and [[Bob Geddes]] ran back a [[Joe Namath]] interception for a 23-yard touchdown; the win was New England's fifth straight in 1974 and first over the Jets since October 10, 1971. Five weeks later on November 17 at [[Schaefer Stadium]] the Jets, fresh off a dramatic victory over the [[New York Giants]], rolled to a 21-16 win as Namath threw two touchdowns and [[Jim Plunkett]] was picked off four times. The win put the Jets at 3-7 as they finished the season with a six-game winning streak while the Patriots fell to 7-7.

===October 18, 1976===
The Patriots hosted the Jets on [[Monday Night Football]], which was unofficially renamed &quot;Monday Night Madness&quot; when the rowdiness of drunken fans at [[Schaefer Stadium]] led to mass arrests by local police and the cuffing of fans to a chain-link fence when other space became unavailable. The Jets were stampeded by running backs [[Andy Johnson (American football)|Andy Johnson]], [[Don Calhoun]], and [[Sam Cunningham]] and quarterback [[Steve Grogan]] as they amassed 330 rushing yards and five touchdowns, one of them a fumble recovered by Grogan in the second quarter. Grogan also completed a short touchdown pass to Johnson, culminating in a 41-7 Patriots rout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/junk/boxscores/New-York-Jets-1976.htm New York Jets 1976 Season box scores]&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 21, 1976===
Hosting the Patriots at [[Shea Stadium]], the Jets set an unofficial record for passing inefficiency as the Patriots wiped out a 10-0 first quarter gap and exploded to a 38-24 win. [[Joe Namath]] threw six interceptions; [[Mike Haynes (cornerback)|Mike Haynes]] had three interceptions, [[Tim Fox]] had one, and [[Prentice McCray]] had two of his own and scored with them (a 63-yard score and a 55-yard score), while backup [[Richard Todd (American football)|Richard Todd]] threw a seventh interception (to cornerback [[Bob Howard (American football)|Bob Howard]]) in the fourth quarter; the Jets also coughed up three fumbles. [[Steve Grogan]] passes to [[Andy Johnson (American football)|Andy Johnson]], [[Darryl Stingley]], and [[Pete Brock (American football)|Pete Brock]] and a [[John Smith (American football)|John Smith]] field goal accounted for the remaining Patriots' points.

===October 29, 1978===
In a bizarre harbinger of [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]], the Patriots hosted the Jets and erupted to a 48-7 third quarter lead, ultimately winning 55-21. Jets coach [[Walt Michaels]] felt the Patriots were somehow decifering his coaching staff's signals and suspected a rival team had told these codes to the Patriots. Michaels stewed afterward, &quot;This will never happen to us again. I know what they did, but by the time we figured it out, it was too late.&quot;  Later that season the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] erased a 23-0 gap to beat the Patriots 26-23, and there was speculation the Jets had told Oilers coaches about Patriots codes. &lt;ref&gt;The New England Patriots: Triumph &amp; Tragedy (New York: Atheneum) by Larry Fox, pp. 278-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 9, 1979===
[[Steve Grogan]] set a Patriots record with five touchdown throws in a 56-3 Patriots massacre of the Jets at [[Schaefer Stadium]]; his touchdown record stood until [[Tom Brady]] broke it against the [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] in 2007. Following the game a scuffle ensued in the crowded locker room between cornerback [[Raymond Clayborn]] and ''[[Boston Globe]]'' writer [[Will McDonough]]. [[Harold Jackson]] caught three passes, all for touchdowns. [[Stanley Morgan]] caught two, and [[Andy Johnson]], [[Allan Clark]] and [[Don Westbrook]] also scored a touchdown each.

===December 9, 1979===
During halftime a Jets win at Shea Stadium, a man from [[Nashua, New Hampshire]] was injured and later died after he was struck by a radio-controlled flying lawnmower that stalled in mid-air and crashed into the stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loge13.com/2007/04/death_from_above_shea_1979.php|title=Death From Above: Shea, 1979|work=Loge13.com|date=2007-04-18|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 30, 1984===
New England made its first trip to [[Giants Stadium|The Meadowlands]] at 2-2 to face the 3-1 Jets. Jets cornerback [[Bobby Jackson (cornerback)|Bobby Jackson]] popped his right hamstring during morning stretching and was lost for the year; coach [[Joe Walton]] replaced him with [[Davlin Mullen]], but the Patriots behind 354 passing yards by [[Tony Eason]] rolled to a 28-21 win; following three unanswered Patriots scores in the second half Mullen was benched by Walton for rookie [[Russell Carter]].

===October 28, 1984===
Following a 44-21 rout by the [[Miami Dolphins]], Patriots coach [[Ron Meyer]] fired assistant coach [[Rod Rust]], but he did not have the authority to do so and was fired himself. [[Raymond Berry]], an assistant with [[Chuck Fairbanks]] and [[Ron Erhardt]], was hired, and his first game was against the Jets. The Jets bolted to a 10-0 lead and then led 20-6 at the half, but the Patriots led by running back [[Craig James (American football)|Craig James]] fought back and scored 24 unanswered points by [[Tony Franklin (placekicker)|Tony Franklin]], James, [[Tony Eason]], [[Tony Collins]], and [[Stephen Starring]] for a 30-20 Patriots win. Collins later said Berry earned the respect of the locker room in that one weekend.

===December 28, 1985===
In the first ever playoff meeting between the two clubs, the Patriots traveled to [[Giants Stadium]], surrendered a 7-3 gap in the second quarter, then erupted to 23 points in a 26-14 win, the team's first playoff win since beating the [[Buffalo Bills]] in a 1963 elimination game to decide the AFL's Eastern Division champ for the 1963 AFL Championship game.

===October 12, 1986===
The 4-1 Jets traveled to [[Foxboro Stadium|Sullivan Stadium]] to take on the 3-2 Patriots and the ensuing game saw memorable performances by Jets running back [[Johnny Hector]] and Patriots quarterback [[Steve Grogan]], who was replacing oft-injured starter [[Tony Eason]]. Hector rushed for 143 yards and three touchdowns as the Jets erupted to a 24-0 halftime lead, but Grogan, throwing for 401 yards and three scores, led a furious Patriots comeback, but with the Jets holding a tenuous 31-24 led with one minute remaining, Grogan completed a 31-yard strike to [[Irving Fryar]] across midfield, but when Fryar was hit by Jets defenders he fumbled the ball to the Jets, securing the Jets win.

===1987 season===
Runaway wins were the order of the year. In September on [[Monday Night Football]] the Jets dominated the Patriots 43-24 in [[Giants Stadium]] behind scores by [[Johnny Hector]], [[Al Toon]], and [[Nuu Faaola]]. In the December rematch in [[Sullivan Stadium]] the Patriots flattened the Jets 42-20 behind four [[Steve Grogan]] touchdown throws and a [[Reggie Dupard]] rushing score.

===October 16, 1994===
The Jets hosted the Patriots with both teams 3-3. Future Pats coach [[Pete Carroll]] was in his first year heading the Jets while future Jets coach [[Bill Parcells]] was in his second season heading the Patriots. [[Brad Baxter]] rushed for two touchdowns and [[Boomer Esiason]] threw for an additional score despite being sacked six times. The Patriots lost the turnover battle, coughing up three fumbles and one interception en route to a 24-17 Jets win.

===November 10, 1996===
The Jets entered this contest at [[Giants Stadium]] with just four wins in the 1995-6 period, but raced to a 21-0 second quarter lead after holding [[Drew Bledsoe]] 0-4 in completions in the entire first quarter. From there Bledsoe went 24-30 for 297 yards and overcame two interceptions and two sacks. After a [[Terry Glenn]] score in the second quarter, his second touchdown came to [[Ben Coates]] and tied the game at 24. A Jets field goal made it 27-24 when Bledsoe completed a pass to Coates at the 50-yard line on 4th and 2. The Jets disputed the ball spot by line judge [[Charles Stewart (line judge)|Charles Stewart]] (the ball spot was also roundly criticized by [[ESPN]]) but the first down call stood, and Bledsoe found [[Keith Byars]] for the game-winning score. A late Jets rally was stopped on an endzone interception by [[Lawyer Milloy]] for a 31-27 Patriots win.

===Early 1997: Bill Parcells===
In his fourth season as Patriots head coach, [[Bill Parcells]]' contract was set to expire after the Patriots' appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXI]]. In the time preceding the game, rumors surfaced that Parcells would seek a coaching job elsewhere with more say in personnel decisions than he had under Patriots owner [[Robert Kraft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat1&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_30/ai_66760539 Take That!(p. 1)] Football Digest. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1996 NFL Draft]], Parcells had wanted to select a defender with the Patriots' seventh overall pick, but Kraft and personnel director [[Bobby Grier (American football coach)|Bobby Grier]] wanted [[wide receiver]] [[Terry Glenn]] instead,&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat1&quot;/&gt; who was drafted.

After the Super Bowl, Parcells resigned from the Patriots, prompting Kraft to believe the Jets had been tampering with Parcells in an attempt for him to resign and take the Jets' vacant head coaching position and have say in the Jets' first overall selection in the [[1997 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat1&quot;/&gt; The Jets decided that since Parcells couldn't be their head coach in 1997 because of his contract renegotiation, they would hire Parcells as a consultant and have [[Bill Belichick]], who followed Parcells from the Patriots, hold the title of head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat1&quot;/&gt; Kraft, who was requesting a first-round pick in return for allowing Parcells to coach elsewhere, called the Jets' agreement &quot;a transparent farce&quot; that &quot;demonstrated it was the Jets' intention all along for Bill Parcells to become head coach of the Jets for the '97 season.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat1&quot;/&gt; Despite Parcells claiming the Jets had been given league permission for the consulting agreement, the NFL denied any permission was given, instead having commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] arrange an agreement between the two sides. The Patriots received third and fourth-round picks in the [[1997 NFL Draft]], a second-round pick in the [[1998 NFL Draft]], and a first-round pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]] in compensation for allowing Parcells to become the Jets' head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat2&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_30/ai_66760539/pg_2 Take That!(p. 2)] Football Digest. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Parcells leaving for the Jets, the Patriots hired 49ers defensive coordinator [[Pete Carroll]], who had been Jets head coach in 1994.

===1997 season===
For the first time in over ten years the Patriots and Jets were locked in a serious fight for the [[AFC East]] division title. Both teams opened 1997 on August 31 with games against [[AFC West]] opponents (the Patriots hosted the [[San Diego Chargers]] while the Jets played the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[Kingdome]]). Both teams opened with routs - the Patriots won their game 41-7 while the Jets triumphed in theirs 41-3. The two teams [[1997 New England Patriots season|met]] in [[Foxboro Stadium]] on September 14 on [[NFL on TNT|TNT's Sunday Night Football program]] (this match-up became one of only two to be featured 3 times on TNT, alongside [[Arizona Cardinals]]-[[Dallas Cowboys]]). The game lead tied or changed seven times as both quarterbacks put up strong numbers but also costly errors - [[Neil O'Donnell]] was sacked seven times and fumbled three times, while on the Patriots side [[Drew Bledsoe]] threw two INTs, one returned by [[Mo Lewis]] for a touchdown. With the game tied at 24 Jets kicker [[John Hall (American football)|John Hall]] lined up for an easy field goal in the final sixteen seconds of regulation, but the kick was blocked. [[Adam Vinatieri]]'s 34-yard kick then won the game for the Patriots 27-24 in overtime.

The Jets won three of their next four (over [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]], [[Cincinnati Bengals|Cincinnati]], and [[Indianapolis Colts|Indianapolis]]) after the loss, and in the rematch in [[Giants Stadium]] on October 19 the Patriots blew a 19-10 third quarter lead as [[Adrian Murrell]] and [[Lorenzo Neal]] rushing scores and desperation Bledsoe heaves that fell short sealed a 24-19 Jets win.

From there, however, both teams struggled - the Jets lost three of their next seven games (to [[Miami Dolphins|Miami]], [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]], and the Colts) and in their season finale against the [[Detroit Lions]] surrendered 184 rushing yards to [[Barry Sanders]] in a 13-10 Lions win; Jets quarterbacks [[Ray Lucas]] and [[Glenn Foley]] and fullback [[Leon Johnson (American football)|Leon Johnson]] combined for three picks. The Patriots meanwhile lost four of their final nine games (to [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]], [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Pittsburgh]]) after their loss to the Jets, but knocked them out of the playoffs with late-season wins over the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], [[Indianapolis Colts]], and [[Miami Dolphins]] twice. The Patriots thus finished 10-6 while the Jets finished 9-7.

===Early 1998: Curtis Martin and the &quot;Poison Pill&quot;===
After his third season in New England, [[running back]] [[Curtis Martin]], the 1995 [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]], became a [[restricted free agent]]. The Patriots placed the highest possible tender on Martin, that would ensure a first-round and third-round draft pick compensation if they did not match a contract offer from another team.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat2&quot;/&gt; The Jets offered Martin a 6-year, [[United States dollar|$]]36 million contract, and the Patriots, low on salary cap space, opted to not match the offer and took the draft pick compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat2&quot;/&gt; The Jets offer was the first example under the NFL's current Free Agency system of the &quot;poison pill&quot;. Essentially a different contract for the Patriots than it would be for the Jets. It included a clause that would have allowed Martin could become an unrestricted free agent the following season if the Patriots matched the offer, allowing him to leave New England without the Patriots receiving any compensation. The deal included a $3.3 million roster bonus that would have counted against the Patriots' salary cap.&lt;ref&gt;http://cowboysblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/04/jets-gm-has-history-with-poison-pill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 season===
The Jets, with Martin, former Patriots fullback [[Keith Byars]], and new quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]], lost three of their first five games (to the [[San Francisco 49ers|Forty-Niners]] in overtime, the [[Baltimore Ravens]], and [[St. Louis Rams]]) before defeating the 4-1 Patriots in Week Six. From there the Jets surged to their greatest season ever, winning nine of their final ten games (their only loss in this period was a 24-23 loss to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and rookie [[Peyton Manning]]). The Patriots meanwhile slumped, losing three of their next four games before last-minute comeback wins over Miami and Buffalo and a 23-9 defeat of Pittsburgh. [[Drew Bledsoe]] broke a finger on his throwing hand and after a 32-18 loss to the [[St. Louis Rams]] backup [[Scott Zolak]] took over, leading the Patriots to a last-second 24-21 win over the [[San Francisco 49ers]], but in the season's final game, the Patriots were crushed 31-10 by the Jets.

Both teams made the playoffs. The Patriots were crushed 25-10 by the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in the AFC Wildcard round (their only loss to the Jags in eight meetings) and the Jets handled Jacksonville 34-24 in the AFC Divisional round but gave up 23 unanswered second-half points in a 23-10 defeat to the [[Denver Broncos]] in the AFC Championship.

===1999 season===
The Jets and Patriots opened the 1999 season in [[Giants Stadium]] and the [[1999 New England Patriots season|ensuing game]] became a ferocious affair. [[Vinny Testaverde]] tore his left achilles and was replaced by former Patriots punter [[Tom Tupa]], who threw touchdowns to [[Keyshawn Johnson]] and [[Fred Baxter]]. Trailing 16-10 at halftime the Patriots scored 17 third quarter points, but the Baxter score and a [[Bryan Cox]] touchdown off an interception put the Jets in the lead 28-27. Parcells twice called for two-point conversions and they failed; he then put in emergency quarterback [[Rick Mirer]] in the game's final three minutes, and a Mirer pass was deflected by [[Chris Slade (American football)|Chris Slade]] and recovered by [[Ty Law]], setting up the game-winning [[Adam Vinatieri]] field goal with 30 seconds left.

The Patriots stormed to a 6-2 record, beating the Jets, Indianapolis, the NY Giants, Cleveland, Denver, and Arizona, while the Jets sleepwalked to 2-6, beating only Denver and Arizona. But in the rematch in November the Jets roared to a 24-3 lead and sweated out two fourth quarter Bledsoe touchdowns for the win, and from there both teams went in opposite directions, the Jets slumping to 4-8 and then winning their final four games to finish 8-8, while the Patriots collapsed to 8-8. The season finale for both teams ended in wins, the Patriots defeating the [[Baltimore Ravens]] while the Jets, in Parcells' final game as coach, defeated the same [[Seattle Seahawks]] against which he'd inaugurated his tenure as Jets coach.

===Early 2000: Bill Belichick===
A day after the [[1999 New York Jets season|1999]] season, Parcells resigned as head coach of the Jets and made his second retirement from NFL coaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat2&quot;/&gt; Belichick, who had been assistant head coach of the Jets, became the Jets' next head coach. The following day, at a press conference for his hiring, Belichick wrote a resignation note on a napkin (&quot;I resign as HC of the NYJ.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2007/12/buzz:-bobby%2526%2523039%3Bs-world-isn%2526%2523039%3Bt-all-bad The Buzz: Bobby's world isn't all bad] The Virginian-Pilot. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;), and proceeded to instead announce his resignation in front of the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat2&quot;/&gt; Despite rumors that he had been offered the Patriots' vacant head coaching position, Belichick cited the Jets' uncertain ownership situation following the death of owner [[Leon Hess]] earlier that year as the reason for his resignation.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat3&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCL/is_4_30/ai_66760539/pg_3 Take That!(p. 3)] Football Digest. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets denied Belichick permission to speak with other teams, and as had happened in 1997 with Parcells, the NFL upheld Belichick's contractual obligations to the Jets. Belichick then filed an [[Competition law|antitrust]] lawsuit against the NFL in federal court.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat3&quot;/&gt; After Parcells and Kraft, talking for the first time since Parcells' resignation from the Patriots, agreed to settle their differences, the Patriots and Jets agreed to a compensation package to allow Belichick to become the Patriots' head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat3&quot;/&gt; With the deal, the Patriots sent their first-round pick in the [[2000 NFL Draft]] and fourth and seventh-round picks in the [[2001 NFL Draft]] to the Jets, while also receiving the Jets' fifth-round selection in 2001 and seventh-round pick in the [[2002 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TakeThat3&quot;/&gt;

===2000-05 seasons===
The Jets under new coach [[Al Groh]] swept the Patriots in 2000; in the two teams' September matchup in [[Giants Stadium]] the Jets rallied from a 19-7 gap in the fourth quarter to win 20-19, then in October smothered the Patriots in [[Foxboro Stadium]] 34-17, recording four interceptions off [[Drew Bledsoe]]. The Jets surged to a 9-4 record but then collapsed in losses to Oakland, Detroit, and Baltimore. The Patriots meanwhile never got untracked en route to a 5-11 season.

[[Herm Edwards]] replaced Groh as Jets coach, and in September 2001 [[Drew Bledsoe]] was badly injured by a hit by [[Mo Lewis]] in [[Foxboro Stadium]]; with his chest cavity filling with blood (an injury requiring hospitalization) he was replaced late in the game by backup [[Tom Brady]], but it was not enough to overcome a 10-3 Jets win. From there, however, the Patriots surged forward, and both teams met in late November in [[Giants Stadium]], the Jets at 7-4 and the Pats at 6-5. The Jets raced to a 13-3 halftime lead, then were shot down by touchdowns by [[Antowain Smith]] and a Brady toss to [[Marc Edwards (American football)|Marc Edwards]] to go with an [[Adam Vinatieri]] field goal and two [[Vinnie Testaverde]] picks. The 17-16 final continued a Patriots streak all the way to a victory in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] while the Jets finished a strong 10-6 only to fall 24-22 to the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the playoffs.

The 2002 season opened with a comeback Jets win in OT in Buffalo, but in Week Two the Patriots mopped the Meadowlands with the Jets 44-7; Jets placekicker [[Matt Turk]] (14 yards on a botched punt attempt) outrushed the entire Jets offensive backfield (nine yards by [[Curtis Martin]], [[LaMont Jordan]], and [[Richie Anderson]] combined) and two Testaverde turnovers (a fumble to [[Tebucky Jones]] and an interception by [[Victor Green]]) led to Patriot touchdowns. A humiliating 30-3 loss in Miami was followed by a 28-3 loss in Jacksonville; during this game Testaverde failed to complete a pass in four tries and was sacked once; he was thus benched and sophomore [[Chad Pennington]] took over under center, finishing with 281 yards and one INT.

From there, however, the Jets came to life. Against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] Pennington completed 22 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns as the game lead tied or changed eight times; the Chiefs won 29-25 on a [[Trent Green]] touchdown (19 yards) to [[Priest Holmes]] with 27 seconds left. The Jets now began winning in an unusually competitive NFL season, beating the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 20-7 as they won six of nine games entering their Week 16 showdown with New England. The Patriots meanwhile fell to 3-4 after an OT win (41-38) over Kansas City was followed by four straight losses (to [[San Diego Chargers|San Diego]], Miami, [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]], and [[Denver Broncos|Denver]];) the Patriots then rallied to 8-6 with routs of Buffalo twice, a huge comeback over [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]], and wins over Minnesota and [[Detroit Lions|Detroit]] when they hosted the Jets at new [[Gillette Stadium]] in December. With both teams coming off losses (the Patriots lost to [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]] on [[Monday Night Football]] while the Jets were beaten in [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]]), the resurgent Jets shot down the Patriots 30-17, and suddenly with both teams 8-7 the final week of the regular season became a dizzying conundrum; the Patriots needed to beat the [[Miami Dolphins]] and have the [[Green Bay Packers]] defeat the Jets to win the [[AFC East]], their only chance of a playoff berth; the Jets needed a Patriots win and to beat the Packers to win the division and thus make the playoffs, while Miami needed to win to make the playoffs. The Patriots rallied from down 24-13 in the final five minutes to force overtime and defeat the Dolphins 27-24; the Jets game against Green Bay started on time with overtime in Foxboro approaching; [[Brett Favre]] had thrown a long incompletion on a neutral-zone infraction by the Jets just as the winning FG in the Patriots game took place; when the game was decided the crowd at [[Giants Stadium]] exploded in cheers. From there the Jets rolled over the Packers 42-17, knocking Miami and New England out of the playoffs and winning the [[AFC East]], only their second division crown since the 1970 merger. The Jets followed up by crushing the [[Indianapolis Colts]] 41-0 in the wildcard round, but then fell to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 30-10.

[[Chad Pennington]] was injured in the Jets' 2003 preseason game against the [[New York Giants|Giants]] and missed half of the year. He returned in the latter half of 2003 but the 2-4 Jets could only salvage a 6-10 record. The Patriots, meanwhile, roared to 14-2, sweeping the Jets (23-16 at Foxboro, 21-16 at The Meadowlands) en route to victory in [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. For the 2004 season Pennington stayed healthy and the Jets roared to a 5-0 start (including a 14-point comeback win over the [[San Francisco 49ers]]) before falling to the Patriots in Foxboro 13-7. The Patriots surged to 12-2 when they met the Jets in the Meadowlands for the season rematch and triumphed 23-7. The Patriots finished 14-2 again and the Jets finished 10-6, securing a wildcard playoff berth; responding to criticism of that fact [[Herm Edwards]] pointedly read the letter from NFL Commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] informing the club of their playoff berth to reporters.

The Jets traveled to [[Qualcomm Stadium]] to meet the resurgent 12-4 [[San Diego Chargers]] in the AFC Wildcard round; the Jets clamped down on [[LaDanian Tomlinson]] and held the Chargers to 17 points; they forced overtime and broke a 17-all tie with a game-winning field goal by [[Doug Brien]]. Now in the AFC Divisional Playoffs, the Jets traveled to [[Heinz Field]] to face the 15-1 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], unbeaten since a Week Two loss to Baltimore and riding the leadership of rookie [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. The Jets once again clamped down on their opponent and despite giving up a fourth quarter touchdown forced two Roethlisberger interceptions, but Doug Brien's field goal tries late in the game failed. Getting the ball in overtime the Steelers drove downfield and ended the game on a [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] field goal, ending the Jets' best chance at a Super Bowl since 1998. The Steelers, however, had been exposed as vulnerable, and a week later in the [[AFC Championship Game]] they were shredded 41-27 by the Patriots, who went on to victory in [[Super Bowl XXXIX]].

Injury once again plagued Pennington and 2005 was another lost year with a 4-12 Jets record and yet another season sweep by the Patriots; in a 16-3 win in Foxboro the Pats' [[Adam Vinatieri]] passed Patriots legend [[Gino Cappelletti]] for first on the team's all-time list for points scored. The Jets responded to the season by releasing [[Herm Edwards]]. Despite the sweep of the Jets, the Patriots fell to 10-6 and were bounced by the hated [[Denver Broncos]] in the playoffs.

===2006-2008: Bill Belichick vs. Eric Mangini===
After graduating from [[Wesleyan University]], [[Eric Mangini]] was hired as a low-level assistant by the [[Cleveland Browns]], who had former Wesleyan football coach [[Kevin Spencer (football coach)|Kevin Spencer]] on their coaching staff. Also a Wesleyan alumnus, Belichick, then head coach of the Browns, met Mangini in the Browns' [[1995 Cleveland Browns season|1995]] training camp and promoted him to a coaching assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Projo&quot;&gt;[http://www.projo.com/patriots/content/sp_fbn_pats16_12-16-07_LV89AGN_v17.20fbbc9.html Head Game: Forget handshake, expect cold shoulder] The Providence Journal. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Belichick was fired after the season, and Mangini followed the Browns in their move to Baltimore in [[1996 NFL season|1996]] for a single season before re-joining Belichick with the Jets in [[1997 New York Jets season|1997]]. When Belichick was hired as head coach of the Patriots in [[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]], Mangini followed Belichick to New England, and was named defensive coordinator by the [[2005 New England Patriots season|2005]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Projo&quot;/&gt; Following the season, the Patriots granted permission for Mangini to interview for the Jets' vacant head coaching position. The Jets hired Mangini and the Patriots locked Mangini out of [[Gillette Stadium]], not allowing him to retrieve his personal items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Projo&quot;/&gt;

===2006 season===
In the second week of the [[2006 NFL season|2006]], Mangini referred to Belichick as &quot;a friend&quot; in press conferences, while Belichick refused to use Mangini's name with the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Projo&quot;/&gt; Earlier in the week, the Patriots had traded hold-out wide receiver [[Deion Branch]] to the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and filed [[Tampering (sport)|tampering]] charges against the Jets for allegedly engaging in contract talks with Branch while he was still a member of the Patriots. The Jets were later cleared of the charges by the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Projo&quot;/&gt; The Patriots went on to defeat the Jets in New York, but in November, the Jets handed the Patriots a loss in New England. The post-game on-field meeting between the two in both games was a topic of discussion, with some claiming their handshakes were intentionally cold and unfriendly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2006/11/13/image_was_hard_to_shake/ Image was hard to shake] The Boston Globe. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the loss the Patriots re-sodded [[Gillette Stadium]]'s deteriorated grass surface with [[Field Turf]]. The Patriots ran away 37-16 in a [[NFL playoffs, 2006-07|playoff]] win over the Jets on the new surface, and following the game Belichick shoved [[Boston Globe]] photographer Jim Davis before reaching Mangini and hugging his former assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16542529/ Belichick apologizes to cameraman for shove] MSNBC.com.

Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 season===
{{see|2007 National Football League videotaping controversy}}
When the Patriots and Jets met again in the first week of the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], the Patriots won in a runaway, 38-14. The game was highlighted by the first touchdown catches by new Patriots wideouts [[Randy Moss]] and [[Wes Welker]], and a 108-yard touchdown on the opening kick of the second half by [[Ellis Hobbs]], setting an NFL record for the longest kickoff return.

After the game, Belichick was accused by the Jets of authorizing his staff to film the Jets' defensive signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations. Two days later, Belichick issued a statement &quot;to apologize to everyone who has been affected;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3015478 Belichick issues apology, says he's spoken with Goodell] ESPN.com. Accessed 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; he also stated that he had spoken with NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] about his &quot;interpretation of the rule.&quot; On September 13, Belichick was personally fined $500,000, and the team was fined $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots were required to forfeit either their first-round draft pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] if they made the [[NFL playoffs, 2007-08|playoffs]] or their second and third-round selections if they did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/09/final_ruling.html|title=Final ruling|newspaper=Boston Globe|accessdate=13 September 2007|date=September 13, 2007|first=Mike|last=Reiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of Jets also illegally videotaping the Patriots in their January 2007 playoff match-up arose following the incident. Jets general manager [[Mike Tannenbaum]] called the accusations &quot;completely false&quot; in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2007/12/12/2007-12-12_spy_for_a_spy_jets_started_video_battle-1.html|title=Spy for a spy: Jets started video battle|first=Rich|last=Cimini|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=2007-12-12|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the week before the teams' December 16, [[2007 New England Patriots season|2007]] game, ''[[Newsday]]'' reported the Jets were found videotaping from the mezzanine level of [[Gillette Stadium]] and asked to leave by Patriots security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view.bg?articleid=1050354|title=Mangini defends Jets taping during playoffs at Gillette|first=John|last=Tomase|work=Boston Herald|date=2007-12-12|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets later claimed they had been granted permission by the Patriots to film in the game, while Belichick denied permission was ever given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/12/15/spygate-just-wont-die-bill-belichick-said-jets-didnt-have-per/|title=Spygate Just Won't Die: Bill Belichick Said Jets Didn't Have Permission to Film|first=Josh|last=Alper|work=[[AOL]] Sports|date=2007-12-15|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season rematch in [[Gillette Stadium]] took place on a windy, rain-soaked day that kept scoring down; the Patriots nonetheless triumphed 20-10, the 14th consecutive win on their quest for a perfect season.

===2008 season===
After finishing 2007 at 4-12 the Jets worked the off-season, and their free-agent acquisitions included offensive guard [[Alan Faneca]] from the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and quarterback [[Brett Favre]] from the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The two clubs met on September 14, 2008 at [[Giants Stadium|The Meadowlands]] but the game's dynamic changed the week before when [[Tom Brady]] was knocked out for the season with a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Backup [[Matt Cassel]] was forced to take over for Brady, and after leading the Patriots to a 17-10 win over the Chiefs Cassel made his first NFL start. Cassel was 16 of 23 for 165 yards with no touchdowns or turnovers; a [[Sammy Morris]] rushing touchdown and four [[Stephen Gostkowski]] field goals led the Patriots to a 19-10 win as Favre went 18 of 26 for 181 yards and a touchdown but threw a costly interception to [[Brandon Meriweather]], setting up Morris' score.

A bitterly-fought rematch occurred on ''[[Run to the Playoffs|Thursday Night Football]]'' on November 13 at [[Gillette Stadium]]. The Jets rushed to a 24-6 lead with five minutes to go in the second quarter and added a touchdown by [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]] in the fourth, but [[Matt Cassel]] exploded into a virtual one-man offense, throwing for 400 yards and three touchdowns with no picks while rushing for 64 yards. He threw touchdowns to [[Jabar Gaffney]] with fifteen seconds left in the first half, to [[Benjamin Watson]] on the final play of the third quarter (and a two-point conversion to Gaffney), and to [[Randy Moss]] with one second left to force overtime. But the Jets drove down field in overtime, escaping a third-and-fifteen deep in their territory before [[Jay Feely]]'s 34-yard game-winning field goal and a 34-31 Jets final. The game was New England's first overtime loss since the 2000 season against the [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]], while the win was the fourth in seven career meetings against the Patriots (his first win in his second meeting as Jets quarterback) by Favre.

The Jets win, though, did not help them in the homestretch of the season, for the Patriots rallied to win five of their last six games (including a 48-28 hammering of [[Miami Dolphins|Miami]] the following weekend) while the Jets lost four of their final six games. Both teams faced a do-or-die scenario on December 28; the Patriots traveled to Buffalo needing a win and a Jets win over [[Miami Dolphins|Miami]] to win the division; the Jets hosted the Dolphins needing a win and outside help to win the division or secure a Wild Card. The Jets-Dolphins game was flexed by the NFL from a 1 PM start to 4:15, so the Patriots' 13-0 shutout of Buffalo meant the Jets had to win and get a [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jaguars]] upset of [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]] simultaneously with their game in order to make the playoffs. The Jets rallied to lead 17-14 in the third quarter, but former Jet [[Chad Pennington]] led the Dolphins to ten unanswered points and a 24-17 final. Miami thus won the [[AFC East]] while New England became the first 11-5 non-playoff team since [[1985 Denver Broncos season|the '85 Broncos]] and the Jets responded by firing coach [[Eric Mangini]].

===2009 season===
The Patriots visited the Jets on September 20, 2009 in New Jersey, the first meeting between the Jets and returning Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] as well as the first matchup between [[Bill Belichick]] and former [[Baltimore Ravens]] coordinator [[Rex Ryan]]. In the week prior to the game, Ryan placed a phone message to all Jets season ticket holders asking them to &quot;make it miserable for (Tom) Brady and company,&quot; following up on his comments during the offseason that he would not &quot;kiss Bill Belichick's [[Super Bowl ring]]s.&quot; He told the Jets fans that &quot;the Patriots had a better head coach and a better quarterback,&quot; but that the game would decide &quot;who has a better team.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=4478976|title='Hey, it's Rex': Jets coach calls fans for help|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=2009-09-16|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Jets safety [[Kerry Rhodes]] said the Jets intended on not just winning, but &quot;embarrassing&quot; the Patriots in the game, while nose tackle [[Kris Jenkins]] called it the Jets' version of the [[Super Bowl]]; the Jets had not defeated the Patriots at home since [[2000 New England Patriots season|2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/extra_points/2009/09/maroney_ready_f.html|title=Maroney ready for a dogfight with Jets|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Julian|last=Benbow|date=2009-09-17|accessdate=2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the Jets defeated the Patriots 16-9 in the 100th overall meeting of the rivalry series.

The Patriots hosted the Jets on November 22 following a stunning last-minute loss [[2009 New England Patriots season|in Indianapolis]] and the Jets were defeated 31-14; [[Mark Sanchez]] threw four interceptions, three of them to [[Leigh Bodden]]. [[Randy Moss]] caught a four-yard touchdown in the face of Jets cornerback [[Darrelle Revis]], who'd been talkative about matching up with Moss; Revis nonetheless held Moss to 34 yards over two games with the interception in the September matchup. [[Wes Welker]], inactive for Week Two, had 15 catches (one short of [[Troy Brown]]'s 2002 record against [[Kansas City Chiefs|Kansas City]]) for 197 yards.

===2010 season===
The Jets hosted the Patriots on September 19 after a lifeless 10-9 loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] the week before. [[Tom Brady]] completed a six-yard touchdown to [[Wes Welker]] and a 34 -yard score caught by [[Randy Moss]] with one hand in the endzone; Moss nemesis [[Darrelle Revis]] was injured on the play and left the game. But the Jets trailed only 14-10 at the half and after two interceptions of Brady [[Mark Sanchez]] threw touchdowns to [[Jerricho Cotchery]] and [[Dustin Keller]] and the Jets led 28-14, a win sealed when former Dolphin [[Jason Taylor]] strip-sacked Brady in Jets territory. 

Two weeks after the game (and a day after the Jets hammered the [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]] 38-14 while the Patriots massacred the [[Miami Dolphins|Dolphins]] 41-14) the Patriots traded Moss to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and traded a draft pick to the [[Seattle Seahawks]] for [[Deion Branch]]. The Jets erupted after the win, winning eight of their next nine games while the Patriots likewise nailed down eight wins in their next nine games. When the two teams met at [[Gillette Stadium]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' on December 6 their 9-2 records gave the game the sense of a playoff game; the Jets, however, never got untracked, as [[Nick Folk]] missed a 53-yard field goal attempt in the first quarter, this following a [[Rex Ryan]] challenge of a ball-spot that was denied. Brady found Branch and [[Brandon Tate]] for touchdowns and [[BenJarvus Green-Ellis]] ran in a one-yard score, leaving the Patriots up 24-3 at the half; from there on the Jets tried vainly to run the ball (five Jets backs combined for 152 rushing yards) while Sanchez was intercepted three times. Brady touchdowns to Welker and [[Aaron Hernandez]] and a second Green-Ellis score finished up a 45-3 rout of the Jets, the biggest for the Patriots against the Jets since 2002's 44-7 win (During the Patriots dynasty several teams have suffered greater losses, including the [[Tennessee Titans]] 59-0 in 2009). Former Jet [[Danny Woodhead]], cut by the Jets despite prominent attention on the ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)|Hard Knocks]]'' television series chronicling the Jets' 2010 preseason, caught four passes for 104 yards against his former team.

The Jets subsequently lost to the [[2011 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] (a game marred when conditioning coach [[Sal Alosi]] tripped Dolphins [[cornerback]] [[Nolan Carroll]] on a return and the Jets were fined by the league) and [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] while winning on a dramatic goalline stand against [[Pittsburgh Steelers|the Steelers]] and routing the Bills again. They thus made the playoffs as an 11-5 wildcard and stunned the [[Indianapolis Colts]] on a last-minute drive ending in a [[Nick Folk]] winning field goal. The win slotted the Jets into a Divisional Round playoff at [[Gillette Stadium|Foxboro]] against the 14-2 Patriots, who'd run the table since an ugly 34-14 loss at [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland]]. It marks the third playoff matchup between the two teams but the first in a game other than the Wildcard round. Before their playoff matchup, the Jets' [[Antonio Cromartie]] called Tom Brady &quot;an asshole&quot;, claiming that he pointed at the Jets' sideline after throwing a touchdown pass during the Patriots' 45-3 win. The Jets won the Divisional Round game 28-21 on January 16th, 2011. After the game, the Patriots' [[Deion Branch]] called the Jets post-game celebrations &quot;classless&quot;.

===2011 Season===

The two teams met on October 9 at [[Gillette Stadium]] with the Patriots 3-1 off a 31-19 victory over the [[2011 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] while the Jets were 2-2 after losses to the Raiders and to the [[2011 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]].  The Patriots clawed to a 10-7 lead at the half but a [[Tom Brady]] throw to [[Aaron Hernandez]] at the end of the half was intercepted by the Jets.  The Patriots later clawed to a 27-14 lead but a [[Mark Sanchez]] touchdown to [[Santonio Holmes]] cut the lead to 27-21.  The Patriots finished the game with a time-consuming drive with multple rushes by [[BenJarvus Green-Ellis]] and a late field goal for a 30-21 win.
On November 13 the Jets hosted the Patriots at [[MetLife Stadium]] and in the second quarter took a 9-6 lead after Brady was flagged for intentional grounding in his own endzone; the Jets drove down field and [[Mark Sanchez]] ran in a two-yard touchdown.  The Patriots roared down the field after this and scored before the end of the half, then in the second half outscored the Jets 24-7; they sacked Sanchez five times and [[Rob Ninkovich]] intercepted Sanchez and ran in a twelve-yard touchdown, finishing off a 37-16 New England win.

==Connections between the two teams==
With Parcells, Carroll, Belichick, and Mangini all acting as coaches on both teams from [[1993 NFL season|1993]] through [[2008 NFL season|2008]], at least 50 players were also with both teams in the same period. Current Patriots [[defensive line]] coach [[Pepper Johnson]] was also a player with the Jets under Parcells. Upon becoming Jets head coach in [[2006 New York Jets season|2006]], Mangini hired former Jets and Patriots players [[Bryan Cox]] and [[Rick Lyle]] to his coaching staff, as well as former Patriot [[Sam Gash]], and retained former Patriots assistant strength and conditioning coach [[Markus Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11464802/ Jets hire former star linebacker Cox] MSNBC.com. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Patriots [[wide receiver]]s coach [[Brian Daboll]] spent seven seasons with the Patriots before leaving to become the Jets' [[quarterback]]s coach in [[2007 New York Jets season|2007]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkjets.com/news/articles/show/1120-new-york-jets-announce-coaching-changes-for-2007-season New York Jets Announce Coaching Changes For 2007 Season] NewYorkJets.com. Accessed 16 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Daboll left with Mangini for the [[Cleveland Browns]], former Patriots quarterback [[Matt Cavanaugh]] was named as Jets quarterbacks coach; ironically, in his playing days with the Patriots Cavanaugh was 0-2 against the Jets.

Connections between the two teams predated the Parcells-Belichick eras. [[Mike Holovak]] coached the then-Boston Patriots 1961-68, going 5-10-1 against the Jets; he joined the Jets front office and in the 1976 season finale (a 42-3 rout by the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) was named interim head coach, replacing [[Lou Holtz]]. Holovak was responsible for drafting players such as linebacker [[Greg Buttle]], defensive lineman [[Joe Klecko]] of later [[New York Sack Exchange]] fame, and quarterback [[Richard Todd (American football)|Richard Todd]] for the Jets, but he quit the organization after the 1977 draft because he'd been passed over for the head coaching job by [[Walt Michaels]]. Ironically, sixteen years later Holovak had to break up a fight between two assistant coaches as [[Houston Oilers]] GM, when the Oilers defeated the Jets in the 1993 season finale. &lt;ref&gt;Eskenazi, Gerald (1998). GANG GREEN: An Irreverent Look Behind The Scenes At Thirty-Eight (Well, Thirty-Seven) Seasons Of New York Jets Football Futility (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), p. 268. ISBN 0-684-84115-0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Hickey]] was an assistant personnel director for the Patriots under [[Chuck Fairbanks]] before joining the Jets and running their drafts in the 1980s; Hickey has been criticized over the years for a number of personnel choices, none more controversial than his 1983 decision not to draft [[Dan Marino]].

[[Dick Steinberg]] was general manager of the Patriots in the 1980s but was released with coach [[Raymond Berry]] after the 1989 season. Steinberg was hired as Jets GM for 1990, but he was blamed for poor draft picks, notably unproductive running back [[Blair Thomas]] and quarterback [[Browning Nagle]], and for missing on drafting quarterback [[Brett Favre]] after he tried to swing a draft-day deal with the [[Phoenix Cardinals]] only to have the Cardinals back out at the last minute.

[[Ron Erhardt]] was a member of [[Chuck Fairbanks]]' staff with the Patriots in the 1970s, and was elevated to head coach 1979-81; his Patriots squads went 3-3 against the Jets, including a 56-3 massacre of the Jets in September 1979. In 1996 he was hired as Jets offensive coordinator before retiring from football after the 1997 season; he was a notable target of the wrath of [[Keyshawn Johnson]] in the rookie receiver's 1997 book &quot;Just Give Me The Damn Ball.&quot;

Connections during the Belichick-Mangini Era include family connections. [[Derrick Gaffney]] was a Jets wide receiver 1978-87; his son [[Jabar Gaffney]] was a Patriots WR from 2006-8. Also, [[Joe Klecko]] was part of the Jets' famous [[New York Sack Exchange]] defensive line, while his son [[Dan Klecko]] was a reserve player on the Patriots' defensive line and also played fullback on goal line pushes in their [[Super Bowl]] dynasty.

The two teams share bitter rivalries with their divisional rivals [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]] and [[Miami Dolphins|Miami]] as well as with [[Oakland Raiders|the Raiders]] and [[Indianapolis Colts|the Colts]] and from time to time have needed or wanted help from each other in key games; in 2001 the Patriots needed a Jets victory over [[Oakland Raiders|the Raiders]] in the season finale to lock up the [[AFC East]] while the Jets needed the win to secure a playoff berth; in 2002 the Jets needed a Patriots win over Miami to make the playoffs; in 2009 it was the Jets who ended the quest of Indianapolis for a perfect season two years after New England went 16-0. The two teams have also shared bitter playoff moments involving referee [[Ben Dreith]]; Dreith officiated New England's controversial 1976 playoff loss to the [[Oakland Raiders]] and also was referee in the Jets' 1986 playoff loss to the Cleveland Browns; he was criticized by Jets players defending teammate [[Mark Gastineau]] following his controversial hit on Browns quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]].

As noted above, games between the two teams have often played out the rivalry between the [[Yankees â Red Sox rivalry|New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]] in Major League Baseball.&lt;ref name=Rivalry/&gt; During games between the two teams, there are derogatory chants made at the Red Sox during games at the Meadowlands and at the Yankees during games in New England.&lt;ref name=Rivalry/&gt;
