'''Auguste Antoine Piccard''' (28 January 1884 &amp;ndash; 24 March 1962) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[physicist]], [[inventor]] and [[explorer]]. 

==Biography==
Piccard and his twin brother [[Jean Piccard|Jean Felix]] were born in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. Showing an intense interest in science as a child, he attended the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich, and became a professor of [[physics]] in [[Brussels]] at the [[UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] in 1922, the same year his son [[Jacques Piccard]] was born. He was a member of the [[Solvay Conference|Solvay Congress]] of 1922, 1924, 1927, 1930 and 1933.

In 1930, an interest in [[ballooning]], and a curiosity about the upper atmosphere led him to design a spherical, pressurized aluminum gondola that would allow ascent to great altitude without requiring a pressure suit.  Supported by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[NFWO|''Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique'']] (FNRS) Piccard constructed his gondola.

On 27 May 1931, Auguste Piccard and [[Paul Kipfer]] took off from [[Augsburg]], [[Germany]], and reached a record altitude of {{convert|15,785|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. During this flight, Piccard was able to gather substantial data on the [[upper atmosphere]], as well as measure [[cosmic ray]]s.  On 18 August 1932, launched from [[DÃ¼bendorf]], Switzerland, Piccard and [[Max Cosyns]] made a second record-breaking ascent to {{convert|16,200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. He ultimately made a total of twenty-seven balloon flights, setting a final record of {{convert|23,000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

In the mid-1930s, Piccard's interests shifted when he realized that a modification of his high altitude balloon cockpit would allow descent into the deep ocean.  By 1937, he had designed a small steel gondola to withstand great external pressure.  Construction began, but was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War II]].  Resuming work in 1945, he completed the bubble-shaped cockpit that maintained normal air pressure for a person inside the capsule even as the water pressure outside increased to over {{convert|46|MPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Above the heavy steel capsule, a large flotation tank was attached and filled with a low density liquid for buoyancy. Liquids are relatively incompressible and can provide buoyancy that does not change as the pressure increases. And so, the huge tank was filled with gasoline, not as a fuel, but as flotation. To make the now floating craft sink, tons of iron were attached to the float with a release mechanism to allow resurfacing.  This craft was named ''[[FNRS-2]]'' and made a number of unmanned dives in 1948 before being given to the [[French Navy]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=brand&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brand, V |title=Submersibles - Manned and Unmanned. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=1977 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6154 |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There, it was redesigned, and in 1954, it took a man safely down {{convert|4,176|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

* Auguste Piccard was the inspiration for [[Professor Cuthbert Calculus]]  in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' by Belgian cartoonist [[HergÃ©]]. Piccard held a teaching appointment in Brussels where HergÃ© spotted his unmistakable figure in the street.
::This connection was confirmed by HergÃ© in an interview with Numa Sadoul.
::''&quot;Calculus is a reduced scale Piccard, as the real chap was very tall. He had an interminable neck that sprouted from a collar that was much too large... I made Calculus a mini-Piccard, otherwise I would have had to enlarge the frames of the cartoon strip.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Horeau , Yves '' The Adventures of Tintin at Sea'' 1999, English translation 2004 for the National Maritime Museum, Published by John Maurray , ISBN 0719561191 .

* [[Will Gregory]]'s opera, ''Piccard in Space'', premiered at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London on 31 March 2011. The libretto, by Hattie Naylor, focuses on Auguste Piccard's first balloon assent with his assistant Paul Kipfer, and on the theories of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Isaac Newton]], who both appear as characters in the drama. The reviews were generally hostile.&lt;ref&gt;See the daily press for 1 April 2011, including [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/54c55c18-5c42-11e0-8f48-00144feab49a.html#axzz1IIFZXsW3 ''The Financial Times'']; [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/gregory-piccard-in-space-queen-elizabeth-hall-2259208.html ''The Independent'']; and [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8422093/Piccard-in-Space-Queen-Elizabeth-Hall-review.html ''The Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt;
