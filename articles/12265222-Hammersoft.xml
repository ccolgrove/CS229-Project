'''WVBE-FM''' is an [[Urban Contemporary]] formatted [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[radio station]] licensed to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], serving Metro Lynchburg.  WVBE-FM is owned and operated by Mel Wheeler, Inc.. and is simulcast in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] on co-owned [[WVBE (AM)|WVBE]] 610 AM.

==History==
WVBE-FM 100.1 began its history in 1948 as WWOD-FM, originally at 940 watts.  It had a sister station on 1390, WWOD, now [[WKPA]].  WWOD-AM was the second station to go on in Lynchburg after WLVA-AM. WWOD-FM was religious until it became WKZZ on May 12, 1979 and carried a country format until the late 1980s, when it becamne a locally programmed CHR format until 1991. 

On November 21, 1991, the station was purchased by Aylett Coleman of Roanoke and began a simulcast with [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] formatted [[WXLK]] &quot;K92&quot; in Roanoke to provide an improved signal in Lynchburg and took the callsign WLYK, which stood for &quot;Lynchburg's K92.&quot;  The following year, WLYK boosted power, going from a Class A to Class C3 station. The stations were later sold a few years after Coleman's death to Mel Wheeler Inc. 

On April 19, 2001, the station became Vibe 100, with an R&amp;B format, changing calls to WVBE-FM on March 13, 2002. The change was necessitated by the addition of the former WSLC-AM as a Roanoke-based simulcast signal for &quot;Vibe 100&quot;, which took the calls [[WVBE (AM)|WVBE]].
