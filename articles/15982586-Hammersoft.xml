It was founded in 1920 and has been much affected by losses resulting from warfare.

== History ==
The origins of the National Library lie in the foundation of the Baghdad Peace Library, the ''Maktabat al-Salam'', sometimes called the General Library, which was established in Baghdad in 1920, with the assistance of [[Gertrude Bell]], then Oriental Secretary to the British High Commissioner.  Initially it was a private, subscription library, supported by donated money and books.  A Catholic priest and school teacher in a monastery in Baghdad, Al-Kermal (1866-1947) became the first librarian of the â''Al Salam''â library.  Bell devoted some of her time and energy to the management committee and to fund-raising for the Library, but it struggled financially and in 1923 discussions about transferring it to the government commenced.  The Library was taken over by or given to the Ministry of Education in 1924 and, in 1929, its collection of 4,283 books was shifted to the ''al-Mamooria'' school where it was renamed as ''al-Maktabatil Aammah'' or the Public Library.  

In the early 1950s, the Baghdad Public Library was situated on Imam al-Adham Street at the north-west corner of the present day Bab al-Muâazzam Square, where the North Gate of the old walled city used to stand.  By that time, it was being referred to informally as the âNational Library.â  Some discussions between the Iraqi authorities and the British Embassy about a possible exchange of land as a site for a National Library, and with the British Council about the design of the building, were terminated by the 1958 Revolution.  Subsequently the new government designated the former Baghdad Public Library as the National Library by a Law (No. 51) passed in 1961.  

Although archival collections had accumulated over the centuries, there appears to have been no organisation responsible for them in recent times until action was taken by the University of Baghdad, following a study carried out by an ''ad hoc'' committee in 1963.  Legislation was passed in 1963 and the National Documents Centre was established by the University in 1964 to collect and conserve official documents.  Responsibility for the Centre remained with the University until 1969, when further legislation established the status, aims and objectives of the renamed National Record Office, which became the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture and Information.  

By the early 1970s, the National Library building was overcrowded, but it was 1977 before it finally moved into a new purpose-built building.  However, the original intentions were frustrated when the government allocated a complete floor to the National Record Office or, as it came to be called, the National Centre for Archives.  The National Library and the National Centre for Archives were formally amalgamated in 1987.  

As [[Saddam Hussein]] came into power in 1979, the INLA began to weaken. One of the causes came from Hussein directing the countryâs money towards the [[Iran-Iraq War]] (1980-1989).  âPolitical appointees and Baâath loyalists directed the INLA under Saddam Hussein, and a budget freeze in 1980 ended all new material acquisitions for the remaining years of Saddamâs regimeâ.&lt;ref&gt;Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, &quot;Rebuilding Iraq's Once-Prized Library,&quot; National Public Radio, Weekend Edition, Sunday, January 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the next two decades, many of the notable institutions of Iraq, including INLA, continued to falter, especially in the wake of the [[Iraq War|2003 Iraq war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, Julie Biando 2008, p327-342&quot;&gt;Edwards, Julie Biando, and Edwards, Stephan P.

== Iraq War ==
âIn April of 2003, the National Library and Archives (Dar al-Kutub wa al-WathaâIq), which was located directly across from the Ministry of Defense, had been burned and lootedâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Tikriti, Nabil 2007&quot;&gt;Al-Tikriti, Nabil. &quot;Stuff Happens: a brief overview of the 2003 destruction of Iraqi manuscript collections, archives, and libraries&quot;, in: ''Library Trends'', v. 55 no. 3 (Winter 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The burning and looting appeared to have taken place on two occasions: April 10 and April 12-13.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Tikriti, Nabil 2007&quot;/&gt; These fires were set professionally with accelerants. A report was later given by Saad Eskander, the directorâgeneral of the National Library and Archive, regarding the destruction. He noted that three days before the invasion, library staff were told to destroy all archival material related to the Baâathist rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Tikriti, Nabil 2007&quot;/&gt; Eskander also reported that the destruction was performed by âa mix of poor people looking for a quick profit, along with regime loyalists intent on destroying evidence of atrocitiesâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eskander, Saad p1-54&quot;&gt;Eskander, Saad. &quot;The Tale of Iraq's 'Cemetery of Books' &quot; (cover story), in: ''Information Today''; Dec 2004, Vol. 21, issue 11, p. 1-54; 5 pl, 1 color&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iraq National Library Destroyed.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The library building after the fire.]]
Due to an iron door having been locked, most of the damage occurred in the main reading room and lobby of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Tikriti, Nabil 2007&quot;/&gt; âAfter the first round of destruction, staff and volunteers associated with a cleric named `Abd al-Munâim welded the door shut and removed as many books as they could transport to the clericâs al-Haqq Mosque in Sadr (formerly Saddam) City.â In total, an estimated 60 percent of its total archival materials, 25 percent of its books, newspapers, rare books, and most of its historical photographs and maps were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eskander, Saad p1-54&quot;/&gt;

Before the destruction, the library and archives were reported to have held 417,000 books, 2,618 periodicals dating from the late Ottoman era to modern times, and a collection of 4,412 rare books and manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, Andrew &amp; Rogers, Michael. &quot;Iraq Libraries Devastated in War&quot;, in: ''Library Journal'' (1976), volume 128, no 9, p. 18, accessed May 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; âAccording to Eskander, Saddam loyalists burned the entirety of the Republican Archive, which contained the records of the Ba'athist regime between the years 1958 and 1979. Also completely destroyed were the Ba'athist court proceedings detailing the charges against and trials of party opponents. Records of Iraq's [[Foreign relations of Iraq|relations with its neighbors]], including Iran, Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, are missing. Iraq has accused neighbouring countries of stealing sections of its national archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jeswLeLfG6ckKEpjHozJIoG1CwsQ Iraq accuses neighbours of stealing archives]. AFP. October 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these documents, which would have been of great interest to Iraqi citizens as well as to historians, the INLA lost records and documents from the Ottoman reign, the British occupation, the monarchical era, and much more. The destruction or loss of these materials, according to Eskander, did not occur only during the April 2003 attacksâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards, Julie Biando 2008, p327-342&quot;/&gt;

In November 2003, the [[Library of Congress|US Library of congress]] sent a team to Baghdad that amongst other things also visited the library in its fire damaged state. They entered the building and visited the stacks of the library, which were hidden behind a metal door.&lt;ref&gt;The Library of Congress and the U.S. Department of State, [http://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/iraqreport/iraqreport.html Report on the National Library and the House of Manuscripts] 15-11-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==
[[Saad Eskander]], director of the library and archives since 2003, has been keeping a diary through the British Libraryâs website, with entries starting in November 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kniffel, Leonard 2007&quot;&gt;Kniffel, Leonard. &quot;National Library Copes as Iraq War Presses on.&quot; ''American Libraries'', 38.5 (2007): 17&lt;/ref&gt; His entries document the events covering the library and archiveâs restoration. By 2007, the center âhad already become a safe haven for intellectual activity, fully accessible to the public, with a state-of-the-art computer centerâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kniffel, Leonard 2007&quot;/&gt; In addition, there is also a facility for transferring documents to microfilm, a cataloging operation, and a department that locates documents from Iraqi government ministries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kniffel, Leonard 2007&quot;/&gt; Having been a major player in the history of Iraq, the [[British Library]] was able to help the reconstruction, by providing microfilm copies of rare books and microfiche copies of documents relating to the administration of Iraq from 1914 to 1921 that were held by the British in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kniffel, Leonard 2007&quot;/&gt; Despite the fact that five staff members have been killed, along with the library closing for days at a time due to heavy fighting, Eskander says he sees the institution as &quot;an important source of uniting and unifying the country.&quot;
