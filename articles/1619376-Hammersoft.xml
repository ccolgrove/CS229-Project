'''Interstate 290''' (abbreviated '''I-290''') runs for {{convert|20.16|mi|km}} from [[Auburn, Massachusetts]] to [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]].  It is a continuation of [[Interstate 395 (Massachusetts)|I-395]] north of [[Interstate 90|I-90]] (the [[Mass Pike]]) and runs through downtown [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], [[I-190 (MA)|I-190]] splits off, and I-290 runs across [[Lake Quinsigamond]] and east to [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Marlborough. There are buildings very close to the highway, including a grand church which faces the road (referred to locally as &quot;[[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of the Highway&quot;).  Massachusetts has built a [[freeway]] connector ([[Route 146 (Massachusetts)|Route 146]]) from I-290 in Worcester to the Mass Pike and then south to [[Providence, Rhode Island]].


==History==
[[File:Orson the Bear Polar.JPG|thumb|left|Orson the bear, the mascot of [[Polar Beverages]], is a prominent landmark visible from I-290 in Worcester.]]
Originally, I-290 was to rejoin I-90 in [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westboro]], roughly where I-495 sits now.  However, this route would have run through the town centers of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]] and [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]].  Additionally, I-290 was intended to be extended past I-495 to [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]]/[[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], but this was canceled under pressure from towns along the planned route.  A brief two-lane connector heads to [[Route 85 (Massachusetts)|Route 85]] as a result of this aborted plan. The interchange with I-495 was originally supposed to be a [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], but after the plan was canceled, it was modified with a [[Overpass|flyover]] ramp onto 495-northbound.
