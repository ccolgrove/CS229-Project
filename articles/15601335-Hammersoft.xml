The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Cincinnati Bengals]] season''' was the 39th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and their 41st overall season. The team finished the season with 4 wins, 11 losses, and 1 tie, and did not qualify for the playoffs for the 3rd consecutive year.

==Offseason==
===Coaching changes===
This season marked head coach [[Marvin Lewis]]'s sixth year with the Bengals. His offensive coordinator, [[Bob Bratkowski]], remained with the team, but his defensive coordinator from 2007â08, [[Chuck Bresnahan]], was not retained. He was replaced by [[Mike Zimmer]] and [[Jeff FitzGerald]] replaced [[Ricky Hunley]] as linebacker coach.

===Season theme===
Typically Lewis has had a theme for the upcoming season for the team to rally around. For the 2008 season it was &quot;Now&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Now&quot; by Geoff Hobson on May 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departures===
*[[Madieu Williams]], [[Safety (football position)|Safety]] signed with the [[Minnesota Vikings]].

*[[Justin Smith (American football)|Justin Smith]], [[Defensive end]] signed with the [[San Francisco 49ers]].

*[[Landon Johnson]], [[Linebacker]] signed with the [[Carolina Panthers]].

*[[Willie Anderson (American football)|Willie Anderson]], the long time Offensive Lineman was released and signed by the division rival [[Baltimore Ravens]].

*[[Rudi Johnson]] was released and signed by the [[Detroit Lions]].

*Ahmad Brooks, [[Linebacker]], who was allegedly involved in an assault for punching a woman in the face late April, was released before the season began.

*[[David Pollack]], who was injured during his second season in the NFL with the Bengals and suffered paralysis, declined to return to football and officially retired.

*[[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]] was released from the team on the same day a press release in the local paper announced his alleged involvement in an assault occurring within Cincinnati. A few weeks after Marvin Lewis made the public declaration that Henry would never play for the Bengals again he was re-signed. He is ineligible to play the first 4 regular season games as punishment for his involvement with criminal charges against him which were dropped before his reinstatement.

*[[Odell Thurman]], a linebacker suspended for two consecutive years, was declared eligible to return to the NFL. He was then waived in May when Lewis cited that they had not seen enough of Odell to evaluate him properly. Less than a month later Odell was indefinitely suspended from the NFL for violating their substance abuse policy.

===Signings===

*[[Ben Utecht]], a tight end previously with the [[Indianapolis Colts]]
*[[Antwan Odom]], a defensive end previously with the [[Tennessee Titans]]
*[[Doug Gabriel]], a wide receiver previously with the [[Oakland Raiders]]. He was released from the Bengals on May 29, 2008.

===[[2008 NFL Draft]]===

The Bengals gained an additional 4 picks for compensation of losing certain players. The Bengals are expected to draft a defensive tackle high in the draft, specifically

Starter, Dexter Jackson, was inactive due to injury.

The Bengals began their 2008 campaign on the road against their AFC North foe, the [[Baltimore Ravens]].  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Ravens WR [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] turned a double reverse play into a 42-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Bengals continued to struggle as kicker [[Matt Stover]] gave Baltimore a 21-yard field goal.  Cincinnati would reply as kicker [[Shayne Graham]] nailed a 43-yard field goal.  However, in the third quarter, the Bengals continued to show their dismal defense as Ravens QB [[Joe Flacco]] got a 38-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally as CB [[Johnathan Joseph]] returned a fumble 65 yards for a touchdown.  However, Baltimore's defense stiffened and held on for the win.

With the loss, Cincinnati began their season at 0â1.

Starter Dexter Jackson was inactive for the game due to injury.

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Ravens, the Bengals played their Week 2 home opener against the [[Tennessee Titans]]. At the beginning of the game the winds were marked at 20&amp;nbsp;mph and picked up intensity as the game continued, with gusts to hurricane force at times due to the passage of the remnants of [[Hurricane Ike]]. After a scoreless first quarter, Cincinnati trailed as Titans RB [[LenDale White]] got a 1-yard TD run.  The Bengals would respond with RB [[Chris Perry (American football)|Chris Perry]] getting his first career TD on a 13-yard run.  However, Tennessee would begin its domination with QB [[Kerry Collins]] completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR [[Justin Gage]].  In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as kicker [[Rob Bironas]] nailed a 34-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Titans sealed the win with LB [[Keith Bulluck]] blocking and recovering a punt within Cincy's endzone for a touchdown.

During the game, the wind was such a factor that it aided the Titan's punter who, with a quick 1-step drop, kicked a punt travelling 70 yards past scrimmage before hitting the ground. It appeared to contribute to difficulties with short passes and long snaps.

With the loss, the Bengals fell to 0â2.

Trying to snap their two-game losing skid, the Bengals flew to [[Giants Stadium]] for a Week 3 interconference duel with the defending Super Bowl champions, the [[New York Giants]].

The Bengals would strike back with RB [[Chris Perry (American football)|Chris Perry]] getting a 25-yard TD run.
