'''Norman Leroy Siebern''' (born July 26, 1933 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) was a [[Major League Baseball]] player for the [[New York Yankees]], [[Kansas City Athletics]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]], [[San Francisco Giants]], and [[Boston Red Sox]] from {{By|1956}} to {{By|1968}}. His best season came in {{By|1962}} with the A's, when he hit 25 [[home runs]], had 117 [[runs batted in]] and a .308 [[batting average]]. He might be most remembered however, as being one of the players the Yankees traded for [[Roger Maris]].

The Orioles acquired Siebern on November 27, 1963 in an exchange of starting [[first baseman|first basemen]], sending [[Jim Gentile]] and $25,000 to the Athletics. He spent two seasons in Baltimore, losing his starting spot in the middle of 1965 to [[Boog Powell]], who successfully made the transition from the [[outfield]]. Siebern was traded to the Angels on December 2, 1965 for outfielder [[Dick Simpson]]. Seven days later, Simpson would be one of three players sent to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] for [[Frank Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, John C.
