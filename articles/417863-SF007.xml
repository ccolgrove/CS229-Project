'''Slax''' is a [[LiveCD]] Linux distribution based on [[Slackware]] and is currently being developed by TomÃ¡Å¡ MatÄjÃ­Äek. Packages can be selected in a website where users can build a custom Slax iso image. Slax slogan refers to the software as a &quot;Pocket [[Operating System]]&quot;. The latest version of Slax is 6.1.2, which was released on 4 August 2009. 

The developer has stated that work on Slax 7 will begin once a stable [[Linux kernel|kernel]] (version 2.6.34){{notincitation|date=January 2011}}{{clarify|date=December 2010}} is released with [[Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]] support for [[squashFS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomas-m.com/blog/2819-Squashfs-LZMA-support.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
One of the main benefits of the Slax distribution is its ease of customization. Additional software can be added and removed, using [[Slackware]] packages and Slax modules. A traditional [[package management system|package manager]] such as Debian's [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] is not required to load additional software; Slax modules are completely self-contained.  Users can also modify the default CD image or USB drive installation to customize the packages available in the distribution on boot. Slax also allows Slackware packages to be converted to Slax modules with the '''tgz2lzm''' command. 

The Slax homepage offers a software repository for downloading user created modules and uploading new ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slax.org/modules.php Slax modules], Official Slax module repository&lt;/ref&gt;

Slax modules are compressed read-only [[SquashFS]] [[file system]] images that are compressed with a [[LempelâZivâMarkov chain algorithm|LZMA]] compressor. The various modules are stacked together to build the complete Slax [[root directory]]. A supplemental writable layer (a [[tmpfs]] file system) is put on the top of the stack to implement the write functionality.

The stackable file system of choice changed between Slax versions 5 ([[UnionFS]]) and 6 ([[aufs]]), as did the module file name extension (changed from .mo to .lzm).

== Versions ==
The Slax releases before Slax 3 were known as &quot;Slackware-Live&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distrowatch.com/index.php?distribution=slax |title=Slax - News |publisher=[[DistroWatch]] |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=ftp://ftp.slax.org/SLAX-6.x/changelog.txt |title=SLAX-6.x - changelog.txt |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slax 5 ===
There were five official editions of Slax 5:
* '''Slax Standard''' was the standard edition for normal personal use.
* '''Slax KillBill''' included [[Wine (software)|Wine]], [[DOSBox]] and [[QEMU]] to run [[DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] applications.
* '''Slax Server''' supplied additional Internet functionality and came with pre-configured [[Domain Name System|DNS]], [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]], [[Samba (software)|Samba]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[MySQL]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]], [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Secure Shell|SSH]] servers and several other server applications.
* '''Slax Popcorn''' was a minimalistic edition focused on browsing and multimedia playback. It featured [[Mozilla Firefox]] as the default [[web browser]] and the lightweight [[Xfce]] as a [[desktop environment]] instead of [[KDE]].
* '''Slax Frodo''' was a &quot;bare bones&quot; edition, providing only a full-featured text-only environment, particularly focused on computers with small amounts of RAM.

The [[Fluxbox]] [[Window Manager]] was an option in all editions except Frodo.

=== Slax 6 ===
Slax 6 is offered in a single version, and completely relies on modules (additional packages) for extra features. From version 6, modules are based on LZMA compression, but some compatibility was initially provided between the obsolete .mo modules used by Slax version 5 and the more recent .lzm modules of version 6. As there have been some changes between Linux kernel versions during sub-version releases of Slax 6, however, the .mo modules of Slax 5 are now considered obsolete. Each module or package should be compiled for compatibility with the Linux kernel currently in use.
