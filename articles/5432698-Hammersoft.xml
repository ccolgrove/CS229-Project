'''C/S''' (standing for '''Crime/Suspense''', originally used as an on-air brand) is brand used for several [[Philippines|Filipino]] entertainment channels owned by the [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]]. It shows mostly American crime and suspense dramas, mysteries, reality, science fiction and action shows.

==History==
Solar Entertainment first launched its namesake entertainment cable channel in early 2000s, one devoted to [[Television in the United States|American]] programs. This channel was later known as ''Solar USA'' (the acronym stands for &quot;'''U'''ltimate in '''S'''uspense and '''A'''ction&quot;), and then later simply as ''USA''. USA was replaced by two separate channels in 2005. Solar USA's comedy and general entertainment programming was moved to [[Jack TV]], while action and crime dramas were given a new separate channel, '''Crime/Suspense''', later launched in October of that year.

As part of a partnership established with the [[Radio Philippines Network]], C/S became the on-air brand for its network of over-the-air stations across the Philippines in January 2008. The C/S cable channel was later rebranded as ''[[C/S Origin]]'' in September of the same year, while the RPN network later changed its branding to '''C/S 9''' the next month, and then changed its name to '''[[Solar TV]]''' in November 2009.
