Pune is known to have existed as a town since 937 AD. Pune was originally called Punawadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pune.org.uk/history.html | title = Pune History - Origin &amp; History of Pune - History of Puna India - History of Pune City |publisher=Pune.org.uk |date= |accessdate = 2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chhatrapati [[Shivaji]] Maharaj, the founder of the [[Maratha Empire]], lived in Pune as a young boy, and later oversaw significant growth and development of the town during his reign. In 1730, Pune became an important political center as the seat of the [[Peshwa]], the prime minister of the [[Chhatrapati]] of Satara. After the town was annexed to [[British India]] in 1817, it served as a [[cantonment]] town and as the &quot;monsoon capital&quot; of the [[Bombay Presidency]] until the [[independence of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of The Southern Command | url = http://indianarmy.nic.in/Site/FormTemplete/frmTempSimpleWithEightPara.aspx?MnId=Sg+FqEGS1Bo=&amp;ParentID=Y11bXvHH2Ok=&amp;flag=p|accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Pune is known for its educational facilities and relative prosperity. Pune is the cultural capital of Maharashtra. Pune has well-established manufacturing, [[glass]], sugar, and [[forging]] industries since the 1950-60s. It has a growing industrial hinterland, with many [[information technology]] and [[automotive]] companies setting up factories in Pune district. The city is known for various cultural activities like classical music, spirituality, theater, sports, and literature. These activities and job opportunities attract migrants and students from all over India and abroad, which makes for a city of many communities and cultures.

==Toponymy==
The name ''Pune'' is derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''Puá¹yanagara'' &quot;City of Virtue&quot;. The oldest reference to this name was found on a [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]]  copper plate dated 937, that refers to the town as ''Punya-Vishaya'' or ''Poonak-Vishaya''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PuneTimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.punediary.com/html/historyevents.html | title = Some Important Years In The History Of Pune |accessdate=2008-04-04}} Pune's Timeline&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century, it had come to be known as ''Kasbe Pune'' or ''Punavadi''.

The city's name is sometimes transcribed as ''Poona'' in English, a practice particularly common during the [[British Raj]]. The spelling ''Pune'' was formally adopted in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nationalencyclopedin]], [http://www.ne.se/ Online edition], articles ''Poona'' and ''Pune''. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Pune}}

===Early and Medieval===
Copper plates dated 758 AD and 768 AD show that, by the 8th century, an agricultural settlement known as ''Punnaka'' existed where Pune is today. The plates indicate that this region was ruled by the Rashtrakuta Dynasty. The [[Pataleshwar]] rock-cut temple complex was built during this era.

Pune was part of the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] from the 9th century to 1327. In 1595, [[Maloji Raje Bhosale]] was appointed the [[jagir]]dar of Pune and Supe by the [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PuneTimeline&quot;/&gt; It was ruled by the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]] until being annexed by the Mughals in the 17th century.

===Maratha rule===
In 1625, [[Shahaji]] appointed [[Rango Bapuji Dhadphale]] as the administrator of Pune. He was one of the first major developers of the town, overseeing construction of the [[Kasba Peth]], [[Somwar Peth]], [[Raviwar Peth]] and [[Shaniwar Peth]]. After the destruction of the town in raids by the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]] in 1630, and again from 1636 to 1647, [[Dadoji Kondadev]], a military and administrative officer of  Shahaji Bhosale, oversaw redevelopment and construction of the area. He stabilized the revenue system of Pune and the neighborhoods of [[Maval]] to the west of town. In addition, he developed effective methods to control disputes and enforce law and order. Construction began on the [[Lal Mahal]] palace, as Shahaji's son [[Shivaji]] was to move there with his mother [[Jijabai]]. The Lal Mahal was completed in 1640.&lt;ref name=&quot;PuneTimeline&quot; /&gt; Jijabai is said to have commissioned the building of the [[Kasba Ganapati]] temple herself. The [[Ganesha]] idol consecrated at this temple is regarded as the presiding deity (''[[gramadevata]]'') of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Monuments in Pune|publisher = Pune district administration | url = http://pune.gov.in/history/monuments1.htm| accessdate = 2008-04-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080325021426/http://pune.gov.in/history/monuments1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shivaji was crowned [[Chhatrapati]] in 1674, thus founding the [[Maratha Empire]]. He oversaw further development in Pune, including the construction of the Guruwar, Somwar, Ganesh and Ghorpade Peths. Shivaji Maharaj encouraged development of dams in Parvati and Kondhwa regions of Pune for agriculture purpose. Pune and surrounding villages later provided manpower for Shivaji's efforts to build an army during the period from 1645 to 1680. In between 1660 to 1670 the town was captured by Moghul General Shahista Khan, but was recaptured by the Marathas in 1670 after the battle of Sinhagad. During the 27-year long conflict between the Marathas and the Moghuls, the town  was occupied by [[Aurangzeb]] from 1703 to 1705; during this time the name of town was changed to &quot;Muhiyabad&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Two years later, the Marathas recaptured Sinhagad fort and later Pune city from the Moghuls as had been done in 1670.
[[File:Thorle Bajirao.jpg|thumb|[[Baji Rao I]]  one of the famous nine [[Peshwas]].]]
In 1720, [[Baji Rao I]] was appointed [[Peshwa]] (Prime Minister) of the Maratha Empire, ruled by [[Chattrapati Shahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher= [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]]|accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected Pune as his base and started construction of [[Shaniwar Wada]] on the banks of the Mutha. The construction was completed in 1730, ushering the era of Peshwa control of the city. The patronage of the Peshwas resulted in the construction of many temples and bridges in the city, including the Lakdi Pul and the temples on [[Parvati Hill]]. Bajirao Peshwa also constructed an underground aqueduct to bring water from Katraj Lake to Shaniwar Wada. The aqueduct is still operational. Pune prospered as a city during the reign of [[Nanasaheb Peshwe]]. He developed [[Saras Baug]], [[Heera Baug]], [[Parvati Hill]] and new commercial, trading and residential localilties. The [[Sadashiv Peth]], [[Narayan Peth]], [[Rasta Peth]] and [[Nana Peth]] were developed in this era. The Peshwas fell into decline after their defeat in the 1761 [[Battle of Panipat (1761)|Battle of Panipat]]. In 1802, Pune was captured by [[Yashwantrao Holkar]] in the [[Battle of Poona]], directly precipitating the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] of 1803-1805.

===British Rule===
[[File:AgaKhan Palace.jpg|thumb|The [[Aga Khan Palace]] was constructed by [[Aga Khan III]] in 1892.]]
The [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] broke out between the Marathas and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] in 1817. The Peshwas were defeated at the [[Battle of Khadki]] (then transcribed ''Kirkee'') on 5 November near Poona, and the city was seized by the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was placed under the administration of the [[Bombay Presidency]], and the British built a large military [[Pune Cantonment|cantonment]] to the east of the city (now used by the [[Indian Army]]). The Pune Municipality was established in 1858. Navi Peth, Ganj Peth and Mahatma Phule Peth were developed during the [[British Raj]].

[[Nana Sahib]] Peshwa, the adopted son of the last Peshwa [[Bajirao II]], rose against the rule of [[British East India Company]] as a part of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], known in India as the First War of Independence. He was helped by [[Rani Lakshmibai]] of [[Jhansi]] and [[Tatya Tope]]. At the end of the war, the final remnants of the Maratha Empire were annexed to British India.

Pune was an important centre in the social and religious reform movements of the late 19th century.  Many prominent social reformers and freedom fighters lived here, including [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] (also known as Lokmanya Tilak), [[Vitthal Ramji Shinde]], [[Dhondo Keshav Karve]] and [[Jyotirao Phule]].

Poona (Pune) is also associated with the struggle for Indian independence. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] was imprisoned at Yerwada jail several times and placed under house arrest at the [[Aga Khan Palace]] in 1942-44, where both his wife and aide Mahadev Desai died.

In late 1896, Poona (Pune) was hit by [[bubonic plague]]; and by the end of February 1897, the epidemic was raging, with a mortality rate twice the norm, and half the city's population fled. A Special Plague Committee was formed under the chairmanship of W. C. Rand, an [[Indian Civil Services]] officer.  He brought troops to deal with the emergency. Although these measures were unpopular, the epidemic was under control by May.  On 22 June 1897, during the Diamond Jubilee celebration of the coronation of [[Queen Victoria]], Rand and his military escort Lt. Ayerst were shot while returning from the celebrations at Government House. Both died, Ayerst on the spot and Rand of his wounds on 3 July.  The [[Chapekar brothers]] and two accomplices were charged with this murder, and with the shooting of two informants and an attempt to shoot a police officer. All three brothers were found guilty and [[hanging|hanged]]. An accomplice was dealt with similarly. Another, a school boy, was sentenced to ten years hard labour.

===Independence===
After [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian independence in 1947]], from Britain Poona (Pune) saw a lot of development, such as the establishment of the [[National Defence Academy (India)|National Defence Academy]] at [[Khadakwasla]] and the [[National Chemical Laboratory]] at [[Pashan]].  Pune serves as the headquarters of the [[Southern Command (India)|Southern Command]] of the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/southcom.htm | title = Southern Command in India|accessdate=$ january 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial development started in the 1950s and '60s in [[Hadapsar]], [[Bhosari]], [[Pimpri]], and [[Parvati]].&lt;ref name=nic&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pune.gov.in/history/mevents3.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080613164908/http://pune.gov.in/history/mevents3.htm |archivedate=2008-06-13 | title = Historical Events in Pune|work=http://pune.gov.in |publisher=NIC - District-Pune|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telco (now [[Tata Motors]]) started operations in 1961, which gave a huge boost to the automobile sector.

In July 1961, the [[Panshet]] and [[Khadakwasla]] dams broke and their waters flooded the city, destroying most of the older sections of town, facilitating the subsequent introduction of modern town planning concepts and the development of parts of Pune.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The economy of the city witnessed a boom in the construction and manufacturing sectors.  By 1966, the city had expanded in all directions.&lt;ref name=nic/&gt;

In 1990 Pune began to attract foreign capital, particularly in the [[information technology]] and [[engineering]] industries; new businesses like [[floriculture]] and [[food processing]] started to take root in and around the city. In 1998, work on the six-lane [[Mumbai-Pune expressway]] began; the expressway being completed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.financialexpress.com/old/fe/daily/20000730/fec30031.html | title = The Mumbai-Pune expressway|work=The Financial Express|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT Parks were established in [[Aundh (Pune)|Aundh]], [[Hinjawadi]] and on [[Nagar Road]]. In 2008 the [[Commonwealth Youth Games]] took place in Pune, which encouraged additional development in the northwest region of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://punekar.in/site/2008/09/17/pune-to-get-piped-compressed-natural-gas-before-cyg/ | title = Pune to get piped compressed natural gas before CYG|work=The Punekar|accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, India's first death due to [[H1 N1]] occurred in Pune.  Later the city became an epicentre of swine flue due to the large number of H1 N1 cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.rediff.com/news/sflu-2009-commtry.html | title = Latest News: Swine Flu in India|work=news.rediff.com|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Pune India.jpg|thumb|left|Laxmi Road in Central Pune]][[File:Pashan Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Pashan Lake]] is a man made lake]]
Pune is located {{convert|560|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level on the western margin of the [[Deccan plateau]].  It is situated on the leeward side of the [[Sahyadri]] mountain range, which form a barrier from the [[Arabian sea]].  It is a relatively hilly city, with its tallest hill, [[Vetal Hill in Pune|Vetal Hill]], rising to {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.

This festival culminates with a parade of Ganesh idols from across the city carried to the local rivers to be immersed (''Ganesh visarjan''). The Kasba Ganapati, as the presiding deity of the city, is the first in this parade. The idea of a public celebration was initiated by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] in Pune, and has since spread to many other cities, particularly [[Mumbai]], which now has a parade every year.

Religious person like [[Dnyaneshwar]] and revolutionary spiritual poet [[Sant Tukaram Maharaj]] were born near Pune. Their link to the city is commemorated with an annual pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], 300 kilometers away, consisting of a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]] of both figures being carried to the [[Vithoba Temple, Pandharpur|main temple]] of the Hindu god [[Vithoba]].
