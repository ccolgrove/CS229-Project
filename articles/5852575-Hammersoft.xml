The '''United States U-23 women's national soccer team''' is a youth [[association football|soccer]] team operated under the auspices of [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]].  Its primary role is the development of players in preparation for the full Women's National Team.  The team's most recent major tournament was the [[2008 Nordic Cup]], in which the United States team won 3-0 over Germany.  The team competes in a variety of competitions, including the annual [[Nordic Cup]], which is the top competition for this age group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ussoccer.com/articles/viewArticle.jsp_12189697.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The current head coach is [[Bill Irwin (footballer)|Bill Irwin]].

==History==
===Beginnings as a U-20 program===
The United States U-23 team has been active since 1989, however it was run as a U-20 team from its inception until 1998.&lt;ref&gt;2009 WNT U.S. Soccer Media Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main goal was to prepare college players for the step up to international soccer.  Women had no viable opportunities to enhance their playing abilities, aside from overseas, since the [[United States]] lacked a top-level domestic league during this time.

===The switch to U-21===
In 1998, [[United States Soccer Federation]] decided to make the team a U-21 team in order to give women a higher level of play to better prepare them for the full National Team.  In accordance with this strategy, the U-21 team frequently rostered &quot;over-aged&quot; players in the U-21 training camps, as well as the [[Nordic Cup]].  It remained a U-21 team from 1998 through 2008.

===Competing as a U-23 team===
2008 saw the change of the USA's oldest youth national team moved to the U-23 level.  The move was made by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] in response to age-level changes [[FIFA]] had made to its oldest women's youth competition, now named [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]].  The age limit was raised from being a U-19 tournament to a U-20 tournament.  This change, coupled with a newly introduced U-23 age limit to the [[Nordic Cup]], prompted the USSF to rethink and eventually change the youth development team.  The team continues to serve as a stepping-stone for collegiate and post-collegiate players to the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States Women's National Team]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ussoccer.com/teams/youth/index.jsp.html&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a new ally has appeared in order to further develop players &amp;mdash; the new top-flight women's league, [[Women's Professional Soccer]], which kicked off in 2009.  While many of the post-collegiate players play in this new league to develop their game, the U-23's turned focus on college players who are out of season and not yet WPS-eligible.

==Current players==
===2011 Four Nations Tournament roster===
The U-23 women competed in the Four Nations Tournament against the U-23 teams of [[England women's national football team|England]], [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]], and [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]], Feb. 21-March 2, 2011.
