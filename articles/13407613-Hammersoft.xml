===Coaching rumors===
Following Michigan's loss to Appalachian State, rumors about the possibility of Ferentz becoming Michigan's head coach began to circulate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fanblogs article - Ferentz to Michigan?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa's Kirk Ferentz offered Michigan job?|url = http://www.fanblogs.com/michigan/007325.php|publisher = Fanblogs.com|date = 2007-11-26|accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MGoBlog article - Ferentz to Michigan?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Say Hello To My Little Ferentz|url = http://mgoblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/say-hello-to-my-little-ferentz.html|publisher = MGoBlog|date = 2007-11-25|accessdate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] coach [[Les Miles]] was widely believed to be Michigan's top choice for the job,&lt;ref name=&quot;FanHouse article - Ferentz to Michigan?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Kirk Ferentz to Michigan?

Soon thereafter, Ferentz was once again rumored for a coaching job, this time for the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

However, when asked about the Baltimore job, Ferentz said, &quot;I've got a great job here, and with that being said, I'm sure Baltimore will get a top-notch coach.&quot;  Ferentz also cited wanting to see his son James â who is slated to be a [[First year|freshman]] at Iowa in 2008 â play every weekend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferentz indication&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Ferentz indicates he'll stay at Iowa|url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-sp.ferentz05jan05,0,7588656.story|publisher = Baltimore Sun|date = 2008-01-05|accessdate = 2008-01-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110522122032/http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-sp.ferentz05jan05,0,7588656.story |archivedate = May 22, 2011|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;  The Ravens eventually hired [[Philadelphia Eagles]] secondary coach [[John Harbaugh]] on January 18, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baltimore Sun - Harbaugh new Baltimore coach&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Ravens hire Harbaugh as coach|url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-harbaugh118,0,5839718.story?coll=sns-ap-entertainment-headlines|publisher = Baltimore Sun|date = 2008-01-18|accessdate = 2008-01-24|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110522122112/http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-harbaugh118,0,5839718.story?coll=sns-ap-entertainment-headlines |archivedate = May 22, 2011|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Kirk Ferentz will be in his tenth season as head coach at Iowa in 2008, and he has a 61â49 record entering the season.  Ferentz came to Iowa in 1999, following an assistant coaching job for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and a heading coaching job at Maine.&lt;ref name=&quot;HawkeyeSports article - Hawks look to 2008&quot;/&gt;  Earlier in his career, Ferentz was an assistant coach under [[Hayden Fry]] at Iowa. From 1981â1989, Ferentz was Iowa's offensive line coach.  From there, Ferentz took the heading coaching position at Maine, and followed that by taking an assistant position in Baltimore.  He was named Iowa's 25th head football coach on December 2, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk Ferentz&quot;/&gt;

Norm Parker, Iowa's [[defensive coordinator]], will also be in his tenth year at Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norm Parker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Norm Parker|url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/parker_norm00.html|publisher = HawkeyeSports.com|date = |accessdate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same can also be said for [[Ken O'Keefe]], Iowa's [[offensive coordinator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ken O'Keefe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Ken O'Keefe|url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/okeefe_ken00.html|publisher = HawkeyeSports.com|date = |accessdate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Parker, Iowa's rushing defense has nationally ranked in the top 10 in three seasons. Parker has also coached several [[linebacker]]s now playing in the [[NFL]], including [[Chad Greenway]], [[Abdul Hodge]], and [[LeVar Woods]].  Before coming to Iowa, Parker coached 12 seasons at Michigan State, five at Minnesota, and three at Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norm Parker&quot;/&gt;  Under O'Keefe, Iowa has had the top scoring offense in the Big Ten twice, in 2001 and 2002, and 14 offensive players coached by O'Keefe have been [[NFL Draft|drafted]] into the NFL.  Before coaching at Iowa, O'Keefe was the head coach at [[Allegheny College]], where he won a [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] national title in 1990.  He was also head coach at [[Fordham University]] for one year before coming to Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ken O'Keefe&quot;/&gt;

===Players===
Returning for the Hawkeyes in 2008 are nine starters on offense, and as many as 18 total starters could be back for Iowa.  Senior running back Young is gone, along with fellow running back Damian Sims and [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] Tom Busch.  The rest of the offense, including the [[offensive line]] and [[wide receiver]] positions, are intact going into 2008. On the defense, up to seven starters may return, but the Hawkeyes lose linebackers [[Mike Klinkenborg]] and Mike Humpal along with [[defensive end]]s [[Kenny Iwebema]] and [[Bryan Mattison]].  [[Cornerback]]s [[Adam Shada]] and [[Charles Godfrey (American football)|Charles Godfrey]] are also done with their playing days at Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;HawkeyeSports article - Hawks look to 2008&quot;/&gt;  Godfrey, who completed 2007 with five [[interception]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Godfrey SI profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = #13 Charles Godfrey|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/players/21612/index.html|publisher = SI.com|date = |accessdate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was regarded as a possible third- to sixth-round draft pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] before being picked in the third-round.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charles Godfrey draft status&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Charles Godfrey, CB, Iowa|url = http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/profile.php?pyid=33090|publisher = NFL Draft Scout|date = |accessdate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scout.com Charles Godfrey draft status&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 2008 NFL Draft: Day Two Ball-Hawking DBs|url = http://profootballexperts.scout.com/2/699262.html|publisher = Scout.com|author = Chris Steuber|date = 2007-11-07|accessdate = 2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Iowa player, Devan Moylan, is seeking for another year after missing most of 2007 with an injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;HawkeyeSports article - Hawks look to 2008&quot;/&gt;

Returnees on offense include [[Jake Christensen]], who succeeded [[Drew Tate]] at the [[quarterback]] position.  Christensen threw for 2,269&amp;nbsp;yards and 17 [[touchdown]]s in his [[sophomore]] season, while throwing only six interceptions.  Also returning are 11 [[true freshman|true freshmen]] and 20 [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt freshmen]] who saw playing time in 2007.  With 31 total freshmen receiving playing time, the Hawkeyes ranked third in the country in that category, behind [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]] and [[2008 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], who played 38 and 33 freshmen respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;HawkeyeSports article - Hawks look to 2008&quot;/&gt;
