'''Buletin Malam''', (literally ''Nightly Bulletin'') is the first [[newscast]] containing international stories ever produced by a private [[television station]] in [[Indonesia]]. Launched in February 1, 1991 on [[RCTI]], Buletin Malam which was then hosted by [[Helmi Johannes]] and [[Desi Anwar]] became so popular since it had been focused on  developments in the then [[Soviet Union]] with its [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] that ended in the country's disintegration. The newscast is a half-hour pre-midnight news program and it continues to be one of the strongest late night shows in Indonesian [[television]] industry, Buletin Malam was also carried by RCTI's then sister station [[SCTV (Indonesia)|SCTV]] and [[Indosiar]].

On February 9, 2009, Seputar Indonesia was revived and is the only news program on [[RCTI]], now called '''Satu Seputar Indonesia'''. The morning news program, [[Nuansa Pagi]] was renamed '''Seputar Indonesia Pagi'''. The afternoon news program, [[Buletin Siang]] renamed '''Seputar Indonesia Siang'''. The late night news program, [[Buletin Malam]] was renamed '''Seputar Indonesia Malam'''. The main evening edition retained the '''Seputar Indonesia''' name due to the historical context.
