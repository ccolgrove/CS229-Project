The [[animation|animated]] [[television series]]  ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' features an extensive cast of characters originally created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Steve Ditko]] and other comic book creators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man at Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936418/|publisher=[[Variety.com]]|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Weisman]] and [[Victor Cook]] and the rest of the crew redesigned these classic characters in the series to be more modern but still to be true to its characters in the comics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisman interview&quot;/&gt; Most of these characters are based on the original [[Earth-616|mainstream]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] but there have been characters that have been introduced from the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe such as [[Kenny McFarlane|Kenny &quot;King&quot; Kong]] and characters from [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man in film|film series]] such as Benard Houseman as well. The majority of the [[villain]]s that have debuted in the show have started out as supporting characters before becoming villains.&lt;ref name=&quot;comicmix&quot;/&gt; The character's portrayals in the shows have mainly gained positive reviews from TV critics.

==Role in ''The Spectacular Spider-Man''==
The main [[protagonist]] of the series is [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], a young teenager who is still in high school but is also secretly a [[superhero]] called Spider-Man.&lt;ref name=&quot;summary&quot;/&gt; In school his two classmates are [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Harry Osborn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;comicmix&quot;/&gt; He and his classmates are constantly being bullied and teased by the more popular [[Flash Thompson]] and his classmates. Ironically enough, much to Peter's dismay, Flash Thompson is also one of Spider-Man's biggest fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;comicmix&quot;/&gt; Also at school, Peter's feelings wrestle between [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Liz Allan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;season two&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Spectacular Spider-Man season 2 review|url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2009/06/30/spectacular-spider-man-season-two-a-slice-of-scifi-review/|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Parker soon finds himself getting a job at the [[Daily Bugle]] as a freelance photographer working with characters such as [[J. Jonah Jameson]], [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]], [[Betty Brant]], [[Ned Leeds|Ned Lee]] and [[Frederick Foswell]]. Parker as Spider-Man fights a lot of villains in the series as the majority of his [[rogues gallery]] in the comics are introduced in this series. Season one introduces [[supervillain]]s such as [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Green Goblin]], [[Doctor Octopus]] and [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;comicmix&quot;/&gt; It also introduces crime lords such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] who are partly responsible for the [[supervillain]]s. Season two expanded on the villains already introduced (excluding the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]) and also introduces the supervillains [[Mysterio]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], and [[Molten Man]].&lt;ref name=&quot;comicmix&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man review in comicmix.|url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/07/07/review-the-spectacular-spider-man-animated-series/|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;season two&quot;/&gt; It also introduced another crime lord called [[Silvermane (comics)|Silvermane]]. The role of the [[antagonist]]'s between these villains in the series shifts and changes as the series progresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man summary|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/specspidey/|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and concept==
{{quote box|width=33%|quote=We're retooling and redesigning things for 
the modern day but we want the characters to still be iconic. We want you to see 
our updated version of the Vulture and still say &quot; yep, that's  the Vulture&quot;Âand 
&quot;yeah, that's the Green Goblin.&quot;Â It's a contemporary version but the changes 
aren't there just for the sake of making changes. It's still true to what Lee, 
Ditko and Romita did.|source=[[Greg Weisman]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisman interview&quot;/&gt;}}
As story editor, [[Greg Weisman]] approached the character by going and buying the first seven  volumes of ''The Essential Spider-Man'' and reread them. The creator [[Greg Weisman]] originally grew up on  [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Romita Sr.]] and When the creators [[Greg Weisman]] created the characters and he later went back and read the original Stan Lee, [[Steve Ditko]] stories. He then re-read them and took copious notes and tried to get the voice of those early stories. He then put  his own spin on some of the origins and the costume designs. He wanted to create something that was coherent, cohesive, contemporary and classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisman interview&quot;/&gt;
Greg Weisman stated: {{blockquote| &quot;Peterâs life has a lot of interesting characters and we wanted to bring them in -- the important ones and the most obscure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisman interview&quot;/&gt;}} 
Because Sally Avril's character was later developed in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man'' the creators used her. In Season 2, he used Bernard Houseman from the movie. The creators didn't want to wait several seasons to bring in [[Gwen Stacy]] or [[Harry Osborn]] or [[Mary Jane Watson]]. The creators didn't meet those characters in comics until Peter was in college. The creators wanted to stay true to it and ask, &quot;What kind of guy would Harry Osborn have been back in high school?&quot; Greg Weisman stated that &quot;It doesnât mean taking his college character and just sticking it in high school, it means extrapolating what he may have been like back then. Same thing with Gwen Stacy, and later with Mary Jane. We included those characters because they meant a lot in Peterâs life and were iconic.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Weisman interview&quot;/&gt;
As for having guest stars in the show, the creators didn't want the show to be guest star of the week.  The creators felt that if they started bringing people in too early, viewers would keep asking âwell, whoâs gonna show up next?â and it would be a distraction from their main characters who are so interesting. Greg Weisman stated:
{{blockquote|The Marvel Universe was basically built on the fly. Since weâre starting this cartoon from scratch, we have the luxury of building a more cohesive universe from day one because we know where weâre going to go with these characters and whoâs going to come later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weisman interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/08/19/interview-greg-weisman-on-the-spectacular-spider-man-animated-series/|publisher=comixmix.com|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The characters that the creators decided to put on the show came from some kind of source and were never intended to be original characters. The characters either came from the mainstream comics, the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' comics or in the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' films]].&lt;ref name=source&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man's Past and Future|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/884/884897p3.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the characters the characters had to do some conflating with their introductions. They didn't want to wait to have Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson when Peter got out of high school (like in the comics) so they introduced them in high school and try to figure what they would have been like in high school instead.&lt;ref name=Midtown&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man Past and Future part 4|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/884/884897p4.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=8 March  2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I felt that I always identified with him. Spider-Man is awesome. I definitely was a huge Spider-Man fan growing up and still am.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Spidey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Josh Keaton speaks for Spidey|url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=21793|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before he was chosen for Spider-Man, he auditioned for the role of Harry Osborn and Eddie Brock as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spidey&quot;/&gt;

'''Gwen Stacy''': (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]) Gwen is the [[deuteragonist]] and is the main [[love interest]] of Peter Parker in the show. Gwen is the daughter of police captain George Stacy, and is one of Peter Parker's best friends and intellectual equal. Although initially fairly shy and unconcerned with her appearance, she gradually evolves into a more confident and attractive character more closely resembling her comic book counterpart. She is always supportive of Peter. Although she is Peter's best friend, her weakness is that she has a colossal crush on Peter.&lt;ref name=&quot;XD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man website at Disney Xd|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyxd/shows/spectacularspiderman/#/disneyxd/shows/spectacularspiderman/|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Osborn===
{{Main|Harry Osborn}}
'''Harry Osborn''': (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]) Harry is portrayed as Peter's best friend and is the son of industrialist [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]. He constantly lives in his father's shadow and considers Peter a good friend, though at times also resents him for earning Norman's respect, which Harry has never been able to do. Being ignored by his father and overprotective of his mother and just like Peter, he is an unpopular kid at school. With his lack of approval he is prone to do anything to get it.&lt;ref name=&quot;XD&quot;/&gt;

===J. Jonah Jameson===
{{Main|J. Jonah Jameson}}
'''[[J. Jonah Jameson]]''': (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) Jameson is portrayed as a loudmouth, egotistical publisher and editor of the [[Daily Bugle]], a major tabloid newspaper. Showing excessive pride in his son, [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], he is obsessed with exposing fraudulent claims to heroism, and is therefore always demanding pictures of Spider-Man so that he can continue his smear campaign against the vigilante. Even though he loves to sell newspapers of Spider-Man he feels that the real heroes are ones that have nothing to hide such as his son, John Jameson. And will do anything to get him on the spotlight instead of Spider-Man.&lt;ref name=&quot;XD&quot;/&gt;

===Mary Jane Watson===
{{Main|Mary Jane Watson}}
'''Mary Jane Watson''': (voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Jane&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=vanessa-marshall-brings-mary-jane-watson-to-life|url=http://www.majorspoilers.com/vanessa-marshall-brings-mary-jane-watson-to-life|publisher=majorspoilers.com|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Mary Jane is portrayed as the niece of Aunt May's friend, Anna Watson. She attends the Fall Formal as Peter's date before ultimately switching schools to be at Midtown. Mary Jane befriends Peter and Gwen, and is initially determined to stay single, desiring to be a 'free agent'. Vanessa Marshall, the voice of the character states &quot;I always make sure my choices for Mary Jane are that of an independent thinker, that sheâs not concerned with what the people around her think, which is an uncommon trait in teenage girls, Thereâs a distinct confidence about her that I try to emulate.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Jane&quot;/&gt; She also explained about the character she played &quot;Mary Janeâs character is incredibly complex, Her strength plays a major part in Peterâs growth and maturation she really keeps him on the straight and narrow. Even though our characters are still only in high school during this cartoon, and youâre not going to get a lot of that character development at this point of the series, I know itâs going to be there in the future and so that has an effect on how I play her now.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Mary Jane&quot;/&gt;

===Flash Thompson===
{{Main|Flash Thompson}}
'''Flash Thompson''': (voiced by [[Joshua LeBar]]&lt;ref name=&quot;toonzone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Joshua Lebar|url=http://marvel.toonzone.net/specspidey/interviews/lebar/|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Flash is a star football player at Midtown High. While he idolizes Spider-Man, he frequently bullies and harasses Peter Parker, believing him to be a &quot;stuck-up egghead,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

He's a dichotomy â he's got a few different sides, and he surprises people. I was both a theatre guy and a football guy in high school, and people tried to stick me into that one-note category, depending on how they knew me â and I didn't like being stereotyped. So when the (Spider-Man) show gives me
the opportunity to represent his other sides, like this week when you see Flash's compassion rather than just all that testosterone, I really enjoy showcasing that part of his character because I can relate to his situation.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;toonzone&quot;/&gt;

===Liz Allan===

He is open-minded, believing in Spider-Man when others like J. Jonah Jameson dismiss his vigilante activities.

*'''[[Tombstone (comics)|L. Thompson Lincoln / Tombstone / Big Man]]''': (voiced by [[Keith David]] and then [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) As one of the lead antagonist's of the series, L. Thompson Lincoln is believed by Spider-Man to be the true identity of the &quot;Big Man,&quot; though he says he's gone by many names, his favorite being Tombstone. Tombstone is one of the few villains to best Spider-Man in a fight. He is made to be a replace to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] which they could not use due to [[copyright]] issues.
*'''[[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]''': (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) Hammerhead was originally Tombstone's second in command, and organized much of the mysterious Big Man's criminal empire, providing its face (and more frequently, muscle) in its various dealings. It was through Hammerhead that the Big Man made a deal with Norman Osborn to continue making supervillains so Spider-Man would be too distracted to stop the Big Man's operations. He also once worked for Silvermane, and had a relationship with his daughter, Sable.
*'''[[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] / [[New Enforcers]]''': Tombstone employed the Enforcers to take care of Spider-Man. Among its members are:
**'''[[Montana (comics)|Montana]] / [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]]''': (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) Montana is the field leader of the Enforcers and is a trained mercenary. Despite his criminal activities, he is very much a professional, having no personal grudge with Spider-Man, just considering it his responsibility to bring him down. He speaks with a southern accent and enjoys wearing a cowboy hat when out of uniform. For Greg Weisman, the decision to make Montana the Shocker instead of Herman Schultz like in the comics is because he wanted to go with something that has an iconic feel for it. He stated that &quot;we are trying to create something that is the three C's: Coherent, cohesive and contemporary. And yet, still, the fourth C: Classic.&quot; Greg looked carefully at the fictional character and said, &quot;Who is this guy? What is it that's iconic about Shocker? What is it that really matters?&quot; And according to Weisman it was the powers, the suit, the relationship with Spider-Man. And he and the creators felt that the identity of Herman Schultz didn't have that. He stated that &quot;he's not Otto Octavius and he sure as hell ain't Norman Osborn&quot;. He also stated that he is speaking &quot;as a fan, not just a producer&quot; and that he &quot;felt that tying that in with the Enforcers and with Montana worked better for the show&quot;.&lt;ref name=Shocker&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man Past and Future part one|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/884/884897p1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Vulture (comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]]''': (voiced by [[Robert Englund]]) Adrian Toomes is an elderly scientist tricked by Norman Osborn to reveal his plans for flying technology, not knowing that Osborn was planning on stealing his invention and blaming his friend Octavius until he learns the truth.

*'''[[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Max Dillon / Electro]]''': (voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mania.com/crispin-freeman-charges-up-spiderman-electro_article_90758.html Crispin Freeman as Electro]&lt;/ref&gt;) Maxwell Dillon was a young 20 year old electrician and a friend of Dr. Curt Connors until he suffered a terrible accident which transformed him into the supervillain Electro.

*'''[[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko / Sandman]]''': (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) Flint Marko is introduced as a petty crook, seen working alongside Alex O'Hirn under the Big Man. He is then transformed into the supervillain Sandman by Norman Osborn after the Big Man wanted supervillains to distract Spider-Man. Unlike his partner O'Hirn, Marko's motivation remained solely to seek out money despite Spider-Man's constant foilings, referring to his eventual goal as getting his &quot;big score.&quot;
*'''[[Rhino (comics)|Alex O'Hirn / Rhino]]''': (voiced by [[Clancy Brown]]) At first Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; O'Hirn is just a petty crook, seen working with Flint Marko under orders of the Big Man. He is captured by Spider-Man with ease times and time again, which increases his annoyance and hatred of Spider-Man. Just like his partner he was experimented by Norman Osborn after the Big Man wanted supervillains to distract Spider-Man. Unlike his partner though, money is a secondary interest to him, his primary one being revenge. And with Rhino's titanium suit, he got superhuman strength.
*'''[[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus / Master Planner]]''': (voiced by [[Peter MacNicol]]) Dr. Octavius is a research scientist working under Norman Osborn at OsCorp. He is very timid and willing to apologize for every little thing, a direct contrast to his boss, Norman. He is one of OsCorp's most intelligent scientists and the creator of a four armed harness that makes him able to do dangerous experiments, playing a part in the creation of Sandman and Rhino. Eventually, as the result of a devastating accident (orchestrated by the Green Goblin), his arms became permanently fused to his back and he was driven out of his mind, becoming the vengeful Dr. Octopus. In season two he is revealed to be the &quot;Master Planner&quot;.
*'''[[Chameleon (comics)|Dmitri Smerdyakov / Chameleon]]''': (voiced by [[Steven Blum]]) The Chameleon is an international spy-for-hire, master of disguise and a former [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] agent.

But while Peter had May and Ben Parker to act as his legal guardians, Eddie did not have anyone to take him in. Because of this he has always carried an envious subconscious hatred towards Peter for being able to live an easier life. However, he has repressed this attitude over the years by acting as a friend and mentor to Peter, often calling him &quot;Bro&quot;. As the series progresses, Eddie develops animosity towards Peter due to a series of misunderstandings, often involving photographs Peter had taken while secretly disguised as Spider-Man. This ultimately damages their friendship. In the series Spider-Man finds himself merged with an alien [[symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] . Spider-Man eventually manages to separate from the symbiote after revealing it's true intentions. The symbyote then subsequently bonds with Eddie, revealing to him Spider-Man's identity as Peter Parker making him the first and only person in the series to figure out his secret identity. Together, they formed the creature known as &quot;Venom&quot;.

*'''[[Kraven the Hunter|Sergei Kravinoff / Kraven the Hunter]]''': (voiced by Eric Vesbit) Determined to hunt Spider-Man, Kravinoff first appeared in the season 2 episode &quot;Destructive Testing&quot;, garbed in a lion-themed vest similar to his original comic book counterpart. He is the most skilled hunter in the known world, relying only on his natural talents to subdue his prey. Using a serum concocted from Warren's own research (and based on Curt Connors' own Lizard formula), he is then mutated into a human-feline hybrid, with elements of leopard, cheetah, and lion DNA calling himself &quot;Kraven the Hunter&quot; much like his Ultimate comic book counterpart.
*'''[[Silver Sable|Sable Manfredi / Silver Sable]]''': (voiced by [[Nikki Cox]]) Sable Manfredi is the daughter of Silvio Manfredi, the crime lord known as Silvermane, and takes the name of Silver Sable. She was once in a relationship with Hammerhead, when he used to work for her father.

==Reception==
Goldman wrote that Electro's redesigned costume retained &quot;some nice visual nods to the Electro many of us grew up with.&quot; Liz Allan's characterization, though, he found confusing, with the character's accent and background unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/866/866979p1.html|title=Interactions Review|author=Goldman, Eric|publisher=IGN|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman also praised the Lizard's design, calling it &quot;the most visually familiar villain the show had introduced yet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/866/866991p1.html|title=Spectacular Spider-Man: &quot;Natural Selection&quot; Review|work=IGN|author=Goldman, Eric|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman enjoyed the design of Shocker which he felt stayed true to his original design and was &quot;intrigued&quot; by changing his secret identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/866/866993p1.html|title=Market Forces Review|author=Goldman, Eric|accessdate=2009-08-21|work=[[IGN]]|date=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldman also praised the unveiling of Tombstone and Mary Jane Watson.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/866/866469p1.html|title=&quot;The Invisible Hand&quot; Review|author=Goldman, Eric|date=2008-08-14|accessdate=2009-09-25|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman gave a mixed response about Green Goblin â noting that he is &quot;perhaps a bit hyper sensitive on how he's portrayed&quot; â considering the design, while similar to the comics, be more of an exact version of it; Goldman considered the character's personality was &quot;a bit too evocative of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]],&quot; the iconic villain from [[DC Comics|DC]]'s [[Batman]] comics, but believed that his &quot;malice side&quot; worked. Goldman also praised Mary Jane Watson for being &quot;much like [[Stan Lee]] created her â a quick witted, fun loving girl.&quot; He also applauded the mysterious factors of Green Goblin's true identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/870/870143p1.html|title=&quot;Catalysts&quot; Review|work=[[IGN]]|author=Goldman, Eric|date=2008-04-28|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman opted that Jonah's hatred of Spider-Man that was formed in the episode was &quot;perhaps the most understandable and best way it's ever been portrayed before.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ign5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/873/873281p1.html|title=&quot;The Uncertainty Principle&quot; Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=Goldman, Eric|date=2008-05-12|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Season Elliot, senior editor of ''iF Magazine,'' wrote &quot;The Lizard himself was a nice update of the original Lizard and he was still in his torn pants, shirt, and lab coat.&quot; Elliot praised the design for differentiating itself from that used for ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' or ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]],'' and that he &quot;can't wait for the action figure of this guy!&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;If&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2388|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man: Season One - 'Natural Selection'|work=iF Magazine|author=Elliot, Sean|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2009-08-21}} &lt;!--{{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated &quot;Even the Shocker was more interesting on this show, so I continue to have high hopes for future episodes, characters, and villains.&quot; When talking about the change of Shocker's secret identity, he quoted that it &quot;saves the writers from having to come up with a completely different origin for a character that pretty much is a second tier villain anyways.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;If2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2411|title=The Spectacular Spider-Man - Season One - 'Market Forces'|work=iF Magazine|author=Elliot, Sean|accessdate=2009-08-21|date=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}--&gt;  Elliot was &quot;pleased&quot; with the portrayal of Rhino as an unintelligent brute; he also enjoyed the change of the &quot;Big Man's&quot; identity from that of the comics - where he was a ''Bugle'' reporter named Frederic Foswell - and found it humorous to have Foswell be the reporter to tell Peter who the &quot;Big Man&quot; is rumored to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:Z_Bez_3wlXsJ:www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp%3Farticle%3D2460+The+Invisible+Hand+The+Spectacular+Spider-Man+iF+Magazine&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=1|archivedate=2009-10-24|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2460|title=Review: The Spectacular Spider-Man - Season 1 - 'The Invisible Hand'|author=Elliot, Sean|date=2008-04-17|accessdate=2009-10-24|work=iF Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;if3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2485|archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache:fdfIyssmcGoJ:www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp%3Farticle%3D2485+Catalysts+The+Spectacular+Spider-Man&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=1|archivedate=2009-11-29|title=Review: The Spectacular Spider-Man - Season One - 'Catalysts'|author=Elliot, Sean|date=2008-04-30|work=iF Magazine|accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to Goldman,&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;/&gt; Elliot applauded the mystery of Goblin's true identity, which he described as a &quot;bait and switch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;if3&quot;/&gt; 

Rob M.
