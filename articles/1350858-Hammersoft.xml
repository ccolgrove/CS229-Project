'''Charles Thomson''' (born 6 February 1953) is an English [[artist]], [[Painting|painter]], poet and [[photographer]]. In the early 1980s he was a member of [[The Medway Poets]]. In 1999 he named and co-founded the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] art movement with [[Billy Childish]]. He has curated Stuckist shows, organised demonstrations against the [[Turner Prize]], run an art gallery, stood for parliament and reported [[Charles Saatchi]] to the [[Office of Fair Trading|OFT]]. He is frequently quoted in the media as an opponent of [[conceptual art]]. He was briefly married to artist [[Stella Vine]].

==Early life==
Charles Thomson was born in [[Romford]], [[London Borough of Havering]], East London, England, and educated at [[Brentwood School (Brentwood, England)|Brentwood School]], [[Essex]], where he was class mates with [[Douglas Adams]]. While still at school he organised mixed media arts events and contributed to ''Broadsheet'', a magazine edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]] and published by ''Artsphere'', a school arts group.&lt;ref&gt;''Broadsheet'', n.d., edited Paul Johnstone, Artsphere&lt;/ref&gt; Outside school, he started the [[London Borough of Havering|Havering]] Arts Lab. this resulted in a headline &quot;Sex Orgy Tale&amp;mdash;Group Banned&quot; in the local ''Havering Express'' newspaper. In 1971 he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Dwarf candidate in the Havering council elections, and was involved in anti-pollution protests. He distributed &quot;[[Underground press|underground]]&quot; magazines around London, including &quot;Schoolkids [[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]&quot;. In 1975 he went to [[Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design|Maidstone College of Art]], where he was the only person in ten years to fail the painting degree. 1979&amp;ndash;87 he worked part-time as a telephonist and receptionist at Kent County Ophthalmic and Aural Hospital. 1987&amp;ndash;99 he was a full-time poet, with work in over 100 anthologies.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;Milner, Frank, ed., ''The Stuckists Punk Victorian'', p.106, [[National Museums Liverpool]], 2004, ISBN 1-902700-27-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Medway Poets==
{{main|The Medway Poets}}

In 1979, Thomson was a founder member of [[The Medway Poets]], a punk performance group, who read in pubs, as well as the Kent Literature Festival and the 1981 international [[Cambridge Poetry Festival]]. There were, however, personality clashes in the group, particularly between [[Billy Childish]] and Thomson, who said, &quot;There was friction between us, especially when he started heckling my poetry reading and I threatened to ban him from a forthcoming TV documentary.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3ammagazine.com/artarchives/2002_dec/interview_charles_thomson.html Interview with Charles Thomson on 3ammagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a TV South documentary on the group in 1982 brought them to a wider regional audience.
According to Childish: &quot;Me &amp; Charles were at war from 1979 until 1999. He even threatened having bouncers on the doors of Medway poetâs readings to keep me out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trakmarx.com/2004_02/10_billy.htm &quot;Billy Childish on Stuckism&quot;, trakmarx.com] Accessed 9 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
Thomson has said this period was &quot;an incredibly pressured and creative time and established the basis on which we are still working.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artistica.co.uk/2006/01/29/interview-with-charles-thomson-of-the-stuckists/ Interview with Charles Thomson on artistica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Other members included future Stuckist artists [[Bill Lewis]] and [[Sexton Ming]]. [[Tracey Emin]], then a local student, was on the out skirts of the group, being the girlfriend of [[Billy Childish]]. In 1987 Thomson printed her first book of writing, ''Turkish Tales'', which had been edited by Lewis and was published by Childish.&lt;ref name=Milner8&gt;Milner p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stuckism==
{{main|Stuckism}}
[[Image:Charles Thomson. A Long Way From Greece.jpg|thumb|''A Long Way from Greece'']]
In 1999 Thomson was reconciled with Childish and together they founded the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] art group with eleven other artists. Thomson coined the name &quot;Stuckism&quot; after an insult from [[Tracey Emin]] to ex-boyfriend Childish that he was &quot;stuck&quot;, which Childish had recorded in a 1993 poem. The group stated its aims as promoting [[figurative painting]] and opposing conceptual art, being particularly critical of the [[Turner Prize]] and [[Charles Saatchi]]'s promotion of [[Young British Artists|Britart]]. Childish left the group in 2001 and Thomson remained as the figurehead, gaining extensive media coverage for his activities and outspoken views. In the meantime the Stuckists grew to a worldwide movement of over 100 groups in 30 countries.

2000-5 he staged yearly Stuckist demonstrations  against the [[Turner Prize]] (making use of props such as clown costumes and blow-up sex dolls). He stood in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]], as a Stuckist candidate against the then-[[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]], [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]]. The same year he exhibited the then-unknown artist, [[Stella Vine]] (later made famous by [[Charles Saatchi]]). The couple married in New York and separated after two months. 

[[Image:Stuckism International Gallery 2004.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stuckism International Gallery]], Shoreditch, London.]]
Thomson opened the Stuckism International Gallery in [[Shoreditch]] (2002â2005). In 2004 he reported Saatchi to the [[Office of Fair Trading|OFT]] (Office of Fair Trading) for alleged unfair trading practices in the art world: the complaint was not upheld. He co-curated the Stuckists' first major exhibition in a public gallery, [[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]] show at the [[Walker Art Gallery]], for the 2004 [[Liverpool Biennial]]. In 2005 he offered of a donation of 175 paintings by Stuckists artists from the Walker Gallery show to the [[Tate Gallery]]: this was rejected by the trustees. Later that year he obtained Tate Gallery minutes about the purchase of a trustee [[Chris Ofili]]'s work ''[[The Upper Room (paintings)|The Upper Room]]'' under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]]. This led to an ongoing press controversy about the purchase&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/Tate/OfiliPress.html &quot;Tate buys trustee Chris Ofili's work The Upper Room for Â£705,000: Press coverage&quot;] stuckism.com. Retrieved 16 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted into an official investigation by the [[Charity Commission]], who censured the Tate in July 2006 for acting outside its legal powers.&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya (2006)[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2275993_1,00.html &quot;Tate's Ofili purchase broke charity law&quot;] ''The Times'' online, 19 July 2006. Accessed 19 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006 he wrote to the British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] asking him to intervene in the case of Stuckist artist [[Michael Dickinson (artist)|Michael Dickinson]], who was facing a possible 3 year jail sentence in Turkey for exhibiting a satirical collage of the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan]].&lt;ref name=blairasked&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2220955,00.html &quot;Blair asked to help artist facing jail&quot;] ''The Sunday Times'' online, 11 June 2006.

Accessed 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, Thomson exhibited paintings and presented an academic paper in both the [[Triumph of Stuckism]] exhibition and symposium respectively . Both these events were organised by [[Naive John]] for the 2006 Liverpool Biennial at the invitation of Professor Colin Fallows, Chair of Contextual Studies at [[Liverpool John Moores University|Liverpool School of Art and Design]].

He writes a regular arts column for [[3:AM Magazine]], which carries work by a number of Stuckists, ex-Stuckists and their opponents.

{{main|Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision}}

His satirical painting of Sir Nicholas Serota, ''[[Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision]]'', has been widely reproduced in the media and become a Stuckist icon. It has been reviewed:
{{cquote|Thomson has painted what must be the masterpiece of Stuckism so far: ''Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision''.

However, [[Sarah Kent]] (a staunch advocate of Britart) was less impressed with the satire: &quot;One might forgive his puerile humour if Thomson didn't consider it a serious weapon ... cut the ranting and Thomson could be a reasonable painter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Sarah (2002) [http://www.stuckism.com/zPressText/5TimeOut5.8.02.html &quot;The Stuckists: Stuckism International] ''Time Out'', 7 August 2002.

Thomson pointed out in response, &quot;it's reality. A few weeks after I did the painting, Tracey Emin was shown on TV getting very angry about an installation because someone had substituted another pair of knickers for hers ... That makes it a bit sad.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/presscuttings.html#SarahKent &quot;Sarah Kent of Time Out Rants&quot;] stuckism.com 7 August 2002.

In October 2006, Thomson's painting of Serota was exhibited during the Stuckists' ''[[Go West (exhibition)|Go West]]'' show at [[Spectrum London]] gallery in London. It was suggested that this could be seen as revenge for the Tate's rejection of a Stuckist donation of 175 paintings the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Teodorczuk, Tom (2006) [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23364213-details/Modern+art+is+pants/article.do &quot;Modern art is pants&quot;] ''Evening Standard'', 22 August 2006.

[[Image:Charles Thomson. I Feel Bad When I Reject Your Love.jpg|thumb|''I Feel Bad When I Reject Your Love'']]
Thomson typically paints figuratively with black outlines and areas of flat colour, often brightly coloured. The painting, ''I Feel Bad When I Reject Your Love'' is not typical in this respect. He said:
:Based on something a (now ex) girlfriend said to me. I thought it was a negative picture, but then I realised it was positive because itâs a reconciliation after self-knowledge. Itâs also ambiguous as to whoâs speaking. Most of my paintings are based on experiences with people I know, usually on a drawing from life, but in this case from a photo I took of her.&lt;ref name=Milner/&gt;

The paintings are based on spontaneous line drawings with a black wax crayon in a sketchbook. These are enlarged on the canvas. The colour is usually the first one on the canvas, though mixing it can take up to an hour. He likens colour to feeling and concludes, &quot;The final image is a synthesis of material, emotional and spiritual experience.&quot;&lt;ref name=Milner/&gt;
