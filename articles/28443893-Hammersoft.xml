This is a list of Saini recipients of military awards and decorations.

Sainis have a distinguished record as soldiers in the armies of pre-British princely states,  British India and independent India. Sainis fought in both the [[World Wars]] and won some of the highest [[military awards and decorations|gallantry awards]] for conspicuous bravery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross of St. George&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jemadar Gurmukh Singh Saini&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Subedar-Major Jagindar Singh OBI&quot;/&gt;  [[Subedar Joginder Singh]], who won [[Param Vir Chakra]], [[Indian Army]]'s highest war time gallantry award, in [[1962 India-China War]] was also a Saini of Sahnan sub clan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prof. Nanua&quot;/

The awards list given below is not exhaustive. Not all Sainis use their clan or  sub clan names and go by the last names such as 'Chaudhry', 'Singh', 'Kumar', etc. Since these names are shared by many other groups (some of which overlap Sainis) such as Sikhs, Jats, Dogras and Rajputs etc. , it is not possible to isolate Sainis among them just by their last names. The following list pertains only to those decorated soldiers and policemen who are confirmed to be Sainis. The actual list of decorated Saini army and police personnel might be much longer. More quality research is needed in this reference.

The following list contains only those soldiers and policemen who have received major wartime and peacetime awards. The list of Sainis in the Indian Army is very large and needs no inclusion here. Army and police have traditionally been major sources of employment for Sainis. British had classified Sainis as a 'martial race'. Purser recorded in a 1892 land settlement report that Sainis joined the military service quite frequently, especially as cavalrymen.&lt;ref name = &quot;Saini Cavalrymen&quot;&gt;''&quot;Men of this tribe not seldom take service especially in cavalry.&quot;'' Final report of the revised settlement of the Jullundur District in the Punjab, pp 84, W.E. Purser, BCS, THE &quot;CIVIL AND MILITARY GAZETTE&quot; PRESS, Contractors to the Punjab Government, Lahore, 1892&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;2nd Punjab&quot;&gt;''&quot;The chief areas for Saini recruitment were the Ambala, Hoshiarpur, and Jullundur Districts. &quot;,'' The Golden Galley: the story of the Second Punjab Regiment, 1761-1947, pp 313, Sir Geoffrey Betham, Herbert Valentine Rupert Geary, printed for the 2d Punjab Regiment Officers ÌAssociation at the University Press, by C. Batey, printer to the university, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

Another fact that needs to be understood is the comparison of Sainis with Dogras, Pushtuns, Jats and Rajputs is not an apples to apples comparison. Sainis are merely a sub tribe of Yaduvanshi Kshatriyas (or Jadon Rajputs) who took to agriculture in Punjab and spun off with a distinct identity local predominantly to Punjab and it's bordering region. Their numbers are relatively very small compared with these groups. For example, according to the 1881 census, the entire Saini population in the whole of undivided Punjab, also all of pre-partition India for that matter, was only 132,000 while the population of just a single Jat clan of Sidhus was 208,000. The Saini population was reduced to 106,000 according to the 1901 census after mistakes of the 1881 census were corrected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Census 1901&quot;&gt;Census of India, 1901, pp 50,  By India Census Commissioner, Edward Albert Gait, Published by Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, India, 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1881 Census, there were only 132,000 Sainis in Punjab, but Sidhus, a Jat tribe, numbered 208,000.&quot; Peasant Communities of Punjab ,By Kulwant Singh Virk [http://www.ksvirk.in/english/thepeasant.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to gauge proportionate Saini  contribution to feats of gallantry in armed forces would be by comparing them individually with other Rajput sub tribes such as Bhati, Chauhan, Sisodia, etc. rather than Rajputs, Jats, or Dogras which are extremely large and heterogeneous when compared to Sainis.

==Known Gallantry Awards==
During British India (World War I)&lt;ref&gt;''Note: In addition to these Wing Commander Kartar Singh Taunque was the first personnel of Indian Airforce to win a gallantry award as part of Royal Indian Airforce. The Chakra class of gallantry awards did not yet exist as Taunque won this award in 1938 during World War II before the independence of India. More information is required for the gallantry awards won by Sainis during both the World Wars.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorated Saini policemen==
''Gallantry medal'' is the most prestigious award for any police officer in the country. It is awarded for displaying conspicuous gallantry, courage and devotion to duty of very high order. The police officer keeps the duty before self in completing the task. This award is rare in itself as the action should match the risk involved on the occasion. The senior controlling officer assessing the task performed by the subordinate recommends to the head of the police department for the award of a gallantry medal.
