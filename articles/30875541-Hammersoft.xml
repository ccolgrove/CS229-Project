'''Bukit Bintang Boys Secondary School (BBBSS)''', or BB, was established in 1958, one year after Malaysia achieved independence in 1957; making it one of the oldest secondary boys school in the city of [[Petaling Jaya]], [[Selangor]]; [[Malaysia]]. It is a mission school under the umbrella of [[Christian Brethren of Malaysia Property Trust]] but is administered by the government under the grant-in-aid system.

The school holds 2 school sessions. The morning session is for Form 3, Form 4, Form 5 and Form 6 students (ages 15 to 19) while the afternoon session is for Form 1 and Form 2 students (ages 13 to 14). This is so to accommodate the large number of students attending the school. The pupils are known &quot;BBians&quot;. It welcomes students from all races and religions. Although a boys' school, girls are permitted to attend the school at the Form 6 level (age 18 to 19).

==History==

The school was founded by Miss Mary Glasgow,&lt;ref&gt;[http://3people.org/bbbssoba/?page_id=96 Mary Glasgow - school founder]&lt;/ref&gt; who was the headmistress of [[Bukit Bintang Girls' School]] (BBGS); in the time when missionaries were involved in establishing educational institutions in the young country.

The municipal council, Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya ([[MPPJ]]) (now named Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya, [[MBPJ]]); allocated a piece of land to Glasgow for building a school for the community. Although the land was available, no money was provided to actually build it. Glasgow and the Bukit Bintang Girls' School students swung into action; raising money by holding fun fairs, food fairs and plays. Within a short time, the girls had raised enough to build the boys' school. Miss Yeoh Kim Eng (a retired teacher of BBGS) recounted the time when BBGS teachers and students, armed with buckets and bins, came to the newly built boys' school to wash and clean the building.

At its establishment, [[The Malay Mail]], a local daily, called it the brother school of Bukit Bintang Girls' School. After deliberation with teachers and advisers to name the new school, Glasgow named it Bukit Bintang Boys' Secondary School in connection to the girls' school Glasgow founded.

As a young nation in 1957-58, the Malaysian government welcomed help from all quarters to build schools and to give its citizens an education. Christian missionaries such as Glasgow opened &quot;Christian&quot; schools in the early 1960s, usually in the rural areas. They either bought land or were granted land in outskirt areas (often rural, undeveloped areas) and were left to their own ingenuity to develop and build their schools. Although the schools were started by missionaries, the curriculum was based on government guidelines and was usually non-religious, although Bible studies were encouraged. Initially, classes were taught in English but has since changed to Bahasa Melayu in line with the government directives. Since 2003, Science and Mathematics are being taught in English.

The school's first Principal (known as the [[Headmaster]]) was Mr. Alastair L. McGregor (now Doctor) from [[Scotland]]. He served the school from 1958 to 1966. He was only a young man of 28 when he accepted the challenge to run a school halfway round the world from his home in Scotland, United Kingdom.

In 1961, the secondary school was moved to its current location in Jalan Utara, Petaling Jaya; and at that time, each form (Form 1 to 5) consisted of only one class. A year later in 1962 - the year when the first group of students sat for the Cambridge Examination, the school's opening ceremony took place and McGregor was appointed the first headmaster.

In 1976, a new science block was built at the cost of RM200,000.00. This block consists of three science laboratories and a lecture theatre. This block was named 'The Boler Block' in honour of Mr. David Boler, the headmaster at the time. Funds to build new wings were mostly raised by the students and teachers. Help was also given by certain Christian associations.

In 2006, [[Bukit Bintang Girls' School]] moved to a new location in Cheras and did not retain its original name; it is now known as SMK Seri Bintang Utara. The Pavilion shopping centre was built over the old location.

===50th Anniversary===
[[File:WHZhang's Bukit Bintang (50th Shirt).jpg|200px|thumb|50th Anniversary T-shirt]]
In 2008, the school celebrated her 50th anniversary (Golden Jubilee). Tan Sri [[Musa Hassan]], Malaysia's Inspector-General of Police, a BB alumnus, was the guest of honour.

A special 50th Anniversary T-shirt was released and sold by the school Co-operative.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both&quot; /&gt;

==School identity==

The school motto is the Latin phrase: ''Nisi Dominus Frustra'' â 'Without God All is Vanity'; and is derived from Psalm 127:1.

The school vision is &quot;To Be The Best in Petaling Jaya by 2015&quot;.

The school mission is &quot;To develop a world-class quality education system which will realisethe full potential of the individual and fulfill the aspiration of the Malaysian nation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.my/?id=42&amp;lang=en Ministry of Education Malaysia Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The school badge and tie===

The second headmaster, Mr. David Boler (1966â1978) designed a new school badge when he replaced Mr. McGregor. The top left hand corner of the badge depicts hills which stands for 'Bukit' followed by the top right hand corner which shows a star which stands for 'Bintang', a [[Malay language|Malay]] word meaning [[star]]. The bottom left hand corner indicates the national flower 'Bunga Raya' ([[Hibiscus]]) and thus represents '[[Malaysia]].' Finally, the last portion of the badge with the design of a roof above the letters 'P.J.' means that the school is situated in Petaling Jaya. The shape that resembles a gear below the letters 'P.J.' symbolises that [[Petaling Jaya]] is an industrialised area. Mr. Boler also redesigned the school tie by adding the design of the school badge on to the plain olive green tie.

===The school song===

The school song was written by Dr McGregor. Dr McGregor wrote the song in English originally but it has been translated to [[Malay language|Bahasa]]. Students today sing both versions during school assembly and events.

'''English version of School Song'''

BBBS ever,&lt;br /&gt;
We would pledge to thee.&lt;br /&gt;
All our high endeavour,&lt;br /&gt;
With all our loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;
May thy star grow brighter,&lt;br /&gt;
May thy fame increase,&lt;br /&gt;
May this glorious chorus never, never cease.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here we strive for honour,&lt;br /&gt;
Here we seek for truth,&lt;br /&gt;
Learn to help the weaker,&lt;br /&gt;
With the strength of our youth.&lt;br /&gt;
Of the highest wisdom,&lt;br /&gt;
Let our watchword be,&lt;br /&gt;
Without God before us all is vanity.

'''Bahasa version of School Song'''

BBBS Jaya,&lt;br /&gt;
Kami ikrar setia,&lt;br /&gt;
Segala tenaga,&lt;br /&gt;
Kami curah untukmu,&lt;br /&gt;
Sinarlah cahayamu,&lt;br /&gt;
Terang cemerlang&lt;br /&gt;
Biarlah lagu ini kekal abadi 

Kami tuntut bahagia,&lt;br /&gt;
Serta kebenaran&lt;br /&gt;
Membantu yang lemah,&lt;br /&gt;
Kami akan usaha&lt;br /&gt;
Dengan bijaksana,&lt;br /&gt;
Itulah cogan,&lt;br /&gt;
Tanpa restu Tuhan semua akan gagal.

===School magazine===

The school magazine is named &quot;The Bintang&quot;. Students and teachers contribute most of the featured articles. The magazine reports the school's activities for the year, club activities, official school functions, news about teachers and students etc. Also, there  are photos of students and co-curricular bodies.

===Old Boys' Association===

Some of the former students, commonly referred to as âEx-BBiansâ; who have left BBBSS have banded together in the group called the Old Boys' Association, or the OBA.

==Infrastructures==

In 2006, air-conditioner units were installed in the Staff Room, as there were none existing earlier. Not only that, a PA system was set up around the school in the same year. The old toilet next to the Quartermaster Room was renovated into the current PBSM Room, sometimes used also by the dental checkup team from outside the school. The Science Labs were also renovated from  wooden tables to concrete tables.

Also in 2006, a covered walkway was built, extending from a newly built waiting shed in front of the school to the front of Boler's Block. In 2010, another covered walkway was built, covering the area between the classes and the Dewan Lama (now named Dewan Dr. Alastair McGregor, commonly referred to as Dewan McGregor). This area has been cleared and paved with bricks.

In 2007, the school Co-operative was formed, named &quot;Koperasi Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Laki-laki Bukit Bintang Berhad&quot;. The original business centre was set up at the previous counseling room. In 2008, it was moved to the room behind the Canteen Area (earlier the Music Room). The shareholders of the Co-operative are students and teachers. The products sold are mostly stationery and books, but now have included buns and ice-cream. After the Government announced that free textbooks would be given to all students, the Co-operative took over the role of school bookshop.

In 2008, the road from the main gate to the squash complex was tarred. A new Computer Laboratory was made in the same year, with 30 computers that were donated by the public. The Computer Lab had earlier occupied the Auditorium, now occupy the room which was formerly the Snooker Room.{{-}}

A new Teacher's Cafe, a lounge for Teachers; unveiled on Graduation Day in August 2009, with the presence of Madam Sharon Kang, the main sponsor. Other than that, a new wall was built around the Squash Complex. Towards the end of the school year, with contributions from an ex-BBian, a gymnasium was installed in one of the Squash Complex classes.

In 2010, the old wiring system of the school was rewired. 7 new air-conditioners were installed in the Dewan McGregor. The stairs from the front of the Badminton Hall to the Canteen were upgraded. So were the stairs from the Canteen to the field . The old toilet near the Dewan McGregor and classes, that was closed for a long time; had been renovated into a storeroom.

In 2011, the auditorium was renovated. The carpet flooring was removed and replaced with wooden flooring.

===Largest squash court complex in Petaling Jaya===

In 1985, a project to construct a new canteen and a gymnasium cum squash courts was completed at a cost nearly half a million Ringgit. Students, teachers and parents raised funds over five years from 1981 to 1985. Fund-raising projects such as &quot;Jog-a-thon&quot;, Canteen Day and School Fun Fair were conducted during the period. Upon its completion, it had the largest squash court facilities in Petaling Jaya. The old canteen was used as a temporary classroom to accommodate the increasing number of students but was eventually demolished. The new double storey block housed a hall upstairs and canteen downstairs. The new school hall also doubled as badminton courts. The batch of students sitting for their 1985 [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia|SPM]] examinations took their examinations in the new hall. Members of the public can rent the squash courts and the badminton hall for their private usage. The squash complex has played host and even moonlighted as a venue for various international tournaments, prominently the Milo All Stars Junior Squash Championship, in which it partners with the MBPJ Squash Complex.
