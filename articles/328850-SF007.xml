The '''vitreous humour''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|UK spelling]]) or '''vitreous humor''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|US spelling]]) is the clear [[gel]] that fills the space between the [[Lens (vision)|lens]] and the [[retina]] of the [[human eye|eyeball]] of humans and other [[vertebrate]]s. It is often referred to as the '''vitreous body''' or simply &quot;the vitreous&quot;.

== Composition, properties and function ==

The vitreous is the transparent, colourless, gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the [[cornea]], but contains very few cells (mostly [[phagocytes]] which remove unwanted cellular debris in the [[visual field]], as well as the [[hyalocytes of Balazs]] of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the [[hyaluronic acid]]), no blood vessels, and 98-99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of [[collagen]] type II fibres with the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronic acid, and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts.  Amazingly, with so little solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.  The lens, on the other hand, is tightly packed with cells.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica from [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the vitreous has a [[viscosity]] two to four times that of pure water, giving it a gelatinous consistency. It also has a [[refractive index]] of 1.336.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retina.anatomy.upenn.edu/~lance/eye/humor_vitreous.html The Vitreous Humor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the vitreous is in contact with the [[retina]] and helps to keep it in place by pressing it against the [[choroid]], it does not adhere to the retina, except at the [[optic nerve disc]], AKA: papilla nervi optici (where the retina sends about 1.2 million nerve fibres (axons) to the brain). It is also connected to the [[Ora serrata]] (where the retina ends anteriorly), at the Wieger-band, the dorsal side of the lens. It is however, not connected at the [[macula]], the tiny spot in the retina which gives us our &quot;detail&quot; and central vision.

Unlike the fluid in the frontal parts of the eye ([[aqueous humour]]) which is continuously replenished, the gel in the vitreous chamber is stagnant. Therefore, if blood, cells or other byproducts of inflammation get into the vitreous, they will remain there unless removed surgically{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} (see [[floaters]]). If the vitreous pulls away from the retina, it is known as a [[vitreous detachment]]. As we age, the vitreous often liquefies and may collapse. This is more likely to occur, and occurs much earlier, in eyes that are [[nearsightedness|nearsighted]] (myopia). It can also occur after injuries to the eye or inflammation in the eye ([[uveitis]]).

== Pathology ==

The [[collagen]] fibres of the vitreous are held apart by electrical charges. With ageing, these charges tend to reduce, and the fibres may clump together. Similarly, the gel may liquefy, a condition known as [[syneresis (chemistry)|synaeresis]], allowing cells and other organic clusters to float freely within the vitreous humour. These allow [[floaters]] which are perceived in the visual field as spots or fibrous strands. Floaters are generally harmless, but the sudden onset of recurring floaters may signify a [[posterior vitreous detachment]] (PVD) or other diseases of the eye.

== Clinical significance ==

The metabolic exchange and equilibration between [[systemic circulation]] and vitreous humour is so slow that vitreous humour is sometimes the fluid of choice for [[postmortem]] analysis of [[glucose]] levels or substances which would be more rapidly diffused, degraded, excreted, or metabolized from the general circulation.
