Shelley was from [[Downey, California]].  He was first paired with Starbuck for a show in 1959, when they were very small children.  They started training seriously with coach [[John Nicks]] at the Arctic Blades FSC in 1961.  In their first year of senior competitions, when they were both 16 years old, they qualified to compete at the [[1968 Winter Olympics]].  Both Starbuck and Shelley attended Downey High School, where they performed off-ice lifts with the cheerleading squad&lt;ref name=&quot;gutsy&quot;&gt;&quot;A Gutsy, Gutsy Team / Starbuck &amp; Shelley&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, Jan 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Long Beach State College]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;JoJo and Ken&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, Dec 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1969, Shelley had a serious off-ice accident, crashing through a glass patio door at a party.  He had surgery to repair two severed tendons and spent 5 weeks in a cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutsy&quot;/&gt;

After retiring from competitive skating, Starbuck and Shelley skated in the [[Ice Capades]] and competed professionally. Shelley was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldskatingmuseum.org/Museum_HOF_Inductees.htm Official Site World Figure Skating Museum and Hall of Fame&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
