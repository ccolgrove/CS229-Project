'''York University''' ({{lang-fr|UniversitÃ© York}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is [[Canada]]'s third-largest university, Ontario's second-largest [[graduate school]], and Canada's leading interdisciplinary university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/web/about_yorku/ About York Universiy]&lt;/ref&gt;

York has a student population of approximately 51,000, 7,000 staff, and 250,000 alumni worldwide. It has ten faculties, including the [[Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies]], Faculty of Science and Engineering, [[Schulich School of Business]], [[Osgoode Hall Law School]], [[Glendon College]], the Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Fine Arts, the Faculty of Health, the [[Faculty of Environmental Studies]], and 24 research centres.

York University participates in the [[Canadian Space Program]]. The Faculty of Science and Engineering is Canada's primary research facility into Martian exploration and has designed several space research instruments and applications currently used by [[NASA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/mediar/archive/Release.asp?Release=1270 Experiment aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour].

==History==
[[File:YorkFaculty1961.jpg|thumb|right|York University Faculty, 1961]]
York University was established in 1959 as a non-denominational institution by the ''York University Act''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/documents/act1959.htm |title=York University Act, 1959 |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received [[Royal Assent]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] on 26 March of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=P. Anisef And J. Lennards |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242 |title=University |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first class was held on September 1960&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003753 York University]. The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; in Falconer Hall on the [[University of Toronto]] campus with a total of 76 students.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The governance was modeled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, [[Glendon College]], and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; It became independent in 1965 after an initial period of affiliation with the [[University of Toronto]] (U of T) under the ''York University Act'', 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/secretariat/documents/act1965.htm |title=York University Act, 1965 |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main campus in [[North York]] opened in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

Murray Ross, who continues to be honoured today at the University in several ways â including the [[Murray G. Ross Award]], was still vice-president of U of T when he approached to become York University's new president.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pound2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, York University was envisaged as a feeder campus to U of T, until Ross's powerful vision led it to become a completely separate institution.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Murray. ''The Way Must be Tried: Memoirs of a University Man''. Toronto: Stoddart Publishing Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the [[Keele Campus (York University)]], in [[North York]]. The [[Glendon College|Glendon]] campus became a [[bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] [[liberal arts college]] led by [[Escott Reid]], who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister [[Lester Pearson]], who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ycom/gazette/past/archive/031198.htm#gen3 |title=York University Gazette Online |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.library.yorku.ca/dspace/handle/123456789/701 |title=YorkSpace: Item 123456789/701 |publisher=Library.yorku.ca |date=1966-09-30 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Canadian undergraduate program in dance opened at York University in 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pound2005&quot; /&gt; The first Canadian PhD. program in Women's Studies opened with five candidates in January 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pound2005&quot; /&gt; 

Its bilingual mandate and focus on the liberal arts continue to shape Glendon's special status within York University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ycom/profiles/past/aug00/current/features/article1.htm |title=Profiles Online â August 2000 â Features: GUIDING PRINCIPALS |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Keele Campus (York University)|Keele campus]] was regarded as somewhat isolated, in a generally industrialized part of the city. Petrol storage facilities are still located across the street. Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the [[brutalism|brutalist]] designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate. In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a [[Beatrice Ice Gardens|hockey arena]]. The [[Rexall Centre]] tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the [[Canada Masters]] tennis tournament. As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA), and in particular, near the [[Jane and Finch]] neighbourhood. Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location. Students occupied the university's administration offices in March 1997, protesting escalating tuition hikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pound2005&quot; /&gt;

On November 6, 2008, the York University Senate suspended classes because of a strike by [[CUPE]] Local 3903. The local represents contract professors, teaching assistants, and graduate assistants. Classes resumed on Monday, February 2, 2009 after back-to-work legislation was passed by the Ontario Legislative Assembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/toronto/archive/2008/11/05/classes-suspended-as-strike-hits-york-university.aspx |title=National Post. &quot;Classes Suspended as Strike Hits York University&quot; |publisher=Network.nationalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see: ''[[2008-09 York University Strike]]'')

==Academics==
York University alumni, faculty, or former faculty have been awarded one Nobel Prize&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_university_affiliation&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 Pulitzer Prizes{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. York has educated some of the current directors and one [[CEO]] of two of the major banks in Canada ([[Bank of Nova Scotia]], [[Bank of Montreal]]), the largest and most prominent media networks in Canada ([[CTV Television Network]], [[Rogers Communications]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]), and numerous judges, [[diplomats]], and senior politicians including the current [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] of Canada, the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] of Canada, the [[Attorney General of Ontario]], the President of the [[Privy Council of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations]]. Astronaut [[Steven MacLean (astronaut)|Steve MacLean]] was educated at York University in the [[physics]] department and later taught there before going to work at [[Stanford University]].

===Faculties===
York University has ten faculties including the Faculties of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies (which was formed in July 2009 by the merger of the Atkinson Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies and the Faculty of Arts), [[Science]] and [[Engineering]], Education, and [[Glendon College]]. Some faculties' programs overlap: for instance, more than one house separate mathematics departments, although some of these are being merged; the [[Schulich School of Business]] offers undergraduate and graduate International Business Administration programmes and the Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Professional Studies offers a Bachelor of Administrative Studies, as well as a minor in Business, to be taken in conjunction with a major in another discipline. The Schulich School of Business offers undergraduates with the option of pursuing a BBA or iBBA program with a component of mandatory exchange. Also, Glendon, and Schulich units are offering or are in the processing of preparing to offer degrees in public policy and administration. The University administration has, however, taken steps in some cases to unify departments in separate faculties, in part to support York's efforts to brand itself as a university focused on interdisciplinarity. For example, the Faculty of Health, opened on 1 July 2006, houses the School of Health Policy and Management, School of [[Kinesiology]] and Health Science, School of Nursing, and the Department of [[Psychology]].

York University offers the first and largest [[graphic design]] programme in Ontario [[York/Sheridan Design (YSDN)]].&lt;ref name=&quot;design.yorku.ca&quot;&gt;[http://design.yorku.ca YSDN | York Sheridan Program in Design | York Master of Design]. Design.yorku.ca (2010-11-26). Retrieved on 2010-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a four-year University degree delivered jointly by the two leading educational institutions of design in Canada (York University and [[Sheridan College]]) and recognized throughout North America for maintaining the highest academic and professional standards.

The [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] moved from a downtown location to the York campus in 1969 following the requirement that every law school affiliate with a university. The law school has several flexible degrees available including the Osgoode-NYU JD/LLB degree in conjunction with [[New York University School of Law]]. Osgoode Hall Law School of York University has been ranked the top law school in Canada in ''Canadian Lawyer'' magazineâs 2008 Law School Survey.

York University's Faculty of [[Graduate Studies]] offers graduate degrees in a variety of disciplines, and there are several joint graduate programmes with the [[University of Toronto]] and [[Ryerson University]]. It is the second largest graduate school in the Province of Ontario.

The [[Ph.D.]] students in the Social and Political Thought&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/spt/index.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; program have won the award for best PhD thesis in Canada.

York's [[Jazz]] Department was once overseen by [[Oscar Peterson]]. York also has a joint Bachelor of Design program with [[Sheridan College]]. York's Departments of Film, Theatre and Creative Writing (which is not officially affiliated with the Faculty of Fine Arts) offers programmes in [[film]] production/directing, acting, and writing respectively, producing many award-winning graduates. The founders of Toronto's [[Hot Docs]] International Documentary Film Festival and [[CineACTION]] film theory magazine were graduates of York's Faculty of Fine Arts.

York's Dance department was founded by [[National Ballet of Canada]]'s first choreographer [[Grant Strate]].

York offers a Space and Communication Sciences undergraduate degree. Yorkâs Centre for Vision Research has developed a â[[virtual reality]] roomâ called IVY (Immersive Virtual Environment at York) in order to study spatial orientation and perception of [[gravity]] and [[motion (physics)|motion]]. The [[Canadian Space Agency]] and National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) use this room to strengthen astronautsâ sense of âupâ and âdownâ in zero-gravity environments. The room is a six-sided immersive environment made of the glass used in the [[CN Tower]]âs observation deck and includes walls, ceiling, and a floor made of computer-generated [[pixel]] maps. York's Faculty of Science and Engineering most recently took part in the 2007 NASA [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]] Mars Mission.

York is also the only university in Canada with specialized programs in [[meteorological]] sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level.

===Libraries===
{{main|York University Libraries}}

There are seven libraries and archives at York, five of them (Scott, Steacie, Peter F. Bronfman, Leslie Frost, and Clara Thomas) constituting [[York University Libraries]], plus the [[Archives of Ontario]] and the library of [[Osgoode Hall Law School]].

==Campuses==
===Keele Campus===
[[File:York Outdoor Art.jpg|thumb|right|An outdoor art exhibit outside of Scott Library, Keele Campus]]

{{main|Keele Campus (York University)}}

York's primary campus (&quot;The Keele Campus&quot;) is located in the former municipality of [[North York]]. Most of the University's faculties reside here, including Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, Environmental Studies, Science and Engineering, Education, and Health. All together, nearly 50,000 students attend classes on the Keele campus.

York has over 200,000 living alumni. Although a large number of alumni live in Ontario, a significant number live in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Alberta, New York, and Washington, D.C.  York also has over 25,000 alumni internationally.

===Glendon===
[[Glendon College]], a bilingual liberal arts faculty which conducts its own recruitment and admissions and hosts its own academic programs, is also housed on its own campus on Bayview Avenue in North Toronto. Glendon is the only university-level institution in central Southern Ontario that offers university courses in both [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]; others elsewhere in Ontario include the [[University of Ottawa]] and [[Laurentian University]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]. A shuttle bus runs regularly between the Glendon and the Keele campuses. Glendon students are free to take courses at the Keele campus (and vice-versa). However, there are students who feel getting from one campus to the other to be inconvenient thus the attractiveness of this option is not universal.

===Satellite Campuses===
[[File:Seymour Schulich Building York University Jan08.jpg|thumb|right|Seymour Schulich Building at York's Keele Campus]]

While most of the Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School programs are offered at the Keele Campus, both of them maintain satellite facilities in downtown Toronto. Schulich operates the Miles S. Nadal Management Centre, while Osgoode Hall has a Professional Development Centre located at 1 Dundas Street West.

==Student life==
York has more than 50,000 students enrolled. Many students come from the Greater Toronto Area, but there is a sizeable population of students from across Canada and abroad, making York one of the most international universities in Canada. To serve this large population, there are 290 student clubs and organizations; six student-run publications and three broadcast programs; six art galleries; 33 on-campus eateries; and a retail mall. Undergraduate students at York are represented by the [[York Federation of Students]], a student-elected body that sponsors most of the clubs and engages in lobbying with the university administration and the [[Government of Ontario|provincial]] and [[Government of Canada|federal]] governments. {{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The different houses that make up Founders Residence are actually named after the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] (Varley House, Harris House, etc.), or as the plaque at the building says, 'The Founders of Canadian Art.&quot;

====The Village====
The [[Village at York]] off-campus student housing area has become a popular area of accommodation for many upper-year and post-graduate students, and the area has had a large amount of attention particularly for large parties hosted by students, including the annual Battle of the Village kegger held in March. There have also been many reports of the level of noise pollution from late-night parties from students living in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/SpecialSections/SchoolsGuide/article/257819 |title=Schools Guide&amp;#124;York University: The city within a city |publisher=Thestar.com |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safety has also been a pressing issue. 

The Village is a residential neighbourhood within the City of Toronto, occupying about 130 acres beyond the south boundary of York University's property. Residential dwellings in The Village are privately owned, and homeowners in this community are City of Toronto taxpayers. York University participates in the Village At York Town and Gown Committee, with representatives of residents of The Village; the York Federation of Students; Toronto Police Service and Toronto Fire Service, as well as other key municipal agencies and the local Councillors' office. This committee addresses concerns of residents, students, the City and the University, such as community safety and by-law enforcement and compliance.

===Newspapers and other publications===
''[[Excalibur (newspaper)|Excalibur]]'' has been the university's autonomous student newspaper since 1966. In 2008, the ''YU Free Press'' was formed as an alternative campus newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://yufreepress.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleges and some programs also have individual newspapers or magazines. They include: ''The Flying Walrus'' (Stong College), ''MacMedia'' (McLaughlin College), ''The Pipe'' (Calumet College), ''Winters Free Press'' (Winters College), ''SOFA'' (Spotlight On Fine Arts), ''The Lexicon'' (Norman Bethune College), ''The Vandoo'' ([[Vanier College at York University|Vanier College]]), ''The Phoenix'' (Founders College), ''Pro Tem'' (Glendon College), ''Obiter Dicta'' (Osgoode Law School), and ''The Insider'' (Schulich School of Business).

''[[Existere]] â Journal of Arts and Literature'' (est. 1978) is a national publication with local and international contributors. It is financed by Vanier College Council. The journal publishes short fiction, poetry, non-fiction and art from novices and seasoned veterans. Several major writers got their early start in Existere.

''YorkU Magazine'' (est. 2003) is the official magazine of York University. It publishes five times per year in hard copy and digital editions.

===Sport===
[[File:YorkUvsUofGuelph.jpg|thumb|200px|left]]
The University is represented in [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] by the [[York Lions]]. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the &quot;[[Yeomen]]&quot;, after the [[Yeomen Warders]], the guardians of the fortress and palace at the [[Tower of London]], otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name &quot;Yeowomen&quot; was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a &quot;Yeowoman&quot; was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the University replaced both names with the &quot;Lions&quot;, as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the &quot;York Lionesses&quot;, even though the name &quot;Lion&quot; is intended to apply to both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitysport.ca/e/story_detail.cfm?id=397 Canadian Interuniversity Sport]. Universitysport.ca. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

York offers 29 interuniversity sport teams, 12 sport clubs, 35 intramural sport leagues, special events and 10 pick-up sport activities offered daily.

York University has several athletic facilities, some of which are used for major tournaments. These include a football stadium, 4 gymnasia, 5 sport playing fields, 4 softball fields, 9 outdoor tennis courts, 5 squash courts, 3 dance/aerobic studios, 6 ice arenas, a swimming pool, an expanding fitness centre and the new [[Rexall Centre]] (home of the [[Canada Masters|Rogers Tennis Cup]]).
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tenniscanadarexallctr.jpg|thumb|170px|The Rexall Centre at York University {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

In 2005, plans were made to build a new football and soccer stadium to host the [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] and future football tournaments. These plans were scuttled, however, when a deal was signed by the Argos to remain at the [[Rogers Centre]].

====Fight song====
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games are: &quot;York Song&quot;, sung to the tune &quot;Harvard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebecca Green |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000759SUBReadings |title=Fight Songs |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |date=1990-10-09 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At sporting events, and in a host of frosh week events on campus, students are often heard singing and chanting the cheer &quot;Deep in the Heart&quot;:

:Deep in the heart of the York U Jungle,
:You can hear the Lions rumble,
:Oo Oo, YU YU, Oo Oo, YU YU

Another York Fight song that is used at Homecoming games is:

:The red and white are waving over the field
:Our team is fighting with the spirit that will not yield
:Rah rah rah!
:Hail to thee O York U
:We'll fight for you
:Once again the Lions will reach victory!

There are also college songs, particularly from the friendly feuds between Stong College and Bethune College, and the infamous Winters College and [[Vanier College at York University|Vanier College]] cheer songs.

===Fraternities and Sororities===
Over the years, two fraternities and two sororities have operated, unofficially, on campus:

''Fraternities:''
* [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] (ÎÎÎ ) - (Eta Pi Chapter)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aepiyorku.ca&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phi Delta Theta]] (Î¦ÎÎ) - (Ontario Delta Chapter)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontariodelta.ca Phi Delta Theta Ontario Delta]. Ontariodelta.ca. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phi Delta Phi]] (Î¦ÎÎ¦) international legal fraternity, at [[Osgoode Law School]], was given special dispensation when the law school became part of the university, as the fraternity's history with the law school dated back to 1896, and is recognized at York.

==Rankings==
===Global rankings===

==Transit==&lt;!-- This section is linked from York University --&gt;
{{main|York University (YRT)|York University GO Station|York University Busway|York University (TTC)}}
[[File:TTC York University night jan08.jpg|thumb|right|A TTC Orion V bus at York]]
York University is sometimes referred to as a &quot;commuter school&quot;. Over 65% of the students and staff have home addresses in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), particularly in York Region and downtown Toronto. Many students are opting for public transit owing to York's high parking fees. York intends to increase the fees for parking for the 2009/10 academic year to combat the congestion around the campus and to support the goal of making Toronto more environmentally friendly.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Close to fourteen hundred buses move people through the campus each day. A proposed extension of the [[Yonge-University-Spadina line]] of the [[Toronto Subway and RT|Toronto Subway]] is currently under construction. It would run directly under the campus, creating new stations at [[Keele Street]] and [[Finch Avenue]] (as [[Finch West (TTC)|Finch West station]]), at the centre of campus (as [[York University (TTC)|York University station]]), and at Steeles Avenue, interfacing with [[York Regional Transit]] (as [[Steeles West (TTC)|Steeles West station]]).

York University's Glendon and Keele campuses are served by the TTC. The Keele site is also served by [[York Region Transit]] buses (both regular and [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva]]) from the immediate north, [[GO Transit]] express buses from several other Toronto suburbs and colleges or universities and [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound buses]] for regional transportation. Transportation Services operates a shuttle service to GO Transit's York University train station on its Barrie corridor. As of November 20, 2009, express buses on the highly frequent 196 York University Rocket [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) [[Toronto Transit Commission buses|bus]] route now use the dedicated [[York University Busway]] to transport students from [[Downsview (TTC)|Downsview station]] to York Lanes in about 15 minutes. It consists of bus-only lanes on Allen Road and Dufferin Street, and bus-only roadways through a hydro corridor north of Finch Avenue West, and along the east side of the campus. As of September 20, 2010, the [[ZÃ¼m]] Route 501 provides service from [[Bramalea Terminal]] in [[Brampton]] to York University.

==Campus safety==
York University Department of Security Services provides security services on the university's campuses. York Security Services provide uniformed security staff which consist of campus liaison officers (community services unit) and the Investigative Unit which works closely with the [[Toronto Police Services]]. The investigative unit and Toronto Police Investigative Units and 31 Division work jointly on serious investigations. Patrols are conducted on foot, bicycle and vehicle. The security service is a member of the Ontario Association of College and University Security Administrators (OACUSA) and the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA). The campus community is over 55,000 people.

The department uses marked Ford Crown Victorias which are clearly identifiable with low-profile LED roof lights. The department responds to all calls for service, however incidents of a criminal nature should be reported to Toronto Police.

Uniform security staff can be clearly identified by their dark cargo-style pants, red shirt (York University colour) and black exterior body armour (bulletproof vest covers).

Residence watch staff are also posted nightly at all undergraduate residence buildings to provide an extra level of protection.

As part of the campus safety system a student escort service is available to all members of the community. The escort staff are students hired on a part-time basis. In an emergency escort staff have immediate communication with Security Services.

In June 2008, the university announced it had commissioned an external safety audit after a string of rapes on the university campus.

During [[frosh week]] 2007, two men entered a campus dormitory and raped two students.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsite.excal.on.ca&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsite.excal.on.ca/cms2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5907:york-safety-audit-mia&amp;catid=6:news&amp;Itemid=66 ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2010/04/14/13583871-qmi.html York University rapist gets 8 years in prison - Crime - Canoe.ca].

In April 2010, a 20-year-old student was sexually assaulted while walking to her apartment, located minutes away from the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100421/100421_sex_assault/20100421/?hub=CP24Home Police investigating severe sexual assault near York U - CTV News, Shows and Sports - Canadian Television].

==Controversies==
===Violation of academic freedom===
In the aftermath of an academic conference that took place in 2009, titled &quot;Israel/Palestine: Mapping Models of Statehood and Paths to Peace&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorku.ca/ipconf |title=Israel/Palestine: Mapping Models of Statehood and Paths to Peace conference |publisher=Yorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which explored the possible models of statehood for Israel/Palestine, including the one state model, concerns were raised about the way the York Administration has handled the political pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/controversy-brews-over-yorks-handling-of-conference-on-mideast/article1531004/ |title=Globe and Mail |publisher=Globe and Mail |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the organizers accused the York administration, mainly the then Dean of the Osgoode Hall Law School and the Associate Vice President for Research and Innovation, of putting undue pressure on the organizers in order to force them to change the content of the conference, invite or disinvite some speakers. The accusations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fragilefreedomatyorku.ca/academic-freedom/field-notes/introduction/ |title=Accusations by conference organizers |publisher=Fragilefreedomatyorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were supported by documents and emails that were obtained through the Freedom of Information and Privacy Protection Act.

The York administration appointed former Supreme Court of Canada Judge to review the issue, but the Iacobucci Review was problematic, and the terms of reference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fragilefreedomatyorku.ca/academic-freedom/administrative-response/objections-to-iacobucci/ |title=Terms of Reference of Iacobucci review |publisher=Fragilefreedomatyorku.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the review were seen as an attack on academic freedom. The whole issue is being investigated by the Canadian Association of University Teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caut.ca/news_details.asp?nid=1370&amp;page=490 |title=Canadian Association of University Teachers |publisher=Caut.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the allegations made, a University spokesperson said that the University should be judged the fact that event took place despite the pressure not to hold it, and that there is always internal discussion as part of the planning of all events. He added that &quot;In the end, this conference did go on and we do not feel that academic freedom was breached.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theglobeandmail.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/controversy-brews-over-yorks-handling-of-conference-on-mideast/article1531004/ This page is available to GlobePlus subscribers]. Theglobeandmail.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President and Provost, Patrick Monahan, said, about these allegation  that &quot;Justice Iacobucci has looked at that and he doesnât see any purpose in conducting further inquiries. Obviously there are a lot of different views about it.â&lt;ref name=&quot;theglobeandmail.com&quot;/&gt; Yet, it seems that the Iaccobucci Report is seen by many faculty members at Osgoode as controversial. In a letter from the Osgoode Hall Faculty Association, the Association said that it &quot;considers the Iacobucci Report to be unsound and unreliable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fragilefreedomatyorku.ca/wp-content/uploads/file/OHFA%20LETTER%20TO%20SENATE.pdf |title=letter from the Osgoode Hall Faculty Association |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association also said that &quot;the Report both jeopardizes academic freedom and fails to consider the troubling conduct of the York officials.&quot;

===Intimidation of Jewish Students and Pro-Israel Groups===
On February 11, 2009, approximately 100 pro-Palestinian students reportedly initiated a near-riot against a group of Jewish students during a news conference where speakers called for the impeachment of the York Federation of Students (YFS) executive. According to witnesses, the demonstrators, which reportedly consisted of members of the YFS and Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA), shouted âZionism equals racism!â and âRacists off campus!â One witness stated that âa riot broke out. They [YFS supporters] started banging the door and windows, intimidating Jewish students and screaming antisemitic slurs.â The students barricaded themselves inside the Hillel offices, where protesters reportedly banged on the windows and attempted to force their way in.  Eventually police were called to escort Jewish students through the protesters.

Krisna Saravanamuttu, York Federation of Students' vice-president of equity, who took part in the protest, denied that the protesters shouted anti-semitic slogans, stating that &quot;That is categorically false. I heard nothing of that nature at all.&quot; He did however, confirm that the protesters shouted &quot;racism off campus&quot; and &quot;students united will never be defeated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globecampus.ca/in-the-news/article/push-to-oust-york-student-leaders-stirs-ethnic-tensions/ Push to oust York student leaders stirs ethnic tensions] by Elizabeth Church and Omar El Akkad, Globecampus.ca (''The Globe and Mail''), February 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, York adjudicator [http://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/faculty/Mosher_Janet.html Janet Mosher], who is an associate dean at Yorkâs Osgoode Hall Law School, ruled that two York students, Krisna Saravanamuttu and Jesse Zimmerman, had violated the Student Code of Conduct due to their behaviour at the protest, which she described as âexclusionary and offensiveâ and which promoted an atmosphere of âhostility, incivility and intimidation.â Mosher noted that both students participated in the protest which pursued a group of Jewish students to Hillelâs lounge in Yorkâs Student Centre, and swarmed outside shouting taunts. On a video of the incident, Saravanamuttu was shown clapping and apparently leading a chant of âWhose campus? Our campus!â as well as  participating in a chant of âRacists off campus.&quot; Saravanamuttu was fined $150 and both he and Zimmerman were given an official reprimand and human rights training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorku.ca/yfile/archive/index.asp?Article=12669 Two York students sanctioned over confrontation], Yfile, York's Daily Bulletin, May 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/200905261682/Sanctions-reprimand-imposed-on-York-students.html Sanctions, reprimand imposed on York students], Jewish Tribune staff, Jewish Tribune, May 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/todays-paper/story.html?id=2652841 Jewish group questions TTC advisory panel choice] by Megan O'Toole, National Post, March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the campus group the [http://www.yorku.ca/scld/organizations/origanizations.php?view=549&amp;key=&amp;alpha=&amp;clubsearch=Search&amp;category=Religious&amp;type=club Christians United for Israel (CUFI)] and ''My Canada'' applied to use university space to host the ''[http://www.imaginewithus.ca/ Imagine With Us]'' coalition event consisting of pro-Israel speakers. The University replied that the event could only proceed under certain conditions (which ultimately led to the event's cancellation when the organizers declined to comply with the terms):
*the organizers would be required to pay for security, including both campus and Toronto police;
*the organizers must provide an advance list of all program attendees and advance minute-by-minute summaries of all the speeches; and
*No advertising for the program would be permitted on campus.&lt;ref name=Frum20100227/&gt;&lt;ref name=JT20100224/&gt;

These conditions drew criticism because they were not imposed on the organizers of [[Israel Apartheid Week]] which was being held on campus the same month.&lt;ref name=Frum20100227/&gt;&lt;ref name=JT20100224&gt;[http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/201002242709/York-University-discriminates-against-Christian-and-Jewish-coalition-ahead-of-Israel-Apartheid-Week.html York University discriminates against Christian and Jewish coalition ahead of Israel Apartheid Week], Jewish Tribune, February 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; York's decision drew sharp criticism from [[David Frum]] who wrote in the ''[[National Post]]'' that &quot;Since the anti-Israel people might use violence, the speech of the pro-Israel people must be limited. On the other hand, since the pro-Israel people do not use violence, the speech of the anti-Israel people can proceed without restraint.&quot; A York University spokesman subsequently told Frum that &quot;all student groups that request university space&quot; must meet &quot;precisely same requirements&quot; but that while the âprocessâ and the âprotocolsâ that were the same, a âneeds-based assessmentâ of each particular case is necessary. Frum subsequently criticized the &quot;utterly arbitrary ad hoc decision-making of a fathomlessly cowardly university administration.&quot; Frank Dimant, CEO of [[B'nai Brith Canada]] also sharply criticized York's justification, arguing that &quot;Yorkâs continued appeasement of anti-Israel agitators at the expense of Zionist Christians and Jews is unacceptable.â &lt;ref name=Frum20100227&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/story.html?id=2620345 David Frum: Something's seriously wrong at York University] by David Frum, National Post, February 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Ed Morgan (professor)|Ed Morgan]] of the [[University of Toronto]] criticized York, citing a 1992 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that struck down a county government's increased fee for police protection for a controversial speaker because &quot;speech cannot be financially burdened, any more than it can be punished or banned, simply because it might offend a hostile mob.&quot; Regarding the situation at York, Morgan wrote that &quot;It's bad enough that there are &quot;hostile mobs&quot; on our campuses; making others pay for that hostility only rubs salt in our wounded freedoms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2629578 Free speech versus safety at York University, National Post, March 2, 2010.]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prof. Howard C. Tenenbaum, also of the [[University of Toronto]], wrote that York &quot;has lost all stature as an academic institution whose remit is to provide for full academic discourse, freedom from hatred on campus and freedom of speech, unless of course that freedom only includes unabashed hatred for the State of Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2629590 RE: Free speech versus safety at York University] by Howard C. Tenenbaum, National Post, March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; David Murrell of the [[University of New Brunswick]] wrote that &quot;Everyone has a supposed right to free speech at York University â so long as groups can afford to pay security against leftist intimidation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2638949 Not sending any more grads to York University] by David Murrell, National Post, March 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strikes===
York University has a history of faculty and teaching assistant strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by [http://www.yufa.org/ YUFA] that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yufa.org/news/TenthAnniversaryStrike.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, teaching assistants and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/article/532380|work=The Star|location=Toronto|title=Strike brings York to standstill|first=Louise|last=Brown|date=November 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central issue in the 2001 disruption was the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language.

A strike beginning on November 6, 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3903strike.ca/ York University Strike CUPE 3903 TAs Contract Faculty GAs &amp; RAs]. 3903strike.ca. Retrieved on 2010-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; concerned a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario [[Premier of Ontario|premier]] [[Dalton McGuinty]] announced a rare Sunday recall of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|provincial legislature]] in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2009/01/24/york-strike.html &quot;Ontario to legislate end to York University strike&quot;], CBC News, January 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42â8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario.
