'''Springfield''' is the [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional town]] in which the [[United States|American]] [[Animation|animated]] [[sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is set. A mid-sized town in an undetermined state of the [[United States]], Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The geography of the town and its surroundings are flexible, changing to address whatever an episodeâs plot calls for.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Springfield's location is impossible to determine; the show is deliberately evasive on the subject, providing contradictory clues and impossible information about an actual geographic location.&lt;!--Please do not add examples of the &quot;clues&quot; about Springfield's location here. It is important to emphasize in the summary that Springfield *cannot be located* due to the creators' intentions. And yes, we saw the &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode too.--&gt;

==Creation==
Springfield is meant to represent &quot;anytown, USA&quot; and not be a specific real town,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Turner| first = Chris| title =[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]]| page =30| isbn = 0-679-31318-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the producers acknowledge basing the town on various locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kval.com/news/8775202.html | title=Groening: Springfield is the real deal! | publisher=[[CBS]] | work=[[KVAL-TV]] | date=2007-07-27 | accessdate=2007-11-19 | author=Kalkstein, Meghan}}&lt;/ref&gt; including ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]'s hometown of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and [[Mike Scully]]'s hometown, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=12392|title=Matt Groeningâs Portland|accessdate=2007-08-04|author=Hamilton, Don|date=2002-07-19|publisher=''[[Portland Tribune]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening liked ''[[Second City Television]]'''s use of Melonville, a town with a large cast of recurring characters that serves as a mini-universe for the show, and partially based ''The Simpsons'' on it.&lt;ref name=Groening&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose the name because Springfield is one of the [[List of the most common U.S. place names#Springfield (32)|most common place-names in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6910174.stm ''Simpsons launch hits Springfield''] [[BBC News]].

==The town==
Springfield was founded in 1796 by a group led by [[Jebediah Springfield]] (also known as Hans Sprungfeld) that, after misinterpreting a passage in the Bible, left Maryland trying to find &quot;New [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lisatheiconoclast&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Lisa the Iconoclast|episodelink=Lisa the Iconoclast|series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons|credits=Collier, Jonathan; Anderson, Mike B.|network=Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate=1996-02-18|season=7|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he refused to found a town where [[cousin marriage|men were free to marry their cousins]], half of the group left.

===Geography, climate, and environment===
Springfield's geography is varied, including forests, meadows, mountain ranges, a desert, a gorge, a glacier, beaches, badlands, canyons, swamps, a harbor, waterholes, and waterways. Major named geographical features include Springfield Gorge, Springfield National Forest, the volcanic Mt. Springfield, the West Springfield Desert (&quot;three times the size of Texas!&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Half-Decent Proposal |episodelink=Half-Decent Proposal |series=The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |credits= |network= Fox Broadcasting Company |station= |airdate=February 10, 2002 |season=13 |seriesno= |number= 279 |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Springfield Badlands (also known as the Alkali Flats),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming|episodelink=Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming|series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons|credits=Feresten, Spike; Polcino, Dominic|network=Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate=1995-11-26|season=7|episode=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the gigantic Murderhorn Mountain, Springfield Glacier, Mt. Useful National Park, Springfield Mesa, and Springfield National Park. The Springfield Mystery Spot (seen in &quot;[[Homer at the Bat]]&quot;), apparently a portal to another dimension, is a popular tourist attraction.

The town's skies are usually blue and sunny. However, it has been subject to many natural disasters, including heat waves, blizzards, avalanches, earthquakes, acid rain, floods, hurricanes, lightning strikes, tornadoes, and volcanic eruptions.

Springfield's environment is unusually polluted. Overflowing garbage forced the whole townâboth population and structuresâto move five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) away from the massive dump that the old town had become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Trash of the Titans|epiosdelink=Trash of the Titans|series =The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons|credits=Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate=1998-05-26|season=9|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Springfield is home to the state's largest self-sustaining [[tire fire]], which has been burning continuously for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Homer's Paternity Coot|episodelink=Homer's Paternity Coot|series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons|credits=Anderson, Mike. B; Cohen, Joel H.|network=Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate=2006-01-08|season=17|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Springfield's pollution almost led to the town's destruction by an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] bomb,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution from the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]] has mutated the fish in the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;blinky&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Its atmosphere proved to have such a thick and acidic pollution layer that it once reduced a [[comet]] to a tiny rock the size of a chihuahua's head.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bart's Comet]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics, religion, and the media===
In [[Politics in The Simpsons|politics]], the mayor of Springfield is [[Joe Quimby]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|(D)]], while the town's [[United States House of Representatives|representative in congress]] is [[Krusty the Clown|Herschel Krustofsky]] [[Republican Party (United States)|(R)]] of the 24th congressional district. [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Mary Bailey|Mary Bailey]] (D) is the governor of Springfield's state.&lt;ref name=&quot;blinky&quot;/&gt; Political corruption and police bribery is common enough to be virtually taken for granted.

[[Religion in The Simpsons|Religious houses of worship]] include a local synagogue, the First Church of Springfield, First [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME Church]], the Cathedral of the Downtown, and a Buddhist [[vihara]].

[[KBBL (The Simpsons)|KBBL]] Broadcasting Inc. is the major [[Media in The Simpsons|media outlet]], owning at least three radio stations and one television station. ''[[The Springfield Shopper]]'' is a town newspaper.

===Neighborhoods and attractions===
The town is divided into many neighborhoods, including Rats Nest, Bum Town, Chinatown, Crackton, East Springfield, [[Greece|Greek]] Town, Russian Town, Junkyville, Little [[Bangkok]], Little [[Italy]], Little [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], Little [[Stockholm]], Little [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], Ethnictown, the Jewish Lower East Side, Pressboard Estates, Recluse Ranch Estates, Skid Row, Springfield Harbor, Springfield Heights, Hyperion Drive, Springshire, [[Tibet]] Town, the wealthy Waverly Hills, the artistic borough of Sprooklyn,&lt;ref name=&quot;musical&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Elementary School Musical (The Simpsons)|Elementary School Musical]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Lincoln Park Village Housing Project, the Flammable District, a gay district, a fast-food district, Little Ukraine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Falcon and the D'ohman|episodelink=The Falcon and the D'ohman|series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons|network=Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate=2011-11-25|season=23|number=01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Nuclear Power Plant, known as Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.

Springfield boasts an opera house, an outdoor [[amphitheater]], an [[arboretum]], and a vibrant [[jazz]] scene, and was previously regarded as the entertainment capital of its state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Krusty Gets Kancelled|episodelink=Krusty Gets Kancelled|series=The Simpsons|serieslink=The Simpsons|credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David|network=Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate=1993-05-13|season=04|number=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town has several universities, including Springfield University and sports [[rivalry (sports)|archrival]] Springfield A&amp;M, Springfield Heights Institute of Technology, and Springfield Community College. Museums include the Springfield Museum and its world's largest [[cubic zirconium]], Springfield Knowledgeum, Springfield Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Swordfish, Springsonian Museum, and a [[philately|stamp museum]].

For transportation, Springfield has an international airport, is served by a railroad, and has both an [[Springfield Subway|abandoned subway system]], a public transit system, and an [[Marge vs. the Monorail|unsuccessful monorail line]].

The town is home to the Springfield Isotopes, an [[minor league baseball|AA minor league baseball]] team which plays its home games at [[Duff Beer|Duff]] Stadium;&lt;ref name=&quot;hungryhungryhomer&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Hungry, Hungry Homer]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the Springfield Atoms football team at Springfield Stadium;&lt;ref name=&quot;strangled&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Love Is a Many Strangled Thing]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the [[NBA]]'s Springfield Excitement (formerly the Austin Celtics);&lt;ref name=&quot;bees&quot;&gt;&quot;[[The Burns and the Bees]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the Springfield Ice-O-Topes hockey team at the Springfield Arena.

==Businesses==
===Springfield Nuclear Power Plant===
The '''Springfield Nuclear Power Plant''' is a [[nuclear power plant]] in Springfield owned by [[Montgomery Burns]]. The plant has the monopoly on the city of Springfield's energy supply, and the carelessness of Mr. Burns and the plant's employees (like Homer, who is employed at Sector 7G) often endangers the residents and natural environment of Springfield. At the core of the plant are two Fissionator 1952 Slow-Fission Reactors, operating in spite of more than 342 safety violations with an estimated repair bill to bring the plant up to code being in excess of $56 million. The plant has come close to a [[nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] several times, and blown up at least once.

There is an unseen [[crow]] or [[raven]] that lives near the Power Plant, that caws whenever an [[establishing shot]] of the Power Plant is on screen. [[Three-eyed fish|Mutated fish]] with more than two eyes have been seen in the lake behind the power plant, which has a large pipe pumping nuclear waste into it. According to Mr. Burns the plant is endowed with flippered mutants.

The design and folly of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is often rumored to be based on the troubled [[Trojan Nuclear Power Plant]] (closed in 1993 due to defects) near [[Matt Groening]]'s home town of [[Portland, Oregon]], or the [[Hanford Site]] in southeastern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. However, Antonia Coffman, Groening's publicist, has said that the Springfield plant's design is generic and that &quot;the Springfield Nuclear Power plant was not based on the Trojan Plant or any other power plant in the country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LaBoe|first=Barbara|url=http://www.tdn.com/articles/2006/05/14/area_news/news07.txt|title='Simpsons' keeps Trojan tower legacy alive ... or does it?|publisher=[[The Daily News (Longview)|The Daily News]]|page=A1|date=2006-05-14|accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/271084_trojan22.html|title=Tower of Oregon's only nuclear plant goes down}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kwik-E-Mart===
{{main|Kwik-E-Mart}}
[[Image:Kwik-e-mart-7-11.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A [[Seattle]] 7-Eleven store transformed into a Kwik-E-Mart.]]
'''Kwik-E-Mart''' is a convenience store located in Springfield and run by [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]]. The Kwik-E-Mart first appeared in the first season episode &quot;[[The Telltale Head]]&quot; (although mentioned in &quot;[[Bart the General]]&quot; as the &quot;Quick-e-Mart&quot;). The episode &quot;[[Homer and Apu]]&quot; suggests that Apu is an employee of the Kwik-E-Mart and after losing his job there had to travel to [[India]] where the Kwik-E-Mart head office is located, in the [[Himalayas]]. However, Apu mentions at a bachelor auction that he runs his own business in &quot;[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]&quot;.

In addition to the sale of food, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and other items offered at a typical convenience store, [[Petrol]] [[fuel dispenser|pumps]] have been shown in front on two occasions. In the episode &quot;[[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]]&quot;, Bart is visiting Principal Skinner at Fort Springfield. Skinners tells his troops to hold their fire and a mortar is fired in the wrong direction; the scene cuts to Apu standing in front of the Kwik-E-Mart bragging about his 16 new pumps just as a shadow from the mortar appears, and back to Fort Springfield where a 'K' from the Kwik-E-Mart lands in smoke. The episode &quot;[[Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield]]&quot; also shows the pumps where Apu refuses to go out and serve a customer on the forecourt.

In July 2007, convenience store chain [[7-Eleven]] converted 11 of its stores in the United States and one in Canada into Kwik-E-Marts to promote the release of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=E!&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=4082c01a-a201-4b22-8c30-1f51e4a41a5a|title=Cowabunga! 7-Elevens Get Kwik-E Makeover|accessdate=2008-02-24|date=2007-07-02|publisher=[[E!

The Squishees were [[Slurpee]]s that are sold in special collector cups and the Krusty-O's were made by [[Malt-O-Meal Company|Malt-O-Meal]].&lt;ref name=FOX/&gt; The promotion resulted in a 30% increase in profits for the changed 7-Eleven stores. This can be seen during the opening of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.&lt;ref name=tieins&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i5cd11e0c6fc24e90a897224f6f3c214d|title=D'oh!

===The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop===
'''The Android's Dungeon &amp; Baseball Card Shop''' is a comic book store owned by Jeff Albertson a.k.a. [[Comic Book Guy]]. The comic book store and its owner first appeared in the episode &quot;[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]&quot;, when Bart sees the store is selling the very first edition of [[Radioactive Man (Simpsons)|Radioactive Man]] for $100.

In the episode titled &quot;[[Worst Episode Ever]]&quot; (which is a remark often used by Comic Book Guy), Bart and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] are given the job of running the comic book store after Comic Book Guy suffers from a heart attack and is told to take a rest from the store and go out and make some friends. It was damaged in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where Comic Book Guy stated that spending his entire life collecting comics was a &quot;life well spent.&quot;

===Aztec Theater===
'''Aztec Theater''' is the old downtown movie theater in Springfield. The first known appearance was in [[The Telltale Head]] where Bart and the school bullies [[List of Springfield Elementary School students#Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], [[List of Springfield Elementary School students#Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]] and [[Dolph Starbeam|Dolph]] all sneak into the theater through the fire escape to watch ''Space Mutants IV''. The theater was used to screen the premiere of ''[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show|Itchy and Scratchy]]:The Movie'' in the [[Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie|episode of the same name]]. In the future, [[Soylent Green]] is on sale in the lobby.  The name and appearance parodies various ethnically-named theaters in [[Hollywood]] and other parts of the United States.

===Barney's Bowl-A-Rama===
'''Barney's Bowl-A-Rama''' is the [[bowling|bowling alley]] in Springfield. It is owned by [[Barney Gumble]]'s Uncle Al.  The Bowl-A-Rama has appeared several times in Simpsons episodes. The very first known appearance is the episode &quot;[[Life on the Fast Lane]]&quot; where [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] forgets Marge's birthday and after rushing out to purchase a gift, he ends up buying a bowling ball. Marge is insulted at the fact her gift from Homer was something obviously intended for his own personal use given the fact the ball had Homer's name engraved on it. Marge decides she will keep the gift for her own use and goes bowling for the first time. This is seen destroyed in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.

In the episode &quot;[[And Maggie Makes Three]]&quot;, Homer tells the family the story of [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s birth. In this story, Homer explains how he quit his job at [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] to work at the Bowl-A-Rama, which was Homer's dream job. This episode reveals where the bowling pins go after they are knocked over; the pins are shown ending up in a heap and new pins are manufactured instantly to replace those knocked over.

The Bowl-A-Rama is used in the episode &quot;[[Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment]]&quot; as a way of smuggling beer into Moe's Tavern. In this episode, [[alcohol]] is [[prohibition|banned]] in Springfield and Homer begins [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] beer he uncovered from the city dump. The beer is poured into bowling balls and Homer then bowls the ball into the gutter at the Bowl-A-Rama; the ball then falls into a pipe leading to Moe's Tavern where [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]  charges an outrageous price.

===Costingtons===
'''Costingtons''' is a department store near the Springfield Mall featured in such episodes as &quot;[[Trash of the Titans]]&quot;,  &quot;[[Kill Gil, Volumes I &amp; II]]&quot; and &quot;[[Homer vs. Dignity]]&quot;.

===KBBL Broadcasting===
is a media company which runs all KBBL TV  and radio stations; it's used to parody the media. Its personalities include
Kent Brockman, Krusty, and Bumble Bee man.
The station jingle is &quot;No sports, no rock, no information! For mindless chatter, we're your station!&quot;

=== King Toots ===
'''King Toots''' is a music store located next door to Moe's Tavern. The store sells musical instruments and is the place where [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s saxophone was purchased. The most notable appearance of King Toots Music Store was in &quot;[[Lisa's Pony]]&quot; where Lisa asks Homer to pick up a new reed for her saxophone for her recital. Homer heads to the store after work and realizes Moe's is next door; since the store wasn't to close for 5 minutes, Homer decides to have a quick beer first. Homer finishes his beer with 15 seconds to spare only to find the store owner has closed early. Homer goes back to Moe's fortunately to find the owner of the store and after much convincing from Homer and Moe the owner opens up to sell Homer a reed.  Unfortunately, Homer is too late for Lisa's recital. Another appearance was in &quot;[[Lisa's Sax]]&quot; where after Lisa's [[saxophone]] was run over by a truck, as a result of a fight between Bart and Lisa, Homer tells the story of how Lisa first got her sax. King Toots is seen briefly during the opening of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' and later while the dome is being put over Springfield.

===The Leftorium===
[[Image:Theleftorium.png|thumb|[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] visiting The Leftorium]]
'''The Leftorium''' is a store in the Springfield Mall that specializes in products for [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] people. The store is owned by [[Ned Flanders]], who first started The Leftorium in the season 3 episode &quot;[[When Flanders Failed]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;JeanWFF&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At first, business at the store was going very poorly. Irritated with Flanders, Homer wished that the store would go out of business after Homer received the larger half of a [[furcula|wishbone]].  Homer got his wish and the Flanders family were forced to sell many of their possessions, much of which Homer purchased at a very low price.  The bank repossessed the Flanders home and the store was to be next. Homer then regretted making this wish and the fact that he never told any of his friends who were in need of left-handed items about The Leftorium.  As a result, he managed to get everyone he knew in town to shop at Ned's store, thus saving the store.

The Leftorium has continued to thrive since.  However, there have been episodes where Flanders mentioned the store doesn't do that well, such as in the season ten episode &quot;[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]],&quot; where Ned mentions that he purchased most of his possessions cheaply, and that the business moved way down hill since &quot;Leftopolis&quot; moved in next door to it.  In the episode &quot;[[Home Away from Homer]]&quot;, Ned mentions that a recently opened, left-hand megastore, called &quot;Left-Mart&quot; (a parody of [[Wal-Mart]]) is threatening his business.

The writers had wanted to have Flanders own a failing business and the idea for the store was suggested by [[George Meyer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReissWFF&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He got the idea from a friend whose family had owned a left-handed specialty store which had failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;VittiWFF&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|date=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;When Flanders Failed&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noiseland Video Arcade===
'''Noiseland Video Arcade''' is the [[video arcade]] in downtown Springfield, a popular place for the youth. Arcade games include Escape from Grandma's House, Kevin Costner's Water World and Larry the Looter. The video arcade has had several appearances in ''The Simpsons'', although mostly in the earlier seasons. The earliest known appearance was in &quot;[[Moaning Lisa]]&quot; where Bart challenges Homer to a boxing game on their home [[handheld TV game|TV game]] system. As Bart is continuously undefeated, Homer decides to fight back by going to the video arcade to learn from the young children how to win in the same boxing game. Homer almost beats Bart but Marge switches off the game at the crucial moment. It was seen destroyed briefly in ''The Simpsons Movie''.

===Sprawl* Mart===
'''Sprawl* Mart''' is a department store in Springfield and a parody of [[Wal-Mart]]. It is first seen in &quot;[[The Fat and the Furriest]].&quot; [[Abraham Simpson|Abe]] and Homer worked there in &quot;[[On a Clear Day I Can't See My Sister]];&quot; Homer was required to work overtime in the store for no extra pay and workers were locked in the store. The workers used this as an opportunity to steal whatever wasn't bolted down.

===Springfield Mall===
The '''Springfield Mall''' is a shopping mall in Springfield and it features stores such as Happy Market, Cost-Mo (an obvious parody of [[Costco]]), and smaller stores such as Girdles N' Such, Eye Caramba, The Ear Piercery, Happy Sailor Tattoo Parlor, Love Your Computer, Gum4Less, Popular Books, The [[Ned Flanders|Leftorium]], Nick's Bowling Shop, Stoner's Pot Palace, Bookacchino's, and many others.

===Try-N-Save===
In the episode &quot;[[Marge Be Not Proud]]&quot;, Bart is caught shoplifting in a '''Try-N-Save''', a store based on retail outlet [[Pic 'n Save]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Despite being told by Try-N-Save security to never return to the store because of [[shoplifting]], Bart is forced to go back with his family for a photo portrait session.  Seen by security again, Bart's crime is revealed, and his relationship with Marge is threatened. The store also appears in the &quot;[[Kamp Krusty]]&quot; episode of ''The Simpsons''. In the episode &quot;[[The Good, the Sad and the Drugly]],&quot; the Try-N-Save brand comes up when Seymour Skinner leads Superintendent Chalmers to believe that his shoes are genuine [[Hush Puppies]] when they are actually Try-N-Save Shush Mutts.

==Bars and restaurants==
===The Gilded Truffle===
'''The Gilded Truffle''' is the local restaurant serving [[French cuisine]]. It has appeared in several episodes.

===Moe's Tavern===
'''Moe's Tavern''' is a local [[bar (establishment)|bar]] in Springfield frequented by Homer Simpson, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard and Barney Gumble. The tavern is named after and ran by [[Moe Szyslak]]. Moe's Tavern first appeared in the episode &quot;[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]&quot;. In the first season of ''The Simpsons'', the entrance appeared to be a saloon door. The bar sells mostly [[Duff Beer]] although other beverages are served. In the episode &quot;[[Flaming Moe's]]&quot;, Moe's beer payments were delinquent so his beer distributor stopped delivering to him. When Homer shows Moe a drink he developed called the Flaming Homer, Moe sells it as his own, calling it the Flaming Moe. The drink becomes extremely popular until Homer reveals its secret ingredient, allowing other businesses to create a similar product. The drink's popularity wanes significantly.

Moe's Tavern has seen several other makeovers in various episodes of ''The Simpsons'', but the tavern always reverts back to its former state before the show's end. In the episode &quot;[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]&quot; Moe's Tavern is named '''Moe's ''C''avern''' as a reference to the world famous [[Cavern Club]] in [[Liverpool]], which is the club where [[the Beatles]] began playing. Other notable makeovers are in the episode &quot;[[Bart Sells His Soul]]&quot; where Moe turns his tavern into a family restaurant called '''Uncle Moe's Family Feed Bag''' and in &quot;[[Homer the Moe]]&quot; where Moe turns his tavern into a yuppie bar called '''m'''. Also in this episode, it is revealed that the television in Moe's is not black and white (as it is always seen) but a dirty color television (Homer says &quot;When was the last time Moe cleaned this thing?&quot; then wipes the screen with a cloth).  In addition it is turned into an English [[Public house|pub]] named '''Nag and Weasel''' in the episode &quot;[[Mommie Beerest]]&quot;. In &quot;[[My Sister, My Sitter]]&quot;, Moe appears to have become '''Moe's Brewing Co.''', a [[brewpub]] that is moved to a posh new premises at the Springfield Squidport, but it is revealed to just be a very long tunnel to the existing bar. In ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' it is located next to the church and named '''Moe's Bar''', and in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'' it is seen next to the Sleep-Eazy Motel. In the episode &quot;[[Homer the Smithers]]&quot;, [[C. Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] believes in order to operate a telephone, you spell the requested person's name out using the alphabetic keypad (he spells out [[Waylon Smithers|S-M-I-T-H-E-R-S]]), he is instead connected to Moe's Tavern. As a result if one was to spell Smithers name out on a telephone keypad, the fictional phone number minus the area code for the tavern would be revealed as 764-8437(7).

===Krusty Burger===
'''Krusty Burger''' is a [[fast food]] [[restaurant chain]] owned by [[Krusty the Clown]] as one of his many branded products and services. Krusty Burger is seen as a parody of a typical fast food chain such as [[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], [[KFC]] or [[Arby's]]. A typical store features a drive-thru with a speaker box and most of the employees are young teenage workers. In the episode &quot;[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]&quot;, the Springfield police are comparing the differences between Krusty Burger and McDonald's, a parallel of the &quot;[[Quarter Pounder|Royale With Cheese]] discussion&quot; seen in ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. This can be seen in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' during the dome sequence after Homer and Bart buy lunch by themselves and with the family.

It appears that Krusty Burger is located across the entire [[United States]]; in the episode &quot;[[Boy-Scoutz n the Hood]]&quot;, Homer loses the map of the rafting route but tells the group that luckily he has brought a map along. It happens to be a map of the entire United States with locations of Krusty Burger restaurants. There is even a Krusty Burger located on an offshore [[oil platform|oil rig]]; it was seen after Homer, Bart, [[Ned Flanders]], and [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Rod Flanders|Rod Flanders]] had been lost at sea several days and were saved from starvation after finding it. There is also a Krusty Burger in [[France]], as seen in the episode &quot;[[The Devil Wears Nada]]&quot;. It exists under the name &quot;Le Krusty Burger&quot;. In the episode &quot;[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]&quot; it was also revealed that Krusty Burger operates in different markets across the USA when Krusty Burger has a new burger called the ''Ribwich.'' After the Ribwich stopped selling in Springfield, Homer and a group of Ribwich fans known as the &quot;Ribheads&quot; followed the &quot;Ribwich tour&quot; as the Ribwich was tested in various markets. The Ribwich sandwich is based on a real life [[McDonald's]] sandwich called the [[McRib]].

According to the episode &quot;[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife, and Her Homer]]&quot;, Krusty Burger is one of the only burger places open in Springfield because Krusty has been paying mobster Fat Tony to keep McDonald's and Burger King from establishing local locations. The extent of Fat Tony's involvement is unknown, as there are no locations of [[Wendy's]], and other major chains. Ironically, Springfield does have an [[In-N-Out Burger]] location in town to compete with Krusty Burger.

===Lard Lad Donuts===
'''Lard Lad Donuts''' is a donut store in Springfield. Its mascot is an (estimated) {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall mascot of a boy proudly holding a donut over his head. The name and the statue of the eponymous boy are likely references to [[Big Boy (restaurant)|Big Boy restaurants]], a competitor of [[Eat'n Park]].

In ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'', the Lard Lad mascot is a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. Lard Lad Donuts is shut down by a health inspector in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', and the Lard Lad is painted in different colors and seen later in the movie during the dome sequence. The former was disproved in &quot;[[E. Pluribus Wiggum]]&quot; when an explosion violently detaches the correctly colored Lard Lad's head.

===The Frying Dutchman===
'''The Frying Dutchman''' is a maritime-themed restaurant operated by Sea Captain Horatio MacAllister. Its cuisine specializes in seafood (to which Marge is allergic), and even the bread has fish in it. Homer sued for refusing to honor the 'all you can eat' promise in the episode &quot;[[New Kid on the Block]]&quot; and was given a job as a [[freak show|freak attraction]] &quot;more stomach than man&quot; (to Marge's great embarrassment).

===The Singing Sirloin===
'''The Singing Sirloin''' is a restaurant where all the waiters sing everything they say. It is first featured in the Season 1 episode &quot;[[Life on the Fast Lane]]&quot;; Marge celebrates her birthday there. Bart also celebrated here after getting an A, however after Homer not able to pay them for the food they had to sing on stage to pay for the bill in the episode &quot;[[Homer vs. Dignity]]&quot;.

==Schools==
===Springfield Elementary School===
'''Springfield Elementary School''' is a local school on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', attended by [[Bart Simpson]], [[Lisa Simpson]] and other Springfieldian children. Springfield Elementary is a grossly underfunded school and suffers from the incompetence and apathy of its administration, teachers, staff and students. It is portrayed within the show as a satire of publicly funded schools and education in the United States. As an illustrative example and parody of the lengths undertaken by some schools to attempt to overcome underfunding, some Springfield Elementary School students (specifically Cletus and Brandine Spuckler's children) are purposely excluded from state or federal standardized testing regimens. The impetus being the maintenance of artificial school-wide averages and therefore basic levels of government supportâa practice not unheard of in the United States and other systems where funding is tied to test results.

Established in the episodes &quot;[[Separate Vocations]]&quot; and &quot;[[Pokey Mom]]&quot;, the school's mascot is a [[cougar|puma]]. It's revealed in the episode &quot;[[Lisa Gets an &quot;A&quot;]]&quot; that Springfield Elementary was at one time voted &quot;The Most Dilapidated School in Missouri&quot;âit was then moved, brick-by-brick, to Springfield. It has been stated several times that the school is filled with [[asbestos]], and the underfunding of the school has resulted in a variety of troubling scenarios for students and staff. Sub-standard facilities abound; including a [[concrete masonry unit|cinder block]] having replaced the school's [[tetherball]], cafeteria food made from circus animals, shredded newspaper, and old gym mats, among others (only the teachers eat [[French fries]] made from potatoes). In one episode, prison inmates occupied the cloakrooms in the classrooms, in an effort to save money. In another episode Lisa Simpson who has been voted student president is tricked into authorizing the cancellation of music, gym and art.  The school later finds the funding for these extra curricular activities by cancelling flu shots.

For a few episodes the school also had a tower with a winding staircase within which led to an observation area. This has since been removed. Other short period additions include a phoney disabled ramp access system built by the local [[Mafia]] and other constructions. In one episode the presentation hall is bulldozed to make way for a mini-mall.The school's address is 19 Plympton Street, revealed in the episode &quot;[[Bart on the Road]]&quot; when [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] receives an envelope addressed to the school containing his airline tickets to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bart on the Road&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= Bart on the Road |episodelink= Bart on the Road |series= The Simpsons |serieslink= The Simpsons |airdate= 1996-03-31 |season= 7 |number= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode Team Homer, school uniforms are temporarily introduced following a riot brought on by Bart wearing a &quot;Down With Homework&quot; T-Shirt to school.

Most students travel to school by bus with Otto being the regular driver.  However in The Otto Show, Otto is suspended from his job and Principal Skinner temporarily takes over his route. Additionally, in another episode the students are forced to car pool when the school bus is wrecked after Otto falls asleep at the wheel and the bus crashes into the auto wrecking yard. Furthermore on one occasion, the regular school bus breaks down and a Springfield State Prison bus is used instead.

In &quot;[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]&quot; it is shown that both Ms. Hoover and Lunch Lady Doris have access to &quot;Independent Thought Alarms&quot; which are sent to [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]]'s office and are both triggered by [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. Also in [[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]], Chalmers fires [[Ned Flanders]] only because the latter's freely express his religious views in the school. Many of the school faculty seem very bored with their jobs and do not try to help students, leaving them to unfulfilling futures. They also take full advantage of any-and-all time off that they have. Several of the teachers and staff smoke and drink. In one episode, the teachers are shown joyfully running out of the school building with the students at the end of the day and subsequently are then shown trooping back into school the following day.  [[Otto Mann]] is shown to be a user of illicit drugs, and in the episode &quot;Weekend At Burnsie's&quot;, Lisa notices a smell of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and remarks that &quot;it smells like the art teacher's office&quot;. The teachers, e.g. [[#Elizabeth Hoover|Miss Hoover]] and [[Edna Krabappel|Mrs. Krabappel]] do not seem to care whether or not the students achieve in their class, and seem to have given up on many of them.

In 1994, the naming of a new elementary school in [[Greenwood, South Carolina]] was left up to the students, and the name ''Springfield Elementary'' was chosen. The school board was unaware of the connection to ''[[The Simpsons]]'' until a protest by one group of parents, who argued that Bart was a poor role model. The name stood, and the school opened in August 1994. Bart Simpson weighed in on the controversy, in a statement from the Fox Network where he said &quot;at least they didn't call it [[Beavis and Butt-head]] Elementary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3DF1F3DF934A25750C0A962958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Chronicle | first=Carol | last=Lawson | date=1994-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snpp.com/other/articles/briefhistory.html The Simpsons Archive: &quot;A Brief History of The Simpsons&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Springfield University===
'''Springfield University''' is a large college which Homer attended in &quot;[[Homer Goes to College]].&quot; It teaches several different courses, including nuclear physics, arts management, and the meaning of cartoons, and has a [[Sports rivalry#College Football|fierce rivalry]] with Springfield A&amp;M University.

===Springfield High School===
'''Springfield High School''' is the high school in Springfield,  is most often seen in flashbacks, notably in &quot;[[The Way We Was]]&quot; when Homer and Marge tell the story of how they met. Springfield High School is seen in the present time in &quot;[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]&quot; when Marge and Homer have their high school reunion there.

==Landmarks==
===Krustylu Studios===
Krustylu Studios is where all of channel 6 shows are filmed which includes the Krusty the Clown show and the news featuring Kent Brockman. Located across from it is the Box Factory. The name is a parody of [[Desilu Studios]].

===Sleep Eazy Motel===
First seen in [[The Cartridge Family]], this is a run-down [[motel]] where everything is coin-operated, including the [[Bible]]. The name is clearly a play on &quot;sleazy motel&quot;.

===Springfield Retirement Castle===
The '''Springfield Retirement Castle''' is Springfield's retirement home for the elderly. Some noted residents of the Castle include [[Abraham Simpson|Abraham &quot;Grampa&quot; J. Simpson]] and his neighbors, [[Jasper Beardley]], and the [[Crazy Old Man]].

For Abraham Simpson, the Retirement Castle is a lonely place to be. He often gets mad when [[Simpson family|his family]] doesn't come and visit him. The door features a sign reading 'Thank you for not discussing the outside world'. The most interesting way to pass time at the home is to &quot;stake yourself out a good spot at the staring window&quot;, which overlooks nothing but a barren tree, and [[Bingo (US)|bingo]] (the prize being a [[banana]]). The staff of the home have little to no respect for the residents, doing things like vacuuming their hair during &quot;nap time&quot;, or switching their [[Intravenous therapy|IV bags]] with their [[catheter]] bags when the former is empty and the latter is full. In the episode &quot;[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]&quot; Grandpa inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend Beatrice &quot;Bea&quot; Simmons. He uses the money to refurbish and redecorate the home, after which its name is changed to Springfield Retirement Castle instead of Springfield Retirement Home. The main dining area is renamed &quot;The Beatrice Simmons Memorial Hall&quot;.

===The Springfield City Hall===

The City Hall of Springfield serves as the workplace of Mayor Quimby and the City Government. Often it is the site of town meetings regarding an issue facing the city, where the citizens vote to approve a proposal that generally causes havoc (most of the time proposed by Homer) and causes more problems. The building is based on the [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]] public library due to longtime ''The Simpsons'' background designer Lance Wilder, a former resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/chelmsford/fun/entertainment/x1278147194|title=Meet the man behind âThe Simpsonsâ|accessdate=2011-01-03|author=Barrett, Heather|date=2007-07-03|publisher=''Chelmsford Independent''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Springfield Courthouse===
The courthouse is the center for all trials and cases in Springfield. It has two judges, Judge Constance Harm, who is a tough and unforgiving judge who enjoys giving cruel punishments to criminals in her courtroom, and Judge Roy Snyder, who is known for his lenient punishments. Often the prosecutor is The Blue Haired Lawyer who also represents Mr. Burns and The Walt Disney Company and unlike Gil Gunderson or Lionel Hutz, he is a competent lawyer (but not always ethical). It appears to resemble the Hill Valley courthouse only with two columns.

=== The Springfield Stadium===
Is where the Springfield Isotopes play; they are generally sponsored by Duff Beer. It has a [[JumboTron]] and is rarely seen in the show.

===Five Corners===
Five Corners is &quot;the only geographic location in the US where five states meet&quot;. A [[boundary marker]] indicates the exact spot. The Simpsons visit Five Corners while driving to [[Itchy &amp; Scratchy Land]]. In &quot;[[The Bob Next Door]]&quot;, [[Sideshow Bob]] plots to kill Bart at the marker where the location's unique property would result in a lack of [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]], explaining it as: &quot;I can stand in one state, fire a gun in a second state, the bullet will travel through the third, hitting you in the fourth, so you fall dead in the fifth. No single act is against any law, but their sum total is the greatest murder...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bob&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Bob Next Door|episodelink=The Bob Next Door |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= Writer: [[John Frink]]; Director: [[Nancy Kruse]] |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |station= |airdate= May 16, 2010 |season=[[The Simpsons (season 21)|21]] |number=463 |minutes= |quote= I can stand in one state, fire a gun in a second state, the bullet will travel through the third, hitting you in the fourth, so you fall dead in the fifth.

==Neighboring towns==
=== Shelbyville ===
''Shelbyville'' is Springfield's neighbor and rival city. It was founded in 1796 by Shelbyville Manhattan, who advocated [[cousin couple|cousin marriage]] among his followers, causing a split between himself and Jebediah Springfield. An intense rivalry between the two cities continues today, especially in the sixth season episode &quot;[[Lemon of Troy]]&quot;, in which Shelbyville residents steal a prized lemon tree from Springfield. In several episodes, &quot;[[Lemon of Troy]]&quot; in particular, it is suggested that Shelbyville is to an extent a parallel version of Springfield. Shelbyville is also the city where Luann van Houten grew up. It also has at least one [[McDonalds]] restaurant, a Speed-E-Mart, Joe's Tavern and a school. Per &quot;[[Last Exit to Springfield]],&quot; Shelbyville was at least briefly called &quot;Morganville&quot; during Abe Simpson's youth.

Shelbyville was ranked 10th in &quot;The 10 Best [[Dystopia]]s&quot; in the December 2005 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/start.html?pg=5 |title=The 10 Best Dystopias  |accessdate=2007-12-12 |work=Wired |first=Jeremy Adam|last=Smith|year=2005|month=December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capital City ===
'''Capital City''' (often spelled '''Capitol City''' in early episodes) is the capital and largest city in the state in which the show is set. It is a major urban center, hosting major sports events, conventions, and [[United Nations]] conferences. Its nickname is ''The Windy Apple'' (a joke by the show's writers, combining the nicknames of [[New York City]]'s &quot;The Big Apple&quot; and [[Chicago]]'s &quot;The Windy City&quot;). Landmarks include a  [[Duff Beer|Duff]] brewery, possibly mimicking the Anheuser-Busch brewery in St. Louis, the Cross-town [[suspension bridge]] resembling [[San Francisco]]'s [[Golden Gate Bridge]], the Capital City Stadium, the Capital City Amphitheatre, and the intersection of 4th and D Streets. Capital City is the city where [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]] was raised (as Armin Tamzarian).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Principal and the Pauper]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brockway ===
Brockway is mentioned by [[Lyle Lanley]] (voiced by [[Phil Hartman]]) as a town to which he's sold [[monorail]] systems (&quot;[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]&quot;).

Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook are also mentioned in Episode 18 of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (TV Series)|Supernatural]]'' by [[Sam Winchester]], as locations of past [[Shtriga]] activity.

=== Ogdenville ===
Ogdenville was first mentioned in &quot;[[Marge vs. the Monorail]]&quot;, when Lyle Lanley claimed to have sold a monorail to Ogdenville. Ogdenville has also been mentioned in other episodes such as &quot;[[Saddlesore Galactica]]&quot;, [[Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bart Star]]&quot; and &quot;[[To Surveil with Love]]&quot;. In &quot;[[Eeny Teeny Maya Moe]]&quot;, Maya is from Ogdenville. Ogdenville has an outlet mall, and is separated from Springfield by a rocky desert. In &quot;[[Coming to Homerica]]&quot;, Ogdenville is a town of barley producing farms that are shut down due to tainted barley being used in a new, vegetarian [[Krusty Burger]]. Ogdenvillians are composed of [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] immigrants with thick Norwegian accents. They also are big fans of the [[Minnesota Vikings]].

===North Haverbrook===
North Haverbrook was first mentioned by [[Lyle Lanley]] in [[Marge vs. the Monorail]]. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] arrives in North Haverbrook and finds a desolate ghost town, where the faulty monorail derailed, causing a disaster and scaring away investors. North Haverbrook locals have since denied the monorail's existence, as Marge is met by a woman who works at the 'Monorail Cafe' and orders Marge to &quot;Go away! There ain't no monorail and there never was!&quot; Lanley is later attacked by the citizens of the town after his plane makes an unscheduled stop there.

North Haverbrook also appeared in &quot;[[Little Big Girl]]&quot;. After [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] is awarded a driver's license, he gets sick of countless errands and goes for a drive and eventually finds North Haverbrook, and falls in love with a girl named Darcy. In this episode, the town appears to have recovered well from the monorail disaster, as it is now changed from a ghost town to a thriving community with multiple businesses Bart enjoys. It has a romantic reputation. All signs of the monorail have also disappeared.

It also appears on a road sign as Snake drives towards Mexico with the Kwik-E-Mart on a flatbed trailer during &quot;[[Marge in Chains]]&quot;.
