==History==
===Early years===
The school was founded as a degree-granting institution on February 22, 1855, by act P.L. 46, No. 50 of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] as the '''Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania'''. [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]], Pennsylvania, became the home of the new school when [[James Irvin]] of [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]], Pennsylvania, donated {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}} of land{{ndash}} the first of {{convert|10101|acre|km2|0}} the school would eventually acquire. In 1862, the school's name was changed to the '''Agricultural College of Pennsylvania''', and with the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Land-Grant Act]], Pennsylvania selected the school in 1863 to be the state's sole land-grant college. In the following years, enrollment fell as the school tried to balance purely [[Agricultural science|agricultural studies]] with a more classic education, falling to 64 undergraduates in 1875, a year after the school's name changed once again to the '''Pennsylvania State College'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;history_short&quot; /&gt;

===President Atherton===
[[George W. Atherton]] became president of the school in 1882, and broadened the school's curriculum. Shortly after he introduced [[Engineering|engineering studies]], Penn State became one of the ten-largest engineering schools in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Penn State's [[Atherton Hall (Penn State)|Atherton Hall]], a well-furnished and centrally located residence hall, is named not after George Atherton himself, but after his wife, Frances Washburn Atherton.&lt;ref name=&quot;intercom_atherton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Descendants of Atherton and Buckhout Discover Their Roots at University Park|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/Oct10/atherton.html|work=Penn State Intercom, October 10, 2002|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grave is in front of Schwab Auditorium near [[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], marked by an engraved [[marble]] block in front of his statue.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Penn state old main summer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]]]]
In the years that followed, Penn State grew significantly, becoming the state's largest grantor of [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate degrees]] and reaching an enrollment of 5,000 in 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;history_short&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania State University{{ndash}} Mission and Public Character|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/about/historyshort.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate= September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, a system of commonwealth campuses was started by President [[Ralph Dorn Hetzel]] to provide an alternative for [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era students who were economically unable to leave home to attend college.&lt;ref name=&quot;history_short&quot; /&gt;

===Rapid growth===
In 1953, President [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of then-[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], changed the school's name to '''The Pennsylvania State University''', and the university developed rapidly under his successor [[Eric A. Walker]]. Under Walker's leadership (1956â1970), the university acquired hundreds of acres of surrounding land, and enrollment nearly tripled.&lt;ref name=&quot;history_short&quot; /&gt; In addition, in 1967, the [[Hershey Medical Center]], a college of medicine and hospital, was established in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]] with a $50&amp;nbsp;million gift from the [[Hershey Trust Company]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history_short&quot; /&gt;

===Modern era===
In the 1970s, university became a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] institution. As such, it now belongs to the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]], and is not part of the fully public [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]].

In recent years, the university's role as a leader in education in Pennsylvania has become very well-defined. In 1989, the [[Pennsylvania College of Technology]] in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]] joined ranks with the university, and in 2000, so did the [[Dickinson School of Law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dickinson_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Penn State Law{{ndash}} History|url=http://law.psu.edu/prospective_students/history|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate= September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is now the largest in Pennsylvania, and in 2003, it was credited with having the second-largest impact on the state economy of any organization, generating an economic effect of over $17 billion on a budget of $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;economic_impact&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pennsylvania State University Economic Impact Statement|url=http://econimpact.psu.edu/|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To offset the lack of funding due to the limited growth in state appropriations to Penn State, the university has concentrated its efforts on philanthropy (2003 marked the end of the Grand Destiny campaign&amp;mdash;a seven-year effort that raised over $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Grand Destiny Campaign Raises $1.371 Billion for Penn State|url=http://live.psu.edu/story/3513|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the university and its football team garnered major international media attention and criticism for [[Penn State sex abuse scandal|allegations]] that several members of its staff, from the university president down to a graduate assistant coach, covered up [[child sexual abuse]] by [[Jerry Sandusky]], a former coach.

===University Park===
The largest of university's 24 campuses, [[University Park, Pennsylvania|University Park]] is almost entirely within the boundaries of [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] borough, a site chosen to be near the geographic center of the state. With an undergraduate acceptance rate of 51 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Best Colleges: Pennsylvania State UniversityâUniversity Park |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/items/6965 |work= [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the most selective campus in the Penn State system, due primarily to the fact that students select University Park as their first-choice campus at a far greater rate than the university's other undergraduate campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;upark competitive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.edu/admissions/counselors/campuses/uppopularity.htm|title=Why Is Admission to University Park So Competitive?|author=Undergraduate Admissions Office|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date= August 29, 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060910113143/http://www.psu.edu/admissions/counselors/campuses/uppopularity.htm |archivedate= September 10, 2006 |accessdate= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fall 2010 semester, 38,594 undergraduate students and 6,223 graduate students were enrolled at University Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;enrollment upark&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/FactBook/StudentDynamic/UGGREnrollSummary.asp?TableCount=3&amp;YearCode=2006Enr | title= Undergraduate and Graduate/First Professional Fall Enrollment | work=Penn State Fact Book | publisher=University Budget Office.

[[File:PSU residence hall.JPG|thumb|left|The Irvin residence hall in West Halls]]
There are seven housing complexes located on campus for students attending the University Park campus: East Halls, North Halls, Pollock Halls, South Halls, West Halls, Eastview Terrace, and Nittany Apartments. Each complex consists of a few separate buildings that are dormitories and a commons building, which has lounges, the help desk for the complex, mailboxes for each dormitory room, a small food shop, and a cafeteria-style room. Different floors within a building in the complex may be a Special Living Option, meaning students can sign up for that floor if they are in that major.

=====Student organizations=====
As of November 2009, 778 student organizations were recognized at the University Park campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;listoforgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Index of Student Organizations at Penn State | url=http://www.sa.psu.edu/usa/studentactivities/allrsos.asp | accessdate= November 23, 2009 | author=Division of Student Affairs | publisher = Pennsylvania State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the university has one of the largest [[Greek organizations|Greek]] systems in the country, with approximately 12 percent of the University Park population affiliated.

For additional information on media related to Penn State â including Penn State Live, the official news source of the University â see the Media section below.

[http://live.psu.edu/ Penn State Live] is the official news source of the university. The student-run newspaper is ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''. It is published every weekday while classes are in session. Since the summer of 1996, the traditional paper publication has been supplemented by an online edition, known as ''The Digital Collegian''. ''[[Onward State]]'' has recently{{When|date=February 2011}} gained standing as an alternative media outlet to ''The Daily Collegian''. It is a blog centered on the Penn State community. Also long-time local web site [http://www.statecollege.com/ StateCollege.com] has expanded its news coverage of the university and the local community. In addition, Penn State's newspaper readership program provides free copies of ''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as local and regional newspapers depending on the campus location (for example, the ''[[Centre Daily Times]]'' in University Park). This program, initiated by then-President Graham Spanier in 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newspapers.psu.edu/ | title = Newspaper Readership Program | publisher = Pennsylvania State University | accessdate = February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; has since been instituted on nearly 400 other universities across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;newspaper2&quot;&gt;{{dead link|date=November 2011|reason=link is to dynamic page}} {{cite web | url = http://www.usatoday.com/educate/readers/overview.html | title = Collegiate Readership Program: Program Overview | work = [[USA Today]] | accessdate = February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Vie'' (the Life), the university's annual student yearbook, has been in production documenting student life continuously since 1890.&lt;ref name=&quot;psu_lavie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://psulavie.org/|publisher=PSU Lavie|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Vie 1987,'' edited by David Beagin, won a College Gold Crown for Yearbooks award from the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1988 Collegiate Crown Recipients |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cspa/docs/contests-and-critiques/crown-awards/recipients/1988-collegiate-crown.html|publisher= [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]] |accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student-run radio station is [[WKPS|The LION 90.7 fm (WKPS-FM)]]. Founded in 1995 as a replacement for Penn State's original student radio station WDFM, The LION broadcasts from the ground floor of the [[HUB-Robeson Center]], serving the Penn State and State College communities with alternative music and talk programming, including live coverage of home Penn State football games. The LION's signal can be heard in the greater State College area at 90.7 FM and anywhere in the world via its live 24/7 webstream at [http://www.thelion.fm/ www.theLION.fm]. The LION's programming grid can be found at [http://www.thelion.fm/shows/ www.thelion.fm/shows/].

In addition, the [[Penn State College of Communications]] operates [http://psucomradio.com/ ComRadio]. It was founded in the spring of 2003 as an internet-based audio laboratory and co-curricular training environment for aspiring student broadcasters. ComRadio is most well known for its coverage of most major Penn State sporting events. ComRadio also airs student-produced Penn State news. Other programming includes student talk shows, political coverage, AP syndicated news and soft rock music. In recent years, ComRadio broadcasters have won numerous state awards for their on-air work.  The station's sports department prides itself on the broadcasts of every home and away football game, including bowl games, and its coverage of the NFL Draft live from New York City.

''Onward State'' is a student-run [[blog]] geared towards members of the university's community. The blog provides news, features, and event-listings. Founded in November 2008, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' named the blog the &quot;Best Alternative Media Outlet&quot; in February 2009.  Alison Go, a blogger of ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' organized the contest &quot;Best Alternative Media Outlet&quot; at the beginning of 2009.  ''Onward State'', still a fledgling organization, was surprisingly nominated.  Pitted against ''Onward State'' were seasoned blogs from [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and an [[Ivy League]] conglomerate.  Snatching 24.76 percent of the vote, ''Onward State'' finished in first place, pleasantly surprising the Penn State bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Go|first=Alison|title=Best Alternative Media Outlet: Onward State|url=http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/paper-trail/2009/02/18/best-alternative-media-outlet-onward-state|accessdate= November 12, 2011| publisher = ''The Paper Trail'' (blog of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'') |date=February 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/polls/best-alternative-media-outlet-2008/results.html &quot;Which Nontraditional Medium Do You Prefer?&quot;] ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]'' first acknowledged ''Onward State'' at the time of the blog's victory.  The two ''Collegian'' articles brought greater awareness of the blog to the university's community.  In an interview with ''The Collegian'' about next year's contest, Davis Shaver explained &quot;We have big ambitions... I think that we're just going to be more established, more of a name within the Penn State community by then. There is a strong possibility of being Alternative Media repeat champions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karas|first=Kristen|title=Last-Minute Voting Propels Student-Run Blog to Victory in National Poll|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2009/02/19/lastminute_voting_propels_stud.aspx|accessdate= November 12, 2011|work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |date=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student-run humor magazine is ''Phroth'', which publishes two to four issues each year. Its roots date back to 1909 when it was called ''Froth''. Several ''Froth'' writers and editors have gone on to win fame: [[Julius J. Epstein]] wrote the screenplay for the film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942) and won three [[Academy Award]]s; [[Jimmy Dugan]] wrote for the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[National Geographic]]'', and ''The New York Times''; and [[Ronald Bonn]] was a producer with ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phroth Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Phroth Magazine | url=http://www.phroth.com/history/ | accessdate= December 8, 2008| author=Phroth | publisher = Pennsylvania State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Allegations of discrimination=====
Penn State has been the subject of controversy for several issues of discrimination. 
Following some violent attacks on African-Americans in downtown State College in 1988 and complaints that Penn State was not adequately recruiting African-American faculty and students to representative population levels, student activists occupied Old Main and demanded that Penn State do more to recruit minority students and address intolerance toward minority students on campus, as well as in the local community.  After President Bryce Jordan canceled a promised meeting with students and organizations in the Paul Robeson Cultural Center on April 8, 1988, 250 students and activists nonviolently occupied Penn State's Telecommunications building on campus. The following morning, 50 state troopers and 45 local and campus police, equipped with helmets, batons, and rubber gloves, entered the building as the crowd outside sang âWe Shall Overcomeâ, arresting 89 individuals for trespassing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]''. April 11, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  All charges were later dismissed.

In 1990 a vice provost for educational equity was appointed to lead a five-year strategic plan to &quot;create an environment characterized by equal access and respected participation for all groups and individuals irrespective of cultural differences.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vp ed equity&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.equity.psu.edu/ | title=Office of the Vice Provost for Educational Equity | publisher=Pennsylvania State University | accessdate= February 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;framework mission&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.equity.psu.edu/Framework/climate.asp | title=Campus Climate and Intergroup Relations | work=A Framework To Foster Diversity at Penn State, 2004â2009 | author = Office of the Vice Provost for Educational Equity | publisher = Pennsylvania State University | date= December 12, 2005 | accessdate= February 13, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070107072319/http://www.equity.psu.edu/Framework/climate.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, discrimination issues include the handling of death threats in 1992 and 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;village threats&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2002/04/04-26-02tdc/04-29-02dnews-01.asp | title = University, Students Respond to Threats | last = Grote | first = Danielle | date = April 29, 2002| work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] | accessdate = February 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1992/01/01-28-92tdc/01-28-92dops-column-01.asp |title=African Americans Should Not Trust 'Devilish' White People | work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |date= |accessdate= August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Amanda |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1992/02/02-03-92tdc/02-03-92dnews-02.asp |title=Collegian Columnist Generating National Stir |work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |date= |accessdate= August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andron |first=Scott |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1992/08/08-04-92tdc/08-04-92dnews-4.asp |title=Case Might Affect Policy | work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] |date= |accessdate= August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; controversy around [[LGBT]] issues,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

In addition to the University Park campus, 19 [[Satellite campus|campus locations]] throughout the state offer enrollment for undergraduate students. Over 60 percent of Penn State first-year students begin their education at a location other than University Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students Adapt to University Park|url=http://admissions.psu.edu/life/stories/?story=77|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate= September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these satellite campuses offer a limited number of degree programs, but any student in good academic standing is guaranteed a spot at University Park to finish his or her degree if required or desired. Most students do complete their degree program at University Park (known as &quot;change of assignment,&quot; since commonwealth campuses are subsidiary to University Park and therefore &quot;transferring&quot; is an inaccurate term).&lt;ref name=&quot;whycampus2006&quot;&gt;&quot;Why Should You Start Your Education at a Penn State Campus?&quot; Published by the Undergraduate Admissions Office, Pennsylvania State University. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special-mission campuses===
The [[Dickinson School of Law|Dickinson School of Law of The Pennsylvania State University]] was founded in 1834 and is the oldest law school in Pennsylvania. It merged with Penn State in 2000. Students now have the choice of studying in either Carlisle or University Park, with classes teleconferenced between the two locations using high-tech audiovisual equipment. The school is ranked among the top 100 law schools nationally. It has produced a number of governors, members of congress, and judges. A number of attorneys comprise the faculty and lead several centers and institutes devoted to specific practice areas. The school's alternative dispute resolution program is ranked among the top 10 nationally. The law school also houses the School of International Affairs.

The [[Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies]] is a special mission campus offering master's degrees, master's certification, and continuing professional education. Located in [[Malvern, Pennsylvania|Malvern]], Pennsylvania, it also offers classes at the old [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]].

[[Penn State Hershey Medical Center|Penn State Hershey Medical Center and College of Medicine]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]], Pennsylvania, is the university's medical school and teaching hospital. Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center has become only the ninth hospital in the United States and 16th worldwide to implant the CardioWest temporary Total Artificial Heart when a 60-year-old man suffering from end-stage heart failure received the device in May 2008.

[[Pennsylvania College of Technology]], in [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], Pennsylvania, offers certificates as well as degrees in over 10 technical fields.

In 1998, the university launched [[Penn State World Campus]], or Penn State Online, which offers more than 60 online education programs, degrees, and certificates. Distance education has a long history at Penn State, one of the first universities in the country to offer a correspondence course for remote farmers in 1892. Examples of online programs include an MBA, master of professional studies in homeland security, a bachelor of science in nursing, and postbaccalaureate certificates in geographic information systems and applied behavior analysis. Penn State's World Campus offers 18 graduate degrees, 21 graduate certificates, 17 undergraduate degrees, and 11 undergraduate certificates. World Campus students come from all 50 U.S. states, more than 40 countries, and six continents.

==Colleges==
The University Park campus is organized into fourteen distinct colleges:&lt;ref name=&quot;campusescolleges&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.edu/ur/cmpcoll.html|title=Campuses and Colleges|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|accessdate= January 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization and administration==
Penn State is a &quot;state-related&quot; university, part of Pennsylvania's [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]]. As such, although it receives funding from the Commonwealth and is connected to the state through its board of trustees, it is otherwise independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006â2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=&quot;state approps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2006/03/03-01-06tdc/03-01-06dnews-07.asp|title=Spanier Testifies for More Funding|last=Horan|first=Kevin|date= March 1, 2006|accessdate= January 27, 2007| work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports concerning the 2007â2008 fiscal year indicated that Pennsylvania Governor [[Ed Rendell]] is recommending a 1.6 percent increase in state appropriations.&lt;ref name=&quot;approps 0708&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/02/02-06-07tdc/02-06-07dweb-03.asp|title=Penn State To Receive Increased Appropriations|last=Boyer|first=Lauren|date= February 6, 2007 |accessdate= February 6, 2007| work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State's appropriation request, submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September, requested a 6.8 percent increase in funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;approp request 07-08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budget.psu.edu/President/AppropRequest200708/Table2.asp|title=2007â08 Appropriation Request|accessdate= February 6, 2007|publisher=University Budget Office. Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|11|13}}

===Board of Trustees===
The university is governed by the 32-member board of trustees. Its members include the university's president, the [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor of the Commonwealth]], and the state Secretaries of Agriculture, Education, and Conservation and Natural Resources. The other members include six trustees appointed by the Governor, nine elected by alumni, and six elected by Pennsylvania agricultural societies. Six additional trustees are elected by a board representing business and industry enterprises.&lt;ref name=&quot;trusteesmembership&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/selection.html|title=Membership Selection|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate students do not elect any trustees; the court case ''[[Benner v. Oswald]]'' ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of trustees.

As of 2009, the chair of the board of trustees was James S. Broadhurst, a 1965 graduate of Penn State and CEO of [[Eat'n Park|Eat'n Park Hospitality Group, Inc.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;broadhurst&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Penn State Board Elects Broadhurst as Chair, Garban as Vice-Chair|url=http://live.psu.edu/story/21836|publisher=Penn State Office of University Relations|date= January 19, 2007|accessdate= January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main responsibilities of the board are to select the president of Penn State, to determine the goals and strategic direction of the University, and to approve the annual budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;trusteesrole&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/governance.html|title=Role of the Board of Trustees in University Governance|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular meetings of the board are held bi-monthly and take place primarily on the University Park campus, although on occasion meetings are held at other locations within the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;trusteesmeetings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.edu/trustees/meetings.html|title=Meeting Dates, Agendas, and Minutes|publisher=Penn State Board of Trustees|accessdate= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
{{See also|Category:Presidents of Pennsylvania State University}}
[[File:Penn state old main summer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old Main (Pennsylvania State University)|Old Main]], the main administrative building of Penn State, located at University Park.]]
The president of the University is selected by the board and is given the authority for actual control of the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, part of this responsibility is delegated by the president to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;trusteesrole&quot;/&gt; Provost [[Rodney Erickson]] became President on November 9, 2011, after President [[Graham Spanier]] was fired in the aftermath of the [[Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpanierFired&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/penn_state_graham_spanier.html|title=Graham Spanier Ousted as Penn State President in Wake of Jerry Sandusky Scandal|newspaper=[[The Patriot-News]]|date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the University. As of November 2012, the provost is Rob Pangborn&lt;ref&gt;http://live.psu.edu/story/56369&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean For Undergraduate Education is Jeremy Cohen.

===Student Government===
The university has a long history of student government with student inclusion in university decision-making capacities, as provided for in the Board of Trustee's Standing Orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/trustees/pdf/standingorders.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  The University Park Undergraduate Association (UPUA) is the [[Student governments in the United States|student government]] of the 38,594&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Undergraduate and Graduate/First Professional Enrollment Fall Enrollment 2010 and 2009 |url=http://upua.psu.edu/ |accessdate= May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[undergraduate]] students at Penn State's University Park campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University Park Undergraduate Association |url=http://upua.psu.edu/ |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate= January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UPUA is composed of an Assembly of Student Representatives, an Executive Board, and a Board of Arbitration. UPUA is currently led by President TJ Bard and Vice President Courtney Lennartz. The Assembly is the [[legislative]] body of UPUA and is composed of many elected positions whose constituencies range from all of the academic units of Penn State to the areas of residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Assembly of Student Representatives |url=http://pennstateupua.com/?q=genassembly |publisher= Pennsylvania State University |accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also student governance bodies in each college. The most prominent college councils include the Earth and Mineral Science Student Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ems.psu.edu/current_undergrad_students/student_council |title=Current Undergraduate Students â Student Council &amp;#124; Penn State College of Earth and Mineral Sciences |publisher=Ems.psu.edu |date= |accessdate= September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Liberal Arts Undergraduate Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/psulauc/ |title=psulauc |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate= September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, students that live in the residence halls are represented by the Association of Residence Hall Students (ARHS) acts as an independent student organization, addressing on-campus issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Association of Residence Hall Students |url=http://www.clubs.psu.edu/arhs |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate= August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the residence areas on the University Park campus also features its own association.

The [[commonwealth campus]]es of the university are governed by the Council of Commonwealth Student Governments (CCSG), formerly known as the Council of Branch Campus Student Governments (CBCSG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://php.scripts.psu.edu/clubs/up/ccsg/index.php |title=CCSG &amp;#124; Council of Commonwealth Student Governments |publisher=Php.scripts.psu.edu |date= |accessdate= September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCSG meets typically three times a semester at University Park, with two representatives from each commonwealth campus. The CCSG Central Staff, while based out of the University Park Campus, deals with issues affecting commonwealth campus students. CCSG is the oldest undergraduate student government at Penn State and is currently led by President Peter Khoury and Vice President Justin Cortes.

===Education===
As of September 2009, only 24 Pennsylvania colleges and universities held [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] accreditation in business and only four in accounting. The [[Smeal College of Business]], The [[Sam and Irene Black School of Business]], [[Penn State Harrisburg]], and [[Penn State Great Valley School of Graduate Professional Studies|Penn State Great Valley]] were among the institutions accredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacsb&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aacsb.edu/General/InstLists.asp?lid=3 | title = Schools Accredited in Business â ordered by country, state, name | publisher = The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business | accessdate = February 28, 2007}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university offers an accelerated [[Pre-medical|Premedical]]-[[Medical education in the United States|Medical]] Program in cooperation with [[Thomas Jefferson University|Jefferson Medical College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmm&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html | title = Penn State's Accelerated Premedical-Medical Program | publisher = Penn State Eberly College of Science | accessdate = April 28, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050414083712/http://www.science.psu.edu/premed/6yrpremedprogram.html |archivedate = April 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the program spend two or three years at the university before attending medical school at Jefferson.

Recently, a joint venture between the [[Eberly College of Science]] and the [[Smeal College of Business]] created an integrated undergraduate/graduate program to give highly motivated students the opportunity to receive a Bachelor's Degree in Science and an MBA two to five years sooner than those pursuing a traditional path. The [http://www.science.psu.edu/bsmba BS/MBA Program] prepares individuals to be future leaders of the world's scientific organizations and is led by Mr. Peter Tombros and Dr. James Gardner.

===Research===
[[File:Forum PSU.jpg|thumb|right|The Forum Building is a classroom building with four classrooms, each capable of containing over 300 students.]]
According to the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]], the university is a research university with very high research activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Pennsylvania State University-Main Campus|url=http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=214777&amp;start_page=institution.php&amp;clq={%22first_letter%22%3A%22P%22} |publisher=Carnegie Classifications |accessdate= November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 10,000 students are enrolled in the university's graduate school (including the law and medical schools), and over 70,000 degrees have been awarded since the school was founded in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About the Graduate School | url=http://www.gradsch.psu.edu/aboutus/ |date= January 19, 2009 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University| accessdate = August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State's research and development expenditure has been on the rise in recent years. For [[fiscal year]] 2007, the [[National Science Foundation]] reported that Penn State had spent $652,144,000 on [[R&amp;D]] and ranked 11th among U.S. universities and colleges in R&amp;D spending.&lt;ref&gt;

The Applied Research Lab (ARL), located near the [[University Park, Pennsylvania|University Park]] campus, has been a research partner with the [[United States Department of Defense]] since 1945 and conducts research primarily in support of the [[United States Navy]]. It is the largest component of Penn State's research efforts statewide, with over 1,000 researchers and other staff members.&lt;ref name=&quot;research 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.psu.edu/about/annrep06.pdf|format=PDF | title=Annual Report of Research Activity, FY 2006 | publisher = Office of the Senior Vice President for Research, Pennsylvania State University | date= January 8, 2007 | accessdate= January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arl.psu.edu/about.html|title=About ARL: Who and What We Are|author=Applied Research Lab|accessdate= January 27, 2007 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Materials Research Institute was created to coordinate the highly diverse and growing materials activities across Penn State's University Park campus. With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutmri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/AboutMRI/index.asp|title=About MRI|author=Materials Research Institute|accessdate= August 2, 2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mri.psu.edu/|title=Materials Research Institute|author=Materials Research Institute|accessdate= August 27, 2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university was one of the founding members of the [[Worldwide Universities Network]] (WUN), a partnership that includes 17 research-led universities in the United States, Asia, and Europe. The network provides funding, facilitates collaboration between universities, and coordinates exchanges of faculty members and graduate students among institutions. Former Penn State president [[Graham Spanier]] is a former vice-chair of the WUN.&lt;ref name=&quot;psu wun&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Penn State's mascot is the [[Nittany Lion]], a representation of a type of [[mountain lion]] that once roamed what is now University Park. The school's official colors, now blue and white, were originally black and dark pink.  Penn State participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] and in the [[Big Ten Conference]] for most sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncaa directory&quot;&gt;
{{cite web |title=NCAA Members by Division |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/divisionListing |publisher= [[National College Athletic Association]] |quote=Select Division 1 and press Run Report |accessdate= August 2, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A few sports participate in different conferences: men's volleyball in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (EIVA); men's [[lacrosse]] in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] (CAA); women's lacrosse in American Lacrosse conference; and hockey (American Collegiate Hockey Association). The fencing teams operate as independents.

Athletic teams at Penn State have won 68 national collegiate team championships (37 [[NCAA]], 2 consensus [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|Division I football]] titles, 6 [[AIAW Champions|AIAW]], 3 USWLA, 1 [[Women's International Bowling Congress|WIBC]], and 4 national titles in boxing, 11 in men's soccer and one in wrestling in years prior to NCAA sponsorship).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.gopsusports.com/trads/national-champions.html Penn State championship history]&quot;.

Since the 2007 season the university has won 10 National Championships in 5 different sports, the most among current Division 1-A teams.

Since joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] in 1991, Penn State teams have won 60 regular season conference titles and 13 tournament titles, including fourteen consecutive titles in women's soccer (longest streak in women's Big Ten athletic history),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State has one of the most successful overall athletic programs in the country, as evidenced by its rankings in the [[NACDA Director's Cup]], a list compiled by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. From the Cup's inception in the 1993â1994 season through the 2007â2008 season, the Nittany Lions have finished in the top 10 eight times and the top five four times, and have finished in the top 25 every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcup&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;Since the 2007 season, Penn State has won ten National Championships in 5 different sports, the most among current Division 1-A teams.

In 1999, ''Sporting News'' named Penn State as the country's best overall athletic program, citing its consistent and wide-ranging athletic successes along with its athletes' long-standing tradition of excelling in the classroom. Penn State placed 6th in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'''s top 25 rankings for athletic success for the 2007â08 academic year, the highest of any Big Ten school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/sioncampus/07/01/2008-top-25-ncaa-rankings/index.html| title = SI's Top 25 Rankings for the 2007â08 College Sports Year | last = | first = | date = July 16, 2008 | work = [[Sports Illustrated]] | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gopsusports.com/genrel/071808aab.html| title = Nittany Lions No. 6 in SI's Rankings of 2007â08 Athletic Success | last = | first = | date = July 18, 2008 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State student-athletes receive academic honors that often far exceed those awarded to other Division 1-A schools. In the 2007â08 academic year, a school record 261 Penn State Student-Athletes earned Academic All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] honors. Penn State leads the Big Ten with 3,069 selections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gopsusports.com/genrel/052808aaa.html| title = School Record 261 Student-Athletes Earn Academic All-Big Ten Honors| last = | first = | date = May 28, 2008 | publisher = Penn State Athletics | accessdate = July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite widespread success in the overall athletic program, however, the school is best known for its [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|football team]], which draws a very large following. Penn State's Beaver Stadium has the second largest [[seating capacity]] of any stadium in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2008/03/17/beaver_to_rule_arenas.aspx| title = Beaver To Rule Arenas | last =Fortuna | first = Matt | date = March 17, 2008| work = [[The Daily Collegian (Penn State)|The Daily Collegian]] | accessdate = September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly behind Michigan Stadium. The football team was led by coach [[Joe Paterno]], who at 84 was fired in 2011, his 45th year as head coach.  Joe Paterno was in a close competition with [[Bobby Bowden]], the head coach for [[Florida State]], for the most wins ever in Division I-A (now the FBS) history. This competition effectively ended with Paterno still leading following Bowden's retirement after the [[2010 Gator Bowl]].  Entering the 2010 campaign, Paterno had 394 total career wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Paterno No. 13 on Sporting News List of Greatest Coaches of All Time |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/40745 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |date= July 30, 2009 |accessdate= August 3, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
He won his 400th game, a huge comeback with the final score 35â21 against Northwestern University, on November 6, 2010.
In 2007, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Cael Sanderson]] became the head coach of Penn State's wrestling team.

The university opened a new [[Penn State All-Sports Museum]] in February 2002. This two-level {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3|sing=on}} museum is located inside Beaver Stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports museum&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=GoPSUsports.com â Official Home of Penn State Athletics | url=http://www.gopsusports.com/hallfame/psu-hallfame.html | publisher = Pennsylvania State University | accessdate = July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the school funded athletics, club sports also play a major role in the University, with over 68 club sport organizations meeting regularly to date. Many club teams compete nationally in their respective sports. The Penn State Ski Team, which competes as part of the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) in the Allegheny Conference, as well as the Penn State Swim Club, which competes in the American Swimming Association â University League (ASAU), are just a few examples. Some other clubs include baseball, [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[karate]], [[crew (sport)|crew]], and [[sailing]].

Penn State's most well known athletic cheer is &quot;We are...Penn State.&quot; Typically, the students and cheerleaders shout, &quot;We are,&quot; followed by a response of &quot;Penn State&quot; from the rest of the fans. This is typically done three or four times, and followed by &quot;Thank you...&quot; &quot;... you're welcome!&quot; when completed. The cheer is by no means restricted to sporting events, as prospective students touring the campus (with the aid of either the Lion Scouts or Lion Ambassadors) will hear plenty of these chants from current students.

Since 2001, the university, along with all schools in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], has participated in the &quot;Big Ten Challenge&quot; website, which is a &quot;competitive&quot; clearinghouse of alumni donation statistics for member schools. Results are tracked to determine a percentage of each school's alumni from the previous decade who gave to their alma mater each calendar year (during the 2005â2006 year, alumni donations from 1996 to 2005 were tallied).
