<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="31799211" ns="0" title="2011 Nakba Day"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Nakba Day''' in '''2011''' was the [[Nakba Day|annual day of commemoration]] for the [[Palestinian people]] marking the [[Nakba]] - the [[Creation of Israel#Demographic outcome|displacement]] that accompanied the [[Israeli Independence |creation]] of [[Israel]] in 1948. Generally held on May 15, commemorative events in 2011 began on May 10, in the form of march by Palestinian [[Arab citizens of Israel]] on Israel's [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|Independence Day]]. On May 13, clashes between stone-throwing youths and Israeli security forces in [[East Jerusalem]] resulted in one Palestinian fatality, and clashes continued there and in parts of the [[West Bank]] in the days following.

In an unprecedented development on May 15, thousands of people, mostly [[Palestinian refugees]] from [[Lebanon]], the West Bank, [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Syria]], marched towards the ceasefire borders with Israel.&lt;ref name=GideonBiger170511&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/israel-was-infiltrated-but-no-real-borders-were-crossed-1.362215|title=Israel was infiltrated, but no real borders were crossed|author=Gideon Biger|date=17 May 2011|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Daragmeh/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/dead-as-israelis-open-fire-on-protesters/story-e6frf7lf-1226056390986|title=At least 12 people killed as Israelis open fire on border protesters|author=Jack Guez|publisher=Herald Sun|date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen Palestinians were killed and hundreds wounded, most by live ammunition as the [[Israeli Defense Force]]s tried to hold them back across the line. Dozens of Israelis were also injured. More than a hundred protestors from Syria managed to breach the fence and enter the [[Israeli occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] [[Golan Heights]], and at least one made it all the way to [[Tel Aviv]]. 

Attempts by march organizers in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]] to reach their countries' borders with [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and Israel, respectively, were largely thwarted by domestic security forces. At a mass demonstration outside the Israeli Embassy in [[Cairo]], the [[Egyptian Army]] used tear gas and live fire to disperse the crowd, wounding 353. In other events in Tel Aviv, an Israeli man was killed and others wounded by an Arab truck driver who claimed he lost control of his vehicle, but is suspected by Israeli police of having purposefully carried out a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;.

Organized by calls put out by Palestinians on [[Facebook]], the border marches were given impetus by the [[2010â2011 Middle East and North Africa protests|revolutions and uprisings]] taking place in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Daragmeh&gt;[http://www.heraldextra.com/news/world/article_10865d67-e7a6-57cf-af4b-dd705e5a19b5.html Palestinians test tactic of unarmed mass marches].&lt;/ref&gt; The American and Israeli governments said the marches were coordinated by the [[Iran]]ian and the [[Syria]]n governments to shift public attention from domestic unrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;HAARETZ&quot;&gt;[http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/1228099.html].

==Background==
''Al-Nakba'' is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for &quot;the catastrophe&quot; or &quot;the disaster&quot; and is used by Palestinians to refer to the loss of Palestine, the displacement and dispersal that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948.&lt;ref name=Kamrava&gt;{{cite book|title=The modern Middle East: a political history since the First World War|author=Mehran Kamrava|page=125|edition=Illustrated|publisher=University of California Press|year=2005|ISBN=0520241509, 9780520241503|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=SKSwpfLUYDEC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=nakba+%22loss+of+palestine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=x-DQTZjVEIX3sgbE5OjFCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nakba%20%22loss%20of%20palestine%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Farsoun&gt;{{cite book| url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=3ntlybo9BEQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=nakba+refugees+return&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7EzNTYKhOYvasgal_9WxCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=nakba%20refugees%20return&amp;f=false|page=14|title=Culture and customs of the Palestinians|author=Samih K.

Nakba Day is commemorated annually, generally on May 15. Commemorations among Palestinian [[Arab citizens of Israel]] are often held on [[Israeli Independence Day]] which falls on the [[Hebrew calendar]] date of [[Iyar|5 Iyar]] (in 2011, May 10). On that day, several thousand [[internally displaced Palestinians]] and their supporters held their 14th annual &quot;March of Return&quot; between [[al-Damun]] and [[al-Ruways]], two [[List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian villages depopulated]] during the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]].&lt;ref name=AIC&gt;[http://www.alternativenews.org/english/index.php/topics/israeli-society/3587-thousands-mark-palestinian-nakba-in-galilee- Thousands Mark Palestinian Nakba in Galilee]&lt;/ref&gt; At least 1,000 Arabs and Jews held the first public commemoration of the Nakba in [[Jaffa]] on May 14 to protest the &quot;Nakba Law&quot; passed by the Israeli [[Knesset]] in March. Organized by members of youth movements in Jaffa and [[Lod]], Arab Members of [[Knesset]] did not attend the protest, where demonstrators chanted pro-Palestinian, [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]], and anti-Israel slogans, and blocked traffic along Jaffa's main street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068464,00.html |title=Hundreds mark 'Nakba Day' in Jaffa - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartman&quot;&gt;Hartman, Ben.

In anticipation of Nakba Day events, the Israeli military sealed off the [[West Bank]] for 24 hours and deployed [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] regiments and Border Police gendarmes. Inside Israel, police prepared for Arab protests and possible violence, and security forces were deployed in the predominantly Arab [[Wadi Ara]] region. A heavy police presence was reported in many of [[Jerusalem]]'s Arab neighborhoods, and included both regular police officers and Border Police gendarmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maan1&quot;/&gt;

Israeli forces were provided with riot and crowd-control gear, and were ordered to use live fire only under extreme circumstances. Israel's political leadership instructed the IDF not to take risks and assume major precautions. Soldiers were ordered not to intervene in peaceful demonstrations that did not target soldiers, settlers, or infrastructure. The IDF said that it wanted &quot;zero funerals&quot; during the demonstrations. Senior field officers were deployed in every sector of operations to monitor the situation and assist in the decision-making process. Israeli commanders also monitored internet chatter and social media websites to get a clear sense of the Palestinian street's mood. IDF Brigades were also trained to deal with clashes between Palestinians and settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4067434,00.html |title=IDF gears for 'Nakba Day' - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4067158,00.html |title=IDF chief warns of violence on 'Nakba Day' - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4067922,00.html |title=The goal: Zero funerals - Israel Opinion, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizers in Egypt had been preparing for weeks to implement the plans for a mass march to the border.&lt;ref name=Philips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bikya/&gt; In addition to demanding the [[right of return]] for Palestinian refugees, several demands specific to Egypt were added by Cairo organizers, including the opening of the Rafah border on a permanent basis, the release of all Palestinian prisoners in Egyptian jails, and an end to the export of Egyptian gas to Israel and all other &quot;humiliating agreements with the Zionist state&quot;.&lt;ref name=AhramO/&gt; 

On the Friday (May 13) before Nakba Day, thousands demonstrated in [[Cairo]]'s [[Tahrir Square, Cairo|Tahrir Square]] in solidarity with Palestinians (and [[Copts]]). On Saturday, thousands were planning to make their way toward the [[Rafah crossing]] with the [[Gaza Strip]] in convoys set to depart from Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Damietta, North Sinai. Gharbiya, Beni Suef, Assiut, Qena and Sohag.&lt;ref name=Bikya/&gt;&lt;ref name=AhramO/&gt; However, an order from the Supreme Council of Armed Forces to tourism companies not to send buses to the convoy organizers left them without sufficient transportation and the few buses they did manage to procure were stopped by the army.&lt;ref name=Bikya/&gt; The blockage of access by Egyptian forces to the [[Sinai Peninsula]], meant that only about 80 activists managed to reach the border with Rafah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=387910 Egyptians rally at Rafah for Palestinian rights].

At the Israeli Embassy in Cairo on May 15th, thousands gathered for a demonstration.

===Israel===
On 15 May, about 25 Arab-Israeli students gathered near [[Avivim]] alongside the border with Lebanon to commemorate Nakba Day. Israeli police ordered them to leave the area. A female attorney among the protesters asked why and was slapped by an Israeli police commander. The protestors said they could not leave immediately because they were waiting for their bus to arrive, and that they were attacked by security forces who fired tear gas. Israeli authorities said the group had no permit to protest and that the area had been declared a closed military zone because of the escalating border disturbances. A police statement said when they refused to leave, reasonable force was used to remove them, and eight people were arrested.&lt;ref name=Watch&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4069475,00.html Watch: Police commander slaps Arab protester]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political arm of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Jordan, the [[Islamic Action Front]], condemned police actions which they described as &quot;shocking&quot; stating: &quot;We condemn the attack, which is part of government policies to impose its will on the people, and we demand an end to such policies that have harmed Jordan's image.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=388312 Jordan police say 25 hurt in Nakba clashes].

===Palestinian territories===
On 13 May, protests took place throughout the West Bank, primarily at the weekly Friday protests against the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|separation fence]]. Near [[Nabi Salih]], dozens of Palestinians, Israeli leftists, and foreign activists clashed with IDF forces who said they were dispersed for throwing stones. Protestors reported 10 injuries. Similar protests took place in [[Na'alin]] and [[Umm Salamuna]], south of [[Bethlehem]], where six were arrested and the area sealed off by the IDF. A protest was also held near [[Bil'in]].&lt;ref name=Efraim&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068181,00 http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068181,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian demonstrators marched on the [[Qalandia]] checkpoint on May 15. Organizers had previously convened seminars on strategies for non-violent resistance to prepare for a march on the [[Qalandia]] checkpoint on May 15. Several of them were arrested by [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] police in the month before the protest date. Representatives from Bi'lin, Nil'in and Nabi Salih, villages known for their grassroots weekly protests against the separation barrier, attended the protest which began at around 10:30am on May 15. More than 1,000 protestors marched through the Qalandia refugee camp until they reached within 100 meters of the checkpoint, where Israeli forces used tear gas to disperse them.&lt;ref name=JQ&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/05/201151611522564602.html Green shoots emerge at Qalandia checkpoint]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donnison&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13417788 Palestinians emboldened by Arab Spring]&lt;/ref&gt; A standoff ensued that lasted more than seven hours between Israeli soldiers and around 100 Palestinian protesters who threw stones as Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets.&lt;ref name=JQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Donnison/&gt; Israeli undercover officers in plain clothes carrying pistols ran into the crowd from time to time and made arrests.&lt;ref name=Donnison/&gt; In several incidents, Palestinians took cover behind ambulances while throwing rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/144186 |title=Camera Doesnât Lie: Attackers Hide Behind Ambulances - Defense/Middle East - Israel News |publisher=Israel National News |date= |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80 Palestinians, including three paramedics, were injured, and 20 were hospitalized.

One demonstrator, Milad Sayyid Ayyash, was shot in the [[Silwan]] neighborhood either by Israeli security forces or a private security guard, and died in hospital the following day. About 30 demonstrators and four police officers and gendarmes were injured during the clashes, and 70 Palestinians were arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJE&quot;/&gt; 

On 14 May, a funeral procession for Milad Sayyid Ayyash passed through Silwan, where some participants threw stones at Jewish homes. Palestinians also threw stones at police and vehicles sporting Israeli flags for independence day throughout east Jerusalem. Five police officers were injured by stone-throwing, and one was hospitalized. Security forces arrested 13 Palestinians. In the Arab-Israeli city of [[Qalansawe]], residents also threw stones at police.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068533,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartman&quot;/&gt; At least 1,000 Arabs and Jews from across Israel attended a procession in [[Jaffa]], marching down Jaffa's main street to a park in the [[Ajami]] neighborhood, where a rally and concert by Arab-Israeli hip-hop group [[DAM (band)|DAM]] was held. The demonstrators waved Palestinian flags and signs, and loudly chanted pro-Palestinian, Arab nationalist, and anti-Israel slogans. There was a very small police presence, and no counter-protests. Police blocked traffic from reaching the demonstration. However, a minor incident took place prior to the demonstration when a group of protesters arrived at the promenade in [[Tel Aviv]] and left their bus while waving Palestinian flags, prompting passerby to spit on and curse them. The protesters responded with slurs and returned to the bus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4068464,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, hundreds of Palestinians clashed with IDF and police forces at the Qalandiya checkpoint and throughout [[Jerusalem]], with dozens hurling stones. Four police officers were lightly injured in several incidents. Three molotov cocktails were also thrown at the back gate of [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Hospital]] at [[Mount Scopus]]. Security forces responded with crowd-control measures, and arrested 36 protesters. Several were arrested by undercover officers. Israeli authorities closed off the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] in Jerusalem to prevent large rallies. Shop owners in the [[Muslim Quarter|Muslim]] and [[Christian Quarter]]s closed down their shops in observance of a strike to commemorate Nakba Day.

At 12pm, a 63-second siren was sounded throughout the West Bank to commemorate 63 years since the Nakba.&lt;ref name=YNETP/&gt; In [[Ramallah]]'s Manara Square, a gathering organized by the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] to commemorate Nakba Day was attended by thousands of people who waved Palestinian flags and black flags, burned Israeli flags, and watched concerts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=YNETP/&gt; At another rally for thousands staged near the tomb of late Palestinian president [[Yasser Arafat]], the PLO's head of refugees' affairs made a speech vowing the refugees' right of return would not be abandoned by the Palestinian leadership. At the entrance of nearby [[Birzeit University]], Palestinian students burned tires and pelted Israeli soldiers manning the [['Atara]] checkpoint with stones. Israeli troops responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas canisters, injuring 30 protesters according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maan1&quot;&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=387899 More than 100 injured in West Bank Nakba protests].
