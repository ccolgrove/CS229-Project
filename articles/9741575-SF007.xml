A '''lolcat''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|Ë|l|É|l|k|Ã¦|t}} {{respell|LOL|kat}}) is an image combining a [[photograph]] of a [[cat]] with text intended to contribute [[humour]]. The text is often [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] and grammatically incorrect, and its use in this way is known as &quot;lolspeak&quot; or &quot;kitty pidgin&quot;.

&quot;Lolcat&quot; is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]]&lt;!-- note: not a portmanteau --&gt; of the [[acronymic]] abbreviation &quot;[[LOL]]&quot; and the word &quot;cat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author = Dwight Silverman| title = Web photo phenomenon centers on felines, poor spelling| publisher = [[Houston Chronicle]]| date = 2007-06-06| url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/4862013.html| accessdate = 2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118798557326508182.html |title=With 'LOLcats' Internet Fad, Anyone Can Get In on the Joke |accessdate=2008-02-13 |last=Rutkoff |first=Aaron |date=2007-08-25 |publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A synonym for &quot;lolcat&quot; is '''cat macro''', since the images are a type of [[image macro]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beacon&quot;&gt;{{cite news

== History ==
As early as the 1870s, British portrait [[photographer]] Harry Pointer created a [[carte de visite]] series featuring felines posed in various situations, to which he added amusing text intended to further enhance their appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photohistory-sussex.co.uk/BTNPointerCats.htm &quot;Harry Pointer's Brighton Cats&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first recorded use of the term &quot;lolcat&quot; is from the anonymous [[imageboard]], [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955| publisher=[http://www.thestar.com/ The Star]| title=Funny how `stupid' site is addictive| last=Langton| first=Jerry| date=2007-09-22| accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Lolcat is a composite of two words, &quot;lol&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;. &quot;[[LOL|Lol]]&quot; stands for &quot;Laugh out Loud&quot; or &quot;Laughing out Loud&quot;, hence lolcats are intended to be funny and to include jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrothing.com/2010/08/1950s-protololcats.html|title=1950's Proto-LOLcats|author=retrothing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lolcats images usually consist of a photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically set in a [[sans serif]] font such as [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] or [[Arial Black]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cats has grammar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html|title=Anil Dash: Cats Can Has Grammar|author=[[Anil Dash]]|date=2007-04-23|accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image is, on occasion, [[Photo editing|digitally edited]] for effect. The caption generally acts as a [[speech balloon]] encompassing a comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The caption is intentionally written with deviations from standard English spelling and grammar,&lt;ref name= &quot;cats has grammar&quot; /&gt; featuring &quot;strangely-conjugated verbs, but a tendency to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and grammar&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;cats has grammar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newitz 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The text parodies the grammar-poor [[patois]] stereotypically attributed to [[Internet slang]]. Frequently, lolcat captions take the form of [[phrasal template]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitty pidgin&quot; /&gt; Some phrases have a known source, usually a well-known [[Internet meme]], such as [[All your base are belong to us]] or [[Do not want]],&lt;ref name=&quot;virgin_myths&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/movies/movieextras/top10s/top-ten-star-wars-myths-and-legends.php?ssid=10|title=Top ten Star Wars myths and legends: Do not want|work=VirginMedia.com|accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others don't. The language of lolcats has also been likened to [[baby talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2008-04-24-lolcats-job-search_N.htm|title=Lolcat site needz ur skillz|work=[[The Associated Press]]|first=Peter|last=Svensson|date=2008-04-24|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many lolcat images capture cats performing characteristically human actions or appearing to use modern technology, such as computers.

There are several well-known lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, including &quot;Ceiling Cat&quot; (see below). Others include [[Failure#Internet memes|Fail]] (a cat with a slice of [[processed cheese]] on its face)&lt;ref&gt;[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article3304328.ece Microtrends: Failure - Times Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[I Can Has Cheezburger]]&quot; (a portrait of a blue [[British Shorthair]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jul2007/sb20070713_202390.htm|title=Bloggers Bring in the Big Bucks|publisher=''[[Business Week]]''|author=Tozzi, John|date=July 13, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offshoots and parodies ==
Variations on the lolcat concept include captioning photos of other animals in a similar style (e.g. ''loldogs'' for dogs, etc.).

The syntax of lolcat captions was used as the basis for [[LOLCODE]], an [[esoteric programming language]] with interpreters and compilers available in [[.NET Framework]], [[Perl]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Silverman&quot;/&gt;

=== Ceiling Cat and Basement Cat ===
&quot;Ceiling Cat&quot; is a character spawned by the meme. The original image was an [[image macro]] with a picture of a cat looking out of a hole in a ceiling, captioned &quot;Ceiling Cat is watching you [[Masturbation|masturbate]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icanhascheezburger.com/2007/01/24/ceiling-cat-is-watching-you-masturbate/ |title=Ceiling cat is watching you... |accessdate=2009-08-17 |date=2007-01-24 |publisher=icanhazcheezburger.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; There followed numerous image macros with the format &quot;Ceiling Cat is watching you [''verb'' ending in/rhyming with -ate]&quot; with Ceiling Cat superimposed in the upper left hand corner of an image macro depicting the appropriate action. The character is also featured in a [[LOLCat Bible Translation Project|project to translate the Bible to ''lolspeak'']]. &quot;Ceiling Cat&quot; and the corresponding &quot;Basement Cat&quot; (a [[black cat]] who lives in the basement) represent good and evil (sometimes God and Satan) in the lolcat universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Charlie| last=Amter| coauthors=| title=Lolcat Bible Translation Project presents the Gospel according to Fluffy| date=2007-12-16| publisher=| url =http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16,1,6069575.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true| work =Los Angeles Times| pages =| accessdate = 2007-12-23| language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224021046/http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16,1,6069575.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribunereview/news/today/s_568828.html|title=How one hungry 'kitteh' can has the Internet lol|last=Horan|first=Brianna|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/thebigblog/archives/124063.asp?from=blog_last3|title=Time killer: The &quot;lolcat&quot; Bible|last=Guzman|first=Monica|accessdate=2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
