California's diverse geography ranges from the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] in the west, to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains in the eastâfrom the [[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood]]â[[Douglas-fir]] forests of the northwest, to the [[Mojave Desert]] areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]], a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest and lowest points in the [[contiguous United States]] ([[Mount Whitney]] and [[Death Valley]]), and has the [[List of U.S. states by coastline|third-longest coastline]] of all states (after [[Alaska]] and [[Florida]]). Earthquakes are a common occurrence due to the state's location along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]: about 37,000 are recorded annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/rate_of_seism.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Seismo.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''California'' once referred to a large area of North America claimed by Spain that included much of modern-day [[Southwestern United States]] and the [[Baja California peninsula]]. Beginning in the late 18th century, the area known as [[Alta California]], comprising the California territory north of the Baja Peninsula, was [[colonized]] by the [[Spanish Empire]] as part of [[New Spain]]. In 1821, Alta California became a part of [[Mexico]] following its successful war for independence. Shortly after the beginning of the [[Mexican-American War]] in 1846, a group of American settlers in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] declared an independent [[California Republic]] in Alta California. Though its existence was short-lived, its flag became the precursor for California's current state flag. American victory in the war led to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], in which Mexico ceded Alta California to the United States. Western areas of Alta California became the state of California, which was admitted as the [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|31st state]] on September 9, 1850.

The [[California Gold Rush]] beginning in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change, with large scale immigration from the U.S. and abroad and an accompanying economic boom. Key developments in the early 20th century included the emergence of Los Angeles as the center of the American [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]], and the growth of a large, state-wide [[tourism]] sector. The late 20th century saw the development of the [[technology]] and [[information]] sectors, punctuated by the growth of [[Silicon Valley]]. In addition to California's prosperous agricultural [[industry]], other important contributors to its economy include [[aerospace]], [[education]], and [[manufacturing]]. If California were a country, it would be the [[Comparison between U.S. states and countries nominal GDP|eighth-largest economy in the world]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9JS1MLO0.htm &quot;Calif. retains economy that would be 8th largest&quot;], &quot;Businessweek&quot;, December 2, 2010, accessed December 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of countries by population|35th most populous]] nation. At least half of the fresh fruit produced in the United States are cultivated in California, and it also leads in the production of vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeintheusa.com/food/vegetables.htm |title=Fruits and Vegetables, America Eats, from Life in the USA: The Complete Guide for Immigrants and Americans |publisher=Life in the USA |date= |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Main|Origin of the name California}}
The word ''California'' originally referred to the entire region composed of what is today the U.S. state of California, plus all or parts of [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], and [[Wyoming]], and the [[Baja California peninsula]] of Mexico.

The name ''California'' is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by [[Black People|Black]] [[Amazons]] and ruled by Queen [[Calafia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Ruth|editor=Herbert Ingram Priestley|title=California: the name|url=http://www.archive.org/details/cu31924008278347|year=1917|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley|pages=356â361|chapter=Appendix A: Etymology of the Word &quot;California&quot;: Surmises and Usage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogeley|first=Nancy|date=April 20, 2001|title=How Chivalry Formed the Myth of California|journal=Modern Language Quarterly|publisher=University of Washington|volume=62|issue=2|pages=165â188|url=http://mlq.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/62/2/165|doi=10.1215/00267929-62-2-165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work ''[[Las sergas de EsplandiÃ¡n|The Exploits of Esplandian]]'', written as a sequel to ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' by Spanish adventure writer [[Garci RodrÃ­guez de Montalvo]].&lt;ref name=cpn&gt;Gudde, Erwin G. and William Bright. 2004.

:&lt;blockquote&gt;Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, 1917, [http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924008278347#page/n23/mode/1up/ p. 306]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''California'' is the fifth-[[List of oldest surviving European place-names in the U.S.|oldest surviving European place-name in the U.S.]] and was applied to what is now the southern tip of Baja California peninsula as the ''[[island of California]]'' by a Spanish expedition led by Diego de Becerra and [[FortÃºn XimÃ©nez]], who landed there in 1533 at the behest of [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]].{{#tag:ref| [[Florida]], [[Dry Tortugas]], [[Cape Canaveral]], and [[Appalachian]] appeared earlier,....From Spanish historian [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]'s accounts, published in 1601.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart 1945&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last= Stewart|first=George |authorlink=George R.

California adjoins the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west, [[Oregon]] to the north, [[Nevada]] and [[Arizona]] to the east, and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Baja California]] to the south. With an area of {{convert|160000|sqmi|km2|-3|sp=us}}, it is the third-[[List of U.S. states by area|largest state in the United States]] in size, after [[Alaska]] and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2000 population and housing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/phc3-us-pt1.pdf |format=PDF |title=2000 Census of Population and Housing|year=2004 |month=April |publisher=[[US Census Bureau]] |page=29|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it were a country, California would be the 59th-[[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|largest in the world in area]].

In the middle of the state lies the [[California Central Valley]], bounded by the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coastal mountain ranges]] in the west, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] to the east, the [[Cascade Range]] in the north and the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] in the south. The Central Valley is California's agricultural heartland and grows approximately one-third of the nation's food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peak Oil&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=56&amp;Itemid=32 |title=Lessons for California and the U.S. from movie &quot;How Cuba survived Peak Oil&quot; |publisher=Culture Change |author=Alice Friedemann |accessdate=June 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;California's Water Woes Threaten the Entire Country's Food Supply&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/water/140487/california's_water_woes_threaten_the_entire_country's_food_supply/

Divided in two by the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta]], the northern portion, the [[Sacramento Valley]] serves as the watershed of the [[Sacramento River]], while the southern portion, the [[San Joaquin Valley]] is the watershed for the [[San Joaquin River]]; both areas derive their names from the rivers that transit them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained sufficiently deep that several inland cities are [[seaport]]s.

The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta, that traverse nearly the length of the state, including the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population, and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. The [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] are located off the [[Southern California|southern]] [[South Coast (California)|coast]].

The Sierra Nevada ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;snowy range&quot;) includes the highest peak in the [[contiguous United States|contiguous forty-eight states]], [[Mount Whitney]], at 14,505&amp;nbsp;ft (4421&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref name=Mount_Whitney/&gt;&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAVD88/&gt;  The range embraces [[Yosemite Valley]], famous for its glacially carved domes, and [[Sequoia National Park]], home to the [[Sequoiadendron|giant sequoia]] trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, [[Lake Tahoe]], the largest lake in the state by volume.

To the east of the Sierra Nevada are [[Owens Valley]] and [[Mono Lake]], an essential [[bird migration|migratory bird]] habitat. In the western part of the state is [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Though Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including [[Palisade Glacier]], the southernmost glacier in the United States.

About 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests,&lt;ref name=&quot;Forestry 2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Many of the trees in the [[White Mountains (California)|California White Mountains]] are the oldest in the world; one [[Bristlecone pine]] has an age of 4,700 years.

In the south is a large inland salt lake, the [[Salton Sea]]. The south-central desert is called the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]; to the northeast of the Mojave lies [[Death Valley]], which contains the lowest and hottest place in [[North America]], the [[Badwater Basin]] at {{convert|â282|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;/&gt; The horizontal distance from the nadir of Death Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney is less than {{convert|90|mi|km}}. Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the [[Colorado River]], from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.

Along the California coast are several major metropolitan areas, including [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the [[San Diego metropolitan area]].

As part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]], California is subject to [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, [[drought]]s, [[Santa Ana winds]], [[wildfire]]s, [[landslide]]s on steep terrain, and has several [[volcanoes]]. It sees numerous [[List of earthquakes in California|earthquake]]s due to several faults, in particular the [[San Andreas Fault]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of California}}
[[Image:Snow on the mountains of Southern California.jpg|thumb|Snow on the mountains of [[Southern California]].]]
[[File:Death Valley Mesquite Sand Dunes.jpg|thumb|[[Death Valley]], in the desert regions of Eastern California]]
California's climate varies from [[Mediterranean Climate|Mediterranean]] to [[subarctic climate|subarctic]].

Much of the state has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with cool, rainy winters and dry summers. The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Further inland, one encounters colder winters and hotter summers.

Northern parts of the state average higher annual rainfall than the south. California's mountain ranges influence the climate as well: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have a [[mountain climate]] with [[snow]] in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.

The east side of California's mountains produce a [[rain shadow]], creating expansive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] see hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the southern California mountains experience hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. [[Death Valley]], a desert with large expanses below [[sea level]], is considered the hottest location in [[North America]]; the highest temperature in the [[Western Hemisphere]], {{convert|134|Â°F|Â°C|0}}, was recorded there on July 10, 1913.

===Ecology===
{{Main|Ecology of California}}

California is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the [[Nearctic ecozone]] and spans a number of terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Checklist of the Scarabaeoidea of the Nearctic Realm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf

California's large number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species includes [[relict]] species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina Ironwood (''Lyonothamnus floribundus''). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or [[adaptive radiation]], whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (''[[Ceanothus]]''). Many California endemics have become endangered, as [[urbanization]], [[logging]], [[overgrazing]], and the introduction of [[exotic species]] have encroached on their habitat.

California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the [[giant sequoia|largest trees]], the [[coast redwood|tallest trees]], and the [[pinus longaeva|oldest trees]]. California's native grasses are [[perennial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Restoring Native Grasses&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/grass0504.htm |title=Restoring California's Native Grasses |journal=Agricultural Research magazine |author=David Elstein |month=May |year=2004 |volume= 52 |issue= 5 |page=17 |accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After European contact, these were generally replaced by [[invasive species]] of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;The California Invasive Species List&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscc.ca.gov/docs/CaliforniaInvasiveSpeciesList.pdf

Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran (desert); upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/states/California-Flora-and-fauna.html |title=California: flora and fauna|publisher=city-data.com |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The [[Joshua tree]] (Yucca brevifolia) is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of [[aster (genus)|aster]]s. [[Fremont cottonwood]] and [[valley oak]] thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. [[Nemophila]], [[Lamiaceae|mint]], [[phacelia]], [[viola]], and the [[California poppy]] (Eschscholtzia californica)- the state flower- also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood ([[Sequoia sempervirens]]) and the &quot;big tree&quot; or giant sequoia (Sequoia gigantea), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). [[Tanbark oak]], [[California laurel]], [[Sugar Pine]], [[Arbutus|madrona]], broad-leaved maple, and [[Douglas-fir]] also grow here. Forest floors are covered with [[swordfern]], alumnroot, [[barrenwort]], and [[trillium]], and there are tickets of [[huckleberry]], [[azalea]], elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, [[tulip]], and [[Lilium columbianum|tiger]] and [[Lilium pardalinum|leopard]] lilies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/sequoia/sempervirens.htm|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.|publisher=fed.us (U.S. Forest Service)|date=|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the [[Jeffrey Pine]], [[red fir]], and [[Lodgepole Pine]] to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf [[manzanita]] and [[ceanothus]]; the unique [[Sierra puffball]] is also found here. Right below the timeberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about 10,500&amp;nbsp;ft (3,200 m), begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including [[Sierra primrose]], [[Yellow Columbine|yellow columbine]], [[alpine buttercup]], and [[alpine shooting star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Life Zones of the Central Sierra Nevada&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierrahistorical.org/archives/lifezones.html

Common plants that have been introduced to the state include the [[eucalyptus]], [[acacia]], [[Schinus|pepper tree]], geranium, and [[Scotch broom]]. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the [[Contra Costa wallflower]], [[Antioch Dunes evening primrose]], [[Solano Grass]], [[San Clemente Island larkspur]], [[salt marsh bird's beak]], [[McDonald's rock-cress]], and [[Santa Barbara Island Liveforever]]. {{As of|1997|12}}, 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the [[jackrabbit]], [[kangaroo rat]], squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the [[owl]], [[roadrunner]], [[Cactus Wren]], and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the [[sidewinder viper]], [[desert tortoise]], and [[horned toad]]. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the [[antelope]], [[brown-footed woodrat]], and [[Ring-tailed Cat]]. Birds unique to this zone are the [[California thrasher]], [[bush tit]], and [[California Condor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;California Condor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/California_Condor/id |title=California Condor|publisher=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CalPhotos: Browse Mammal Common Names&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/fauna/com-Mammal.html|title=CalPhotos: Browse Mammal Common Names|publisher=calphotos.berkeley.edu (BSCIT University of California, Berkeley) |date=2010-10-02|accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quail Ridge Reserve: UC Davis Natural Reserve System&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrs.ucdavis.edu/quail/natural/birds_bushtit.htm|title=Quail Ridge Reserve: UC Davis Natural Reserve System|publisher=nrs.ucdavis.edu (University of California at Davis: Natural Reserve System) |date=2007-04-05|accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the transition zone, there are Colombian [[Black-tailed Deer]], [[American Black Bear|black bear]]s, [[gray fox]]es, [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[Roosevelt elk]]. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the [[water puppy]] and [[redwood salamander]] are common too. Birds such as the [[kingfisher]], chickadee, [[towhee]], and hummingbird thrive here as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black-tailed Deer of California&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernhunter.com/Pages/Vol02Issue24/blacktail.html|title=Black-tailed Deer of California|publisher=westernhunter.com|year=2000|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian zone mammals include the [[Mountain Weasel]], [[Snowshoe Hare]], [[Sierra chickadee]], and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the [[blue-fronted jay]], [[Sierra hermit thrush]], [[water ouzel]], and [[Townsend solitaire]]. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the Sierra rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as the hummingbird and [[Clark's Nutcracker]]. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, [[White-tailed Jackrabbit]], and the [[Bighorn Sheep]]. {{As of|2003|04}}, the Bighorn Sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the [[mule deer]], coyote, [[mountain lion]], [[Northern Flicker]], and several species of hawk and sparrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them [[Rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Golden trout|golden]], and [[Tahoe trout|Tahoe]]. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include [[White seabass|sea bass]], [[yellowfin tuna]], [[barracuda]], and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.&lt;ref name=&quot;California: flora and fauna&quot;/&gt;

As of April 2003, 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the [[San Joaquin kitfox]], [[Point Arena mountain beaver]], [[Pacific pocket mouse]], [[Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse]], [[Morro Bay kangaroo rat]] (and five other species of kangaroo rat), [[Amargosa vole]], [[California Least Tern]], [[California Condor]], [[Loggerhead Shrike]], [[San Clemente sage sparrow]], San Francisco garter snake, five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish. Eleven butterflies are also endangered and two that are threatened are on the federal list. Among threatened animals are the coastal [[California Gnatcatcher]], [[Paiute cutthroat trout]], [[southern sea otter]], and [[Northern Spotted Owl]].

===Rivers===
{{Main|List of rivers of California}}

The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are looked after by the [[California Coastal Commission]].

The two most prominent rivers within California are the [[Sacramento River]] and the [[San Joaquin River]], which drain the Central Valley and the west slope of the Sierra Nevada and flow to the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Several major tributaries feed into the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, including the [[Pit River]], the [[Tuolumne River]], and the [[Feather River]].

The [[Owens River]] takes runoff from the southeastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and flows into [[Owens Lake]]. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California.

Some other important rivers are the [[Klamath River]] and the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] in the far north coast, and the [[Colorado River]] on the southeast border with [[Arizona]].

==History==
{{California history sidebar}}
{{Main|History of California}}
Settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian [[North America]]; The [[Indigenous peoples of California]] included more than [[Classification of Native Americans#California|70 distinct groups]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s. Large, settled populations lived on the coast and hunted sea mammals, fished for salmon and gathered shellfish; groups in the interior hunted terrestrial game, and gathered nuts, acorns and berries. California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands, tribes, villages, and on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]], [[Pomo people|Pomo]] and [[Salinan]]. Trade, intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups.

The first European to explore the coast as far north as the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] was the Portuguese [[Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo]], in 1542, sailing for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Some 37 years later [[England|English]] explorer [[Francis Drake]] also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579. Spanish traders made unintended visits with the [[Manila Galleon]]s on their return trips from the [[Philippines]] beginning in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hyzercreek.com/britannica.htm |title=Page 1580 of the 1778 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica (second edition) |publisher=Hyzercreek.com |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SebastiÃ¡n VizcaÃ­no]] explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for [[New Spain]].

Spanish [[missionaries]] began setting up 21 [[California Missions]] along the coast of what became known as [[Alta California]] (Upper California), together with small towns and ''presidios''. In 1821 the [[Mexican War of Independence]] gave [[Mexico]] (including California) independence from Spain; for the next 25 years, [[Alta California]] remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexico. Cattle ranches, or ''[[Ranchos of California|ranchos]]'', emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. After Mexican independence from Spain, the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were [[secularized]] by 1832. The ranchos developed under ownership by [[Californios]] (Spanish-speaking Californians) who had received land grants, and traded cowhides and tallow with [[Boston]] merchants.
[[Image:6-Duhaut-Cilly 1828.jpg|thumb|The [[Russian America|Russians]] from Alaska established their largest settlement in California, [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]], in 1812.]]
Beginning in the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the U.S. and Canada began to arrive in Northern California, harbingers of the great changes that would later sweep the Mexican territory. These new arrivals used the [[Siskiyou Trail]], [[California Trail]], [[Oregon Trail]] and [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]] to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding California. In this period, [[Imperial Russia]] explored the California coast and established a trading post at [[Fort Ross]].

In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. Afterwards, rebels raised the [[Bear Flag]] (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words &quot;California Republic&quot;) at Sonoma.

His term lasted 22 days and concluded when California was occupied by U.S. forces during the [[Mexican-American War]].

The California Republic was short lived. The same year marked the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846â1848). When Commodore [[John D. Sloat]] of the [[United States Navy]] sailed into [[Monterey Bay]] and began the military occupation of California by the [[United States]], Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U.S. forces. After a series of defensive battles in [[Southern California]], including The [[Siege of Los Angeles]], the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho]], the [[Battle of San Pasqual]], the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel]] and the [[Battle of La Mesa]], the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed by the [[Californios]] on January 13, 1847, securing American control in California. Following the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] that ended the war, the region was divided between Mexico and the U.S.; the western territory of [[Alta California]], was to become the U.S. state of California, and [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]] and [[Utah]] became U.S. Territories, while the lower region of California, the Baja Peninsula, remained in the possession of [[Mexico]].
[[Image:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|thumb|left|[[San Francisco]] harbor c. 1850. Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.]]
In 1848 the non-native population of California was estimated to be no more than 15,000. But after gold was discovered, the population burgeoned with U.S. citizens, Europeans and other immigrants during the great [[California Gold Rush]]. By 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Gold Rush, 1848â1864|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=118|work=Learn California.org, a site designed for the [[California Secretary of State]]|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1850, as part of the [[Compromise of 1850]], California was admitted to the [[United States]] undivided as a [[Free state (USA)|free state]], denying the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] to the Pacific Coast.

Travel between California and the central and eastern parts of the U.S. was time consuming and dangerous. A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] through [[Donner Pass]] in the Sierra Nevada mountains. After this rail link was established, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens came west, where new Californians were discovering that land in the state, if irrigated during the dry summer months, was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.

Migration to California accelerated during the early-20th century with the completion of major transcontinental [[highway]]s like the [[Lincoln Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|Route 66]]. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the Union. In order to meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the [[California Aqueduct|California]] and [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]]s; the [[Oroville Dam|Oroville]] and [[Shasta Dam]]s; and the [[San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay]] and [[Golden Gate Bridge]]s were built across the state. The state government also adopted the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.

Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the [[studio system]] in [[Hollywood]] in the 1920s. A couple of decades later, [[Stanford University]] and its Dean of Engineering [[Frederick Terman]] began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Markoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/travel/escapes/17Amer.html?pagewanted=1|title=Searching for Silicon Valley|last=Markoff|first=John|date=2009-04-17|work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these efforts, California is currently regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology and engineering businesses, and as the U.S. center of agricultural production.

The culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the [[culture of the United States]], but also, historically, many [[Hispanic]] influences. As a border and coastal state, Californian culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World of Opportunity&quot;&gt;{{cite web

California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th Century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as [[The Beach Boys]] promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.

In terms of socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more [[American liberalism|liberal]] than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states. In some ways, California is the quintessential [[Blue state|Blue State]]-- accepting of alternative lifestyles, not uniformly religious, and preoccupied with environmental issues.

The [[California Gold Rush|gold rush]] of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.

===Religion===
[[File:San-diego-mission-chuch.JPG|210px|[[Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡]], one of the first [[Spanish missions in California]]|thumb|right]]
{{Main|Religion in California}}
The largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2008 were the [[Catholic Church]] with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Affi liation by State in the U.S.|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|work=U.S Religious Landscape Study|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=24 June 2010|page=103|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Jewish Yearbook placed the total [[American Jews|Jewish]] population of California at about 1,194,190 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Ira M.

The first priests to come to California were Roman Catholic missionaries from [[Spain]]. Roman Catholics founded [[California missions|21 missions along the California coast]], as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Roman Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]] and the [[Archdiocese of San Francisco]], the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.

A [[Pew Research Center]] survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the US: 62 percent of Californians say they are &quot;absolutely certain&quot; of the belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is &quot;very important,&quot; compared to 56 percent nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helfland 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Helfand |first=Duke |title= State has a relaxed view on religion â Survey finds Californians are less certain about the existence of God than others in the U.S. |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | publisher= [[Tribune Company]] |date=June 24, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/24/local/me-faith24 |accessdate=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's economy is very dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for approximately one-quarter of the stateâs economy.

One potential problem is that a substantial portion of the state's income comes from income taxes on a small proportion of wealthy citizens.

The stateâs crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field]]. Natural gas-fired [[power plants]] typically account for more than one-half of State electricity generation.

California is also home to two major [[nuclear power]] plants: [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] and [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station|San Onofre]].

California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of [[controlled-access highways]] ('freeways'), [[limited-access road]]s ('expressways'), and [[highway]]s. California is known for its [[car culture]], giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]]. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the [[California Department of Transportation]], nicknamed &quot;Caltrans&quot;.

One of the state's more visible landmarks, the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] was completed in 1937. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. It is simultaneously designated as [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]], which is part of the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] (Spanish for Royal Road or King's Highway), and [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]], also known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway (United States)|Pacific Coast Highway]]. Another of the seven bridges in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is the [[San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge]] (often abbreviated the &quot;Bay Bridge&quot;), completed in 1936. This bridge transports approximately 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks, with its two sections meeting at [[Yerba Buena Island]].

[[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[San Francisco International Airport]] are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial [[airport]]s and many more [[general aviation]] [[List of airports in California|airports]] throughout the state.

California also has several important [[seaport]]s. The giant seaport complex formed by the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Long Beach, California#Shipping and transportation|Port of Long Beach]] in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The [[Port of Oakland]], fourth largest in the nation, handles trade from the Pacific Rim and delivers most of the ocean containers passing through Northern California to the entire USA.

The [[California Highway Patrol]] is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in terms of employment with over 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state maintained highways and on state property.

The California Department of Motor Vehicles is by far the largest in North America. By the end of 2009, the California DMV had 26,555,006 driver's licenses and ID cards on file.&lt;ref&gt;http://dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/official.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, there were 1.17 million new vehicle registrations in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_17197542 |title=California new-car sales up 13.1 percent in 2010 |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state also allows direct participation of the electorate by [[initiative]], [[referendum]], [[recall election|recall]], and [[ratification]]. California allows each political party to choose whether to have a [[closed primary]] or a primary where only party members and [[independent (politics)|independents]] vote. The state's capital is [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].

The Governor of California and the other state constitutional officers serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once. The [[California State Legislature]] consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly. Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to [[term limit]]s of three terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of two terms.

California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/30/eveningnews/main2138297.shtml | title=California Is A Political Trendsetter | date=October 30, 2006 | accessdate=February 22, 2011 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the second state [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|to recall their state governor]], the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban [[marriage]] for gay couples twice by voters (including [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8 in 2008]]). Voters also passed [[California Proposition 71 (2004)|Proposition 71 in 2004]] to fund [[stem cell]] research, and [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 in 2010]] to completely change the state's [[primary election]] process. California has also experienced [[California Water Wars|disputes over water rights]]; and a [[tax revolt]], culminating with the passage of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|Proposition 13 in 1978]], limiting state [[property tax]]es.

What has been consistent in the last few decades is that California politics has trended towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors.  Once very [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], having elected Republicans until 1958, California is now a reliable [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], Democratic state. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor [[Jerry Brown]]; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], tend to be considered &quot;Moderate Republicans&quot; and more centrist than the national party.

The Democrats also hold a majority in both houses of the state legislature. There are currently 52 Democrats and 27 Republicans in the Assembly; and 25 Democrats and 15 Republicans in the Senate.

The trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections; the Democratic Party candidate has won California's [[electoral vote]]s in the last five elections. Additionally, both the state's current Democratic U.S. Senators, [[Dianne Feinstein]], a native and former mayor of [[San Francisco]], and [[Barbara Boxer]], a former congresswoman from [[Marin County]], have held onto their seats since they were first elected in 1992.

In the U.S. House, the Democrats have held a 34â19 edge since the seating of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California are usually dominated by one or the other party with very few districts that could be considered competitive.

In general, Democratic strength is centered in [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of [[Los Angeles County]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] also remains mostly Republican. One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and San Francisco in the top 10 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and [[Orange, California|Orange]] in the top 10 most conservative cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html | publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research | title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities | date=August 16, 2005 | accessdate=February 20. 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's [[local government]] is divided into 58 counties and 482 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] cities and towns; of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms &quot;city&quot; and &quot;town&quot; are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be &quot;City of (Name)&quot; or &quot;Town of (Name)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal Gov Code 34502&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five [[metropolitan area]]s. Sixty-eight percent of California's population lives in its three largest metropolitan areas, [[Greater Los Angeles Area]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and the [[Riverside-San Bernardino Area]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although smaller, the other two large population centers are the [[San Diego metropolitan area|San Diego]] and [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Greater Sacramento]] metro areas.

The state recognizes two kinds of cities: [[Charter city|charter]] and general law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cal Gov Code 34502&quot;/&gt; General law cities owe their existence to state law and are consequentially governed by it; charter cities are governed by their own city charters. Cities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter cities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities.

==Education==
[[File:THS facade.jpg|thumb|[[Torrance High School]] is one of the oldest high schools in continuous use in California and a popular location for television and motion picture production.]]
{{Main|Education in California}}
{{See also|List of colleges and universities in California}}
Public [[Secondary education in the United States|secondary education]] consists of [[High school#United States|high schools]] that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a [[California Proposition 98 (1988)|unique constitutional amendment]] that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K-12 and [[community college]]s that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prop 98&quot;&gt;{{cite web

California had over 6.2 million school students in the 2005â06 school year. Funding and staffing levels in California schools lag behind other states. In expenditure per pupil, California ranked 29th (of the 50 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]) in 2005â06. In teaching staff expenditure per pupil, California ranked 49th of 51. In overall teacher-pupil ratio, California was also 49th, with 21 students per teacher. Only Arizona and Utah were lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;How&quot;&gt;{{cite web

A 2007 study concluded that California's public school system was &quot;broken&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall |first=Carolyn |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/education/16schools.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1313692806-wLcsPvmsQ7+YfX++w1H+lQ |title=Report Says Public Schools in California Are âBrokenâ â New York Times |location=California |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's public [[postsecondary education]] offers a unique three tiered system:
*The research university system in the state is the [[University of California]] (UC), a [[public university]] system. There are ten general UC campuses, and a number of specialized campuses in the UC system.
*The [[California State University]] (CSU) system has almost 450,000 students, making it the largest university system in the United States. It is intended to accept the top one-third of high school students. The 23 CSU schools are primarily intended for undergraduate education.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSU Facts 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = CSU Facts 2008

*The [[California Community Colleges System]] provides lower division coursework as well as basic skills and workforce training. It is the largest network of higher education in the US, composed of 110 colleges serving a student population of over 2.9 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;California Community College Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web

California is also home to such notable private universities as [[Stanford University]], the [[University of Southern California]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and the [[Claremont Colleges]]. California has hundreds of other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions.

==Sports==
[[File:LA Coliseum gate.jpg|right|thumb|[[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the only stadium in the world to host the [[Olympic Games]] twice: in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and 1984]]
{{Main|Sports in California|List of professional sports teams in California}}
The State of California is the only US state to have hosted both the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympics]]. The [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] were held in [[Los Angeles]]. [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort]] hosted the [[1960 Winter Olympics]]. Multiple games during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] took place in California. The [[Rose Bowl Stadium|Rose Bowl]] in Los Angeles hosted eight matches including the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. [[Stanford Stadium]] which is located north of [[San Jose]] hosted six matches. The NFL [[Super Bowl]] has been hosted in California 11 times at four different stadiums.

California has nineteen [[major professional sports league]] franchises, far more than any other state. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] has seven major league teams spread in three cities, [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. While the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises, it is also the largest metropolitan area not to have a team from the [[National Football League]]. San Diego has two major league teams, and [[Sacramento]] has one.

Home to some of the most prominent universities in the United States, California has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], among others.

California has also long been a hub for motorsports and auto racing. The city of Long Beach holds an event every year in the month of April, which is host to [[IndyCar Series]] racing through the streets of downtown. Long Beach has hosted [[Formula One]] events there in the past, and also currently hosts an event on the [[American Le Mans Series]] schedule. [[Auto Club Speedway]] is a speedway in Fontana, and currently hosts one to two [[NASCAR]] Sprint Cup Series races a year, and used to host [[Champ Car|CART]] Indycar races. [[Infineon Raceway]] in Sonoma is a multi-purpose facility, featuring a road course and a drag strip. The road course is home to a NASCAR event, an [[IndyCar]] event, and used to host an [[International Motor Sports Association]] sports car event. The drag strip hosts a yearly [[NHRA]] event. [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca]] is a roadcourse that currently hosts an ALMS event, and formerly hosted CART events.  The [[Auto Club Raceway at Pomona]] has hosted NHRA drag racing for over 50 years.
