'''''Saw''''' is a [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[media franchise|franchise]] distributed by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] and produced by [[Twisted Pictures]] that consists of seven films and two video games, published by [[Konami]]. The franchise began with the 2003 [[Saw (2003 film)|short film]] which was created by [[Australian]] director [[James Wan]] and screenwriter [[Leigh Whannell]] to help [[sales pitch|pitch]] as a potential [[feature film]].  This was successfully done in 2004 with the release of [[Saw (film)|the first feature film]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].  It was released theatrically that October. The sequels were directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], [[David Hackl]] and [[Kevin Greutert]] and were written by Wan, Whannell, Bousman, [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and have been released subsequently every October, on the Friday before [[Halloween]]. Both of the creators remained with the franchise as [[executive producers]]. On July 22, 2010, producer [[Mark Burg]] confirmed that the seventh film, ''[[Saw 3D]]'' is the final installment of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowles|first=Scott|date={{nowrap|July 22, 2010}}|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-saw22_ST_N.htm|title='Saw 3D' will be the final cut for horror franchise|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate={{nowrap|July 22, 2010}}|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61r3dlvkb|archivedate={{nowrap|September 20, 2011}}|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell are still open to continuing the series, however, if they can do something &quot;different&quot; with the material. The films collectively grossed over [[United States dollar|$]]873 million at the box office worldwide.

The franchise revolves around the fictional character of [[Jigsaw (Saw)|John Kramer]], also called the &quot;Jigsaw Killer&quot; or simply &quot;Jigsaw.&quot;  He was introduced briefly in ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]'' and developed in more detail in ''[[Saw II]]''.  Rather than killing his [[List of Saw characters|victims]] outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he calls &quot;tests&quot; or &quot;games,&quot; to test their will to live through [[physical torture|physical]] or [[psychological torture]].  Despite the fact that John was murdered in ''[[Saw III]]'', the films continue to focus on the posthumous influence of the Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].

The film series as a whole has received mixed to negative reviews by critics, but has been a financial success at the [[#Box office|box office]]. While the films are often compared to ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' and classified as [[Splatter film#Torture porn|torture porn]] by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharrett|first=Christopher|title=The Problem of Saw:

==Overview==
Flashbacks from ''[[Saw IV]]'' reveal the roots of the series, presenting John Kramer as a successful civil engineer and devoted husband to his wife [[Jill Tuck]], who opened a rehab clinic for drug addicts. Jill lost her unborn baby, Gideon, due to the unwitting actions of a drug addict named [[List of Saw characters#Cecil Adams|Cecil]], who fled the scene. ''[[Saw VI]]'' later showed that another drug addict, [[Amanda Young]], also had an unintentional role in the death of Gideon. John grieved over the loss of his child, and distanced himself from his friends and his wife.

In the comic book ''[[Saw: Rebirth]]'', John and Jill eventually drifted apart and divorced. After this turn of events, John found himself trapped by his own complacency, until he was diagnosed with inoperable [[cancer]]. Extremely bitter over his squandered life, John began observing the lives of others and became even more depressed as he saw those around him squandering the gift of life that he had just been denied. Flashbacks from ''[[Saw II]]'' show that, after surviving a [[suicide]] attempt where he drove his car off a cliff, John was &quot;reborn&quot;, and nurtured the idea that the only way for someone to change is for them to change themselves. Then, in ''[[Saw IV]]'' flashbacks, he designed the first trap and test for Cecil and decided to use the rest of his existence to design more of these &quot;tests&quot; or &quot;games&quot; as a form of &quot;instant rehabilitation&quot; that would change the world, &quot;one person at a time&quot;. John was soon given the name &quot;The Jigsaw Killer&quot; (or &quot;Jigsaw&quot;), because he removed a puzzle-piece-shaped chunk of flesh from those who did not escape his traps. John stated that this name was given to him by the media, and that the cut piece of flesh was meant to represent that these victims were each missing something - what he called the &quot;survival instinct&quot;.

Few of Jigsaw's victims are able to survive his brutal mechanical traps, which are often [[irony|ironically]] [[symbol]]ic representations of the problems in the victim's life and require them to undergo severe physical or psychological [[torture]] to escape.

In ''[[Saw V]]'', police lieutenant [[Mark Hoffman]]'s ties with John are revealed in a series of flashbacks during the film. Hoffman's sister is murdered by her boyfriend, [[List of Saw characters#Seth Baxter|Seth Baxter]]. Seth is arrested; however, a technicality allowed him to be released, and Hoffman, feeling Seth had not served the full capacity of his sentence, kills him in an inescapable trap designed to look like one of Jigsaw's, laying the blame on him. Jigsaw then kidnaps Hoffman and blackmails him into becoming his apprentice in his &quot;rehabilitation&quot; methods, though eventually Hoffman would become a willing apprentice, helping set up John's tests from almost the beginning, starting with [[List of Saw characters#Paul Leahy|Paul]]âs trap.

The first surviving victim, [[Amanda Young]], views Jigsaw as a hero who ultimately changed her life for the better. Amanda, upon Jigsaw's request, agrees to become his [[protÃ©gÃ©e]]. After Amanda survives, John shows Jill her rehabilitation, and Jill then becomes knowledgeable of John's traps and becomes a willing accomplice as well.

In ''[[Saw (film)|Saw]]'', Jigsaw has chained the man who diagnosed his cancer, [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], in a dilapidated industrial washroom with [[List of Saw characters#Adam Faulkner-Stanheight|Adam Stanheight]], a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to a former police detective's suspicions that Gordon is Jigsaw. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by 6 o'clock, or else his wife and daughter will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[List of Saw characters#Steven Sing|Steven Sing]], who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases [[List of Saw characters#Zep Hindle|Zep Hindle]], who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws his own foot off in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It's later seen in Saw 3D that Dr. Gordon found a steaming hot pipe and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Gordon and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from ''Saw III'' show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of &quot;mercy killing&quot;; it would be the first time she deliberately intervened during a test and try to kill someone.

In ''[[Saw: The Video Game]]'', Jigsaw nurses Detective Tapp back to health and places him in an asylum where he has to save six people. This includes Amanda, a CSI named [[List of Saw characters#Jennings Foster|Jennings Foster]], Steven Sing's wife [[List of Saw characters#Melissa Sing|Melissa]], a reporter named [[List of Saw characters#Oswald McGullicuty|Oswald McGullicuty]], an arsonist named [[List of Saw characters#Obi Tate|Obi Tate]], and [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Ridenhour-Thomas|Jeff]] the victim who Tapp and Sing saved. Throughout the game, Tapp is followed by a masked figure known as [[Pighead]], who is eventually killed by him. At the end of the game, Tapp and the other victims escape with their lives but Tapp becomes fixated on finding Jigsaw. He then commits suicide due to depression.

''[[Saw II: Flesh &amp; Blood]]'' revolves around [[List of Saw characters#Michael Tapp|Michael]], Tapp's son, who is kidnapped by [[List of Saw characters#Pighead II|Pighead II]] and forced to play Jigsaw's game to find out anything he can about his father's death. Along the way, he discovers a drug [[cartel]] that Tapp accidentally stumbled upon. Michael finds and rescues most of the members of the cartel, but they are soon killed by Pighead II. At the beginning of the game, [[List of Saw characters#Campbell Iman|Campbell Iman]], who is playing a game to try and find his son, is given a choice to sacrifice himself, a drug-addict who is slowly dying of cancer, and save a &quot;stranger&quot; who has a long life ahead of him, or let the &quot;stranger&quot; die, resulting in his freedom. It is revealed that the &quot;stranger&quot; is Michael. If Campbell chooses to save himself, Michael dies and Jigsaw appears, telling him that his son completed his own test prior to the game. Jigsaw says that all he has to do is walk out the exit. Campbell comes to the conclusion that his son can not live in a world with people like Jigsaw. Campbell attacks Jigsaw, only to be killed by a flying [[scythe]]. If Campbell chooses to sacrifice himself and save Michael, Campbell dies and Michael escapes in an elevator. Michael's fame however slowly dies away.

''[[Saw II]]'' begins with the police tracking a severely weakened Jigsaw to his lair. However, another test is in place, as he and Amanda have kidnapped the son of Detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]] and trapped him and a group of seven convicts, previously framed by Matthews, in a house that is slowly being filled with [[sarin gas]], with Amanda Young among them. He will trade [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Matthews|Daniel Matthews]]' life for Detective Matthews' time, conversing with him until the game is concluded. Matthews loses his patience and assaults Jigsaw, forcing him to take them to the house, only to discover that the video feed from inside the house had been pre-recorded, the events actually taking place much earlier; Matthews' son was locked in a safe in Jigsaw's warehouse, being kept alive with an oxygen tank. Matthews is knocked unconscious by a masked figure and wakes up imprisoned in the bathroom from ''Saw'', which is part of the foundation of the house. Amanda reveals herself to Eric as Jigsaw's protÃ©gÃ©e before leaving him to die. In a flashback from ''Saw III'', Matthews manages to escape the bathroom by breaking his foot. He confronts and beats Amanda, demanding to know where his son is. Amanda fights him off and leaves him for dead. A flashback from ''Saw IV'' shows Hoffman later dragging Eric to a prison cell, keeping him alive for a future game.

The events of ''[[Saw III]]'' and ''[[Saw IV|IV]]'' occur concurrently. ''Saw III'' begins with Jigsaw, weakened and near death, confined to a makeshift hospital bed. Amanda has taken over his work, designing traps of her own; however, these traps are inescapable, as Amanda is convinced that Jigsaw's traps have no effect and that people don't change. A [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|kidnapped doctor]] is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while another test is performed on [[List of Saw characters#Jeff Denlon|Jeff]], a man obsessed with vengeance against the drunk driver who killed his son. Jigsaw, unwilling to allow &quot;a murderer&quot; to continue his legacy, designs a test for Amanda as well; she ultimately fails, and it results in the deaths of both Jigsaw and Amanda. ''Saw IV'', meanwhile, revolves around tests meant for [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Officer Rigg]], which are overseen by Hoffman. Rigg fails his test, resulting in the death of Eric Matthews. Rigg is left to bleed to death by Hoffman, who later discovers the bodies of Jigsaw and Amanda. When an [[autopsy]] is performed on Jigsaw, a [[cassette tape]] coated in wax is found in his [[stomach]]; the tape informs Hoffman that he is wrong to think that it is all over just because Jigsaw is dead, and he should not expect to go untested.

The events of ''[[Saw V]]'' show one of Hoffman's first solo tests, five people connected together by different roles in a disastrous fire that killed several others are put into four interconnected tests of teamwork, killing off one person in each trap. The two remaining test subjects realize at the final trap that each previous trap was meant to be completed by each of the five people doing a small part, rather than killing one person per trap. With this, the two work together and barely manage to escape from the series of traps. They are found by Special Agent Erikson and are alive.&lt;ref&gt;http://officialsaw.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Hoffman has set up [[Peter Strahm]] to appear to be Jigsaw's accomplice, while Strahm pursues Hoffman and is eventually killed due to the inability to follow Hoffman's rules, leaving Hoffman free to continue Jigsaw's &quot;work&quot;.

''[[Saw VI]]'' begins with Hoffman setting up a game as per John's instructions left in a box for Jill during ''Saw V''. This game centers around an insurance executive named [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]] who oversees a team responsible for rejecting two-thirds of all insurance claims. As William progresses through four tests, he saves as many people as he can and learns the error of his choice to reject so many policies, which inherently &quot;kill&quot; the rejected. His last test is revealed to be a test of forgiveness by the family of [[List of Saw characters#Harold Abbott|Harold Abbott]] who William rejected a policy to in the past, who's son ultimately chose to kill William using [[hydrofluoric acid]]. Meanwhile, Agent Erickson and the previously thought to be dead agent Perez search for Agent Strahm with the assistance of Hoffman. Upon finding irregularities in previous murder scenes, Perez and Erickson discover Hoffman's identity, but are killed by him before they can go public with his involvement. Hoffman travels back to the site of William's tests in which Jill attacks him to obey John's final request. She leaves Hoffman in a new Reverse Beartrap left behind by John where he is able to manipulate the trap and escape wounded. Hoffman is left in the area, screaming, with his face mangled by Jill's trap.

''[[Saw 3D]]'' picks up with Jill and Hoffman battling for control of Jigsaw's legacy. As Jill enters protective custody and makes Hoffman's true identity public, Hoffman sets up a new game involving skinheads to find a way to Jill. Meanwhile, Bobby Dagen, a fraud who has written a book about escaping a Jigsaw trap he never had experienced, is captured and forced to confront people around him who knew he lied about being in a trap. Three of Dagen's friends die, and his trap concludes with him being forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived before. He fails, which results in the death of his wife. Meanwhile, Hoffman has posed as a corpse and killed several officers to infiltrate the police station. He finds and kills Jill using the Reverse Beartrap. Hoffman attempts to leave town but is captured by Lawrence Gordon and his accomplices, then placed in the bathroom from the first film. Revealing Jigsaw aided Gordon after his trap and Gordon helped with subsequent traps in return, Hoffman is then left shackled in the bathroom to die.

==Production elements==
===Billy===
{{Main|Billy (Saw)}}

Billy is a puppet resembling a ventriloquist's dummy, sometimes seen riding a tricycle, that has appeared throughout the films and has become a type of mascot for the series. It is used by the [[Jigsaw (Saw)|Jigsaw Killer]] to communicate with his victims by delivering televised messages or occasionally in person to describe  details of the sadistic traps and the means by which the victims could survive. Viewers have sometimes incorrectly identified the puppet itself as Jigsaw, because of its presence and connection to the killer.

Age and use of the puppet over the course of the films necessitated its reconstruction. According to Wan, the original puppet's face for ''Saw'' involved clay, papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, and black ping-pong balls with the irises painted in for the eyes, but in later films more sophisticated construction included waterjet-cut foam for the body and remote-controlled [[Audio-Animatronics|animatronics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GreggJoBlopt2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/saw-2-diary-2|title=Saw 2: Dairy #2|last=Hoffman|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Hoffman|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|page=2|date={{nowrap|May 13, 2005}}|accessdate={{nowrap|August 24, 2011}}&lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61AcAwHaK|archivedate=August 24, 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]|people=Jason Ehl (props builder)|date=2007 | accessdate={{nowrap|September 20, 2011}}|time=0:32â1:41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The endurance and popularity of the franchise has resulted in the production of ''Billy'' merchandise, as well as references in other media and its use in promotions for the films.

===&quot;Hello Zepp&quot;===
{{Main|Hello Zepp}}

&quot;Hello Zepp&quot; is a piece of instrumental music that was originally composed by [[Charlie Clouser]] for the first film in the series. In ''Saw'', the implied primary antagonist, Zep Hindle, is revealed to actually be a victim of the real antagonist, the Jigsaw Killer. (The character's name in the script is spelled 'Zep', whereas the music titles are spelled 'Zepp').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Saw.html ''Saw'' script] on IMSDb. Accessed 2010-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://saw.ugo.com/?cur=saw-i-soundtrack ''Saw'' track listing] on [[UGO Networks|UGO]]. Accessed 2010-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; As the series continued, the piece was reused in every film as a [[leitmotif]], often being renamed and remixed to accommodate the changing situations and characters. The music was used in every ''Saw'' ending, except for ''Saw VI'' where a remixed, slightly modified version of the song was used.

===Traps===
An important component of each film is the variety of mechanical traps Jigsaw and his apprentices use on their captives to communicate his message. According to David Hackl, all of the traps are real objects, and not [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. They were designed to look horrific but ultimately be safe for the actors in them. Writer Marcus Dunstan said, &quot;It's built to function there on the day,&quot; and added, &quot;It works. So if there's a scalping chair â there really was a chair with working gears to grind and pull your scalp back.&quot; The most potentially dangerous item was a &quot;water box,&quot; used in ''Saw V'', in which one of the actors (Scott Patterson, as Peter Strahm) had to keep his head submerged as long as possible. Another element of the traps is that Hackl desired a specific look of rust and menace, but he also wanted them to have a type of beauty about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/103/1039913p1.html|title=The Anatomy of a Trap: Saw|date={{nowrap|October 29, 2009}}|accessdate={{nowrap|July 22, 2010}}|last=Monfette|first=Christopher|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61r3t1zc2|archivedate={{nowrap|September 20, 2011}}|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===

[[Japan|Japanese]] video game company [[Konami]] currently owns the rights to the ''Saw'' interactive video game property. Konami stated in mid-2009 that they wanted to make ''Saw'' a series of video games to supplement the films. They also wish to make ''Saw'' their next big survival horror franchise next to their other property, ''[[Silent Hill]]''. They stated that because ''Saw'' focuses on visual intensity and ''Silent Hill'' focuses on psychological terror, both could exist in the video game industry without directly competing against each other.&lt;ref name= &quot;Will Saw Be Konami's Second Great Horror Franchise?&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2009/04/silent-hill-say-hello-to-your-new-brother-jigsawkonami-has-confirmed-an-earlier-cut-scene-report-that-it-has-bought-the-pub.html|title=Will Saw Be Konami's Second Great Horror Franchise?|work=The Cut Scene|date=2009-04-02|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
In an interview with [[IGN]] on April 12, 2011, series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell were asked if ''Saw 3D'' is truly the final ''Saw'' film. Wan commented by saying, &quot;It is finished for now, but since it's such a huge, well-known franchise, it's gonna come back at some point.&quot; They were also asked what it would take for them to return to the films. Wan stated, &quot;I would come back if we were allowed to do something different and really cool.&quot; Whannell expanded that by saying, &quot;We would want to do something that was a bit of a different take.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/videos/2011/04/12/kapow-11-saw-franchise-isnt-dead|title=Saw - James Wan and Leigh Whannell Talk Franchise Future|work=[[IGN]]|date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
