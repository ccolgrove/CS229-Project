'''''The Hunger Games''''' is a [[First-person_narrative|first person]] [[young adult literature|young-adult]] [[science fiction]] novel written by [[Suzanne Collins]]. It was originally published on September 14, 2008, by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen King |authorlink = Stephen King |title=Book Review: The Hunger Games|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20223443,00.html|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first book of the [[The Hunger Games trilogy|''Hunger Games'' trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Collins |first=Suzanne |title=Planning the Trilogy |url=http://www.scholastic.ca/thehungergames/videos/planning-the-trilogy.htm |format=Video |program=[[Scholastic Canada]] |accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduces sixteen-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], who lives in a [[post-apocalyptic]] world in the country of [[The Hunger Games universe#Panem|Panem]] where the [[United States]] once existed. This is where a government working in a central city called the [[The Hunger Games universe#The Capitol|Capitol]] holds power. In the book, the Hunger Games are an annual televised event where the Capitol chooses one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 from each of 12 districts for a massive televised battle in which only one person can survive. 

Collins says that the idea for ''The Hunger Games'' came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the [[Iraq War]]. The two blended together and the idea for the book was formed. The Greek myth of [[Theseus]] also served as inspiration for the book, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Margolis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Margolis|first=Rick|title=A Killer Story: An Interview with Suzanne Collins, Author of 'The Hunger Games'|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6590063.html|publisher=[[School Library Journal]]|date=September 1, 2008|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins' father's service in the Vietnam War helped her understand how it feels to fear the loss of a loved one.

The book has been released as a paperback and also an audiobook, which was read by [[Carolyn McCormick]]. ''The Hunger Games'' has an initial print of 200,000 &amp;ndash; twice doubled from the original 50,000. Since its initial release, the novel has been translated into 26 different languages and rights have been sold in 38 countries. The book received mostly positive reviews from major reviewers and authors, such as [[Stephen King]]. ''Hunger Games'' is the first novel in a trilogy, followed by ''[[Catching Fire (2009 novel)|Catching Fire]]'', published September 1, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunger Games|work=Scholastic| url=http://www.scholastic.com/thehungergames/about-the-book.htm|accessdate=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mockingjay]]'', published August 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Keith Staskiewicz |title=Final 'Hunger Games' novel has been given a title and a cover |url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/02/11/final-hunger-games-novel-has-been-given-a-title-and-a-cover/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration and origins==
Collins says that the idea for ''The Hunger Games'' came to her one day when she was switching between multiple television channels. The lines between a reality show competition and war coverage &quot;began to blur in this very unsettling way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Horse&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080609/9915-a-dark-horse-breaks-out.html|title=A dark horse breaks out: the buzz is on for Suzanne Collins's YA series debut.|last=A. Sellers|first=John|date=June 9, 2008|work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also cites the Greek myth of [[Theseus]], in which the city of [[Athens]] was forced to send young men and women to [[Crete]] to be devoured by the [[Minotaur]], as inspiration for the nation of Panem; she explains, &quot;Crete was sending a very clear message: 'Mess with us and we'll do something worse than kill you. We'll kill your children.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dark Horse&quot;/&gt; Collins also said that similar stories hit her hard when she was young, since her father fought in the [[Vietnam War]] and she was frightened knowing that he was there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Margolis&quot; /&gt;

==Plot==
{{See also|The Hunger Games universe}}

''The Hunger Games'' takes place in an unidentified future time period after the destruction of [[North America]], in a nation known as [[The Hunger Games universe#Panem|Panem]]. Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol and thirteen surrounding, poorer districts, one of which has been destroyed. District 12, where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly [[Appalachia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins, Suzanne 2008 p. 41&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Suzanne|year=2008|title=The Hunger Games|publisher=Scholastic|page=41|ISBN=0-439-02348-3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol, every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by lottery and forced to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised event in which the participants, or &quot;tributes,&quot; must fight to the [[death]] in a dangerous, outdoor arena, controlled by the Capitol, until only one remains. The story follows fatherless 16-year-old [[Katniss Everdeen]], a girl from [[The Hunger Games universe#District 12|District 12]], who volunteers for the 74th Games in place of her younger sister, [[Primrose Everdeen|Primrose]]. Also participating from District 12 is [[Peeta Mellark]], a baker's son whom Katniss knows from school and who once gave her bread when her family was starving.

Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their mentor, Haymitch, a former tribute himself, instructs them to learn about the other tributes. They are then publicly displayed to the Capitol audience. During this time, Peeta reveals on-air his long-time unrequited love for Katniss. Katniss believes this to be a ploy to gain audience support for the Games, which can be crucial for survival, as audience members are encouraged to send gifts like food, medicine, and tools to favored tributes during the Games. The Games begin with eleven of the 24 tributes dying in the first day, while Katniss relies on her well-practiced hunting and outdoor skills to survive. As the games continue, the tribute death toll increases. Days later, Katniss develops a short allegiance with Rue, the twelve year-old girl from District 11 who reminds Katniss of her sister Prim. When Rue is speared in the abdomen by another tribute, Katniss shoots him through the throat with one of her arrows and comforts a dying Rue. She sings to her, and then spreads flowers all over her body as a sign of distaste towards the Capitol.  

Supposedly due to Katniss and Peeta's beloved image in the minds of the audience as &quot;star-crossed lovers,&quot; a rule change is announced midway through the games, stating that two tributes from the same district can win the Hunger Games as a pair. Upon hearing this, Katniss searches for Peeta and finds him wounded. She nurses him back to health and acts the part of a young girl falling in love to gain more favor with the audience and, consequently, gifts from her sponsors. When the couple are finally the last two tributes, the Gamemakers suddenly reverse the rule change and try to force them into a dramatic finale, where one must kill the other to win. Instead, they both threaten suicide by means of [[The Hunger Games universe#Nightlock|poisonous berries]] in hope that the Gamemakers would rather have two winners than none. It works and both Katniss and Peeta are declared winners of the 74th Hunger Games.

Though she survives the ordeal in the arena and is treated to a hero's welcome in the Capitol, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a political target after defying her society's authoritarian leaders so publicly. Afterwards, Peeta is heartbroken to learn that their relationship was at least partially a calculated ploy to earn sympathy from the audience, although Katniss remains unsure of her own feelings.

==Themes==
{{expand section|date=January 2011}}
The major themes in &quot;The Hunger Games,&quot; as noted by a VOYA reviewer, are &quot;government control, 'big brother,' and personal independence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;barnesnoble&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Hunger-Games/Suzanne-Collins/e/9780439023481|title=Barnes &amp; Noble, The Hunger Games (Editorial Reviews)|accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themes are shown through the Capitol's controlling rules for the residents of the different districts, as well as the Hunger Games themselves, where the Capitol has children fight to the death, simply to assert their power. The theme of personal independence is evident in many of the characters in the books, including Katniss, Gale, and Peeta, as they fight against the government in order to simply survive in the face of the corrupt Capitol. Survival and self-preservation are also apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alison|last=Carnar|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/48135746|title=The Hunger Games (book review)|publisher=Scientific Commons|year=2009|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of power and downfall, similar to that of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']], was pointed out in Scholastic's ''Discussion Guide''.&lt;ref name=&quot;guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/content/collateral_resources/pdf/h/HungerGamesTrilogyDiscussionGuide.pdf|title=The Hunger Games trilogy Discussion Guide|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cover==
The cover of ''The Hunger Games'' is black, featuring a gold bird with an arrow inscribed in a circle.

==Critical reception==
''The Hunger Games'' has been received well by critics. In [[Stephen King]]'s review for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', he praised how the book is addictive and also compared it to &quot;shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway.&quot; However, he stated that there were &quot;displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults&quot;, that the love triangle was standard for the genre, and that the reality TV &quot;badlands&quot; were similar to ''[[Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man]]'', and ''[[The Long Walk]]''. He gave the book an overall B grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt; [[Stephenie Meyer]] (author of the [[Twilight (series)|''Twilight'' series]]) said, &quot;I was so obsessed with this book....''The Hunger Games'' is amazing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer|first=Stephanie|title=Press and Reviews|url=http://www.thehungergames.co.uk/press_and_reviews|accessdate=October 14, 2010}}Note: originally on www.stepheniemeyer.com&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Bird of ''[[School Library Journal]]'' praised the novel, saying it is &quot;exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns&quot;.

===Controversy===
''The Hunger Games'' has been criticized for its similarities to the 1999 novel ''[[Battle Royale]]''. Although Collins maintains that she &quot;had never heard of that book until [her] book was turned in,&quot; [[The New York Times]] reports that &quot;the parallels are striking enough that Collinsâs work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff,&quot; but that &quot;there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10collins-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=Suzanne Collinsâs War Stories for Kids|date=April 8, 2011|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
