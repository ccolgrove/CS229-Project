The '''Italian elections of 1948''' were the second democratic elections with [[universal suffrage]] ever held in [[Italy]], taking place after the 1946 elections to the [[Italian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], responsible for drawing up a new Italian Constitution. The election day for the first Parliament of the new Italian Republic was set for the 18th of April 1948.

The 1948 elections were heavily influenced by the [[Cold War]] confrontation between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. After the February 1948 [[Czechoslovak coup d'Ã©tat of 1948|communist coup in Czechoslovakia]], the US became alarmed about Soviet intentions and feared that, if the [[leftist]] coalition were to win the elections, the communist Left would draw Italy into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. As the last month of the 1948 election campaign began, [[Time magazine]] pronounced the possible leftist victory to be &quot;the brink of catastrophe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;time220348&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804484,00.html Fateful Day], Time Magazine, March 22, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

The elections were eventually won with a comfortable margin by the '''[[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]''' party ({{Lang-it|Democrazia Cristiana}}, DC) that defeated the left-wing coalition of the '''[[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]''' ({{Lang-it|Fronte Democratico Popolare per la libertÃ , la pace, il lavoro}}, FDP) that comprised the '''[[Italian Communist Party]]''' ({{lang-it|Partito Comunista Italiano}}, PCI) and the '''[[Italian Socialist Party]]''' ({{Lang-it|Partito Socialista Italiano}}, PSI). 

The Christian Democrats went on to form a government without the Communists, who had been in government from June 1944, when the first post-war government was formed, until May 1947.

==Electoral system==
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] chosen two years before for the election of the Constituent Assembly, was definitely adopted for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were divided into 31 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;The number of seats for each constituency went from 1 for [[Aosta Valley]] to 36 for [[Milan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In each constituency, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with the [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats transferred to the national level, where special [[closed list]]s of national leaders received the last seats using the [[Hare quota]].

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were created.  The candidates needed a two thirds majority to be elected, but only 15 aspiring senators were elected this way. All remaining votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where the [[D'Hondt method]] was used: Inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.

This electoral system became standard in Italy, and was used until 1993.

==campaign==
The elections remain unmatched in verbal aggression and fanaticism in Italy's period of democracy. The Christian Democrat [[Political campaign|campaign]] claimed that, in [[communist]] countries, &quot;children send parents to jail&quot;, &quot;children are owned by the state&quot;, &quot;people eat their own children&quot;, and assured voters that disaster would strike Italy if the [[Left-wing|Left]] were to take power.&lt;ref name=&quot;time120448&quot;&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779791,00.html &quot;Show of Force&quot;], TIME Magazine, April 12, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time190448&quot;&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798374,00.html &quot;How to Hang On&quot;], TIME Magazine, April 19, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Another slogan was, &quot;In the secrecy of the polling booth, God sees you - Stalin doesn't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc130605&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4087420.stm &quot;Fertility vote galvanises Vatican&quot;], BBC News, 13 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

The PCI was ''de facto'' leading the FDP, and had effectively marginalised the PSI, which eventually suffered because of this in  these elections, in terms of parliamentary seats and political power;&lt;ref&gt;The Communist party gained more than the two thirds of the seats won by the joint list. ([http://legislature.camera.it/frameset.asp?content=%2Faltre%5Fsezionism%2F8793%2F8992%2Fdocumentotesto%2Easp%3F &quot;Number of MPs for each political group during the First Legislature&quot;],  Italian Chamber of Deputies website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Socialists also had been hurt by the secession of a social-democratic faction led by [[Giuseppe Saragat]], which contested the election with the concurrent list of [[Socialist Unity (Italy)|Socialist Unity]].

The PCI had difficulties in restraining its more militant members, who, in the period immediately after the war, had engaged in violent acts of reprisals. The areas affected by the violence (the so called &quot;Red Triangle&quot; of [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], or parts of [[Liguria]] around Genoa and Savona, for instance) had previously seen episodes of brutality comitted by the [[Fascist]]s  during [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime and the [[Italian Resistance]] during the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' gradual advance through Italy.

==Superpower influence==
[[File:Distacco 1948.PNG|thumb|left|220px|Regional pluralities in Senate]]
The 1948 general election could not but be influenced by the [[Cold War]] that was starting between the United States and the Soviet Union. 

The CIA, by its own admission, gave $1 million to Italian &quot;center parties&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;CIA memorandum to the Forty Committee (National Security Council), presented to the Select Committee on Intelligence, [[United States House of Representatives]] (the Pike Committee) during closed hearings held in 1975. The bulk of the committee's report which contained this memorandum was leaked to the press in February 1976 and first appeared in book form as CIA â The Pike Report (Nottingham, England, 1977). The memorandum appears on pp. 204-5 of this book.&lt;/ref&gt; and was accused of publishing forged letters in order to discredit the leaders of the Italian Communist Party.&lt;ref name =cnn&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Security Act of 1947]], that made foreign [[covert operations]] possible, had been signed into law about six months  earlier by the [[President of the United States|American President]] [[Harry S. Truman]].

&quot;We had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their political expenses, their campaign expenses, for posters, for pamphlets,&quot; according to CIA operative [[F. Mark Wyatt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt060706&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/us/06wyatt.html F. Mark Wyatt, 86, C.I.A. Officer, Is Dead], The New York Times, July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In order to influence the election, the US agencies undertook a campaign of writing ten million letters, made numerous short-wave radio broadcasts and funded the publishing of books and articles, all of which warned the Italians of what was believed to be the consequences of a communist victory. [[Time Magazine]] backed the campaign and featured the Christian Democrat leader and Prime Minister [[Alcide De Gasperi]] on the cover of its April 19, 1948 issue and in its lead story.&lt;ref name=&quot;time190448&quot;/&gt;

The PCI, though, was also being funded by the Soviet Union, according to Mark Wyatt. &quot;The Communist Party of Italy was funded ... by black bags of money directly out of the Soviet compound in Rome; and the Italian services were aware of this. As the elections approached, the amounts grew, and the estimates [are] that $8 million to $10 million a month actually went into the coffers of communism. Not necessarily completely to the party: [[Giuseppe Di Vittorio|Mr. Di Vittorio]] and labor was powerful, and certainly a lot went to him,&quot; according to the former CIA operative.&lt;ref name =cnn/&gt;

The Christian Democrats eventually won the 1948 election with 48 percent of the vote, while the FDP received 31 percent. The CIA's practice of influencing the political situation was repeated in every Italian election for at least the next 24 years.&lt;ref name=nyt060706/&gt; A leftist coalition would not win a general election for the next 48 years, until 1996. This was due to the Italians' traditional bend for conservatism, on one side, but also, even more importantly, to the [[Cold War]], with the US closely watching Italy, in their determination to maintain a vital [[NATO]] presence amidst the Mediterranean and retain the [[Yalta_agreement#Key_points|Yalta-agreed]] [[status quo]] of western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ganser&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Results==
The electoral results allowed the continuation of [[Alcide De Gasperi]] premiership, under the ''[[centrism]]'' formula. Liberals, Republicans and Social-democrats joined the Christian Democracy in the government. De Gasperi formed three [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Councils of Ministers]], the second one in 1950 after the defection of the Liberals, who hoped for more rightist politics, and the third one in 1951 after the defection of the Social-democrats, who hoped for more leftist politics.

Following a provision of the new [[Constitution of Italy]], all living democratic deputies elected during the [[Italian general election, 1924|1924 general election]] and deposed by the [[National Fascist Party]] in 1926, automatically became members of the first republican Senate.
