<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="29717753" ns="0" title="Format of Sesame Street"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">''[[Sesame Street]]'' is an American [[children's television program]] known for its use of format and structure to convey educational concepts to its preschool audience.  It utilized the conventions of television, in the form of a combination of [[Jim Henson|Jim Henson's]] [[Muppets]], animation, short films, humor, and cultural references.  Since its premiere in 1969, it was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents, format, and production values on laboratory and formative research, and the first to include a curriculum &quot;detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;palmer&quot;/&gt;

The goal of the show's creators, television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] vice president [[Lloyd Morrisett]], was to create a [[children's television show]] that would &quot;master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-8&quot;/&gt; such as helping young children prepare for school.  The format of ''Sesame Street'' consisted of a combination of commercial television production elements and educational techniques. It was the first time a more realistic setting, an inner city street and neighborhood, was used for a children's program, a choice writer Michael Davis called &quot;unprecedented&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis, p. 156&quot;/&gt;

At first, each episode was structured like a [[magazine]], but in 1998, as a result of changes in their audience and its viewing habits, the producers changed to a more narrative format, including the addition of a popular, fifteen-minute long segment, &quot;[[Elmo's World]]&quot;, hosted by the Muppet [[Elmo]].  The show expanded the new format to the entire show in 2002.

==Original format==
As writer Cary O'Dell has stated, ''Sesame Street's'' producers, from its first episode, have used elements of commercial television in structuring the format of the show: &quot;a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-70&quot;/&gt;  They also used animation, live-action short films, and music.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-70&quot;/&gt;  The show's staff produced segments filmed in-studio with their human and Muppet cast and they contracted out the animations and short films&lt;ref group=note&gt;For the CTW, &quot;films&quot; meant segments that depicted humans or real animals instead of animated characters. Morrow reported that films depicting animals were more popular than the ones with humans (Morrow, pp. 91, 92).&lt;/ref&gt; to independent producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-88&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Animations made up 37% of an episode, films made up 17%, and Muppet segments 20%. (Morrow, pp. 89, 92, 94).&lt;/ref&gt; Cooney was the first to suggest that they use &quot;teaching commercials&quot;, or several twelve -to ninety-second shorts, and that they consistently repeat several key concepts throughout an episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-70&quot;/&gt; The studio segments were written to concentrate on the African-American child, a key component of the show's audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-97&quot;/&gt;

The producers and writers decided to build the new show around a [[brownstone]] on an inner-city street, a choice writer Michael Davis called &quot;unprecedented&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis, p. 156&quot;/&gt; They reproduced their viewers' neighborhoodsâas O'Dell, described it, &quot;a realistic city street, complete with peeling paint, alleys, front stoops, and metal trash cans along the sidewalk&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;odell-72&quot;/&gt;  Director [[Jon Stone]], for example, was convinced that in order for inner-city children to relate to ''Sesame Street'', the show had to be set in a familiar place.&lt;ref name=&quot;hellman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The set has changed many times during its history to better reflect the changing experiences of the show's young viewers (Gikow, p. 212).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its urban setting, however, the producers decided to avoid depicting more negativity than what was already present in the child's environment, but instead depicted the world both realistically and as it could be.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-50&quot;/&gt;  They attempted to present the world from a child's perspective, as writer Robert Morrow put it, &quot;an idealized world of learning and play&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;morrow-102&quot;/&gt; or as director Jim Martin put it, &quot;an urban show kids could relate to&quot; and &quot;a reality show with a sprinkling of fantasy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-120&quot;/&gt;  As researcher [[Gerald S. Lesser]] stated, &quot;With all its raucousness and slapstick humor, ''Sesame Street'' became a sweet show, and its staff maintains that there is nothing wrong in that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-95&quot;/&gt;

When ''Sesame Street'' premiered, most researchers assumed that young children did not have long [[attention span]]s, so the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. As a result, each episode was structured like a [[magazine]] that would allow the producers to use a mixture of styles, paces, and characters. It allowed for flexibility and for segments to be dropped, modified, or added without affecting the rest of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;magazine&quot;/&gt;  As Lesser stated, &quot;It is unlikely that any other approach would have provided enough room to present material on the wide range of goals we had selected&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-99&quot;/&gt;  Lesser reported that they found that if the segments within the show were sufficiently varied in character, content, style, pace, and mood, children's attention was able to be sustained throughout each episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;lesser-131&quot;/&gt;  Morrow reported that the show's magazine format accommodated both the curriculum and its demanding production schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;magazine&quot;/&gt;

===&quot;Street scenes&quot; ===

At first, the show's &quot;street scenes&quot;, which referred to the action taking place on the brownstone set, were not story-based. Instead, they consisted of individual segments connected to the curriculum and interrupted by &quot;inserts&quot;, or puppet skits, short films, and animations. By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, so the street scenes were changed to depict storylines.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-179&quot;/&gt;  The writers presented a story, separated by several inserts, dispersed throughout the hour-long show. Although the stories usually lasted about ten-to-twelve minutes in length, it would take forty-five minutes to tell them.&lt;ref name=&quot;palmer-8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salamon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;When 130 episodes were made each season, about 2,400 segments had to be produced.&lt;/ref&gt; According to writer Tony Geiss, the addition of storylines changed the nature of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;gikow-179&quot;/&gt;

During ''Sesame Street's'' development stage in 1968, the producers decided to follow the recommendation of child psychologists and not feature the human actors and Muppets together because they were concerned it would confuse and mislead young children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisch &amp; Bernstein, p. 39&quot;/&gt;  Shortly before the show's premiere, the producers created five one-hour episodes for the purpose of testing whether children found them comprehensible and appealing. They were never intended for broadcast. Instead, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia in July 1969. The CTW found that the results were &quot;generally very positive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisch &amp; Bernstein, p. 39&quot;/&gt;  Children attended to the shows during the Muppet segments, but their interest was lost during the &quot;street scenes&quot;, which featured only humans and was called &quot;the glue&quot; that &quot;pulled the show together&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell, p. 106&quot;/&gt; by CTW researcher Edward Palmer. As a result, the appeal of the test episodes were lower than they preferred,&lt;ref name=&quot;gladwell-105&quot;/&gt; so significant changes were made.

Lesser called the producers' decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers &quot;a turning point in the history of ''Sesame Street''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell, p. 106&quot;/&gt; The producers went back and re-shot the Street segments; Henson and his team created Muppets that could interact with the human actors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell, p. 106&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fisch&quot;&gt;Fisch &amp; Bernstein, pp. 39â40&lt;/ref&gt; specifically, as CTW researchers put it, &quot;two of ''Sesame Street's'' most enduring Muppets: [[Oscar the Grouch]] and [[Big Bird]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisch &amp; Bernstein, p. 40&quot;/&gt;  The test episodes were responsible for what writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]] called &quot;the essence of ''Sesame Street''âthe artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell, p. 106&quot;/&gt;

==Format changes of the 1990s and 2000s==
''Sesame Street'''s format remained intact until the show's later decades. By the 1990s, its dominance was challenged by other programs, and its ratings declined. New research, the growth of the children's home video industry, and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable demonstrated that the traditional magazine-format was not necessarily the most effective way to hold their attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis-338&quot;/&gt;  For ''Sesame Street's'' 30th anniversary in 1999, its producers researched the reasons for the show's lower ratings. For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed ''Sesame Street's'' content and structure during a series of two-week long workshops. They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed in thirty years. They found that although the show was produced for three- to five-year-olds, children began watching it at a younger age. As a result, the target age for ''Sesame Street'' shifted downward, from four years to three years.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Elmosworld-room.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A red Muppet, Elmo, standing with his arms outstretched, in the midst of a brightly-colored, crayon-drawn room.|The Muppet [[Elmo]], as shown in his crayon-created &quot;[[Elmo's World]]&quot;, 2007]] --&gt;

In 1998, a new 15-minute long segment that targeted the show's younger viewers began to be shown at the end of each episode. The segment, called &quot;[[Elmo's World]]&quot;, used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative,&lt;ref name=&quot;fisch-45&quot;/&gt; followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition. Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, &quot;Elmo's World&quot; took place in a stylized crayon-drawn universe as conceived by its host.&lt;ref name=&quot;clash-75&quot;/&gt;  [[Elmo]], who represented the younger audience, was chosen as the host of the closing segment because younger toddlers identified with him&lt;ref name=&quot;clash&quot;/&gt; and because he had always tested well with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;works&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;At first, the same segment was repeated daily for a week, but this practice was dropped at the end of the first season of &quot;Elmo's World&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, ''Sesame Street's'' producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic. They decided, after the show's 33rd season, to expand upon the &quot;Elmo's World&quot; concept by, as ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' TV critic Tim Goodman called it, &quot;deconstructing&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timgoodman&quot;/&gt; the show. They changed the structure of the entire show to a more narrative format, making the show easier for young children to navigate. Arlene Sherman, a co-executive producer for 25 years, called the show's new look &quot;startlingly different&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;timgoodman&quot;/&gt;
