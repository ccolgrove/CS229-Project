The '''[http://driverpacks.net/ DriverPacks.net]''' project is an [[open source]] project. The goal is to simplify the creation of a &quot;uniform&quot; Windows installation CD, i.e. an installation CD that works on '''every''' piece of hardware, without having to go look for other drivers after the installation.

==History==
Originally started by [http://wimleers.com/about Wim Leers] because he &quot;wanted to achieve a Uniform UXPCD, to be able to use these unattended Windows XP installation CD's on any computer (of course one that's capable of running Windows XP)&quot;.
Wim released the first Pack in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://driverpacks.net/about About DriverPacks]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Packs==
Currently there are DriverPacks (i.e. collections of drivers) for the following hardware categories:
*CPU Chipsets
*CPU 
*Graphics/Video
*Ethernet
*Mass Storage/Removable/USB
*Audio/Sound
*Wireless (Wi-Fi/WLAN)

There also is a tool to integrate these DriverPacks into a Windows installation CD, which is called the DriverPacks BASE.

==Compatibility==
The DriverPacks and the DriverPacks BASE are compatible with all Windows versions based on the NT 5.1 32-bit kernel, as well as Windows Vista (including the 64-bit version):
*Windows 2000
*Windows XP
*Windows Server 2003
*Windows Vista
*Windows 7

==Legal status==
On the driverpacks.net forums, mr_smartepants claims, &quot;The content of the DriverPacks belong to their respective companies and they are well aware of our use of their intellectual property (and by their inaction, condone our use). It's up to them to determine any legal intervention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Re: DriverPack Solution discussion|url=http://forum.driverpacks.net/viewtopic.php?id=4339#p36486|work=Driverpacks.net forums|accessdate=November 19, 2010|author=mr_smartepants|date=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
