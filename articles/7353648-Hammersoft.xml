'''Eliot Jon Halverson''' (born November 8, 1990) is an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]]. He is [[2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2007 US Junior National Champion]].

==Personal life==
Halverson was born  in [[BogotÃ¡]], [[Colombia]] and was adopted from Colombia at age five months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinoskating.org/Eliot-November2005.htm |title=Latino Skating Interview - November, 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived and trained in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] from his move to the United States until 2008, when he began training in [[Ann Arbor]]. Halverson's adoptive parents are divorced and he lives with his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;skho&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Pat |last=Borzi |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Skating Home |url=http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/January-2008/Skating-Home/ |work= |publisher=Minnesota Monthly |date=2008-01 |accessdate=2007-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been homeschooled from a young age.

Because the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships]] were held in his hometown of St. Paul, Halverson became a poster-boy for the 2008 Nationals.

==Career==
Eliot Halverson began skating at age six on a frozen pond behind his house.&lt;ref name=&quot;skho&quot; /&gt; When the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] came to [[Minneapolis]] in 1998, Halverson skipped school for a week to watch them. This encouraged him to take private lessons and become a more serious skater. He landed his first triple at age eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=J.

Unlike most male skaters, Halverson can perform a [[Biellmann spin]].

Halverson is the 2003 U.S. Juvenile bronze medalist, 2004 Intermediate champion, and 2005 Novice pewter medalist. His fourth place finish at the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships]] earned him a trip to the 2005 [[Triglav Trophy]] at the novice level, which he won. Halverson stayed novice for the 2005-2006 Olympic season and won the novice title at the  [[2006 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. In his novice free skate, he landed six triple jumps, including two triple-double combinations.&lt;ref&gt;http://stlouis2006.usfigureskating.org/upload/general/news/novicemen-reports.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 2006-2007 season, Halverson made his junior debut. He won  two bronze medals on the [[ISU Junior Grand Prix]] circuit and was second alternate to the 2006/2007 Junior Grand Prix Final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isufs.org/events/jgp2006/jgpsmen.htm Crystal Report Viewer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to the [[2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|2007 Nationals]] and won the junior title.  Halverson is the first men's skater since [[Evan Lysacek]] to win back-to-back novice and junior national titles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Fawcett  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=No Nightmare for Halverson in Junior Men's Free Skate |url=http://spokane2007.usfigureskating.org/News/RecapNews/012607HalversonWins.aspx |work= |publisher= |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elvin |last=Walker  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Halverson Looks Toward 2007-08 Season  |url=http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2006/061007.shtml |work= |publisher=GoldenSkate |date=2007-06-10 |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of only nine men to do it since 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;skho&quot; /&gt; His placement at nationals earned him a trip to the [[2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]], where he placed 10th. Until Junior Worlds, Halverson had never placed off the podium in a major event in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Strong U.S. Team Ready for World Junior Figure Skating Championships This Week in Oberstdorf, Germany |url= http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=37789 |work= |publisher=U.S. Figure Skating |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- the source says &quot;fourth or higher&quot;. In the competition where he finished fourth, fourth was on the podium. --&gt;  

Halverson began the 2007-2008 season at the Junior Grand Prix Harghita Cup. After placing 6th in the short program, he attempted his first triple axel jump in competition in the free skate. Although he fell on the landing, he rotated it successfully and was given credit for the jump officially. He placed 5th in the long program, placing 5th overall. At his second event, the Pokal der Blauen Schwerter in Germany, he placed 7th overall, after placing 4th in the long program and being credited with his first triple axel of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isufs.org/results/jgpger2007/jgpger07_JuniorMen_FS_Scores.pdf |title=2007 Junior Grand Prix Pokal der Blauen Schwerter Men's Free Skating Protocol |accessdate=2007-12-26 |format=PDF |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halverson made his senior debut at the 2008 Midwestern Sectional Championships, where he won the pewter medal. At the [[2008 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], his second senior-level competition, he was the youngest senior man to compete. He placed 13th overall and was named first alternate for the [[2008 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]].

Halverson changed coaches from [[Ted Engelking]] to [[Doug Haw]] following the 2007/2008 season. He also changed his club affiliation from the to St. Paul FSC the Ann Arbor FSC following his move to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. This changed the region he competed out of from Upper Great Lakes to Eastern Great Lakes.

He began the 2008/2009 season at the [[2008-2009 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] event in [[Courchevel, France]], where he placed 8th. At the Eastern Great Lakes Regional Championships in October, he won the silver medal behind [[Parker Pennington]] and qualified for Sectionals.

Halverson's 2009/2010 season began at the [[2009-2010 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] event in [[Belarus]], [[Russia]], where he placed 5th.  He went on to place second at the Eastern Great Lakes Regional Championships in October, qualifying for [[Midwestern Sectional Figure Skating Championships|Midwestern Sectionals]], where he placed 5th to finish his season.

Due to ongoing medical issues related to a pinched nerve in his lower back, Halverson did not compete in the 2010/2011 season.  However, he currently plans to return to competition for the 2011/2012 season, barring any continued medical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100908&amp;content_id=14436644&amp;vkey=ice_news|title=2The Inside Edge with Sarah and Drew - Halverson to sit out the season with back injury|date=2010-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
