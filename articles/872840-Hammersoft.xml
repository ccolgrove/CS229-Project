Shortly thereafter the owner and now Chairman, [[Richard Hayne]], changed the name to Urban Outfitters. The product line has evolved from [[vintage clothing|vintage]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], [[retro]], [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]], [[irony|ironically humorous]], [[kitschy]] apparel and furniture to include luxury brands and several designer collaborations.

== Customer base and merchandise ==
[[Image:Urban Outfitters.jpg|thumb|Urban Outfitters store in San Francisco, California]]Urban Outfitters has been described as selling hip, kitschy, and ironic merchandise, for example, T-shirts emblazoned with the words &quot;Jive Turkey&quot; or &quot;[[Atari]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/articles/5725/cover-story ''Philadelphia Weekly'']&lt;/ref&gt;  They are known for catering to &quot;[[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]&quot; culture and fashion, which incorporates an influence from past decades. According to their website, Urban Outfitters' &quot;established ability to understand our customers and connect with them on an emotional level is the reason for our success.&quot; The site says that &quot;the reason for this success is that our brands... are both compelling and distinct. Each brand chooses a particular customer segment, and once chosen, sets out to create sustainable points of distinction with that segment&quot; and that &quot;the emphasis is on creativity. Our goal is to offer a product assortment and an environment so compelling and distinctive that the customer feels an empathetic connection to the brand and is persuaded to buy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanoutfittersinc.com/profile/index.jsp Corporate website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban Outfitters seeks to create &quot;a differential shopping experience, which creates an emotional bond with the 18 to 30 year old target customer we serve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbanoutfittersinc.com/profile/urban.jsp Corporate website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it agreed to sell limited editions of [[List of Polaroid instant cameras#600|Polaroid ONE600]] instant cameras and Type 779 [[instant film]] in partnership with the Austrian entrepreneur Florian Kaps, who acquired the rights to manufacture 700 copies of the defunct product.&lt;ref&gt;Karen von Hahn, &quot;Mama, don't take my Polaroid away&quot;, ''Globe and Mail'', page L3, September 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product controversies ==
Urban Outfitters' products have been the subject of multiple controversies, particularly concerning religious and ethnic issues.
*In [[2003]] the company released a [[Monopoly]] parody called [[Ghettopoly]]. The game was criticized as racist by a local chapter of the [[NAACP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2003/10/04/Tampabay/Game_s_street_theme_u.shtml &quot;Game's street theme upsets NAACP&quot;] â ''St. Petersburg Times''&lt;/ref&gt; and black clergy, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday1&quot;&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creator of the game, David Chang, maintained the games are &quot;a medium to bring together in laughter,&quot; adding, &quot;If we can't laugh at ourselves... we'll continue to live in blame and bitterness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday1&quot;/&gt;
*Also in 2003, a T-shirt released with the phrase &quot;Everyone Loves a [[Jewish]] Girl&quot; surrounded by [[dollar sign]]s was condemned,&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Paynter|Paynter, Susan]]. [http://www.seattlepi.com/paynter/158269_paynter28.asp &quot;Fashion statement sends a hurtful message&quot;], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', January 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[Anti-Defamation League]] welcomed the decision to discontinue the shirts, saying that it hoped &quot;that this experience, combined with another recent controversy surrounding an Urban Outfitters product that reinforced stereotypes, has served to sensitize the company to the sensibilities of its customer base and all ethnic groups.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/DiRaB_41/4438_41.htm &quot;ADL Welcomes Urban Outfitters' Decision to Discontinue Production of Offensive T-Shirt&quot;], ''[[Anti-Defamation League]]'', January 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL later expressed &quot;outrage and disgust&quot; at other incidents of insensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/DiRaB_41/4890_41.htm &quot;Urban Outfitters At It Again&quot;], ''[[Anti-Defamation League]]'', March 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The following year, in 2004 [[Jesus Dress Up]], a game created by artist [[Normal Bob Smith]], drew additional critical response.&lt;ref&gt;[[Washington Times]] March 22, 2004 http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/22/20040322-092410-2758r/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc10.com/news/2922892/detail.html &quot;âDress-Up Jesusâ Creator Reacts to NBC 10 Story&quot;, ''NBC 10 Philadelphia'']&lt;/ref&gt; The company allegedly received feedback from an estimated 250,000 emails.&lt;ref name=&quot;afa&quot;&gt;{{cite web

*In 2006, the retailer was criticized &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_5544.aspx Retailer under fire]&lt;/ref&gt; for offering sparkly handgun-shaped Christmas ornaments in its hometown of Philadelphia, a city that had seen over 1,700 shootings and over 300 gun-related murders for the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inquirer.philly.com/graphics/murders_map The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the murder of officer [[Charles Cassidy]], the company announced on November 15, 2007 that it would no longer sell the gun-shaped ornament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.urbanoutfitters.com/blog/ornament_discontinued Urban Outfitters: Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007, complaints by Jewish groups over the company sales of [[keffiyeh]]s (which had been marketed as &quot;antiwar&quot; scarves)&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;Kim, Kibum. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/fashion/shows/11KAFFIYEH.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin &quot;Where Some See Fashion, Others See Politics&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; led Urban Outfitters to stop carrying that item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i6lnLT-Q_hjUApWo_h9v_fWuVTYg &quot;Iconic Palestinian headdress brings colourful clash to Beirut&quot;], ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'', December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Urban Outfitters issued a statement, &quot;Due to the sensitive nature of this item, we will no longer offer it for sale. We apologize if we offended anyone, this was by no means our intention.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;
*In May 2008, after concern in the Jewish community, Urban Outfitters discontinued a T-shirt that featured a Palestinian child holding an [[AK-47]] over the word &quot;Victimized&quot;. According to a company representative, &quot;[W]e do not buy items to provoke controversy or to intentionally offend. We have pulled this item in all of our locations and will no longer be selling it online either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ramer, Alison Avigayil.

* In May of 2010 [[The Village Voice]] published an article comparing various local Brooklyn artists merchandise to products sold later by Urban Outfitters, claiming they have been stealing people's work and designs. &lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/05/are_brooklyn_fa.php &quot;Are Brooklyn Fashion Designers Being Ripped Off By Urban Outfitters?&quot;], May 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2011 Stephanie &quot;Stevie&quot; Koerner, a designer who owns an online store on [[Etsy]], claimed that Urban Outfitters' &quot;I Heart Destination&quot; necklaces were stolen from her &quot;United World Of Love&quot;, which both featured metal chain necklaces of various states with heart shaped holes punched in. &lt;ref&gt; [http://imakeshinythings.tumblr.com/post/5855716317/not-cool-urban-outfitters-not-cool &quot;Not Cool Urban Outfitters, Not Cool.&quot;], May 25, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; Blogger [[April Winchell]] investigated and discovered that the necklaces featured a common design which a number of other artists, both on and outside of Etsy, had been selling for at least a year prior to Koerner's first sale. Additionally, Winchell drew attention to a commenter's discovery of another instance in which Koerner had claimed credit for a design that was not originally hers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regretsy.com/2011/05/27/urban-outrage/ &quot;Urban Outrage&quot;], ''Regretsy'', May 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Urban Outfitters removed the product from their online store. &lt;ref&gt; [http://consumerist.com/2011/05/urban-outfitters-jewelry-identical-to-independent-designers-line.html &quot;Urban Outfitters Offers Jewelry Identical To Independent Designer's Line&quot;], ''Consumerist'', May 26, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, the [[Navajo Nation]] sent a a cease-and-desist letter to Urban Outfitters, demanding that the company stop using the term &quot;Navajo&quot; for a line of products that include underwear and a liquor flask. The tribe holds at least 10 trademarks on their name and alleges the company of trademark violation and criticism of the product. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_zgXn2sMCpDcYDrClXVrO_CH52w?docId=15566e2aa2f14ff993f4941161805744 &quot;Navajo calls out Urban Outfitters for its products&quot;], ''Associated Press'', October 18, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2011, Urban Outfitters removed the word &quot;Navajo&quot; from product names on its website. &lt;ref&gt; [http://news.yahoo.com/urban-outfitters-pulls-navajo-name-website-191915314.html &quot;Urban Outfitters pulls 'Navajo' name from website&quot;], ''Associated Press'', October 19, 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor issues==
On November 27, 2009, the firm drew the attention of the Swedish press for denying collective bargaining rights to employees at their [[Stockholm]] store by making all 48 workers [[redundant]] and re-hiring them through [[employment agency]] Academic Work.&lt;ref name=&quot;aftonbladet&quot;&gt;{{cite web
