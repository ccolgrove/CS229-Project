==Storylines==
[[File:Joe viki 1974.png|thumb|left|Joe and [[Victoria Lord|Viki]] ([[Erika Slezak]]) remarry, 1974]]
In 1968, reporter Joe Riley clashed with icy heiress [[Victoria Lord|Viki Lord]], who had little interest in romance and focused her time and energy on her work at ''The Banner''.  They soon started falling in love, but publisher [[Victor Lord]] disapproved of his daughter becoming involved with the working-class Riley and did all he could to keep them apart. Torn between pleasing her father and following her heart, Viki began getting headaches &amp;mdash; and mysterious, threatening notes telling her to end her relationship with Joe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1968-69/1968.html  |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1968) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033131/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1968-69/1968.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretly plagued by [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], Viki (as alter ego Niki Smith) became involved with Joe's best friend, [[Vinny Wolek|Vincent &quot;Vinny&quot; Wolek]]. In love with Niki, a heartbroken Vinny learned the truth and told Viki about her other personality. Viki sought medical treatment and, as her mental illness seemed under control, she went ahead with her plans to marry Joe. But during the wedding in June 1969, Niki reemerged and fled the ceremony with an ecstatic Vinny. When he urged Niki to marry him, however, Niki's own panic resulted in Viki regaining control. She returned to Joe. During more intensive therapy, Viki remembered writing the notes (as Niki), and finally recalled the childhood memory that had apparently caused her personality to splinter. Now freed by the truth, Viki married Joe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1969-70/1969.html  |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1969) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033246/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1969-70/1969.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Joe began investigating Llanview's increasing drug trade for ''The Banner''. While making inquiries in [[California]], Joe's car went over a cliff; his body was never found, but he was presumed dead. Viki was devastated. She signed papers declaring Joe dead in 1972, which shocked Vinny Wolek and Joe's sister '''[[Eileen Riley Siegel|Eileen]]''', both of whom had refused to give up the hope that Joe was alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1970-71/1970.html  |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1970) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033211/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1970-71/1970.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1972-73/1972.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1972) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033127/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1972-73/1972.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Riley reappeared in 1972, after Viki declared Joe [[legal death|legally dead]] and was marrying another man, new ''Banner'' editor [[Steve Burke (One Life to Live)|Steve Burke]]. As she and Steve returned from their honeymoon, she got the news that Joe was alive, and fainted. In love with (and married to) two different men, Viki eventually chose to remain loyal to Steve in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1973-74/1973.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1973) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033118/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1973-74/1973.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heartbroken and still in love with Viki, Joe took up with [[Cathy Craig Lord|Cathy Craig]], who bears him a daughter. The daughter dies in infancy due to a [[car crash]] involving Viki, the latter who falls into a brief [[coma]]. Joe and Viki remarry in 1974, remaining married through 1979, bearing two children ([[Kevin Buchanan|Kevin]] and [[Joey Buchanan|Joe, Jr.]]) when he dies of [[brain tumor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1974-75/1974.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1974) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033203/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1974-75/1974.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1979-80/1979.html |title=''One Life to Live'' recap (1979) |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |accessdate=October 30, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080423033208/http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/1979-80/1979.html |archivedate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
