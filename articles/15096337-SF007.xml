'''''OpenCity''''' is a free [[open source]] 3D [[city-building game]]. The entire game is written in standard [[C++]] with [[OpenGL]] and [[SDL]] from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencity.info/ OpenCity, another free 3D city simulator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game, the player builds a city by marking land as commercial, industrial or residential zones. Those zones depend on each other to grow. The player is also required to supply the city with power and connect the different zones by building roads.

==Origins and development==

'''''OpenCity''''' is the product of programmer Duong-Khang Nguyen and 3D artist FrÃ©dÃ©ric Rodrigo, along with contributions such as translation and quality testing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencity.info/en/Credits.html OpenCity website&lt;/ref&gt; Nguyen was inspired by the open source game FreeReign; when he realized that the FreeReign project was abandoned and the code was not in the condition to be improved, he began development on his own city-building simulator.&lt;ref&gt;http://linux.softpedia.com/get/GAMES-ENTERTAINMENT/Simulation/Open-City-10890.shtml Softpedia&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is improved continuously and is available on multiple platforms. OpenCity binary packages are available for [[Mandriva]], [[Debian]], [[Arch Linux]], [[Suse]], [[Slackware]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Pardus]], [[Frugalware]] GNU/Linux distribution and [[Mac OS]]. It is also available on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as a setup file.
