As the number of German armed forces committed to the [[North Africa Campaign]] of [[World War II]] grew from the initial commitment of a small corps the Germans developed a more elaborate command structure and placed the now larger ''[[Afrika Korps]]'', with Italian units under this new German command structure, a succession of different German commands were created to manage the Axis assets in Africa:
*'''''Panzer'' Group Africa''', (''Panzergruppe Afrika'') August 1941-January 1942
*'''''Panzer'' Army Africa''', (''Panzerarmee Afrika'')  January-October 1942
*'''German-Italian ''Panzer'' Army''', (''Deutsch-Italienische Panzerarmee'') October 1942-February 1943
*'''Army Group Africa''', (''Heeresgruppe Afrika'') February-May 1943

==''Panzer'' Group Africa==
When the ''Afrika Korps'' was formed on 11 January 1941 it was officially subordinated to the Italian chain of command in Africa. In the middle of 1941 the German [[Wehrmacht|Armed Forces]] High Command (German acronym ''[[OKW]]'') created a larger command structure in Africa, forming a new headquarters called '''''Panzer'' Group Africa''' (''Panzergruppe Afrika''). On 15 August 1941, ''Panzer'' Group Africa was activated with newly promoted Lieutenant-General (''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'') [[Erwin Rommel]] in command. The ''Panzer'' Group controlled the ''Afrika Korps'' plus some additional units that were sent to Africa (notably the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Germany)|90th Light Infantry Division]]), as well as two Italian corps, X and XX.

==''Panzer'' Army Africa==
''Panzer'' Group Africa was redesignated as '''''Panzer'' Army Africa''' (''Panzerarmee Afrika'') on 30 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;A German Panzer group was an army-level headquarters. As the war progressed all of the Panzer groups were redesignated as Panzer armies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==German-Italian ''Panzer'' Army==
''Panzer'' Army Africa was redesignated as '''German-Italian ''Panzer'' Army''' (''Deutsch-Italienische Panzerarmee'') in October 1942 during the long retreat after the defeat at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] during the [[Western Desert Campaign]].

==Army Group Africa==
In February 1943, the headquarters was upgraded to '''Army Group Africa''' (''Heeresgruppe Afrika'') to manage the defense of [[Tunisia]] during the final stages of the [[North African Campaign]], its combat unitsâincluding the ''Afrika Korps''âwere turned over to the [[Italian First Army|Italian 1st Army]]. Command of the Army Group was turned over to [[Hans-JÃ¼rgen von Arnim]] in March. Army Group Africa included the [[German Fifth Panzer Army]] (''5. Panzerarmee'') in addition to the Italian 1st Army. von Arnim surrendered the Army Group on 13 May 1943, ending the Axis presence in Africa.

==Order of battle==
Throughout its existence, this headquarters controlled the well-known ''Afrika Korps'', and for most of its life it controlled a number of other German and Italian units as well.&lt;ref&gt;Notice that at no time were all the German units in Africa subordinate to the ''Afrika Korps''; some were reserves for the ''Panzer'' Army, and some were occasionally subordinated to Italian armies or corps.&lt;/ref&gt; The following overview of its assets is taken from lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de, with dates corrected (see references).
