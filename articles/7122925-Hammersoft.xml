'''Disney Junior''' is a British television channel owned by [[Disney-ABC Television Group]].

==History==
The channel launched on 29 September 2000 as '''Playhouse Disney''', on the same day as the now defunct sister channel, [[Toon Disney (UK &amp; Ireland)|Toon Disney]].

Presenters were added to the channel in September 2009. The presenters work on the channel between 6pm and 8pm.

The Playhouse Disney brand, which existed as 22 channels or blocks in 156 countries and territories, rebranded as [[Disney Junior]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/resources/detail.asp?area=79&amp;article=55780|title=Disney Junior to replace SoapNet, Playhouse|publisher=C21Media|date=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK and Ireland, Disney Junior began on 7 May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/news/a300723/disney-to-launch-new-disney-junior-brand.html|title=Disney to launch new Disney Junior brand|publisher=Digital Spy|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its first show as [[Handy Manny]]. At the same time the channel started broadcasting in widescreen format.

===Logos and Identity===
[[Image:Playhouse Disney.svg|right|thumb|150px|Playhouse Disney logo.]]
When Playhouse Disney UK was launched, it also has the same logostyle as Disney Channel UK, with 2D idents featuring lines and circles. The idents are also carried to Disney Channel UK.

Here is the list of the Playhouse Disney idents used in 2000:
* [[Balloon]]
* [[Car]]
* [[Space]]
* [[Yarn]]
* [[Squeeze]]
* [[Band]]
* [[Flute]]
* [[Nest]]

In September 2007, the channel logo in the external promotionals (programme press releases, promos for terrestrial TV) were changed to include the inscription &quot;Channel&quot; as in all Playhouse Disney Europe channels, but in the channel itself the logo was not changed. This move probably is to differentiate the channel from the US block ''Playhouse Disney'', all mornings on [[Disney Channel]] USA.

==Disney Junior +==
A one hour [[Timeshift channel|timeshift]] service of the channel named '''Disney Junior +''', launched on 30 October 2007 as '''Playhouse Disney +''', replacing the now defunct channel [[ABC1 (United Kingdom)|ABC1]]. It launched on the same day that the Disney Channels were reshuffled on Sky, involving Disney Cinemagic and Disney Cinemagic +1 moving down the EPG, to enable Playhouse Disney to move up the EPG to allow Playhouse Disney + to launch next to it on Sky 611 and 612 respectively. Playhouse Disney + was initially a 25 minute timeshift service until 11 April 2011 when it became a 1 hour timeshift service.

==Disney Channel Hour==
Disney Junior also airs as an hour-long block on [[Disney Channel (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney Channel]], Monday to Friday at {{nowrap|9:00 a.m.}}-{{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} It shows three programmes, usually ''[[Handy Manny]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh]]'' or ''[[Imagination Movers]]''.
