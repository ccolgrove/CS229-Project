'''Karl Anthony Malone''' (born July 24, 1963), nicknamed '''&quot;The Mailman&quot;''', is a retired [[United States|American]] professional basketball [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] who spent the majority of his career with the [[Utah Jazz]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985&amp;ndash;2003) with the Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate [[John Stockton]]. He played his final season ([[2003-04 NBA season|2003&amp;ndash;04]]) with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].

Malone grew up in rural [[Summerfield, Louisiana]] and played college basketball at [[Louisiana Tech University]]. In his three seasons with Louisiana Tech, he helped the [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball|Bulldogs basketball team]] to its first-ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] in 1984 and to first place in the [[Southland Conference]] in 1985. The Jazz drafted Malone in [[1985 NBA Draft|1985]] with the 13th overall pick in the first round.

Having scored 36,298 points in his career, the second [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|most career points in NBA history]], and holding the [[List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders|record for most free throws both attempted and made]], Malone is generally considered one of the greatest NBA power forwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; In 1997 and 1999, Malone won the [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] award.  Malone appeared in the playoffs every season in his career, including three [[NBA Finals]]: in [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]] with the Jazz and in [[2004 NBA Finals|2004]] with the Lakers. Internationally, Malone competed with the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national team]] in the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic games of 1992]] and [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]]; in both years he won gold medals. After retiring from the NBA, Malone joined the staff of the Louisiana Tech basketball team in 2007 and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2010.

==Early life and college==
Born in [[Summerfield, Louisiana]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Malone|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/973113/Karl-Malone|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=July 3, 2011|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malone was the youngest boy of nine children and during his childhood lived in a farm with his single mother Shirley. His father Shedrick Hay was raising a family with another woman he married and committed suicide when Karl Malone was 14; Malone first disclosed that suicide in 1994. As a child, Malone often worked at the farm and chopped trees, hunted, and fished. He attended the local Summerfield high School and led its basketball team to three consecutive Louisiana Class C titles from 1979 to his senior season in 1981. Although recruited by [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|University of Arkansas basketball]] coach [[Eddie Sutton]], Malone enrolled at [[Louisiana Tech University]], which was closer to home. He joined the [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball]] team in his second year because his grades were too low for freshman eligibility; Malone played under coach [[Andy Russo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Classic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Bob|title=The Mailman always delivered|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=Malone_Karl|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 3, 2011|date=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second season with Louisiana Tech (1983-1984), Malone averaged 18.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Classic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;basketball-reference&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Malone|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/malonka01.html|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louisiana Tech would finish the 1984-1985 season 29-3, at the top of the [[Southland Conference]], and advance to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history; the team finished at the [[1985_NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament#Midwest_region|Sweet 16 round]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1984-85 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs Statistics|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/schools/LOUT/1985.html|publisher=Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of his three seasons with the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, Malone was an All-Southland selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Classic&quot;/&gt;

== NBA career ==
===Early years (1985-1987)===
In the [[1985 NBA Draft]], the [[Utah Jazz]] chose Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick. According to Malone's official NBA biography: &quot;If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Malone bio|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/karl_malone/bio.html|publisher=NBA|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050707003526/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/karl_malone/bio.html|archivedate=July 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under head coach [[Frank Layden]], Malone averaged 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds in his first season and made the 1986 [[NBA All-Rookie Team]] after coming in third for [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; On January 14, 1986, the Jazz beat the [[Houston Rockets]] 105-102 to snap the Rockets' 20-game winning streak. Malone scored 29 points that game, including four free throws followed by a three-pointer by [[Pace Mannion]] to rally from a 96-89 deficit with 5 minutes and 36 seconds remaining to a 96-96 tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rocket Streak Stopped at 20|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/15/sports/rocket-streak-stopped-at-20.html|accessdate=July 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 15, 1986|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the third consecutive season, the Jazz made the postseason but lost the first round of the [[1986 NBA Playoffs|1986 playoffs]] to the [[Dallas Mavericks]]. In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9). After his second season, Malone became the Jazz' leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt;

===All-Star, a new coach, and team offense leader (1987-1996)===
By the [[1987-88 NBA season|1987â88 season]], Malone was the foundation of the offense and [[John Stockton]] was the floor general. Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season. This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; In the [[1988 NBA All-Star Game]], Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 1988&quot;/&gt; The Jazz finished 47â35, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1987-88 Utah Jazz Roster and Statistics|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/1988.html|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next round, the defending champions [[Los Angeles Lakers]], led by perennial All-Stars [[Magic Johnson]], [[James Worthy]], and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], defeated the Jazz in seven games. In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and made 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109-98 and would eventually win the [[1988 NBA Finals]]. In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; 

Malone signed a 10-year contract during the 1988 offseason worth $18 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 1988&quot;/&gt; In December 1988, [[Jerry Sloan]] succeeded Layden as head coach as Layden became team president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kragthorpe|first=Kurt|title=Layden quits as Jazz coach; Sloan steps in|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/26734/LAYDEN-QUITS-AS-JAZZ-COACH-SLOAN-STEPS-IN.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=December 9, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone averaged 29.1 points in {{nbay|1988}}, good for second in the NBA behind [[Michael Jordan]], and 10.7 rebounds, which was fifth in the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1988-89 NBA Season Summary: League Leaders|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1989.html|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scoring average was Malone's highest so far in his career. At the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, Malone finished with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists en route to his first All-Star MVP. The Jazz finished 51â31, but were swept in three games in the first round by the [[Golden State Warriors]]. This season marked Malone's first with the [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA First Team]] honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; 

Malone, in {{nbay|1989}}, increased his scoring to 31 points and his rebounding to 11.1 a game and again was selected to the All-NBA First Team and would continue to be selected every year until 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; On January 27, 1990, Malone scored a career-high 61 points in a 144-96 victory against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kragthorpe|first=Kurt|title=Malone score 61 - says he'll play in All-Star Game|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/print/83967/MALONE-SCORES-61---SAYS-HELL-PLAY-IN-ALL-STAR-GAME.html|accessdate=July 7, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=January 28, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 21 of 26 [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]]s and 19 of 23 free throws.&lt;ref name=&quot;SLT Hall&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Luhm|first=Steve|title=Malone worked his way into the Hall of Fame|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/jazz/50099788-87/malone-utah-jazz-points.html.csp|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=August 23, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zzhCng7o|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most points scored by a Jazz player since the team moved to Utah from New Orleans. Although Malone was voted to the NBA All-Star Game for the third consecutive season, because of an ankle injury he sat out the game. He led the team in scoring in 24 of the last 26 games of the season; on March 29, 1990 against the [[Golden State Warriors]], Malone scored 49 points, and on April 12 against the Lakers he scored 45. The Jazz, finishing the season 55-27, lost to the [[Phoenix Suns]] within five games in the first round of the [[1990 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], in which Malone averaged 25.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. For the second straight season, Malone finished second in the league in points per game behind Michael Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; 

From January 19 to March 4, 1991, Malone led the Jazz in scoring for 19 straight games; after starting the {{nbay|1990}} season 7-8 the team went 21-9 in January and February 1991. Malone scored 16 points and took 11 rebounds in the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game]], his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance for the West, and averaged 29.0 points and 11.8 rebounds each regular season game. He was among four Jazz players with double-figure scoring averages, the others being the newly acquired [[Jeff Malone]] (no relation) as well as John Stockton and [[Thurl Bailey]]. In four games, the Jazz eliminated the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the first round of the [[1991 NBA Playoffs|1991 playoffs]] but lost to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in the second round. Malone made the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive season.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt;

As he had done in 1989-90, Malone finished the 1991-92 season second in the league in scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the [[1992 NBA Playoffs]], the team made the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Utah index&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Utah Jazz Franchise Index|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/|publisher=basketball-reference.com|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone scored 40 or more points in five games this season.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a [[flagrant foul]]. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the [[Detroit Pistons]], Malone elbowed the Pistons' [[Isiah Thomas]] on the head. Thomas needed 40 stitches on his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspension for Malone|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/17/sports/sports-people-basketball-suspension-for-malone.html|accessdate=July 27, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 17, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz left the playoffs for the second straight season to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Malone averaged 29.1 points on 52.1% shooting and 11.9 rebounds in the 1992 playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt;

Through the 1990s, Malone continued to put up stellar numbers: in {{nbay|1992}}, he averaged 27.0 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds in {{nbay|1993}}, 26.7 points and 10.6 rebounds in {{nbay|1994}}, and 25.7 points and 9.8 rebounds in {{nbay|1995}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA playerfile&quot;/&gt; Following the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in which Malone helped the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|American national team]], dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, win a gold medal, Malone expressed opposition to [[Magic Johnson]], who had recently tested positive for [[HIV]] and retired from the NBA in 1991, making a comeback to the league. Malone's point of view digressed from the support for Johnson from his Olympic and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] teammates, and the NBA implemented [[AIDS]]-related precautions after Johnson's revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Araton|first=Harvey|title=Johnson's Return to League Isn't Welcomed by Some|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/sports/basketball-johnson-s-return-to-league-isn-t-welcomed-by-some.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=August 12, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 1993, in a game against the Lakers, Malone surpassed 16,000 points in his career. Malone and his Jazz teammate John Stockton shared the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP]] award in [[1993 NBA All-Star Game|1993]]. In the West's 135-132 overtime win, Malone scored 28 points and made 10 rebounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt;

Malone started all 82 games of 1993â94 and helped the Jazz make the Western Conference Finals for the second time in franchise history and his career. In his ninth season, Malone led the Jazz in scoring (25.2), rebounding (11.5), and blocked shots (126), made 49.7% of field goal attempts, and played 3,329 minutes, the second-most that season in the league behind [[Latrell Sprewell]]'s 3,533.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; On March 29, 1994, Malone made a career-high 23 rebounds, but the Jazz lost to the [[Golden State Warriors]] 116-113. However, Malone made only 8 of 29 field goals that night and commented post-game: &quot;My rebounds are not going to be tomorrow's headline...Tomorrow's headline is going to be all those easy shots I missed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Lee|title=This time Malone rips on Malone|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/344504/THIS-TIME-MALONE-RIPS-ON-MALONE.html|accessdate=August 12, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=March 30, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA champion]] [[Houston Rockets]] eliminated the Jazz from the Western Conference Finals in five games.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; Although Malone scored 32 points in the Jazz' 104-99 Game 2 loss, along with Stockton's 18, they and the Jazz were no match for the Rockets with high-scoring center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. Midway into the fourth quarter, Malone and Olajuwon scored in four consecutive possessions by their teams, leading up to a 93-93 tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhoden|first=William C.|title=Olajuwon A Problem Without A Solution|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/27/sports/pro-basketball-olajuwon-a-problem-without-a-solution.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=August 12, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 27, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the first time in team history, in 1994â95, the Utah Jazz won 60 games. In addition, the team won 15 consecutive away games (the best such streak by the team, then the second-best streak in the league). Malone's 26.7 points per game ranked fourth in the NBA, and Malone became the 19th NBA player to reach 20,000 career points on January 20, 1995. In the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]], the Jazz lost to the [[Houston Rockets]] for the second consecutive year, this time in the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA bio&quot;/&gt; The Rockets became [[1995 NBA Finals|NBA champions for the second straight season]].

On January 13, 1996, Malone renewed his contract with the Jazz.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBA playerfile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Malone|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/karl_malone/|publisher=NBA|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050707001704/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/karl_malone/|archivedate=July 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jazz only made it as far as the Western Conference Finals in this period, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers (1992), the [[Houston Rockets]] (1994) and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (1996).

===Western Conference championship years (1996-1998)===
Malone returned from a [[#Olympic career|gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics]] leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. During the 1996-97 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64â18 record, the most regular season wins in team history. Malone won his first [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] award, and the Jazz were the top team in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] and the playoff champions in that conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN Classic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1996-97 Utah Jazz Roster and Statistics|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/UTA/1997.html|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sweeping the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the [[Houston Rockets]], led by the aging trio of [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[Clyde Drexler]]. The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally got to the Finals in [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], where they played the [[Michael Jordan|Jordan]]-led [[Chicago Bulls]]. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls took the first two games at the [[United Center]]. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game Two. However the Jazz won the next two games at the [[Delta Center]] behind Malone's 37 points in Game 3 and 23 in Game 4, including a game-winning fastbreak lay-up off a spectacular assist by Stockton in the last minute. The Bulls took the next two games and the series, with Malone struggling from the foul line in the pivotal Game 6.

The next season saw the Jazz once again dominate. Malone put up 27 points per game and just missed out on his second MVP award, losing to Jordan. Nevertheless, the Jazz posted a 62â20 record, which was the best in the NBA. The Jazz once again were seated at the top of the Western Conference, and in the 1998 playoffs they defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Lakers (via a sweep) en route to their second consecutive [[1998 NBA Finals|Finals]] appearance. The rematch with the Chicago Bulls would start differently, as Malone put up 21 points and the Jazz won Game 1, 88â85. Malone found himself unable to put up consistently high numbers, due in large part to the swarming defense of defenders [[Dennis Rodman]] and [[Scottie Pippen]]. In Game 5 of the 1998 Finals, Malone led the Jazz in scoring with 39 points, and the Jazz beat the Bulls 83-81 in Chicago. Malone scored his 39 points on 17-for-27 shooting and also made nine rebounds, five assists, and one turnover. Many of his shots were &quot;mid-range turnaround jumpers from the left side.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 game 5 ESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollinger|first=John|title=Best single-game performances: No. 5|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2010/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&amp;page=BestFinalsGame-Individual-5|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=July 3, 2011|date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals|sixth game]] of the Finals was held at the Jazz' home court, the Delta Center at Salt Lake City, and by trailing the series 3-2 the team was one loss away from losing the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Selena|title=THE N.B.A. FINALS; Defeat Deferred, but Jazz Isn't Smiling Yet|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/sports/the-nba-finals-defeat-deferred-but-jazz-isn-t-smiling-yet.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone scored 31 points and made 11 rebounds. Although the Jazz held leads of 49-45 by halftime and 66-61 after the third quarter, the team squandered their lead in the fourth and would lose after Malone lost a pass in the [[Basketball_court#Low_post_area|post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wise|first=Mike|title=THE N.B.A. FINALS; A Steal, a Shot and One More Crown|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/sports/the-nba-finals-a-steal-a-shot-and-one-more-crown.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 3, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 18.9 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Jazz leading 86-85, Bulls guard/forward [[Michael Jordan]] stole the ball just passed to Malone and with 5.2 seconds left made a jump shot that gave the Bulls an 87-86 lead. [[John Stockton]] missed a potential game-winning jump shot. Jordan's shot has been dubbed as the &quot;greatest feat&quot; in his career, and the Bulls' 1998 title was their third consecutive championship and sixth since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roberts|first=Selena|title=THE N.B.A. FINALS; Pippen's Pain Pushes Jordan to Greatest Feat|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/sports/the-nba-finals-pippen-s-pain-pushes-jordan-to-greatest-feat.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 3, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 15, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later seasons with Jazz (1998-2003)===
In the lockout-shortened 1999 season, Malone won his second MVP award and the Jazz went 37â13. They lost in the second round to the Trail Blazers, and for the next several years the Jazz fell out of title contention. The Jazz won Game 5 of the second-round [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]] round against the Blazers 88-71 to force a sixth game, and Malone scored 23 points. In that game, Malone elbowed the Blazers' [[Brian Grant]], something he also did in Game 1 and for which he was fined $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blazers lose their cool|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1999/playoffs/western/news/1999/05/25/blazers_jazz_game5/|work=CNN.com|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=August 12, 2011|date=May 25, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the decline of his team and his advancing age, Malone averaged 25.5, 23.2, 22.4, and 20.6 points per game in his last four seasons with Utah. In the 2002â2003 season, Malone passed [[Wilt Chamberlain]] for second on the all-time scoring list with 36,374 points. He became a free agent in 2003, after which Stockton had retired. For the time Malone and reserve [[point guard]] [[John Stockton]] played together on the Jazz (1984-2003), the two formed one of the most productive guardâforward combinations in NBA history. Playing coach [[Jerry Sloan]]'s scrappy and tough style and perfecting the [[pick and roll]] to a maximum degree of efficiency, the Jazz regularly made the playoffs with a winning record. Malone led the Jazz to multiple 50-win seasons with the exception of [[1992-93 NBA season|1992&amp;ndash;93]] (47â35).

===Final season with Lakers (2003-2004)===
Malone played in the NBA for one more season, joining the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in an attempt to win a championship, the only major achievement absent in his career. His bid failed as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in the [[2004 NBA Finals]]. Malone sprained his right knee and played injured for four games in the Finals before missing Game Five, with the Lakers down 3â1 and the series almost over. The Jazz retired his number 32 jersey in his honor.

===Free agency and retirement (2004-2005)===
After his season with the Lakers, Malone became a [[free agent]]. He had knee surgery during the summer of 2004, and personal problems with Lakers guard [[Kobe Bryant]] prompted Malone not to return for another season with the team. The [[New York Knicks]] sought to sign Malone for 2004â05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Howard|title=Fairy Tale or Not, Knicks Call Malone|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/10/sports/basketball/10knicks.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early February 2005, prior to the [[2005 NBA All-Star Game]], Malone's agent speculated that Malone would sign with the [[San Antonio Spurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If Malone Returns, It Could Be With Spurs|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/08/sports/basketball/08nba.html|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 8, 2005|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference on February 13, 2005 at the Delta Center, the arena of the Utah Jazz, Malone officially announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malone: 'You will not see me play again'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1990848|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=ESPN.com|date=February 14, 2005|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Malone and Stockton were both cut from the amateurs-only [[United States men's national basketball team]] but joined the team in 1992, when national basketball teams welcomed professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genessy|first=Jody|title=Utah Jazz: For Karl Malone, John Stockton, Dream Team erased memories|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700056824/Utah-Jazz-For-Karl-Malone-John-Stockton-Dream-Team-erased-memories.html|accessdate=July 6, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Oregon National Guard]] made Malone an honorary member after the U.S. national team beat the [[Venezuela national basketball team|Venezuelan team]] 127-80 in the gold-medal game of the 1992 Olympic qualifier tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malone Is Now a Forward in the Guard|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/07/sports/sports-people-basketball-malone-is-now-a-forward-in-the-guard.html|accessdate=July 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 7, 1992|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Malone played in the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics]] and won gold medals with the US team both years. In the 1996 Olympics, Malone averaged 8.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game and made 56.9% of two-point field goal attempts and 52.9% of free throw attempts.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIBA 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Olympic Games: Tournament for Men: 11 - Karl Malone|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/player/p/pid/25172/sid/2944/tid/379/_/1996_Olympic_Games_Tournament_for_Men/index.html|publisher=FIBA|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-NBA career==
[[File:Karl Malone visits Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Malone visits U.S. base in Afghanistan.]]
The Utah Jazz retired Malone's jersey number 32 on March 23, 2006, when the Jazz hosted the [[Washington Wizards]].  He was also honored with the unveiling of a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze statue]] outside the [[EnergySolutions Arena]] next to teammate [[John Stockton]], and the renaming of a portion of 100 South in [[Salt Lake City]] in his honor.  The location where the statues stand is now the intersection of Stockton and Malone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jazz Retired Malone's No. 32|url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=180647|newspaper=KSL.com|date=March 23, 2006|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 31, 2007, Malone became director of basketball promotion and assistant strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater [[Louisiana Tech University]] and donated $350,000 to the university athletic department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malone joins Louisiana Tech hoop program, donates|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2888007|work=ESPN.com|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=June 20, 2011|date=May 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Player profile==
Malone is regarded as one of the best power forwards in the history of the NBA and was known as &quot;The Mailman&quot; for his scoring skills, speed, and consistent delivery.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 1988&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldaper|first=Sam|title=Malone Becomes A Major Force|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/15/sports/malone-becomes-a-major-force.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=July 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 15, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected two regular-season MVP Awards, eleven NBA First Team nominations and was also selected to the NBA All-Defensive Team three times.

Malone led the NBA in free throws made a league-record seven times. He was a physical defender and rebounder, and one of the most durable players ever in the NBA, missing a total of only five regular season games in his first 13 years in the league.  He maintained a high level of play even at age 40, becoming the oldest player to both log a [[triple-double]] and to be a starter on an NBA Finals-bound team. Malone's work ethic showed prominently in his formative years in the NBA where he raised his [[free throw]] shooting percentage from below 50% to 75%.

Malone wore number 32 for the Utah Jazz. He wore [[11 (number)|number 11]] for the Los Angeles Lakers (number 32 was retired honoring Magic Johnson, though Johnson himself offered to have it unretired for Malone to wear, an offer Malone refused) and also for the Dream Team (the players wore 4 to 15 to adhere to [[FIBA]] rules).

Over 1,476 NBA games (fourth all-time), and 1,471 starts (most all-time, never coming off the bench after his rookie season), Malone scored 36,928 points (25.0 per game), second-best all-time, on .516 shooting. His high [[field goal percentage]] benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton. Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all time for two players on the same team, and missed just eight games out of a possible 1,442 games during his time with the Jazz (3 because of suspension).

== Notable games ==
{{Section-diffuse|date=July 2011}}
* Malone posted his first career triple-double with 27 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 2, 1996.
* On May 11, 1997, in a playoff game against the Lakers, Malone made 18 of 18 free throws, breaking the NBA record for most free throw attempts without a miss in a single playoff game.  He finished with 42 points.
* Malone scored 50 points and added 12 rebounds in a playoff game against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] on April 22, 2000.  The 50 points set a Jazz franchise playoff record, and at 36 years of age, he became the oldest player to score 50 points or more in a playoff game.
* On November 30, 2003, while playing with the Lakers, Malone became the oldest NBA player ever to post a triple-double (at age 40).  He totaled 10 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists in just 26 minutes against the [[San Antonio Spurs]].
* With his 30-point, 13-rebound performance April 25, 2004, at Houston, Malone became the oldest player in playoff history to score 30 points in a game and only the second player over age 40 to reach the 30-point mark in a postseason contest.  [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] was the first.

Malone and [[Dennis Rodman]] participated in a [[professional wrestling]] match in [[World Championship Wrestling]] at their &quot;[[Bash at the Beach]]&quot; event in July 1998. Malone, a wrestling fan, teamed with his personal friend, [[Diamond Dallas Page]], against the duo of Rodman and [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Malone-Rodman Wrestling Might Not Be Over in Finals |date=July 14, 1998 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/14/sports/sp-59937 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61FCa20RP |archivedate=Agust 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Let's get ready to rumble |date=June 17, 1998 |agency=Associated Press | publisher=CNN/SI |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/1998/06/17/malone_rodman/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61FColQZ8 |archivedate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a poorly-received match, the two power forwards exchanged &quot;rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines&quot; for 23 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Powell |first=John |title=Mailman doesn't deliver a win |date=July 13, 1998 |publisher=[[CANOE (website)|Canoe Inc]] |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jul13_bashbeach.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61FDFevYD |archivedate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Malone married the former Kay Kinsey, winner of the 1988 [[Miss Idaho USA]] pageant, on December 24, 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laker wives&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Boeck|first=Greg|title=L.A. wives' tales|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/2004-06-02-lakers-wives-cover_x.htm|accessdate=June 24, 2011|newspaper=USA Today|date=June 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have four children: daughter Kaddee (born November 8, 1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Struggling Jazz face Clips tonight|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/192766/STRUGGLING-JAZZ-FACE-CLIPS-TONIGHT.html|accessdate=June 24, 2011|newspaper=Deseret News|date=November 9, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter Kylee (born 1992), son Karl, Jr. (born 1995), and daughter Karlee (born 1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;Laker wives&quot;/&gt; Karl Jr. is a left tackle and nose guard on the football team of Cedar Creek High School in [[Ruston, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A chip off the ol' block -- sort of|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/football/news/story?id=6325226|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 24, 2011|date=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1998, the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s, which alleged that he was the father of three children by two women from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana: [[Demetrius Bell]] and twins Daryl and [[Cheryl Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malone Paternity Revealed|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-07-23/sports/25738724_1_karl-malone-cheryl-and-daryl-bonita-ford|accessdate=June 24, 2011|newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News|date=July 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malone was 17 when the Ford twins were born to Bonita Ford, who was approximately the same age. However, when 20-year-old Malone conceived Demetrius, Gloria Bell was only 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jemele|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=hill/080507|title=Karl Malone falls short, as a father|work=Page 2|publisher=ESPN|date=May 12, 2008|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the 1998 NBA Finals, Malone had met with the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born.&lt;ref name=&quot;meets twins&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Malone finally meets twins who call him `Dad'|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/638070/Malone-finally-meets-twins-who-call-him-Dad.html|newspaper=Deseret News|date=June 26, 1998|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and Malone's attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits prior to any conclusive establishment of paternity, and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children. 

The ''Tribune'' confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. However, the paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One of the items listed was a laboratory blood test which concluded with over 99 percent certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying that same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;Fantin, Linda. Spirit vs. Letter of Law in Malone Paternity Suits. ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', July 19, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tribune2&gt;Fantin, Linda.

But recently he made contact with twins; Children Claim Karl Malone Is Their Father. ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', July 19, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Tribune'', Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case regarding the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]]. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.&lt;ref name=Tribune /&gt; 

By the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone spoke publicly of the twins being members of the Malone family.&lt;ref name=Tribune3&gt;Siegel, Lee.

''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', November 8, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater of Louisiana Tech University. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the [[Detroit Shock]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]].

To date, Malone has made no public comment with regard to Bell, who is now an offensive lineman for the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[National Football League]]. In 2008, ''[[The Buffalo News]]'' reported that Bell's first and only meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him at that time that it was &quot;too late&quot; for them to have a father-son relationship.&lt;ref name=Buffalo&gt;Wilson, Allen.

===Politics===
Malone donated $4,000 to the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2004|2004 re-election campaign]] of President [[George W. Bush]] and $2,000 to the [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2004|2004 U.S. Senate campaign]] of [[Lisa Murkowski]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from Alaska. In 2002, Malone donated $1,000 to the [[United_States_House_elections,_2002#Utah|campaign]] of incumbent U.S. Representative [[Jim Matheson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Malone|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/sports_political_donations/Karl_Malone.php|publisher=Newsmeat|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malone appeared on the &quot;Great American Panel&quot; segment of the [[Fox News]] talk show ''[[Hannity]]'' in a March 2009 edition. He advocated support for farmers in Louisiana who were about to lose their jobs due to [[Pilgrim's Pride]] plants in the state closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Malone Supports Farmers, Do You?|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/hannity/blog/2009/03/12/karl-malone-supports-farmers-do-you|publisher=Fox News|date=March 12, 2009|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
