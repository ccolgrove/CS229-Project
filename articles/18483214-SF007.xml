A '''splash screen''' is an [[image]] that appears while a game or program is loading. It may also be used to describe an introduction page on a [[website]]. Splash screens sometimes do not cover the entire [[computer screen|screen]], but only a [[rectangle]] near the center. The splash screens of [[operating systems]] and some applications that expect to be run full-screen usually cover the entire screen.

== Purpose ==

Splash screens are typically used by particularly large applications to notify the user that the program is in the process of loading. In other words, they provide feedback that a lengthy process is underway. Occasionally, a progress bar within the splash screen indicates the loading progress. A splash screen disappears when the application's main window appears. 

Splash screens typically serve to enhance the [[look and feel]] of an application or [[web site]], and hence are often visually [[attractiveness|appealing]]. They may also have [[animation]]s, graphics and [[sound]].

The [[Java]] programming language has a specific function for creating splash screens called java.awt.SplashScreen &lt;ref name=&quot;java.awt.SplashScreen&quot;&gt;[http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/SplashScreen.html java.awt.SplashScreen] Java Platform Standard Ed. 6&lt;/ref&gt; that handles standard splash screen functions (i.e. display an image centered on screen then disappears when the first program window opens).

On the [[World Wide Web|Web]], a '''splash screen''' or '''splash page''' is a [[web page|page]] of a [[web site]] that is a kind of pre-[[home page]] front page. Designers may use splash pages:

* to direct users to the appropriate website for their [[country]] or [[language]] preference
* to direct users to a low-[[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] site or one more accessible to disabled users
* as an additional form of [[advertising]]
* to restrict access to content such as [[pornography]], [[alcohol]] advertising or sales, or [[gambling]]
* as an aesthetic complement to the main page

An early use of the Splash screen on a Flash Website was to enable the site developer to launch the site in a JavaScript-controlled new window, without browser elements such as scroll-bars, address bar, etc. and in the exact size of the Flash movie. This has gone out of style with the predominance of pop-up blockers. Instead many starting Flash Web pages now allow their audience to choose to go to full screen viewing.

Since splash screens often increase the wait for the desired content and may take a long time to load, they are not liked by all users. Web splash screens are especially inconvenient for users with slow [[internet connection]]s as the first page may take longer to load. Moreover, if the user has turned off rich content (such as images, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] or [[Adobe Shockwave|Shockwave]]), the splash page may not load at all. Splash pages created in [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] (and the associated main pages) often cannot be accessed by search engines or handled by text readers for the blind.

Splash screens can also be created in [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] if they are designed for a purpose other than as a loading screen and instead used for another purpose, such as giving the option to pick the language.
