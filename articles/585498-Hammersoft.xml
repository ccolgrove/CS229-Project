The '''rights of the accused''' is a &quot;class&quot; of [[civil and political rights]] that apply to a person accused of a [[crime]], from when he or she is [[arrest]]ed and [[criminal charge|charged]] to when he or she is either [[Conviction (law)|convicted]] or [[Acquittal|acquitted]]. Rights of the accused are generally based on the maxim of &quot;[[presumption of innocence|innocent until proven guilty]]&quot; and are [[due process]].
