'''Route 128''', also known as the '''Yankee Division Highway''' (for the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Infantry Division]]), and originally the '''Circumferential Highway''', is a partial [[beltway]] around [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The majority of the highway is built to [[freeway]] standards, and about 3/5 of it is part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. With the rapid growth of [[high-technology industry]] in the [[suburban]] areas along Route 128 from the 1960s to the 1980s, Route 128 came to symbolize the Boston high-tech community itself.  However, today the industry has expanded significantly onto [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] as well, the next beltway out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=246 &quot;MassMoments: Route 128 Opens Boston's High-Tech Age.&quot;]  Massachusetts Foundation for the Humanities.  Accessed 05-18-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
In local culture, Route 128 is seen as something of a dividing line between the inner municipalities of Greater Boston and the more far-flung suburbs. The road's roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} radius, for example, also delimits most of the area accessible by the [[MBTA]] [[rapid transit]] system. Much of the area within Route 128 was developed before World War II, while the area outside it was developed more recently.

The south end of Route 128 is in [[Canton (MA)|Canton]], where [[Interstate 95 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 95]] heads south toward [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], just east of the [[Northeast Corridor]]'s [[Route 128 Station]]. Common usage, as well as signs until 1997, continues Route 128 east along the first 7 miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) of [[Interstate 93 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 93]] to the [[Braintree Split]] in [[Braintree (MA)|Braintree]], where I-93 turns north with [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] toward downtown Boston. This section of former Route 128 serves as the north end of [[Route 24 (Massachusetts)|Route 24]] to [[Fall River (MA)|Fall River]]. (Until 1965, Route 128 continued further, southeast along [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] and roughly north on [[Route 228 (Massachusetts)|Route 228]] to [[Hull (MA)|Hull]].)

From Canton, Route 128 and Interstate 95 heads northwest, north, northeast and east around the Boston area to [[Peabody (MA)|Peabody]], where I-95 splits to head north toward [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[New Hampshire]]. Along this section, Route 128 has major [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s with [[Interstate 90 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 90]] (the [[Mass Pike]]), [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]], [[U.S. Route 3 (Massachusetts)|U.S. Route 3]], and [[Interstate 93 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 93]]. On roads approaching Route 128 here, guide signs only list I-95; Route 128 shields are in a separate sign assembly. [[U.S. Route 1 (Massachusetts)|U.S. Route 1]] has also run along Route 128 near [[Dedham (MA)|Dedham]] since 1989, forming a three-way [[wrong-way concurrency]], with I-95 and Route 128 going one way and US 1 the other. (US 1 continues east on I-93 &amp;mdash; former Route 128 &amp;mdash; to Braintree, and turns north there with I-93 into Boston.)

After it splits from I-95 in Peabody, Route 128 continues east into [[Cape Ann]]. The [[freeway]] (termed a highway or expressway in Massachusetts) ends at a [[rotary (intersection)|rotary]] with [[Route 127 (Massachusetts)|Route 127]] in [[Gloucester (MA)|Gloucester]], and the last bit of Route 128 is a surface road that bypasses downtown Gloucester to the northeast. After crossing Route 127 again (Route 127 runs in a loop through Gloucester and [[Rockport (MA)|Rockport]]), Route 128 ends at [[Route 127A (Massachusetts)|Route 127A]] east of downtown Gloucester.

==Route description==
The route 128 number dates from the origin of the Massachusetts highway system in the 1920s. By the 1950s, it ran from Nantasket Beach in [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]] to [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]]. The first, {{convert|27|mi|km|adj=on}}, section of the current limited-access highway from [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] to Gloucester was opened in 1951. It was the first limited-access [[ring road|circumferential highway]] in the United States.&lt;!--Rosegrant, p107--&gt;

[[Image:128 south end.jpg|thumb|400px|Since 1997, the south end of Route 128 has been in [[Canton (MA)|Canton]], where [[Interstate 95 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 95]] south leaves the beltway and [[Interstate 93 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 93]] north begins. [[U.S. Route 1 (Massachusetts)|U.S. Route 1]] north continues straight.]]
Route 128 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] from [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] north to [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]] and, when I-95 continues north from Peabody toward [[New Hampshire]], east from Peabody to Gloucester. Until the early 1990s, it also ran concurrently with the present [[Interstate 93]] from Canton to Braintree. This stretch of Interstate 93, which is now also designated as part of U.S. Route 1, though no longer officially part of Route 128, is still often referred to as &quot;Route 128&quot; by locals. The I-95 and I-93 signage were added in the mid-1970s when plans to construct [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] through Boston, directly connecting the two I-95/Route 128 interchanges, were cancelled. An unused [[Cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], now removed, was the one leftover structure from this plan.

Until 1965, while and shortly after the [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] freeway to Cape Cod was fully finished, the section of current Route 3 between exits 15 and 20 was also designated as Route 128. The route's southern end was then truncated to its intersection with Route 3 in Braintree. The non-freeway section of Route 128 from Route 3 through [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] to Nantasket was redesignated Route 228. The [[MassHighway|Massachusetts Highway Department]] has tried twice, in 1997 and 2003, to truncate 128 even further, back to its intersection with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in Peabody, but local opposition has convinced them to back down. A reflection of these attempts are along every interchange, where the main signage on the intersecting route indicates the highway as I-95, while smaller signage to the sides also identifies the road as Route 128.

[[Image:128 north end.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The north end of Route 128 is at [[Route 127A (Massachusetts)|Route 127A]] in [[Gloucester (MA)|Gloucester]]. The sign pointing Route 127A south straight is incorrect; it is actually to the right, where the sign points &quot;ALT 127&quot;.]]
The area along the western part of Route 128 is home to a number of high-technology firms and corporations. This part of Route 128 has been dubbed &quot;America's Technology Highway&quot;, and through to the end of the 1980s, was second only to [[Silicon Valley]].

Route 128 makes more than a 180-degree arc around Boston, and clockwise is &quot;north&quot; even when the road heads slightly south of east when approaching the Atlantic Ocean. [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|Hackers]] in the area refer to this as going &quot;logical north&quot; on the route. Interstate 93, going north-and-south, intersects Route 128, which nominally goes north-and-south, at a right angle, about {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of Boston. A traveller going &quot;logical south&quot; on 128 (compass west) from the I-93 interchange will soon find himself driving due west, travelling logically south on 128 and I-95, and north on [[U.S. Route 3|US 3]] in a [[wrong-way concurrency]].

Like the I-95 signage mapping onto 128, the mapping of US 3 onto this stretch of 128 is due to US 3 as a separate limited access highway terminating in [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] on 128 instead of further south at [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] as originally envisioned. This abrupt termination requires the US 3 signage to continue along 128 for somewhat over a mile until it can interchange the old US 3 surface arterial. Moreover, when I-93 and Route 128 ran concurrently south of Boston, before the route was truncated to the I-95 interchange in Canton, they were signed in opposite directions, so it was possible to travel north on I-93 and south on Route 128 at the same time.

Much of Route 128 is now part of the Interstate system, being concurrent with I-95 (and formerly I-93). However, the vast majority of locals will refer to these stretches as 128; it is uncommon for a local to use the Interstate designation(s) in ordinary conversation or while giving directions.

[[Image:128 north approaching exit 10.jpg|thumb|150px|Exit 10 is signed heading northbound as the [[at-grade intersection]] with [[Route 127 (Massachusetts)|Route 127]].]]
The northernmost several exits along Route 128, past exit 12, are not [[grade separation|grade-separated]] [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s. Exit 10 is signed as the [[traffic signal|signalized]] intersection with [[Route 127 (Massachusetts)|Route 127]], and there are two [[rotaries (road)|rotaries]] between that and exit 12 (the Crafts Road interchange).

In the 1990s, the exit system was changed from concurrency along 128 to a system using the I-95 exits. The exits, which had gone from Gloucester to Braintree, were renumbered along I-95, from the [[Rhode Island]] state line to the border with [[New Hampshire]]. Exit 37 had been the interchange with I-93, which also had its exit numbered 37 at that interchange. Coincidentally, with the renumbering, exit 37 remained exit 37.

[[Route 128 Station]] is located along the highway in [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]], [[Massachusetts]] and is served by [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] line and [[MBTA]] [[commuter rail]].

==The high-tech region==
In 1955, ''Business Week'' ran an article titled &quot;New England Highway Upsets Old Way of Life&quot; and referred to Route 128 as &quot;the Magic Semicircle&quot;.&lt;!--Rosegrant p 108--&gt; By 1958, it needed to be widened from six to eight lanes, and business growth continued. In 1957, there were 99 companies employing 17,000 workers along 128; in 1965, 574; in 1973, 1,212. In the 1980s, the positive effects of this growth on the Massachusetts economy were dubbed the &quot;[[Massachusetts Miracle]]&quot;.

Major companies located in the broader Route 128 area included [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Data General]], [[Thermo Electron Corporation]], [[Analog Devices]], [[Computervision]], [[Microsoft]], [[GTE]], [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[BEA Systems]], [[EMC Corporation]], and [[Raytheon]].

Route 128 was assigned by 1927&lt;ref name=&quot;1927 map&quot;&gt;1927 Rand McNally Boston and vicinity map&lt;/ref&gt; along local roads, running from [[Route 138 (Massachusetts)|Route 138]] in [[Milton (MA)|Milton]] around the west side of Boston to [[Route 107 (Massachusetts)|Route 107]] (Essex Street or Bridge Street&lt;!--contemporary maps disagree, and some even end it at 114, which they show through Peabody center!--&gt;) in [[Salem (MA)|Salem]]. Its route was as follows:&lt;!--1933 map shows it clearly -- possibly changed somewhat before that though as new roads were built--&gt;

By 1928, it had been extended east to [[Quincy (MA)|Quincy]] from its south end along the following streets, ending at the intersection of [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] and [[Route 3A (southeastern Massachusetts)|Route 3A]] (now Route 3A and [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]):&lt;ref name=&quot;1928 map&quot;&gt;1928 map of numbered routes in Boston and vicinity, prepared by the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Works]] for the New England Affairs Bureau, Boston Chamber of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

The first section of the new '''Circumferential Highway''', in no way the [[freeway]] that it is now, was the piece from [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] in [[Wellesley (MA)|Wellesley]] around the south side of Boston to [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]) in [[Hingham (MA)|Hingham]]. Parts of this were built as new roads, but most of it was along existing roads that were improved to handle the traffic. In 1931, the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Works]] acquired a [[easement|right-of-way]] from [[Route 138 (Massachusetts)|Route 138]] in [[Canton (MA)|Canton]] through [[Westwood (MA)|Westwood]], [[Dedham (MA)|Dedham]] and [[Needham (MA)|Needham]] to Route 9 in Wellesley. This was mostly 80 feet (24 m) wide, only shrinking to 70 feet (21 m) in Needham, in the area of Great Plain Avenue and the [[Needham Line]]. Much of this was along new alignment, but about half &amp;mdash; mostly in Needham &amp;mdash; was along existing roads:
*Royall Street from west of Route 138 to east of Green Street (Canton)
*Green Lodge Street from Royall Street (now cut by Route 128) to [[Route 128 Station]] (Canton and Westwood)
*Greendale Avenue from Lyons Street and Common Street just south of the [[Charles River]] to Hunting Avenue (Dedham and Needham)
*Fremont Street north from Highland Avenue (Needham)
*Reservoir Street from Central Avenue to Route 9 (Needham and Wellesley)&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plans:

*Wellesley: [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Wellesley/Layouts/2857/ 2857] (December 22, 1931)&lt;/ref&gt;

From Route 138 in Canton east through the [[Blue Hills Reservation]] in Canton, [[Milton (MA)|Milton]], [[Quincy (MA)|Quincy]] and [[Braintree (MA)|Braintree]], [[Norfolk County (MA)|Norfolk County]] acquired a right-of-way in 1927&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Canton/Layouts/3960/3960.tif 3960]&lt;/ref&gt; and built the Blue Hill River Road. This tied into West Street in northwest Braintree, which itself had been taken over by the county in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/6741/6741-6.TIF 6741]&lt;/ref&gt;

West Street led to [[Route 37 (Massachusetts)|Route 37]], which ran southeast to Braintree center. This part of Route 37 had been taken over by the state in 1919 (to Braintree center)&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1823/ 1823] (June 24, 1919)&lt;/ref&gt; and 1917 (in Braintree center).&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plan [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/1765/ 1765] (September 4, 1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the new highway, from Route 37 east to [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]), through Braintree, [[Weymouth (MA)|Weymouth]] and [[Hingham (MA)|Hingham]], was taken over by the state in 1929. This was all along existing roads, except possibly the part of Park Avenue west of [[Route 18 (Massachusetts)|Route 18]] in Weymouth.&lt;ref&gt;[[MassHighway]] state highway layout plans:
*Hingham: [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Hingham/Layouts/2604/ 2604] (September 3, 1929)

*Braintree: [http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/LayoutsImages/Braintree/Layouts/2602/ 2602] (September 3, 1929)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--needs something about the state law, if it can be found--&gt;

By 1933,&lt;ref name=&quot;1933 map&quot;&gt;1933 General Drafting Boston and vicinity map&lt;/ref&gt; the whole Circumferential Highway had been completed, and, except for the piece from [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] in [[Wellesley (MA)|Wellesley]] south to Highland Avenue in [[Needham (MA)|Needham]], was designated as Route 128. Former Route 128 along Highland Avenue into Needham center was left unnumbered (as was the Circumferential Highway north of Highland Avenue), but the rest of former Route 128, from Needham center east to [[Quincy (MA)|Quincy]], became part of [[Route 135 (Massachusetts)|Route 135]]. Thus the full route of the Circumferential Highway, as it existed by 1933, is now the following roads:

At the same time as Route 128 was extended along the new Circumferential Highway, it was extended further into [[Hull (MA)|Hull]]. This alignment, not part of the Circumferential Highway, ran southeast on [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] (now [[Route 53 (Massachusetts)|Route 53]]) (Whiting Street) to the border of [[Hingham (MA)|Hingham]] and [[Norwell (MA)|Norwell]], where it turned north on present [[Route 228 (Massachusetts)|Route 228]] (Main Street) through Hingham and into [[Hull (MA)|Hull]]. The exact route through Hingham was Main Street, Short Street, Leavitt Street, East Street, and Hull Street. The end of the numbered route was at the south end of [[Nantasket Beach, Massachusetts|Nantasket Beach]], where Nantasket Avenue curves northwest to follow the shore of [[Massachusetts Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;1937 Massachusetts Department of Public Works map of Hull&lt;/ref&gt;

===Route 128/I-95/I-93 Add-A-Lane Project===
The $315 Million MassDOT Highway Division Project has started widening on the project to upgrade the existing {{convert|14.3|mi|km|adj=on}} six-lane section of highway to eight lanes from north of Route 9 in Wellesley to Route 24 in Randolph.  The project consists of adding a lane on the inside of each carriageway, complete with a 10-foot inside shoulder.  The existing 1950s bridges, 22 in total, will be replaced as well.  The project will be constructed in five phases over a twelve-year period.  Construction of Phase 1 began in 2004.  The first phase of the project consisted of replacing the existing three-lane Route 128 bridges over University Avenue/MBTA/Amtrak and the Neponset River with new four-lane bridges in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]].  The project also included construction of a new two-lane ramp from Route 128 to I-95.  The $33 million project was awarded to SPS New England of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]].

During the initial construction of Route 128, a provision had already been made for a fourth lane within the widely-spaced [[median]] along the 1.5 mile (2.5&amp;nbsp;km) length of Route 128 running from just north of the U.S. Route 1 interchange in Dedham, MA, north-westwards to the Route 109 interchange, and this will finally be used for the Add-A-Lane project.

Construction on Phase 1 was officially completed in October 2009.  Construction of Phase 2 of the project began in summer 2006.  This phase of the project consisted of the replacement of the Route 1 and Route 1A bridges over Route 128 in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]].  Construction of four sound barriers were also included.  Phase 2 of the project, as of June 2010, is 78% complete; final completion is projected for Spring 2011.

Construction on Phase 3 of the Route 128 widening project, begun in April 2009, widens Route 128 to 4 lanes in each direction from Route 24 to south of US 1. This phase of the project was expected to be completed by September 2011. Phase 4 of the Project, expected to begin in March 2011,  replaces 7 bridges and widens Route 128 to 4 lanes in each direction from Route 109 to south of Highland Avenue in Needham. This phase of the project is expected to be completed by June 2015 with an estimated cost of $88 Million, the most expensive contract so far.

==Route 128 Corridor Study==
The Boston area [[Metropolitan planning organization|MPO]] studied the Route 128/I-95 Corridor from approximately 2005â2010.  The study focused on the heavily congested section from I-90 (Newton) to US 3 (Burlington), and was completed in November 2010. As of 2010, the highway carried over 200,000 vehicles per day.  Some possible improvements to Route 128 include [[HOV]] or HOT Lanes, reconstruction of shoulders, [[ramp metering]], [[bus on shoulder]], and fiber optic traffic system improvements. More studies will need to be completed before projects will begin.

|After I-95 was moved to Route 128, new signs instead featured only that designation, with Route 128 marked only on separate sign assemblies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''The left signage is present on US-1 northbound at its junction with I-95 (Exits 15A-B) in Dedham.''&lt;br&gt;''The right signage is present on Walnut Street in Lynnfield, at the Exit 43 ramps to/from I-95.

|Other than on the [[Mass Pike]], the only overhead signs to include both I-95 and Route 128 are near their northern split in [[Peabody (MA)|Peabody]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;''All signage in both directions for the I-95/Route 128 split was replaced in 2009 with I-95 the sole designation south of the split (with ground signage for 128 present).  The right signage (at Exit 44 southbound) is the only remaining overhead on I-95 showing the Route 128 designation.

|The overhead sign on U.S. Route 1 north at the exit to Route 128 in [[Lynnfield (MA)|Lynnfield]], near the split in [[Peabody (MA)|Peabody]], originally indicated both directions of Route 128. (I-95 is only marked south because a more direct ramp to I-95 north exists straight ahead.) A standard sign assembly for Route 128 south was also installed.
|-
|[[Image:US 1 north at I-95 128.jpg|200px]]
|When the above sign was replaced in 2003 or 2004, Route 128 south was removed.

|Overhead signage on the ramp from US 1 north to Route 128 similarly only shows Route 128 north.

|Until 1997, Route 128's south end was at the [[Braintree Split]] in [[Braintree (MA)|Braintree]]. Several signs for [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] in that area still indicated that in 2001.

===Sign upgrade projects on Route 128===
As of 2010, the state is in the midst of a resigning program on Route 128 that replaces the 25-year-old Route 128 designation signs with new I-95 designation signs. Starting in 1998 and continuing through 2002, signs were replaced through a $1.1 million project between Reading and Lynnfield. Progress continued in 2005 and 2006 during a $2.2 million project which replaced the signs on from Peabody to Gloucester, and continued with a $1.4 million project in 2008 and 2009 that replaced signs in Peabody and the remaining ones in Lynnfield. A $2.9 million federal stimulus project is underway and expected to be completed in 2011, replacing traffic signs on Route 128 from I-93 in Woburn to US 3 in Burlington.

A project valued at $5.8 million is expected to begin in 2012 and will replace 13 miles of traffic signs on Route 128 from Routes 4/225 in Lexington to Route 9 in Wellesley. These signs are being replaced as part of the five-phase widening project from Route 9 to Route 24.

==Exit list==
This exit list covers all of Route 128 as it existed before 1997.  The stretch north of I-95, as well as the rest of the length before I-95 exit numbering was applied, has decreasing exit numbers travelling northbound (this is contrary to almost all highways in the US with numbered exits).  Additionally, the lowest exit number on the highway is Exit 10 (which is an at-grade intersection near the highway's northern end). Route 128 is also the only highway in the state to contain directional exit designations (N/S or E/W after the number, as opposed to the traditional A/B/C in Massachusetts).

Route 128 currently has 18 numbered interchanges, starting at 29 (southbound) and continuing downwards to 10 (former Exit 27, an at-grade intersection, was removed, and there is no Exit 11).
