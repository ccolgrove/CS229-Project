The '''Memphis Tigers football''' team represents the [[University of Memphis]] in [[college football]] at the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly Division I-A) level. The Tigers compete in [[Conference USA]]. They play home games at [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]].
Currently the Memphis Tigers are searching for a new head coach after firing Larry Porter after two seasons in which the tigers achieved little on the field which resulted in a dwindling fan base.
this was announced after a comprehensive loss to rival school Southern Miss. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/nov/27/university-memphis-reportedly-fires-football-coach/&lt;/ref&gt;
==Nickname==
When the University of Memphis first fielded a football team in the fall of 1912, no one had selected a nickname for the squad. Early references to the football team tabbed them only as the Blue and Gray Warriors of West Tennessee Normal School. After the final game of the 1914 season, there was a student parade. During this event, several Normal students shouted, &quot;We fight like Tigers.&quot; The nickname was born. More and more the nickname &quot;Tigers&quot; was used, particularly in campus publications. But it did not catch on with the newspapers downtown. They continued to use &quot;Normals&quot; or the &quot;Blue and Gray&quot; when referring to the University. In the late 1920s, student publications and downtown newspapers began referring to the football team as the &quot;Teachers&quot; or &quot;Tutors.&quot; The Tiger nickname would return, but not until 1939 was it finally adopted as the official nickname for the University of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gotigersgo.com/trads/mem-mascot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===School colors===
The University of Memphis' official school colors of Blue and Gray were selected in the early 1900s. The colors were chosen in an effort to show unity in a nation that was still recovering from the effects of the Civil War. The student body thought that by picking the colors of the North and the South, the school would show a togetherness among all students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gotigersgo.com/trads/school-colors.html&lt;/ref&gt;
