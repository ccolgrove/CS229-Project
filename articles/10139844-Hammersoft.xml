'''ABC Western Victoria''' (call sign: '''3WV''') is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station in the [[Wimmera]] region of [[Victoria, Australia]]. Its primary transmitter is located in [[Horsham, Victoria|Horsham]] which broadcasts on 594&amp;nbsp;kHz [[amplitude modulation|AM]]. The station is clearly receivable over most of western Victoria, well beyond the Wimmera. In the past, it was designed to serve this broader region.

==History==
3WV - both the station's callsign and former name - was conceived in the mid-1930s, and officially opened on 25 February 1937.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us - ABC Western Victoria |url=http://www.abc.net.au/westernvic/about.htm |accessdate=2008-01-22 |date=2005-08-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071216092046/http://www.abc.net.au/westernvic/about.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s second regional radio station; ABC Western Victoria was later joined by four other ABC radio stations in the Western part of Victoria.  3WV was intended as a back-up to Melbourne's [[3LO]] during [[World War II]]. Japanese bombs never struck Victoria, however 3WV did play a role broadcasting coded messages at times.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt;

The station's south-west coverage area split from ABC Western Victoria in 2004 to become [[ABC South West Victoria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt; The station's studios in Baillie Street were upgraded in 2006 to digital broadcasting facilities, making ABC Horsham one of the broadcaster's most advanced radio facilities in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt;
