==Early life==
Schwartz was born in 1976 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] to Steve and Honey Schwartz. His parents were both toy inventors at [[Hasbro]], working on the development of toys such as [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] and [[My Little Pony]], until they went on to start their own company.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;{{cite news |title=The man behind the OC |author=Hadley Freeman |date=2005-01-22 |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1394603,00.html |accessdate=2007-01-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=&quot;On the Scene&quot;: &quot;The O.C.&quot; |author=Michael Elkin |work=The Jewish Exponent |location=Philadelphia |url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ekLSK5MLIrG&amp;b=297399&amp;ct=412979 |accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz grew up on the East side of Providence, Rhode Island with a younger brother, Danny, and a younger sister, Katie.&lt;ref name=Wheeler&gt;{{cite news |title=People: O.C. creator to speak at Wheeler, his alma mater |author=Andy Smith |date=2005-06-10 |work=The Providence Journal |url=http://www.projo.com/extra/graduation/highschool/content/projo_20050610_schwartz.1bd26e5.html |accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Engelberg| first =Keren| title =Young Creator Spells Success âO.C.â |work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles| date=2003-10-31 | url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=11286 |accessdate=2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz always had ambitions of being a writer since early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charmed life: Young writerâs made it big with Fox hit |author=Curt Schleier |date=2004-03-19 |work=The Jewish News Weekly of Northern California |url=http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21864/edition_id/443/format/html/displaystory.html |accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Schwartz was seven years old, he won an essay-writing contest at [[Summer camp|sleep-away camp]] for a review of the recently released movie ''[[Gremlins]]''; the opening line was &quot;Spielberg has done it again&quot; and stood out amongst the pile of essays from the other kids.&lt;ref name=NYT_Posner&gt;{{cite news |title='The O.C.'

==Film school at USC==
In 1995, Schwartz realized his boyhood dream of attending [[film school]] to study screen and television writing at the [[University of Southern California]]. He became a member of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity, as well as president of the chapter, and got to see what it's like &quot;behind the [[Gated community|gated communities]] and big [[mansion]]s&quot; of Southern California which would later provide fodder for his pilot ''The O.C.''&lt;ref name=DailyTrojan&gt;{{cite web |title=Schwartz struts his stuff on 'O.C.' |author=Kim Holmes |date=2004-04-22 |publisher=Daily Trojan |url=http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/04/22/Lifestyle/Schwartz.Struts.His.Stuff.On.o.c-667916.shtml?norewrite200701071734&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytrojan.com |accessdate=2007-01-07}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive Interview: Josh Schwartz, Creator/Executive Producer of The OC| url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-oc/exclusive-interview-josh-scwar-2651.aspx |publisher=BuddyTV |date=2006-12-14 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an outsider, and met many kids from Newport Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The OC revealed |author=Libby Slate |year=2005 |publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |url=http://www.emmys.org/events/2005/theoc.php |accessdate=2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at USC, Schwartz tried out [[stand-up comedy]] at a talent show in front of five hundred people but was &quot;disabused of [the] notion very quickly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CharlieRose&quot;/&gt;

In his [[Student#Years|sophomore year]] he wrote an autobiographical screenplay about his senior year in high school called ''Providence'' as a homework assignment for school. He entered his screenplay into a contest for the prestigious Nicholson Award in Screenwriting, the highest honor awarded to undergraduates, and won. Unfortunately, the prize was quickly revoked; to be eligible he had to be in his junior year at the time. Schwartz says &quot;I dropped it in a box â I was a sophomore. And I got a call over the summer saying I'd won, and I'd won five thousand dollars. I was like, &quot;This is awesome!&quot; Then they called back, like, the next day and said you had to be a junior to enter and not a sophomore, so they were rescinding it. I was pretty pissed.&quot;&lt;ref name=FirstScreenplay&gt;{{cite web|title=Schwartz uses youth to his advantageâ¦A look behind The O.C.| author=Molly Shalgos |year=2004|month=May |publisher=Lumino Magazine |url=http://www.luminomagazine.com/2004.05/spotlight/ocpf.html |accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, with help from connections through his fraternity, he generated interest in Hollywood to buy his screenplay.&lt;ref name=HR_sale/&gt; In 1997, Sony's [[TriStar Pictures]] bought his first screenplay in a bidding war for a deal guaranteeing $550,000 and worth up to $1 million while he was still a [[Student#Years|junior]] in college. It was never made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Journey at WB; Foster exits 'Double' |author=Michael Fleming |date=1997-12-15 |publisher=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR111776851.html?categoryid=3&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz got an agent and subsequently wrote a TV pilot called ''Brookfield'' for [[Disney-ABC Television Group|ABC/Disney]] while he was still studying at USC. It was a boarding school drama about wealthy kids in New England and was his first TV pilot script; it sold only a few months after he had sold his first feature film script.&lt;ref name=NYT_Posner/&gt; ''Brookfield'' was produced starring Amy Smart and Eric Balfour but never aired.

==''The O.C.''==
{{main|The O.C.}}
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:The oc premiere poster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Promotional poster for ''The O.C.'' premiere.]] --&gt;
In 2003, Schwartz wrote a pilot called ''[[The O.C.]]'' for [[Warner Bros. Television|Warner Bros. TV]] and [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] which was produced with him as creator and executive producer. At 26 he was the youngest ever creator of a TV show, which did not sit well with Fox executives who sent a series of seasoned pros armed with conventional ideas about how to steer the show and a bitterness about sharing control with someone so young. That changed when Bob DeLaurentis signed on, a TV veteran who proved to be a nurturing presence on the show.&lt;ref name=NYT_Posner/&gt; Schwartz and Bob DeLaurentis collaborated on supervising and approving the editors' work on each episode in [[post-production]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theocshow.com/news/news_82.htm The OC Show - OC News Articles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The O.C.'' became an instant teen favorite when it debuted on the [[Fox Network]] in August 2003. The show popularized its setting, Orange County, and led to copycats like [[MTV]]'s reality show ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]'' and the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] documentary series ''[[The Real Housewives of Orange County]]''.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe1&gt;{{cite web|title=Once hot, 'O.C.' now struggles |author=Suzanne C.

''The O.C.'' was named &quot;Guilty Pleasure of the Year&quot; by [[VH1]]. In 2007, after 4 seasons ''The O.C.'' was canceled due to a significant ratings drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox bids farewell to 'The OC' |author=Michael Schneider |date=2007-01-03 |publisher=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956637.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz has stayed in touch with his alma maters: The Wheeler School and USC. In 2005, he endowed USC with its first television writing scholarship: The Josh Schwartz Scholarship. The scholarship is intended to be awarded annually to a student or students concentrating on writing for television and in need of financial assistance, who have completed a TV pilot script and first season synopsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The OC&quot; Creator Josh Schwartz Endows Inaugural Scholarship for Television Writing Students at USC School of Cinema-Television |url=http://cinema.usc.edu/summer/resources/newsDetail.cfm?news_id=197 |publisher=USC School of Cinematic Arts|accessdate=2007-01-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061204015341/http://cinema.usc.edu/summer/resources/newsDetail.cfm?news_id=197 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schwartz never graduated from USC he has since worked with many USC alumni.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyTrojan&quot;/&gt; In 2005 he gave a commencement speech to The Wheeler School.&lt;ref name=Wheeler/&gt;

Schwartz has worked on his share of stalled projects. In 2004, he worked as a [[script doctor]] on the [[J. J. Abrams]] ''Superman'' screenplay that Warner Bros. eventually tossed.&lt;ref name=Superman&gt;{{cite web |title=Supe's on with 'X' man: Singer flies with pic |author=Cathy Dunkley, Michael Fleming |date=2004-07-18 |publisher=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117907948.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Superman' back in orbit: Moritz, Adler in negotiations to produce |author=Michael Fleming, Cathy Dunkley |date=2004-06-16 |publisher=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117906596.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold a pilot to Fox called ''Alphabet City'', a drama about a New York tabloid but it was never produced.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;Horn, John (March 21, 2004). &quot;He's 'O.C.'s' fresh breeze: Infusing it with sly wit and detail, creator Josh Schwartz has raised the Fox drama above its prime-time soap trappings&quot;.

Retrieved on August 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on a drama for Fox called ''Athens'' described as an &quot;OC&quot; companion but it was never produced. According to the futon critic, ''Athens'' will explore the intertwined lives and loves of the fictional New England community of Athens, home to a prestigious university that acts as a dividing line between the rich outsiders who study and teach there, and the local townies who serve that population. Viewers will enter this world through the friendship of Jed Hall, a young English professor, and Ethan Frost, an 18-year-old freshman whose arrival changes the dynamics for everyone in Athens. Like Ryan and Seth on &quot;The O.C.,&quot; Jed and Ethan will become unlikely partners in an alliance that will forever change them and the people of this town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fox turning a triple play: Hit trio fields new timeslots |author=Josef Adalian, Michael Schneider |date=2004-05-18 |publisher=Variety |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117905236.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |accessdate=2007-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UGOInterview&gt;{{cite web |title=Josh Schwartz of The O.C.
