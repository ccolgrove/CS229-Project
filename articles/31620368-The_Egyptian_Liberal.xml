The '''Egyptian Communist Party''' ({{lang-ar|Ø§ÙØ­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ´ÙÙØ¹Ù Ø§ÙÙØµØ±Ù}}) (ECP) is a [[political party]] in [[Egypt]], formed in 1975 by a number of members of the [[Egyptian Communist Party (1958)|former Egyptian Communist Party]]. Under the regimes of [[President of Egypt|President]]s [[Anwar Sadat]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] the new Communist Party faced [[Political repression|state repression]] and was barred from running in elections. The party however continued to operate underground until the [[Egyptian Revolution 2011|overthrow of Mubarak]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://links.org.au/node/2227 | title=Communist Party of Egypt resumes open political activities | publisher=Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal | accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having ECP members allegedly killed and imprisoned under Mubarak, the party have since been involved in mobilizing workers in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cpa.org.au/guardian/2011/1488/01-in-solidarity.html | title=In solidarity with heroic struggle of the Egyptian people | publisher=Communist Party of Australia | date=9 February 2011 | accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
