'''Texas Tech University''', often referred to as '''Texas Tech''' or '''TTU''', is a [[public university|public]] research university in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].  Established on February 10, 1923, and originally known as Texas Technological College, it is the leading institution of the [[Texas Tech University System]] and has the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|seventh largest]] student body in the state of Texas. With {{convert|1839|acre|km2}}, it has the second largest contiguous campus in the United States and is the only school in Texas to house an undergraduate institution, [[law school]], and [[medical school]] at the same location. 

The university offers degrees in more than 150 courses of study through 13 colleges and hosts 60 research centers and institutes. Texas Tech University has awarded over 200,000 degrees since 1927, including over 40,000 graduate and professional degrees. The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] classifies Texas Tech as having &quot;high research activity&quot;. Research projects in the areas of [[epidemiology]], [[pulsed power]], [[grid computing]], [[nanophotonics]], and [[wind energy]] are among the most prominent at the university.  The [[Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance|Spanish Renaissance]]-themed campus, described by author [[James A. Michener|James Michener]] as &quot;the most beautiful west of the Mississippi until you get to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]&quot;, has been awarded the Grand Award for excellence in grounds-keeping, and has been noted for possessing a public art collection among the ten best in the United States.

The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders]] are charter members of the [[Big 12 Conference]] and compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] for all varsity sports. The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Red Raiders football team]] has made 34 bowl appearances, which is [[List of schools by Bowl appearances|17th most]] of any university. The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball|Red Raiders men's basketball team]] has made 14 appearances in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Tournament]]. [[Bob Knight]], the winningest coach in men's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Div. I basketball history, served as the team's head coach from 2001 to 2008. The [[Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball|Lady Raiders women's basketball team]] won the [[1993 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]] [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's national championship]].

=== Establishment ===
[[File:TTUadmin1925.jpg|left|thumb|[[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] (c. 1925)]]
The call to open a college in [[West Texas]] began shortly after the arrival of settlers in the area in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hensley|first=Doug|title=Landing Tech may have been biggest step in Lubbock's first 100 years|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=2008-08-03|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/080308/loc_312967413.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hub&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Legendary Lubbock: The Hub City of West Texas|publisher=Lubbock Chamber of Commerce|page=9|url=http://www.lubbockchamber.com/documents/AHistoryofLegendaryLubbock.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-08|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025082314/http://www.lubbockchamber.com/documents/AHistoryofLegendaryLubbock.pdf |archivedate = October 25, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]] to be located in [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mares|first=Lluvia|title=Abilene home to three distinguished colleges|work=[[Abilene Reporter-News]]|date=2006-01-27|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2006/Jan/27/abilene-home-to-three-distinguished-colleges/|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered that [[James E. Ferguson|Governor James E. Ferguson]] had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed in the state house and senate in 1921, [[Pat Morris Neff|Governor Pat Neff]] vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend that West Texas secede from the state.&lt;ref name=Grad&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech History|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://grad.ba.ttu.edu/GSC_Tech_Lubbock/GSC_Tech_and_Lubbock_History.asp|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the legislature decided that, rather than a branch campus, an entirely new university would better serve the needs of the region.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook of Texas Online: Texas Tech University|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct32.html|accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year a committee began searching for a site.&lt;ref name=Grad /&gt; When the members of the committee visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for the idea of hosting the institution.&lt;ref name=KCBD&gt;{{cite news|title=Texas Tech a Major Part of Hub City History|publisher=[[KCBD]]|date=2008-07-02|url=http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=8613752|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=John|title=Three universities power higher education in Lubbock|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/060505/lif_850412.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], [[Plainview, Texas|Plainview]], and [[Sweetwater, Texas|Sweetwater]].&lt;ref name=KCBD /&gt;

Construction of the college campus began on November 1, 1924.&lt;ref name=Hub /&gt; Ten days later, the cornerstone of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] was laid in front of a crowd of twenty thousand people. Governor Pat Neff, [[Amon G. Carter]], Reverend E. E. Robinson, Colonel [[Ernest O. Thompson]], and Representative R. M. Chitwood spoke at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Tech University Archives|publisher=Southwest Collection|url=http://www.swco.ttu.edu/University_Archive/uacollections10.html|accessdate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an enrollment of 914 studentsâboth men and womenâTexas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College of Arts and Sciences|publisher=[[Texas Tech University System]]|url=http://www.texastech.edu/giving/colleges%20&amp;%20schools/TTU/arts&amp;sciences.html|accessdate=2008-08-09|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070815184216/http://www.texastech.edu/giving/colleges%20&amp;%20schools/TTU/arts&amp;sciences.html |archivedate = August 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arenas|first=Jesus|title=Joining of communities led to Lubbock|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=2001-06-23|url=http://www.lifeinlubbock.com/stories/062401/gen_0624010007.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrick|first=Nolan|title=Texas Tech...

Texas Tech grew slowly in the early years. During the 1930s, [[Bradford Knapp]], the university's second president proceeded with an expansion program, which included new dormitories, the first library (now the mathematics building), a golf course, a swimming pool, paved streets and alleys, and landscaping. A proposed $80,000 allocation for a football stadium was shelved. The library won the approval of Governor [[James V. Allred]]. Because the state cut appropriations by 30&amp;nbsp;percent at the start of the [[Great Depression]], President Knapp applied for assistance from the major [[New Deal]] agencies to expand Texas Tech, including the [[Works Progress Administration]], [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), [[Civil Works Administration]], and the [[National Youth Administration]]. [[Wyatt C. Hedrick]], son-in-law of Governor [[Ross S. Sterling]], was the architect of all campus PWA projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Sarah|last=Barwinkel|contribution=Breaking Ground to Keeping from Breaking Down: How the New Deal Kept the Texas Tech Campus Moving Forward in the 1930s|series=[[West Texas Historical Association]] annual meeting|year=2010|place=[[Fort Worth, Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] training did not commence until 1936. By 1939, the school's enrollment had grown to 3,890. Though enrollment declined during [[World War II]], Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its [[armed forces]] training detachments.&lt;ref name=Handbook /&gt; Following the war, in 1946, the college saw its enrollment leap to 5,366 from a low of 1,696 in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raw Enrollment Data|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.irs.ttu.edu/ARCHIVE/ENR/FALLENRL.HTM|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and growth ===
[[File:TTUadmin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]]]]
By the 1960s, the school had expanded its offerings to more than just technical subjects.&lt;ref name=Controversy&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Robert|title=The Name Change Controversy|publisher=Southwest Collection|date=January - February 1990|url=http://www.swco.ttu.edu/University_Archive/pdf/1990.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty Advisory Committee suggested changing the name to &quot;Texas State University&quot;, feeling the phrase &quot;Technological College&quot; was insufficient to define the scope of the institution.&lt;ref name=Fighting&gt;{{cite news|last=Siegrist|first=Nikki|title=Tech Traditions: Fighting for Change|work=[[The Daily Toreador]]|date=2003-03-03|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2003/03/03/CampusNews/Tech-Traditionsfighting.For.Change-1276134.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most students supported this change, the Board of Directors and many alumni, wanting to preserve the [[Double T]], opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: History|publisher=Texas Tech Alumni Association|url=http://www.texastechalumni.org/olc/pub/TTAA/cpages/about_us/history.jsp|accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other namesâUniversity of the Southwest, Texas Technological College and State University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hensley|first=Doug|title=Triumph, tragedy in world's spotlight|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|url=http://www.lubbockcentennial.com/Section/1959_1983/3_Hensley.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Texas University of Art, Science and Technologyâwere considered,&lt;ref name=Game&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redraiders.com/techs75th/namechange.htm|title=Tech began playing name-change game in '50s|accessdate=2008-08-10|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|author=Elizabeth Langton |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020123163409/redraiders.com/techs75th/namechange.htm |archivedate=2002-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Board of Directors chose Texas Tech University, submitting it to the state legislature in 1964. A failed move by [[John Connally|Governor John Connally]] to have the school placed into the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]], as well as continued disagreement and heated debate regarding the school's new name, kept the name change from being approved.&lt;ref name=Controversy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fighting /&gt; In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. It finally received the legislature's approval on June 6 and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September.&lt;ref name=Game /&gt; All of the institution's schools, except Law, became colleges.&lt;ref name=Handbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information|publisher=Texas Tech University Office of Official Publications|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/officialpublications/facultyHB/general.php|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas Tech was [[Racial integration|integrated]] in 1961 when three [[African American|African-American]] students were admitted. After its initial rejection of the students' enrollment and the threat of a subsequent lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit &quot;all qualified applicants regardless of color&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shabazz|first=Amilcar|title=Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|year=2004|location=[[Greensboro, NC]]|page=205|isbn=9780807855058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student in 1967, when Danny Hardaway was recruited to play for the Red Raiders football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Sam|title=Hardaway relates Tech experience|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=1999-02-07|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/020799/0207990053.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Hortense W.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the university invested [[United States dollar|US$]]150 million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture. Some other buildings were significantly expanded.&lt;ref name=TTUS&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Texas Tech|publisher=[[Texas Tech University System]]|url=http://www.texastech.edu/welcome.php |accessdate=2008-08-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071220193335/http://www.texastech.edu/welcome.php |archivedate = 2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 29, 1969, the [[Sixty-first Texas Legislature|61st Texas Legislature]] created the Texas Tech University School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Tech University Archives: Medical School|url=http://www.swco.ttu.edu/University_Archive/uacollections3.html|publisher=Southwest Collection|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Texas Legislature expanded the medical school charter in 1979, creating the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]].

Chancellor Kent Hance reiterated plans for Texas Tech's main campus to reach enrollment of 40,000 students by 2020, with additional 5,000 students at [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]] and 10,000 students at [[Angelo State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Hance|first = Kent|title = Balancing state's budget requires all do fair share|newspaper = Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|page = A4|url = http://lubbockonline.com/columnists/2011-02-07/hance-balancing-states-budget-requires-all-do-fair-share|date = 2011-02-07|accessdate = 2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent history ===

In 1996, the [[Board of Regents of the Texas Tech University System|Board of Regents of Texas Tech University]] created the Texas Tech University System. Former [[Texas State Senate|State Senator]] John T.

Even though growth continued at Texas Tech, the university was not immune to controversy. In 2003, a third-year student at the [[Texas Tech University School of Law|Texas Tech School of Law]] filed suit against the university over its policy on [[free speech zone]]s, which restricted student speech to a single &quot;free speech gazebo&quot;.&lt;ref name=ADF&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Speech zones&quot; and &quot;speech code&quot; struck down at Texas Tech University|publisher=[[Alliance Defense Fund]]|url=http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=2809|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, a [[federal judge]] declared the policy [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref name=ADF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Delany|title=Law student sues Texas Tech over free speech zones: Plaintiff claims First Amendment rights were violated by university|work=[[The Daily Texan]]|date=2003-06-13|url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2003/06/13/News/Law-Student.Sues.Texas.Tech.Over.Free.Speech.Zones-494208.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-22}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hervey|first=Christine|title=A look at the Free Speech Zone: Zone offers a default location to express sometimes unpopular ideas|work=The Del Mar College Foghorn|date=2008-04-29|url=http://www.delmar.edu/foghorn/index.html|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mascots ===
[[The Masked Rider]] is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when &quot;ghost riders&quot; were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the [[Gator Bowl]]. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' who witnessed the event, later wrote, &quot;No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smits|first=Garry|title=Mascots unmasked: A lasting tradition for Texas Tech began at 1954 Gator Bowl|work=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|date=2007-12-26|url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122507/col_228878061.shtml|accessdate=2006-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ritz|first=Jennifer|title=History of Masked Rider: A history of one of Texas Tech's Oldest and Best-Loved Traditions|work=Texas Techsan Magazine|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/spiritsquads/MR_History.htm|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created by artist Grant Speed, is 25&amp;nbsp;percent larger than life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wolfe|first=Angel|title=Rider stands larger than life: A new statue dedicated to the history of the Masked Rider finds its home|date=2000-09-11|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2000/09/11/CampusNews/Rider.Stands.Larger.Than.Life-1270800.shtml|accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Masked Rider logo.png|left|thumb|The Masked Rider logo]]
Today the Masked Rider, with [[guns up]], leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive [[gaucho]] hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech. Christi Chadwell, a sophomore agricultural communications major from [[Garland, Texas|Garland]], will represent the university as the Masked Rider during 2010/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New mascots make first appearances|work=[[The Daily Toreador]]|date=2010-04-20|url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/la-vida/new-mascots-make-first-appearances-1.2231825|accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas Tech's other mascot, [[Raider Red]], is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the [[Texas Tech University traditions#Spirit organizations|Saddle Tramps]] student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist [[Dirk West]], a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gulick|first=Joe|title=Dirk West: Before the mustache, guns|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=2008-05-04|url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/050408/loc_275256359.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raider Red|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/raiderred.php|accessdate=2008-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders.

== Traditions ==
{{Main|Texas Tech University traditions}}

=== Carol of Lights ===
[[Image:TTUlights.jpg|thumb|left|Carol of Lights]]
The Carol of Lights is an annual event, sponsored by the Residence Halls Association, traditionally held the first Friday in December, to celebrate the holiday season at the university. The event begins with a Carillon concert, from the 43 bells located in the west tower of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]] followed a torch light processional by the [[Saddle Tramps]] and [[High Riders]] spirit organizations. The Texas Tech Trombone Choir and combined choirs lead the crowd in singing carols and the illumination ceremony culminates with a soloist performance of âO Holy Night,â in the Science Quadrangle. This is followed by the lighting ceremony, where thirteen buildings within the [[Texas Technological College Historic District]] are illuminated with the over 25,000 red, white, and orange lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/carol.php|title=Carol of Lights|publisher=Texas Tech University|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lights remain on the campus buildings until the first week when students come back from the holiday break.&lt;ref name=&quot;ttu 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.ttu.edu/2008/12/50-years-carol-of-lights/ |title=50 Years of Shining Bright |publisher=Texas Tech Today |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Texas Tech University Board of Directors member Harold Hinn planned and provided the funding to cover the Science Quadrangle and Administration Building with 5,000 lights. However, students were away on Christmas break and did not see the display. The following year, the Residence Hall Association sponsored the event under the name &quot;Christmas Sing&quot;. In 1961, the event was renamed Carol of Lights and the display increased to 16,000 lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://housing.ttu.edu/carol.php|title=Carol of Lights|publisher=Texas Tech University|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition has since grown to include decorations like the 38-foot lighted Christmas tree, 3,000 luminaries lining the sidewalks of Memorial Circle and a 21-foot fresh pine wreath hung on the Physics/Geosciences building.&lt;ref name=&quot;ttu 1&quot;/&gt;

=== Double T ===
{{Main|Double T}}
[[File:Texas Tech Red Raiders Logo.svg|150px|thumb|Double T]]
The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, [[E. Y. Freeland]], was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Double T Symbol|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/doublet.php|accessdate=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise but incorporates three-dimensional bevelling effects coupled with white trim.

To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. Per tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]]. The logo is further embodied in the Double T [[neon sign]], donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.&lt;ref name=Parent&gt;{{cite web|title=A Review of Tech Traditions|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.depts.ttu.edu/studentaffairs/parent2002/information/traditions.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-13|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080530174907/http://www.depts.ttu.edu/studentaffairs/parent2002/information/traditions.pdf |archivedate = May 30, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Will Rogers and Soapsuds ===
{{Main|Riding Into the Sunset}}
[[File:Wrstatue.jpg|thumb|left|Will Rogers and Soapsuds]]
One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of [[Will Rogers]] on his horse Soapsuds. The statue, entitled &quot;[[Riding Into the Sunset]]&quot;, has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950, by Rogers' longtime friend [[Amon G. Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooks|first=Michael Q.|title=Will and Soapsuds|publisher=Southwest Collection|url=http://swco.ttu.edu/University_Archive/pdf/1982.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of [[West Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Rogers statue dedicated|publisher=Lubbock Centennial|url=http://lubbockcentennial.com/Section/1934_1958/WillRogers.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statue, estimated to cost $25,000 when it was dedicated, stands {{convert|9|ft|11|in|m}} and weighs {{convert|3200|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2006/08/25/LaVida/How-To.Live.As.A.Raider.In.12.Big.Ways-2250711.shtml|title=How to Live as a Raider in 12 Big Ways|accessdate=2008-08-18|work=[[The Daily Toreador]]|last=Monahan|first=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: &quot;Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Rogers &amp; Soapsuds|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/rogers.php|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue continues to be a part of school tradition. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap it with red crepe paper. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crepe paper.&lt;ref name=Rogers/&gt;

According to one [[wiktionary:campus legend|campus legend]], the statue was originally to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior to face due east, toward the main campus entrance. The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. Although now proven apocryphal, the legend holds that this problem was solved by turning the statue 23&amp;nbsp;degrees to the northwest so Soapsuds' rear would face southeast, toward College Station, Texas, home of rival [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref name=Rogers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmenner|first=Drew|title=Ten things you didn't know about Texas Tech|work=Missourian|date=2007-10-19|url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2007/10/19/ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-texas-tech/|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Texas Tech ring ===
While the [[class ring]] had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the schoolâs full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.

One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the [[Administration Building (Texas Tech University)|Administration Building]], with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TTAA Class Ring &amp; Ceremony|publisher=Texas Tech University|url=http://www.ttu.edu/traditions/ring.php|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
