See [[List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Economics]]. Project resources were expanded in 2009, post [[GFC]], with the executive and governance additions of Ross Peat, Terry Allen and Phil Norman (chair).

The successful implementation of the systems in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]] have given KlickEx credibility across multiple jurisdictions, currencies, and timezones - and has revolutionised the efficiency of remittance markets, particularly for payments less than USD500.&lt;ref&gt;http://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/Country-Corridors/New-Zealand/Tonga&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a regional partnership with the United Nations Development Program, and the Australian &amp; New Zealand Governments in 2011; KlickEx has continued to build services and increase the financial 'technical stretch' underway in the Pacific - and further afield, by providing the platform for Mobile Carriers (MNO) to integrate mobile wallet platforms into the established banking system; thereby accelerating the penetration of financial services to the unbanked - particularly focusing on Rural communities, and financial inclusion for women in developing economies &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfip.org/media-centre/press-releases/digicel-klickex-launch-web-to-mobile-wallet-remittance-transfer.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software History==

KlickEx development dates back to 2002, when first generation software was deployed in OTC markets in NZ, Australia and the UK.

Planning for expansion into the currency markets began in 2005, and regulatory dialogue was initiated in 2007. The system was deployed in 2008, and supported co-parent companies &quot;Helix Data Solutions&quot; &amp; &quot;UBNZ World Markets&quot; to track and complete over $2m in transactions in 2H 2008. 

In 2008/9, New Zealand, Australia &amp; Hong Kong institutional/inter-bank client testing was completed (Trading as UBNZ World Markets prior to 2009).

By FY 2009/10, a formal governance &amp; strategy board was established&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/small-business/4499510/KlickEx-exchanging-currencies-without-fees&lt;/ref&gt;, including [[Xero]] Chairman Phil Norman, former Microsoft NZ Managing Director Ross Peat and former &quot;IceHouse&quot; Director Terry Allen; the retail brand &quot;KlickEx&quot; was officially launched and incorporated.

In 2010, two further countries were added (Samoa &amp; Tonga) and extensive closed network consumer product testing completed. In September 2010, the pacific island retail pilot launch was concluded, with over 10,000 transactions occurring. The retail platform (www.KlickEx.com) was officially released to the public on the 16th December&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1012/S00571/klickex-launches-a-cheaper-way-to-exchange-currencies.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, and has continued to increase customers at a compounded rate of 35% per week through to Q1 2011.

In early 2011, [[KlickEx]] was officially designated as an independently regulated Financial Institution - enabling KlickEx to undertake settlements across a broader range of service levels (including processing transactions outside banking hours, and/or over regional public holidays where domestic banks were closed).

In the first half of 2011, KlickEx expanded into Europe, taking the number of &quot;connected&quot; '''real time''' bank accounts over the 70 million mark across Europe and Oceania; with access via low cost ACH payments to over 400 million small businesses and consumers at hundreds of banks, in 34 countries covering 6 currencies.

In 2H 2011, KlickEx launched the first syndicated, Central Bank lead commercially integrated 4 currency settlement system in the Pacific Region, including eight regional clearing banks, and for the first time, [[mobile wallets]] and tel-co operators.
