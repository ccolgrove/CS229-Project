'''Gilly''' is a [[Charleroi Metro]] station, located in [[Gilly, Belgium|Gilly]] (part of the [[Charleroi]] municipality), in fare zone 2. Gilly is an underground station featuring a central platform, which serves as the current terminus of pre-metro lines 54 and 55.

Gilly station was opened on 28 August 1992, although it had been built in the eighties. It was refurbished in 2008 and reopened in its current version on 23 April 2008. One of the walls is adorned with coat of arms of other ''Gilly'''s in Europe, while the opposite wall features the lyrics of ''El pÃ©tite gayole'', a song in [[Wallonia|Walloon]] language written by Belgian artist Julos Beaucarne.

While trams drive on the right on most of the Charleroi Pre-metro network, they drive on the left on the [[Gilly, Belgium|Gilly]] line.

Works are in progress to extend the Gilly line of the Charleroi Pre-metro with 3 more stations to [[Soleilmont (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Soleilmont]]. When the extension opens, Gilly will no longer be a terminus station.
