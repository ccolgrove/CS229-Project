{{Campaignbox American Civil War}}

The '''American Civil War''' (1861â1865) was a [[civil war]] fought in the [[United States of America]]. In response to the [[United States presidential election, 1860|election]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States]], 11 [[Southern United States|southern]] [[slave state]]s declared their [[secession]] from the United States and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] (&quot;the Confederacy&quot;); the other 25 states supported the federal government (&quot;the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]&quot;). After four years of warfare, mostly within the Southern states, the Confederacy surrendered and slavery was outlawed everywhere in the nation. Issues that led to war were partially resolved in the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction Era]] that followed, though others remained unresolved.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]], the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], had campaigned against expanding slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republicans strongly advocated nationalism, and in their 1860 platform they denounced threats of disunion as avowals of treason. After a Republican victory, but before the new administration took office on March 4, 1861, seven cotton states declared their [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and joined to form the Confederate States of America. Both the outgoing administration of President [[James Buchanan]] and the incoming administration rejected the legality of secession, considering it rebellion. The other eight slave states rejected calls for secession at this point. No country in the world recognized the Confederacy.

Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation]] at [[Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]]. Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state to recapture federal property, which led to declarations of secession by four more slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union seized control of the border states early in the war and established a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]]. Land warfare in the East was inconclusive in 1861â62, as the Confederacy beat back Union efforts to capture its capital, Richmond, Virginia, notably during the [[Peninsular Campaign]]. In September 1862, the confederate campaign in Maryland ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Antietam]], which dissuaded the British from intervening.&lt;ref name=&quot;diplomacy&quot;/&gt; Days after that battle, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;proclamation&quot;/&gt;

In 1863, confederate general [[Robert E. Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] northward advance ended in defeat at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. To the west, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] gained control of the [[Mississippi River]] after the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg]], splitting the Confederacy in two and destroying much of their western army. Due to his western successes, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was given command of the eastern army in 1864, and organized the armies of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Philip Sheridan]] and others to attack the Confederacy from all directions, increasing the North's advantage in manpower. Grant restructured the union army, and put other generals in command of divisions of the army that were to support his push into Virginia. He led the [[Overland Campaign]] to seize Richmond, though in the face of fierce resistance he altered his plans and led the [[Siege of Petersburg]] which nearly finished off the rest of Lee's army. Meanwhile, Sherman captured [[Atlanta]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|marched to the sea]], destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. When the Confederate attempt to defend Petersburg failed, the Confederate army retreated but was pursued and defeated, which resulted in Lee's surrender to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865.

The American Civil War was one of the earliest true [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]]. Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The practices of [[total war]], developed by Sherman in Georgia, and of [[trench warfare]] around Petersburg foreshadowed [[World War I]] in Europe. It remains the deadliest war in [[History of the United States|American history]], resulting in the deaths of 620,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties. Historian [[John Huddleston]] estimates the death toll at ten percent of all Northern males 20â45 years old, and 30 percent of all Southern white males aged 18â40.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;
Victory for the North meant the end of the Confederacy and of [[slavery in the United States]], and strengthened the role of the federal government. The social, political, economic and racial [[Issues of the American Civil War|issues]] of the war decisively shaped the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|reconstruction era that lasted to 1877]].

==Causes of secession==
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War|Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War}}
{{History of the United States}}
The causes of the Civil War were complex, and have been controversial since the war began. The issue has been further complicated by [[historical revisionism|historical revisionists]], who have tried to improve the image of the South by lessening the role of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Bradford, ''A companion to American military history'' (2010) vol. 1 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s. The Republican Party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, Lincoln, won the 1860 election. Following Lincoln's victory, many Southern whites felt that disunion had become their only option.

While not all Southerners saw themselves as fighting to preserve slavery, most of the officers and over a third of the rank and file in Lee's army had close family ties to slavery. To Northerners, in contrast, the motivation was primarily to preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rQSYk-LWTxcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Politics+and+Ideology+in+the+Age+of+the+Civil+War#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Politics and Ideology in the Age of the Civil War |first=Eric |last=Foner |year=1981 |isbn=9780195029260}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Abraham Lincoln consistently made preserving the Union the central goal of the war, though he increasingly saw slavery as a crucial issue and made ending it an additional goal.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, Eric. &quot;The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery&quot; (2011) p 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation angered both Peace Democrats (&quot;Copperheads&quot;) and War Democrats, but energized most Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson pp 506-8&lt;/ref&gt;  By warning that free blacks would flood the North, Democrats made gains in the 1862 elections, but they did not gain control of Congress. The Republicans' counterargument that slavery was the mainstay of the enemy steadily gained support, with the Democrats crushed at the 1863 elections in Ohio when they tried to resurrect anti-black sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson p 686&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}
The slavery issue addressed not only the well-being of the slaves (although abolitionists raised the issue) but also the question of whether slavery was an anachronistic evil that was incompatible with American values or a profitable economic system protected by the Constitution. All sides agreed slavery exhausted the land and had to find new lands to survive. The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction.

To the South this strategy made Southerners second-class citizens and trampled their Constitutional rights.  The [[Abolitionist movement|anti-slavery movement]] in the United States had roots in the Declaration of Independence. Slavery was banned in the [[Northwest Territory]] with the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.

By 1804 all the Northern states (states north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]]) had passed laws to abolish slavery gradually. Congress in 1807 banned the international slave trade. Slavery faded in the border states and urban areas but expanded in highly profitable cotton states of the Deep South.

Despite compromises in 1820 and 1850, the slavery issues exploded in the 1850s. The new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] angered slavery interests by demanding the end to its expansion. The Republican idea was that without expansion slavery would eventually die out (as it did in other nations). [[Abraham Lincoln]], for example, in his 1858 [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], called for America to &quot;arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;american&quot;/&gt; Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voices from the Gathering Storm: The Coming of the American Civil War&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;compromise&quot;/&gt; Both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand, it would wither and die.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;declarations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independence&quot;/&gt;

Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern resentment of the influence that [[the Slave Power]] already wielded in government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Disagreements between [[Abolitionist]]s and others over the morality of slavery, the scope of democracy and the economic merits of [[Free Soil Party|free labor]] versus slave [[plantation]]s caused the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and &quot;[[Know Nothing|Know-Nothing]]&quot; parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the [[Free Soil Party]] in 1848, the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] in 1854, the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union]] in 1860). In 1860, the last national political party, the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], split along sectional lines.

Northerners ranging from the abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]] to the moderate Republican leader Lincoln&lt;ref name=&quot;declaration&quot;/&gt; stressed Jefferson's declaration that [[all men are created equal]]. Lincoln  mentioned this proposition many times, including his 1863 [[Gettysburg Address]].

Almost all the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the [[three-fifths compromise|three-fifths clause]] and a twenty-year extension of the [[African slave trade]] in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The 1793 invention of the [[cotton gin]] by [[Eli Whitney]] increased by fiftyfold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day and greatly increased the demand for slave labor in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;trager&quot;/&gt; There was controversy over adding the slave state of [[Missouri]] to the Union that led to the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820. A gag rule prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 1835â1844, while [[Manifest Destiny]] became an argument for gaining new territories, where slavery could expand. The acquisition of [[Texas]] as a [[slave state]] in 1845 along with territories won as a result of the [[MexicanâAmerican War]] (1846â1848) resulted in the [[Compromise of 1850]].&lt;ref name=&quot;democracy&quot;/&gt; The [[Wilmot Proviso]] was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from Mexico. The extremely popular anti-slavery novel [[Uncle Tom's Cabin|''Uncle Tomâs Cabin'']] (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;representatives&quot;/&gt;

[[File:John Brown, The Martyr.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] being adored by an enslaved mother and child as he walks to his execution on December 2, 1859.]]
The 1854 [[Ostend Manifesto]] was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex [[Cuba]] as a slave state. The [[Second Party System]] broke down after passage of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with [[popular sovereignty]], allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The [[Bleeding Kansas]] controversy over the status of slavery in the [[Kansas Territory]] included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery [[Border Ruffian]]s. Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]] to attempt to admit Kansas as a slave state. Buchanan supported the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;impending&quot;/&gt;

Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the [[Wakarusa War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;impending4&quot;/&gt; the [[Sacking of Lawrence]],&lt;ref name=&quot;impending5&quot;/&gt; the [[Preston Brooks#Sumner assault|caning of Republican Charles Sumner]] by the Southerner Preston Brooks,&lt;ref name=&quot;butterfield&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;impending6&quot;/&gt; the [[Pottawatomie Massacre]],&lt;ref name=&quot;impending7&quot;/&gt; the [[Battle of Black Jack]], the [[Battle of Osawatomie]] and the [[Marais des Cygnes massacre]]. The 1857 Supreme Court [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott decision]] allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery, including Kansas.

The [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858]] included Northern Democratic leader [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' [[Freeport Doctrine]]. This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision that, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid at [[Harpers Ferry Armory]] was an attempt to incite [[slave insurrection]]s in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;impending8&quot;/&gt; The North-South split in the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.

This famous 1863 photo was distributed by abolitionists to illustrate what they saw as the barbarism of Southern society.&lt;ref name=&quot;google9&quot;/&gt;  The victim likely suffered from [[keloid]], according to Kathleen Collins, making the scars more prominent and extensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;photography&quot;/&gt;]]

Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;secessionist&quot;/&gt;  States of the [[Deep South]], which had the greatest concentration of plantations, were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Tennessee]] had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;impending11&quot;/&gt;

As of 1860 the percentage of Southern families that owned slaves has been estimated to be 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;reconstruction&quot;/&gt; Half the owners had one to four slaves. A total of 8000 planters owned 50 or more slaves in 1850 and only 1800 planters owned 100 or more; of the latter, 85% lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states.&lt;ref name=&quot;randall&quot;/&gt; According to the 1860 U.S. census, 393,975 individuals, representing 8 percent of all US families, owned 3,950,528 slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;civil-war&quot;/&gt;

Ninety-five percent of African-Americans lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North, chiefly in larger cities like New York and Philadelphia. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson12&quot;/&gt;

The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' escalated the controversy. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney|Roger B. Taney's]] decision said that slaves were &quot;so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;impending13&quot;/&gt; Taney then overturned the [[Missouri Compromise]], which banned slavery in territory north of the 36Â°30' parallel. He stated, &quot;[T]he Act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning [enslaved persons] in the territory of the United States north of the line therein is not warranted by the Constitution and is therefore void.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sandford&quot;/&gt;

Southern Democrats praised the ''Dred Scott'' decision, but Republicans branded it a &quot;willful perversion&quot; of the Constitution. They argued that if Scott could not legally file suit, the Supreme Court had no right to consider the Missouri Compromise's constitutionality. Lincoln warned that &quot;the next ''Dred Scott'' decision&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;illinois&quot;/&gt; could threaten Northern states with slavery.

Lincoln said, &quot;This question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abraham&quot;/&gt; The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories,&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson14&quot;/&gt; and the Southern demand for a [[Slave codes|slave code]] for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that, &quot;our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;townsend&quot;/&gt; Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, whites throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.

Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson15&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;impending16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;william&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;freehling&quot;/&gt; The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvalonProject&quot;/&gt; said that the non-slave-holding states were &quot;proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color&quot;, and that the African race &quot;were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race&quot;. Alabama secessionist [[Edmund Strother Dargan|E. S. Dargan]] warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, &quot;we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;convention&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in the 1830s, the US [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;schlesinger&quot;/&gt; Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of [[abolitionism]] were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists.&lt;ref name=&quot;abolitionists&quot;/&gt;
The North felt threatened as well, for as [[Eric Foner]] concludes, &quot;Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;republican&quot;/&gt;

During the 1850s, slaves left the [[border states (Civil War)|border states]] through sale, [[manumission]] and escape, and border states also had more free African-Americans and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area.  Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make [[Kansas]] a slave state. By 1860, the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;secessionists&quot;/&gt;

Even though Lincoln agreed to the [[Corwin Amendment]], which would have protected slavery in existing states, secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless. Besides the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners, secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation, and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall. They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as [[Hinton Rowan Helper]]. Then slavery in the lower South, like a &quot;scorpion encircled by fire, would sting itself to death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freehling&quot;/&gt;

According to historian Chandra Manning, both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] soldiers who did the actual fighting believed slavery to be the cause of the Civil War.  He argues that a majority of Confederate soldiers fought to protect slavery, which they viewed as an integral part of southern economy, [[culture]], and manhood.  Further, he argues that Union soldiers believed the primary reason for the war was to bring [[emancipation]] to the slaves.  However, many Union soldiers did not fully endorse the idea of shedding their own blood for [[African American]] slaves, whom they viewed as inferior.  Manning's research involved reading military camp newspapers and personal correspondence between soldiers and families during the Civil War.  Manning stated that the primary debate in Confederate states over secession was not over state rights, but rather &quot;the power of the federal government to affect the institution of [[slavery]], specifically limiting it in newly added territories.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eskridge&quot;/&gt; Other historians, such as [[Eric Foner]], argue that no two people held the same motivations. He argues that while some were motivated mainly by slavery, most were motivated by some mixture of politics, culture, nationalism, honor, or any other number of motivations.[http://books.google.com/books?id=rQSYk-LWTxcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Politics+and+Ideology+in+the+Age+of+the+Civil+War&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TmNkTvHZGoqQsALcu4G0Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]

===Sectionalism===
[[File:US Secession map 1861.svg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt;'''Status of the states, 1861.&lt;/center&gt;''' {{legend|#A40000| States that seceded before April 15, 1861}} {{legend|#EF2929| States that seceded after April 15, 1861}} {{legend|#FCE94F| Union states that permitted slavery}} {{legend|#204A87| Union states that banned slavery}}

[[Sectionalism]] refers to the different economies, social structure, customs and political values of the North and South.&lt;ref name=&quot;sectionalism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sectionalism17&quot;/&gt; It increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with subsistence farming for the poor whites.  The South expanded into rich new lands in the Southwest (from Alabama to Texas).&lt;ref name=&quot;expansion&quot;/&gt;

However, slavery declined in the border states and could barely survive in cities and industrial areas (it was fading out in cities such as Baltimore, Louisville and St. Louis), so a South based on slavery was rural and non-industrial. On the other hand, as the demand for  cotton grew the price of slaves soared. Historians have debated whether economic differences between the industrial Northeast and the agricultural South helped cause the war. Most historians now disagree with the [[economic determinism]] of historian [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]] in the 1920s and emphasize that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary.&lt;ref name=&quot;progressive&quot;/&gt;

Fears of slave revolts and abolitionist propaganda made the South militantly hostile to abolitionism.&lt;ref name=&quot;clement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;franklin&quot;/&gt; Southerners complained that it was the North that was changing, and was prone to new &quot;isms&quot;, while the South remained true to historic [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] of the Founding Fathers (many of whom owned slaves, including Washington, Jefferson and Madison). Lincoln said that Republicans were following the tradition of the framers of the Constitution (including the [[Northwest Ordinance]] and the [[Missouri Compromise]]) by preventing expansion of slavery.&lt;ref name=&quot;february&quot;/&gt;

The issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the largest religious denominations (the [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Baptist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;religious&quot;/&gt; Industrialization meant that seven European immigrants out of eight settled in the North. The movement of twice as many whites leaving the South for the North as vice versa contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhersonExceptionalism&quot;/&gt;

===Nationalism and honor===
Nationalism was a powerful force in the early 19th century, with famous spokesmen like [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Daniel Webster]].  While practically all Northerners supported the Union, Southerners were split between those loyal to the entire United States (called &quot;unionists&quot;) and those loyal primarily to the southern region and then the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor&quot;/&gt;  [[C. Vann Woodward]] said of the latter group, &quot;A great slave society...had grown up and miraculously flourished in the heart of a thoroughly bourgeois and partly puritanical republic. It had renounced its bourgeois origins and elaborated and painfully rationalized its institutional, legal, metaphysical, and religious defenses....When the crisis came it chose to fight. It proved to be the death struggle of a society, which went down in ruins.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;counterpoint&quot;/&gt; Insults to Southern national honor included ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1854)&lt;ref name=&quot;southern&quot;/&gt;  and [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|John Brown]] in 1859.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism&quot;/&gt;

While the South moved toward a Southern nationalism, leaders in the North were also becoming more nationally minded, and rejected any notion of splitting the Union. The Republican national platform of 1860 warned that disunion was treason and would not be tolerated:
:we denounce those threats of disunion...as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence.&lt;ref name=&quot;republican18&quot;/&gt;  The South ignored the warnings and did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalism19&quot;/&gt;

===States' rights===
{{Main|States' rights}}
Everyone agreed that states had certain rightsâbut did those rights carry over when a citizen left that state? The Southern position was that citizens of every state had the right to take their property anywhere in the U.S. and not have it taken awayâspecifically they could bring their slaves anywhere and they would remain slaves. Northerners rejected this &quot;right&quot; because it would violate the right of a free state to outlaw slavery within its borders.  Republicans committed to ending the expansion of slavery were among those opposed to any such right to bring slaves and slavery into the free states and territories.  The [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott]] Supreme Court decision of 1857 bolstered the Southern case within territories, and angered the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot;/&gt;

Secondly the South argued that each state had the right to secedeâleave the Unionâat any time, that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was a &quot;[[compact theory|compact]]&quot; or agreement among the states. Northerners (including President Buchanan) rejected that notion as opposed to the will of the Founding Fathers who said they were setting up a &quot;perpetual union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forrest McDonald 2002&quot;/&gt; Historian James McPherson writes concerning states' rights and other non-slavery explanations:

{{quote|While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson20&quot;/&gt;}}

===Slave power and free soil issues===
{{Main|Slave Power}}
Antislavery forces in the North identified the &quot;Slave Power&quot; as a direct threat to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. They argued that rich slave owners were using political power to take control of the Presidency, Congress and the Supreme Court, thus threatening the rights of the citizens of the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;chairmanship&quot;/&gt;

&quot;Free soil&quot; was a Northern demand that the new lands opening up in the west be available to independent [[yeoman]] farmers and not be bought out by rich slave owners who would buy up the best land and work it with slaves, forcing the white farmers onto marginal lands. This was the basis of the [[Free Soil Party]] of 1848, and a main theme of the Republican Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;republican21&quot;/&gt;  Free Soilers and Republicans demanded a [[Homestead Act|homestead law]] that would give government land to settlers; it was defeated by Southerners who feared it would attract to the west European immigrants and poor Southern whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;mississippi&quot;/&gt;

===Tariffs===
{{Main|Tariffs in United States history}}

The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners,  wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates, so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816.  The South had no complaints but the low rates angered Northern industrialists and factory workers, especially in Pennsylvania, who demanded protection for their growing iron industry.
The Whigs and Republicans complained because they favored high tariffs to stimulate industrial growth, and Republicans called for an increase in tariffs in the 1860 election. The increases were finally enacted in 1861 after Southerners resigned their seats in Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;taussig&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor22&quot;/&gt;

Historians in recent decades have minimized the tariff issue, noting that few Southerners in 1860â61 said it was of central importance to them.  Some secessionist documents do mention the tariff issue, though not nearly as often as the preservation of slavery.

===Election of Lincoln===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1860}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln seated, Feb 9, 1864.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Abraham Lincoln, 16th President (1861â1865)]]
The election of Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.&lt;ref name=&quot;impending23&quot;/&gt; Efforts at compromise, including the &quot;[[Corwin Amendment]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Crittenden Compromise]]&quot;, failed.
Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.

===Battle of Fort Sumter===
{{Main|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
The Lincoln Administration, just as the outgoing Buchanan administration before it, refused to turn over Ft. Sumterâlocated in the middle of the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Jefferson Davis ordered the surrender of the fort. Union Maj. Anderson gave a conditional reply which the Confederate government rejected, and Davis ordered Beauregard to attack the fort before a relief expedition could arrive. After a heavy bombardment on April 12â13, 1861 (with no intentional casualties), the fort surrendered. On April 15, Lincoln then called for 75,000 troops from the states to recapture the fort and other federal property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lincoln's Call to Arms&quot;/&gt;

Rather than furnish troops and access for an attack on their fellow southern states, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas elected to join them in secession.  North and South the response to Ft. Sumter was an overwhelming demand for war to uphold national honor. Only Kentucky tried to remain neutral. Hundreds of thousands of young men across the land rushed to enlist.&lt;ref name=&quot;secession&quot;/&gt;

==Secession begins==

===Secession of South Carolina===
{{See also|History of South Carolina#Antebellum South Carolina}}
South Carolina did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state. South Carolina adopted the &quot;[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]&quot; on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.

===Secession winter===
Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson24&quot;/&gt; They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President [[James Buchanan]], whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the [[Dred Scott decision]] was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union &quot;was intended to be perpetual&quot;, but that &quot;the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union&quot; was not among the &quot;enumerated powers granted to Congress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ucsb&quot;/&gt; One quarter of the U.S. Armyâthe entire garrison in Texasâwas surrendered in February 1861 to state forces by its commanding general, [[David E. Twiggs]], who then joined the Confederacy.

As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, Republicans were able to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the [[Morrill Tariff]], land grant colleges (the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morill Act]]), a [[Homestead Act]], a transcontinental railroad (the [[Pacific Railway Acts]]), the [[National Banking Act]] and the authorization of [[United States Note]]s by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The [[Revenue Act of 1861]] introduced the [[income tax]] to help finance the war.

===The Confederacy===
{{Confederate states in the American Civil War}}
{{Main|Confederate States of America}}
Seven [[Deep South]] cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with [[South Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]]. These seven states formed the Confederate States of America (February 4, 1861), with [[Jefferson Davis]] as president, and a [[Confederate States Constitution|governmental structure]] closely modeled on the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].

Following the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, an additional four Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy: [[Virginia]], [[Arkansas]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]]. The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of [[West Virginia]] on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861, [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]] were effectively under Union control, with Confederate state governments in exile.

===The Union states===
{{Main|Union (American Civil War)}}
Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union: [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], and [[Wisconsin]]. During the war, [[Nevada]] and [[West Virginia]] joined as new states of the Union. [[Tennessee]] and [[Louisiana]] were returned to Union military control early in the war.

The territories of [[Colorado Territory|Colorado]], [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]], [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]], [[Nevada Territory|Nevada]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and [[Washington Territory|Washington]] fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]) a small, bloody civil war.&lt;ref name=&quot;university&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Volunteers â Indian Troops&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Civil War Refugees&quot;/&gt;

===Border states===
{{Main|Border states (American Civil War)}}
The border states in the Union were [[West Virginia]] (which separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ([[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]]).

[[Maryland]] had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rioting in Baltimore]] and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with [[martial law]] and sent in militia units from the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson25&quot;/&gt; Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by arresting all the prominent secessionists and holding them without trial (they were later released).

In Missouri, an [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)|elected convention]] on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor [[Claiborne Fox Jackson|Claiborne F. Jackson]] called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General [[Nathaniel Lyon]], who chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. (''See also: [[Missouri secession]]''). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins&quot;/&gt;
[[File:American Civil War Chaplain.JPG|thumb|A [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Union army chaplain celebrating a Mass]]

Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its Union status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins26&quot;/&gt;

After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] asked 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on October 24, 1861. A voter turnout of 34% approved the statehood bill (96% approving).&lt;ref name=&quot;A State of Convenience, The Creation of West Virginia&quot;/&gt; The inclusion of 24 secessionist counties&lt;ref name=&quot;copperhead&quot;/&gt;  in the state and the ensuing guerrilla war&lt;ref name=&quot;political&quot;/&gt; engaged about 40,000 Federal troops for much of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson27&quot;/&gt; Congress admitted [[West Virginia]] to the Union on June 20, 1863. West Virginia provided about 20,000-22,000 soldiers to both the Confederacy and the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;charleston&quot;/&gt;

A Unionist secession attempt occurred in [[East Tennessee]], but was suppressed by the Confederacy, which arrested over 3000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union. They were held without trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederate&quot;/&gt;

==Overview==

Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee.&lt;ref name=&quot;boritt&quot;/&gt; Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones, this article only gives the broadest outline. For more information see [[List of American Civil War battles]] and [[Military leadership in the American Civil War]].{{clear}}

===The beginning of the war, 1861===
{{Details|Battle of Fort Sumter}}
Lincoln's victory in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, an additional six Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their temporary capital at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]]. A pre-war February [[Peace Conference of 1861]] met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response apart from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter using the ship ''[[Star of the West]]'', which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson28&quot;/&gt;
However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.
[[File:Great Meeting Union Square.jpg|thumb|The great meeting in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], New York, to support the government, April 20, 1861]]
On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], he argued that the Constitution was a [[Preamble to the United States Constitution|''more perfect union'']] than the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]], that it was a binding contract, and called any secession &quot;legally void&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaugural&quot;/&gt;
He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union.&lt;ref name=&quot;inaugural29&quot;/&gt;

The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents because he claimed the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government.&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterNegotiations&quot;/&gt;
However, Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PotterNegotiations&quot;/&gt;

[[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, [[Fort Sumter]] in Charleston, South Carolina, and [[Fort Pickens]], [[Fort Jefferson]], and [[Fort Zachary Taylor|Fort Taylor]], all in Florida, were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold them all. Under orders from Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]], troops controlled by the Confederate government under [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12, forcing its capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lincoln's Call for Troops&quot;/&gt;
citing presidential powers given by the [[Militia Acts of 1792]]. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson30&quot;/&gt;
For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;google31&quot;/&gt;
Confederate sympathizers seized [[Liberty Arsenal]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]] on April 20, eight days after Fort Sumter.
On May 3, 1861, Lincoln called for an additional 42,034 volunteers for a period of three years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proclamation 83 â Increasing the Size of the Army and Navy&quot;/&gt;
:
Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson32&quot;/&gt;
The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of [[Atlanta]] and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.{{clear}}

===Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861===
{{Main|Union blockade}}
[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|1861 cartoon of Scott's &quot;[[Anaconda Plan]]&quot;]]

[[Winfield Scott]], the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the [[Anaconda Plan]] to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;profession&quot;/&gt; His idea was that a [[Union blockade]] of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the [[Mississippi River]] would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;winfield&quot;/&gt;

In April 1861, Lincoln announced the Union blockade of all Southern ports; commercial ships could not get insurance and regular traffic ended.  The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake it was too late. &quot;King Cotton&quot; was dead, as the South could export less than 10% of its cotton.&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;/&gt;  British investors built small, fast [[blockade runner]]s that traded arms and luxuries brought in from [[Bermuda]], [[Cuba]] and the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson33&quot;/&gt;  When the Union Navy seized a blockade runner, the ship and cargo were sold and the proceeds given to the Navy sailors; the captured crewmen were mostly British and they were simply released.  The Southern economy nearly collapsed during the war.  Shortages of food and supplies were caused by the blockade, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies. The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing [[Southern Bread Riots|bread riots]] across the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;heidler&quot;/&gt;

On March 8, 1862, the [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate Navy]] waged a fight against the [[United States Navy|Union Navy]] when the [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] attacked the blockade. Against wooden ships, she seemed unstoppable. The next day, however, she had to fight the new Union warship [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads|Battle of the Ironclads]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson34&quot;/&gt; Their battle ended in a draw. The Confederacy lost the ''Virginia'' when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of ''Monitor''. Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain.

Northern technology achieved another breakthrough on April 10â11, 1862, when a joint Army-Navy expedition reduced a major masonry fortification at  [[Battle of Fort Pulaski|Fort Pulaski]] guarding Savannah, Georgia.  Employing the [[Parrott rifle]] cannon made masonry coastal defenses obsolete overnight. The Federals left a small garrison, releasing troops and ships for other blockading operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;google35&quot;/&gt; The Union victory at the [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]] in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.

===Conscription and desertion===
[[File:CivilWarFifeandDrum.jpg|thumb|left|A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps]]
In the first year of the war, both sides had far more volunteers than they could effectively train and equip. After the initial enthusiasm faded, reliance on the cohort of young men who came of age every year and wanted to join was not enough. Both sides used a draft lawâ[[conscription]]âas a device to encourage or force volunteering; relatively few were actually drafted and served. The Confederacy passed a draft law in April 1862 for young men aged 18 to 35; overseers of slaves, government officials, and clergymen were exempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;questia&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Congress followed in July, authorizing a militia draft within a state when it could not meet its quota with volunteers.

When the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in January 1863, ex-slaves were energetically recruited by the states, and used to meet the state quotas. States and local communities offered higher and higher cash bonuses for white volunteers. Congress tightened the law in March 1863.  Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.  Families used the substitute provision to select which man should go into the army and which should stay home. There was much evasion and overt resistance to the draft, especially in Catholic areas. The great [[New York Draft Riots|draft riot in New York City in July 1863]] involved Irish immigrants who had been signed up as citizens to swell the machine vote, not realizing it made them liable for the draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;reconstruct&quot;/&gt;  Of the 168,649 men procured for the Union through the draft, 117,986 were substitutes, leaving only 50,663 who had their personal services conscripted.&lt;ref name=&quot;murdock&quot;/&gt;

North and South, the draft laws were highly unpopular.  An estimated 120,000 men evaded conscription in the North, many of them fleeing to Canada, and another 280,000 Northern soldiers deserted during the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;infantry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; along with at least 100,000 Southerners, or about 10% all together.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederate36&quot;/&gt;  However, desertion was a very common event in the 19th century; in the peacetime Army about 15% of the soldiers deserted every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;peacetime&quot;/&gt; In the South, many men deserted temporarily to take care of their families,&lt;ref name=&quot;teachinghistory&quot;/&gt; then returned to their units.&lt;ref name=&quot;desertion&quot;/&gt;  In the North, &quot;bounty jumpers&quot; enlisted to get the generous bonus, deserted, then went back to a second recruiting station under a different name to sign up again for a second bonus; 141 were caught and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;desertion37&quot;/&gt;

===Eastern theater 1861â1863===
{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}

Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]], [[Virginia]], in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces there was halted in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], or ''First Manassas'',&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson38&quot;/&gt; McDowell's troops were forced back to [[Washington, D.C.]], by the Confederates under the command of Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[P. G. T. Beauregard]]. It was in this battle that Confederate General [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]] received the [[nickname]] of &quot;Stonewall&quot; because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson39&quot;/&gt;

Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Crittenden-Johnson Resolution]] on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.

Maj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Wager Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],&lt;ref name=&quot;perryville&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;terrible&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson40&quot;/&gt; [[Joseph E. Johnston|Johnston]] halted his advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], then General [[Robert E. Lee]] and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson81&quot;/&gt; defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat. The [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson41&quot;/&gt; McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.
[[File:NYRiot.jpg|thumb|upright|Rioters attacking a building on Lexington Avenue during the [[New York City draft riots]] of 1863]]

Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North. General Lee led 45,000 men of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson81&quot;/&gt; near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], [[Maryland]], on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson42&quot;/&gt;  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his [[Emancipation Proclamation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson43&quot;/&gt;

When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson44&quot;/&gt; on December 13, 1862, when over 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863]] Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson45&quot;/&gt; in May 1863. Gen. Stonewall Jackson was mortally wounded by his own men during the battle and subsequently died of complications. Gen. Hooker was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]] during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson46&quot;/&gt; (July 1 to July 3, 1863). This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory.   Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson47&quot;/&gt; However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership.  At the same time the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].{{clear}}

===Western theater 1861â1863===
{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}

While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson48&quot;/&gt; [[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], [[Kentucky]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.

The [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], [[Missouri]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  In April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] captured [[New Orleans]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson49&quot;/&gt; without a major fight, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], prevented Union control of the entire river.

General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] at the [[Battle of Perryville]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson50&quot;/&gt; although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at invading Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen. [[William Rosecrans]] at the [[Battle of Stones River]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson51&quot;/&gt; in [[Tennessee]].
[[File:Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Chickamauga was one of the deadliest battles in the Western Theater.]]
The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]. Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]]'s corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas]]. Rosecrans retreated to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], which Bragg then besieged.

The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (by which the Union seized control of the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] Rivers); [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]];&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson52&quot;/&gt; and the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vicksburg]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson53&quot;/&gt; which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning points]] of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the [[Chattanooga Campaign|Third Battle of Chattanooga]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson54&quot;/&gt; driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.

===Trans-Mississippi theater 1861â1865===
{{Details|Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War}}
[[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla]] activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissFacts&quot;/&gt; The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]], and [[New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|New Mexico Territory]] for the Union. Confederate incursions into [[New Mexico territory]] were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure [[Indian Territory]] succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's [[Red River Campaign]] was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.

Sherman]], General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], Lincoln, and Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]] discuss military plans for final months of the Civil War.]]
At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of [[total war]] and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms, and railroads. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals George Meade and [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General [[Franz Sigel]] (and later [[Philip Sheridan]]) were to [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|attack the Shenandoah Valley]], General Sherman was to capture [[Atlanta]] and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals [[George Crook]] and [[William W. Averell]] were to operate against railroad supply lines in [[West Virginia]], and Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks|Nathaniel P. Banks]] was to capture [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], [[Alabama]].

Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (&quot;Grant's [[Overland Campaign]]&quot;) of the Eastern campaign. Grant's [[attrition warfare|battles of attrition]] at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson55&quot;/&gt; resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks),&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson56&quot;/&gt; kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.
[[File:Sherman Grant Sheridan 1937 Issue-3c.jpg|left|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Generals [[William T. Sherman|Sherman]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] &amp; [[Phil Sheridan|Sheridan]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[US Presidents on US postage stamps#Ulysses S. Grant|Army Issue of 1937]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Grant finally found a commander, General [[Philip Sheridan]], aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former [[U.S. Vice President]] and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market would prove to be the Confederacy's last major victory of the war. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson57&quot;/&gt; a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.
[[File:EwellsDeadSpotsylvania1864crop01.jpg|thumb|right|Confederate dead of General [[Richard S. Ewell|Ewell]]'s Corps who attacked the Union lines at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania]], May 19, 1864.]]

Meanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson58&quot;/&gt; Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson59&quot;/&gt; Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.

Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his &quot;[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]&quot;. He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south,&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson60&quot;/&gt; increasing the pressure on Lee's army.

Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson61&quot;/&gt; to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]], it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.{{clear}}

===Confederacy surrenders===
{{Main|Conclusion of the American Civil War}}
[[File:Civil war 1861-1865.jpg|right|thumb|380px| Map of Confederate territory losses year by year]]
Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the [[McLean House (Appomattox, Virginia)|McLean House]] in the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|village of Appomattox Court House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;appomattox&quot;/&gt;
In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully restoring Confederate states to the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his sword and his horse, [[Traveller (horse)|Traveller]]. On April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Southern sympathizer.  Lincoln died early the next morning, and [[Andrew Johnson]] became president. Meanwhile, Confederate forces across the South surrendered as news of Lee's surrender reached them.&lt;ref name=&quot;surrender&quot;/&gt;

==Emancipation during the war==
[[File:Soldiers White Black 1861.jpg|thumb|upright|Black and White soldiers in the Union Army. 1860s]]
At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves &quot;...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson62&quot;/&gt; 

The same Congressmanâand his fellow Radical Republicansâput pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot;/&gt; [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and some [[War Democrats]] opposed emancipation, although the latter eventually accepted it as part of [[total war]] needed to save the Union.  The [[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] generally opposed emancipation, and when the draft began in the summer of 1863 they launched [[New York Draft Riots|a major riot in New York City]] that was suppressed by the military, as well as much smaller protests in other cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;reconstruct63&quot;/&gt; 

Many of the recent immigrants viewed freed slaves as competition for scarce jobs, and as the reason why the Civil War was being fought.&lt;ref name=&quot;americanheritage&quot;/&gt; Many Catholics in the North had volunteered to fight in 1861, sending thousands of soldiers to the front and taking high casualties, especially at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]]; their volunteering fell off after 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;fredericksburg&quot;/&gt; Sentiment among [[German American]]s was largely anti-slavery, especially among [[Forty-Eighters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Refugees of Revolution&quot;/&gt; Hundreds of thousands of German Americans volunteered to fight for the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;kamphoefner&quot;/&gt;

In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that &quot;to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;september&quot;/&gt; At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War [[Simon Cameron]] and Generals [[John C. FrÃ©mont]] (in Missouri) and [[David Hunter]] (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.

Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson64&quot;/&gt; Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, which was enacted by Congress. When Lincoln told his cabinet about his proposed emancipation proclamation, Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing it, as to do otherwise would seem like &quot;our last shriek on the retreat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephen&quot;/&gt; 

In September 1862 the [[Battle of Antietam]] provided this opportunity, and the subsequent [[War Governors' Conference]] added support for the proclamation.&lt;ref name=&quot;america&quot;/&gt; Lincoln had already published a letter&lt;ref name=&quot;greeley&quot;/&gt; encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was &quot;somehow the cause of the war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecondInaugural&quot;/&gt; 

Lincoln issued his preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that &quot;If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lincoln&quot;/&gt;

Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson65&quot;/&gt; Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;WhoFreed&quot;/&gt; which made emancipation universal and permanent.

Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. 

The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright|Union Army soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]] in May, 1865. After the war, [[Henry Wirz]], the prison's commandant, was tried for war crimes by a military commission and executed.]]
Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;retreat&quot;/&gt; This led to a breakdown of the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|prisoner and mail exchange program]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Civil War Topics&quot;/&gt; and the growth of prison camps such as [[Andersonville National Historic Site|Andersonville prison]] in Georgia,&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtontimes&quot;/&gt; where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson66&quot;/&gt;

In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders&amp;nbsp;â until 1865&amp;nbsp;â opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, &quot;If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot; Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson67&quot;/&gt;

Historian [[John D. Winters]], in ''The Civil War in Louisiana'' (1963), referred to the exhilaration of the slaves when the Union Army came through [[Louisiana]]: &quot;As the troops moved up to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], the Negroes crowded the roadsides to watch the passing army. They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;university68&quot;/&gt;

The Emancipation Proclamation&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson69&quot;/&gt; greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlavDela&quot;/&gt; 

The great majority of the 4&amp;nbsp;million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved south. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th amendment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson70&quot;/&gt; ratified December 6, 1865, finally made slavery illegal everywhere in the United States, thus freeing the remaining slavesâ65,000 in Kentucky (as of 1865),&lt;ref name=&quot;harrison&quot;/&gt; 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;/&gt;

Historian Stephen Oates said that many myths surround Lincoln: &quot;man of the people&quot;, &quot;true Christian&quot;, &quot;arch villain&quot; and racist. The belief that Lincoln was racist was caused by an incomplete picture of Lincoln, such as focusing on only selective quoting of statements Lincoln made to gain the support of the border states and Northern Democrats, and ignoring the many things he said against slavery, and the military and political context within which such statements were made. Oates said that Lincoln's letter to [[Horace Greeley]] has been &quot;persistently misunderstood and misrepresented&quot; for such reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;stephen71&quot;/&gt;

==Blocking international intervention==
{{Main|Britain in the American Civil War|France in the American Civil War}}
Europe in the 1860s was more fragmented than it had been since before the American Revolution. France was in a weakened state while Britain was still shocked by their poor performance in the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson546&quot;/&gt; France was unable or unwilling to support either side without Britain, where popular support remained with the Union though elite opinion was more varied. They were further distracted by Germany and Italy, who were experiencing unification troubles, and by Russia, who was almost unflinching in their support for the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson546&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;superpower237&quot;/&gt;

Though the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson546&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;superpower237&quot;/&gt; The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson72&quot;/&gt;

[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860â62 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further way from the Confederacy. It was said that &quot;King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton&quot;, as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson72&quot;/&gt; When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;nevins73&quot;/&gt;

[[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]] proved particularly adept as [[ambassador|minister]] to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain (who had herself abolished slavery in her own colonies in 1834).&lt;ref name=&quot;approaching&quot;/&gt;

War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|British mail steamer]] to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediationâthough even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S. [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin|Uncle Tomâs Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.&lt;ref name=&quot;approaching&quot;/&gt;

The Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the Polish revolt against Russia further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would continue to remain neutral.&lt;ref name=&quot;superpower&quot;/&gt;

[[File:AndersonvilleCemetary.JPG|thumb|[[Andersonville National Cemetery]] is the final resting place for the Union prisoners who perished while being held at Camp Sumter.]]

Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, such as [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson75&quot;/&gt; McPherson argues that the Northâs advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy&quot;/&gt; 

Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy&quot;/&gt; 

Some scholars, such as those of the [[Lost Cause]] tradition, argue that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Civil War historian [[Shelby Foote]] expressed this view succinctly: &quot;I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ward&quot;/&gt; 

The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves, Britain, and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson76&quot;/&gt;

Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarLeader&quot;/&gt; The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly the United Kingdom and France.  Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities.  

Lincoln's naval blockade was 95% effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and the United Kingdom's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either the United Kingdom or France would enter the war.

The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22&amp;nbsp;million and the South 9&amp;nbsp;million in 1861. The Southern population included more than 3.5&amp;nbsp;million slaves and about 5.5&amp;nbsp;million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tread&quot;/&gt;

The disparity grew as the Union controlled an increasing amount of southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, riverboats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson77&quot;/&gt; 

Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South, which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system, repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia78&quot;/&gt; The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors (especially Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] of Georgia and Governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance]] of North Carolina) damaged his ability to draw on regional resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcpherson79&quot;/&gt; The Confederacy's &quot;[[King Cotton]]&quot; misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia80&quot;/&gt;

The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered,&lt;ref name=&quot;SpartSchool&quot;/&gt; further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties, and fought numerous battles in 1864â65.&lt;ref name=&quot;experience&quot;/&gt; European [[History of Immigration to the United States#Immigration 1790 to 1849|immigrants]] joined the [[Union Army]] in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;google81&quot;/&gt; The railroad industry became the nation's largest employer outside of agriculture. The American Civil War was followed by a boom in railroad construction, which contributed to the [[Panic of 1873]].&lt;ref name=&quot;8jhiewvmb8mc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oberholtzer&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Grand Army of the Republic by Swatjester.jpg|thumb|Monument in honor of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], organized after the war.]]

Slavery for the Confederacy's 3.5 million blacks effectively ended when Union armies arrived; they were nearly all freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Slaves in the border states and those located in some former Confederate territory occupied prior to the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 18, 1865) by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. 

The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deathsâtwo-thirds by disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;StatsWarCost&quot;/&gt; Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker believes the number of soldier deaths was approximately 750,000, 20% higher than traditionally estimated, and possibly as high as 850,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;hacker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;recounting&quot;/&gt; The war accounted for roughly as many American deaths as all American deaths in other U.S. wars combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;introduction&quot;/&gt;

The [[Origins of the American Civil War|causes of the war]], the reasons for its outcome, and even [[Naming the American Civil War|the name of the war itself]] are subjects of lingering contention today. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all [[White people|white]] males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and 18% in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;google82&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;/&gt; About 56,000 soldiers died in prisons during the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic&quot;/&gt; 

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] tactics, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[MiniÃ© ball]]s and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open. This led to the adoption of [[trench warfare]], a style of fighting that defined the better part of [[World War I]].

The war destroyed much of the wealth that had existed in the South.  Income per person in the South dropped to less than 40% than that of the North, a condition which lasted until well into the 20th century.  Southern influence in the US federal government, previously considerable, was greatly diminished until the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist&quot;/&gt;

====Reconstruction====

{{Main|Reconstruction Era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war (and continued to 1877) in an effort to solve the issues caused by reunion, specifically the legal status of the 11 breakaway states, the Confederate leadership, and the freedmen. Northern leaders during the war agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. 

Lincoln and the Radical Republicans disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control that should be imposed on the South, and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.  These disputes became central to the political debates after the Confederacy collapsed.

==Memory and historiography==
The Civil War is one of the central events in America's collective memory. There are innumerable statues, commemorations, books and archival collections. The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;controversy&quot;/&gt;  The last theme includes moral evaluations of racism and slavery, heroism in combat and behind the lines, and the issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an &quot;[[Empire of Liberty]]&quot; influencing the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;american83&quot;/&gt;  Memory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|&quot;Lost Cause&quot;]], which shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;confederacy84&quot;/&gt;
===150th anniversary===
The year 2011 will include the American Civil War's 150th anniversary. Many in the South are attempting to incorporate both [[Black history]] and white perspectives. A Harris Poll given in March 2011 suggested that Americans were still uniquely divided over the results and appropriate memorials to acknowledge the occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;150 Years Later Remembering the American Civil War&quot;/&gt; While traditionally American films of the Civil War feature &quot;brother versus brother&quot; themes &lt;ref name=&quot;google85&quot;/&gt; film treatments of the war are evolving to include African American characters.  Benard Simelton, president of the Alabama [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], said celebrating the Civil War is like celebrating the &quot;[[Holocaust]]&quot;. In reference to slavery Simelton said that black &quot;rights were taken away&quot; and that blacks &quot;were treated as less than human beings.&quot; National Park historian Bob Sutton said that slavery was the &quot;principal cause&quot; of the war. Sutton also claimed that the issue of state rights was incorporated by the Confederacy as a justification for the war in order to get recognition from Britain. Sutton went on to mention that during the 100th anniversary of the Civil War white southerners focused on the genius of southern generals, rather than slavery. In Virginia during the fall of 2010, a conference took place that addressed the slavery issue. During November 2010, black Civil War reenactors from around the country participated in a parade at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Civil War's 150th anniversary stirs debate on race&quot;/&gt;
===Hollywood===
Hollywood's take on the war has been especially influential in shaping public memory, as seen in such films as &quot;Birth of a Nation,&quot; &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and &quot;Glory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gallagher&quot;/&gt;
