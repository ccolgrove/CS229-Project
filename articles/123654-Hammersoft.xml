Billings was nicknamed the [[Magic City]] because of its growth from its founding as a railroad town in 1882. The city is named for [[Frederick H. Billings]], a former president of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]]. With one of the largest trade areas in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.bigskyeda-edc.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.bigskyeda-edc.org/ Big Sky Economic Development]&lt;/ref&gt; Billings is the trade and distribution center for most of [[Montana]], Northern [[Wyoming]] and western portions of [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]]. Billings is also the retail destination for much of the same area. With more hotel accommodations than any area within a five state region, the city hosts a variety of conventions, concerts, sporting events and other rallies.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.bigskyeda-edc.org&quot;/&gt;

Area attractions include [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Pompey's Pillar National Monument|Pompey's Pillar]], [[Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument]], [[Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area]], [[Pictograph Cave (Billings, Montana)|Pictograph Cave]], [[Chief Plenty Coups State Park]], [[Zoo Montana]], [[Red Lodge Mountain Resort]] and the [[Beartooth Highway]].

==History==
===Before the city===
[[File:Popi sig550.jpg|thumb|William Clarkâs inscription on Pompeys Pillar]]

Much of Billings is located in the Yellowstone Valley, carved out by the [[Yellowstone River]]. Over 10 million years ago, this valley was underwater with the tops of the Rimrocks, {{convert|500|to|800|ft|m|adj=on}} cliffs to the north and east of downtown, being a prehistoric beach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comevisitbillings.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Some pictographs in the [[Pictograph Cave (Billings, Montana)]] {{convert|6|mi|km}} south of Billings are 2,100 years old. The Pictograph, Middle, and Ghost cave complex were home to generations of prehistoric hunters. Approximately 30,000 artifacts, ranging from stone tools, weapons, paintings and the instruments used, have been identified from the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;visitmt1&quot;&gt;[http://custer.visitmt.com/categories/moreinfo.asp?siteid=129&amp;IDRRecordID=3107 Pictograph Cave State Park]&lt;/ref&gt; They were carved from the Eagle sandstone cliff by the forces of water and wind.&lt;ref name=&quot;visitmt1&quot;/&gt; The [[Crow Indians]] frequented this area from about the year 1700. In 1806, [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] traveled through the region on the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He inscribed his name on [[Pompey's Pillar National Monument|Pompey's Pillar]], a rock formation {{convert|25|mi|km}} northeast of Billings, on July 25, 1806 William Clark wrote that he climbed the sandstone pillar and &quot;had a most extensive view in every direction on the Northerly Side of the river&quot;. Clark named the place &quot;Pompys Tower&quot; in honor of a young [[Shoshone]] boy he had nicknamed &quot;Pompy.&quot; The boy's mother was [[Sacajawea]], who had helped guide the Lewis and Clark expedition and had acted as an interpreter. The name of the formation was changed by 1814 to the current title. Clark's inscription is the only remaining physical evidence found along the route that was followed by the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitmt.com/categories/moreinfo.asp?IDRRecordID=7009&amp;siteid=1 Pompeys Pillar National Monument]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coulson / Billings===

Billings was established in 1882 in [[Montana Territory]] near the already existing town of Coulson. The city of Billings was a rail hub founded by the Northern Pacific Railroad on a site originally known as Clark's Fork Bottom. The location was steered by a plan to develop freight hauling up Alkali Creek to Ft Benton and beyond into the productive Judith and Musselshell Basins. This inauspicious location was three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from fresh water on the alkali flats above the Yellowstone River, and was far from an ideal location to start a town.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.yhpb.org/VirtualTours/BillingsTour/billings.html Historic Downtown Billings - Historical Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby town of Coulson, five years old and perched on the river's edge just to the northeast, appeared a far more likely site. Coulson was a rough and tumble town where arguments were often followed by gunplay. Coulson's first sheriff was none other than [[Liver-Eating Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnlivereatingjohnston.com/ John Liver Eating Johnston - Home]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous person to be buried in Coulsons Boothill cemetery is Muggins Taylor,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billings.k12.mt.us/talesw/teamtale/castle/taylor.htm Taylor]&lt;/ref&gt; the scout who carried the news of Custer's Last Stand to the world. Most buried here were said to have died with their boots on. Settlers moving east from the Gallatin Valley had farmed the flats around Coulson since 1877, and rejoiced at the news that the railroad was coming their way. In the end, though, Billings edged out Coulson, to the great disappointment of those living in the settlement. The town of  Coulson had been situated on the [[Yellowstone River]], which made it ideal for the commerce that [[Steamboats]] brought up the river. However, when the Montana &amp; Minnesota Land Company oversaw the development of potential railroad land, they ignored Coulson, and platted the new town of Billings just a couple of miles to the Northwest. Coulson quickly faded away; most of her residents were absorbed into Billings. Yet for a short time the two towns co-existed: a trolley even ran between the two. But ultimately there was no future for Coulson as Billings grew. Though it stood on the banks of the Yellowstone River only a couple of miles from the heart of present day Downtown Billings, the city of Billings never built on the land where Coulson once stood. Today Coulson Park sits along the banks of the Yellowstone where the valley's first town once stood.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

===Early railroad town===

Billings railroad ancestry is seen in its townsite configuration. Unlike mining towns of the region whose contours traced the haphazard routes of streambeds and ore bodies, railroad towns were orderly geometric affairs. Laid out on rectilinear grids, the rail lines formed the spine of the townsite, with streets for businesses and homes projecting away at right angles. Taking advantage of the unique way that Billings straddled two sections, Clark platted the town to include two main commercial streets, paralleling and fronting onto the rail line. These twin streets, named Montana and Minnesota for the mother company that gave them life, formed the commercial center of the new town.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

On April 1, 1882, Heman Clark arrived at Billings. Detailing the creation of the Billings townsite, what he described was basically an instant city planned to hold 20,000 inhabitants. Eight or nine sawmills, a {{convert|16|mi|km|adj=on}} irrigation system, rail spurs to nearby mines and money for the first bank in town came with the package. The railroad's promise to pump massive capital into the town &quot;lit the fuse of a crazed land boom&quot;, and when M&amp;MLI agent G. B. Hulme joined Clark the following week, the land rush was on.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, work on the approaching NP line continued at breakneck pace. Henry Villard, then president of the NP, was pushing hard for the transcontinental connection. While rail crews built east from Portland, others continued west up the Yellowstone valley. In August 1882, the line was completed to Billings, and on September 8, 1883, spike-driving celebrations at Gold Creek, Montana forged the final link in the NP's chain across the continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

By May 1882, there were three buildings on the spot destined to become Billings. They were headquarters to lodge railroad survey crews, H. Clark's townsite office and mercantile, and a lone residence. Immediately, the building of town began. Many of the first structures were tents that sheltered hustling new businesses and town residents. Alongside them, cabins of rough-hewn log sprouted in about equal numbers and rapidly replaced the tents. By mid-June the first year, 79 tent shelters were in use, 81 houses were complete and another 75 homes were underway. Buildings to house new arrivals were hastily constructed south of the tracks, while commercial buildings and hotels were planted close to the hub of railroad activities. To keep order in the midst of the flurry, it was decreed that all dwellings be kept off the middle of streets&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

The building boom continued, and by the end of 1883, the newspaper reported some 400 buildings, occupied by over 1,500 citizens. Maps of the day reveal that downtown encompassed about a nine-block area, split about evenly north and south of the railroad tracks. However, on the south the buildings were all of wood frame construction, while to the north, brick buildings were already beginning to edge out first generation frame buildings. Beyond downtown, the area south of the tracks became the first large residential neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

On November 19, 1888, a visiting reporter described Billings' progress through her first half decade.

''In January 1882, Billings was a bright prairie. Today it is a sprightly, live, energetic and aggressive town of 1,500 inhabitants. It has certain metropolitan characteristics such as a splendid system of water works, electric lights, graded streets, efficient fire department, excellent schools and churches, good society, an intelligent class of people, wide awake and quick to respond to any demands upon their purses in the interest of the community.''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

===20th century===

The railroad and the new townsite drew settlers from far and wide. Many of the new arrivals came from other countries (the 1900 census recorded a quarter of the population foreign-born), creating a cosmopolitan mix of people and cultures in early Billings. The Northern Pacific employed many Chinese on their rail crews, and many took up resident status in the new city of Billings. A police officer of the day remembered there were some 90 people, mainly &quot;laundry and restaurant employees, born in China and with families still in China. The Chinese lived close together, primarily at the east end of the townsite near Minnesota Ave. Sam Lee, one of the most prominent Chinese businessmen, owned much of block 189 including the L &amp; L Building which still stands at 2624 Minnesota Ave.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

In 1909, the Great Northern Railway built through Montana to Billings and beyond. That same year, Congress passed the Enlarged Homestead Act, allowing people to lay claim to {{convert|320|acre|km2}} farms (double the previous size). What had been a steady flow of settlement suddenly became a raging torrent. In the heartland of dry farming, Billings was both a farm and rail hub. Outside of town, some {{convert|100,000|acre|km2}} were put into cultivation, while greater Yellowstone County reported {{convert|2500000|acre|km2}} dry were tilled for homestead farms.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Banks abounded in Billings, each a monument to local prosperity. By 1905, there were six banks in town, with a combined capital of over half a million dollars. Downtown was transformed during this &quot;modern&quot; era, and buildings of the late 19th century gave way to new, larger buildings that reflected the prosperity of Billings in the early 20th century. The presence of the Burlington and Milwaukee Railroad along the 5th Avenue North right-of-way drew downtown development that direction, and northern portions of downtown became increasingly urban. On March 24, 1909, a new downtown &quot;Union Depot&quot; serving the NP, Great Northern and Burlington lines opened to the public. Hotels large and small sprouted at the heart of downtown to serve travelers to Billings. Most prominent were the Northern and the Grand Hotels. Both buildings remain today, and are commanding on the Billings skyline. Smaller hotels also grew up in the shadow of the depot. Along Montana in the depot district, several small hotels were erected during the second decade of the 20th century. The Eagle, McCormick, Rex, Lincoln and Carlin are among those buildings that still remain.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

By the 1910 census, Billings' population had risen to 10,031 ranking it the sixth fastest growing community in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; In 1911, a new Federal Building at First Ave. North and North 26th St. was begun. Completed in January 1914, it housed the post office, courthouse, and a booming U.S. Land Office. In 1912, the Montana Power Company constructed the Electric Building, aglow at night with recessed panel lighting. In May 1918, the Hart-Albin Building was completed and opened for business at Broadway and Second Ave. North.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Homes and older commercial buildings in the way of the boom were quick to go. At the same time, desirable neighborhoods rose up on the edge of the expanding downtown. A stone mansion and carriage house (&quot;The Castle&quot;) built by Austin North in the 600 block of North 29th St. helped to set the pace in this fashionable northern part of town. On the western side of town, P.B. Moss built a red stone house on Division,&lt;ref name=&quot;mossmansion.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.mossmansion.com/ Welcome to the Historic Moss Mansion - About the Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; and I.D. O'Donnell built a large new home at First St. West and Clark St. in 1904.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Toward the end of the homestead boom, oil production began on the outskirts of town. The Elk Basin oil field on the Montana-Wyoming border was located in mid-1915, and by the following year, the first well near Billings was drilled. Soon the Montana-Wyoming Oil Journal was in print to report on the latest developments from the oil fields. Just 6 years later, natural gas was also discovered in the basin, and plans for a pipeline to the city were discussed. In the 1940s and 1950s, this industry helped pull Billings into a new era and became a lynchpin of the local economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

After [[World War II]], Billings boomed into the major financial, medical and cultural center of the region. Billings always experienced rapid growth from its founding, in its first 50 years growth was at times in the 300 and 400 percentile.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=T9HrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA311&amp;lpg=PA311&amp;dq=census+billings+montana+1900&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nbo9SdNvbB&amp;sig=yXIoRpGw-r6X29YPdRLOruUuFMM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xd53TaKbK4r1rAGp9f3WDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Billings's growth has remained robust throughout the years and at times almost unmanageable as in the 1950s when it had a growth rate of 66.0%. The [[1973 oil embargo]] by [[OPEC]] spurred an oil boom in eastern Montana, northern Wyoming and Western North Dakota. With this increase in oil production, Billings became the headquarters for energy sector companies. In 1975 and 1976, the [[Colstrip]] coal fire generation plants 1 and 2 were completed; plants 3 and 4 were operational in 1984 and 1986.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Billings saw major growth in its downtown core; the first high-rise buildings to be built in Montana were erected. In 1980, the 22-floor Sheraton Hotel was completed. At the time, it was the tallest building from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Seattle, Washington and from Denver, Colorado to Calgary, Alberta (Canada). Upon its completion it was also declared &quot;the tallest load-bearing brick masonry building in the world&quot; by the Brick Institute of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=sheratonbillingshotel-billings-mt-usa Crowne Plaza, Billings, U.S.A. &amp;#124; Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, Billings also saw the completion of other important buildings in its downtown core;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/wm/ci/bu/?id=102598 Buildings of Billings &amp;#124; Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the Norwest Building (now Wells Fargo), Granite Tower, Sage Tower the MetraPark arena, the TransWestern Center, many new city owned parking garages and the First Interstate Tower, now the tallest building in a five state area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;lng=3&amp;id=1interstatecenter-billings-mt-usa First Interstate Center, Billings, U.S.A. &amp;#124; Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the completion of large sections of the interstate system in Montana in the 1970s, Billings became an even bigger shopping destination for an ever increasingly larger area. The 1970s and 1980s saw new shopping districts and shopping centers developed in the Billings area. In addition to the other shopping centers developed, two new malls were developed and a third mall redeveloped and enlarged, Rimrock Mall on what was then the city's west end, Cross Roads Mall, ''no longer in existence,'' in Billings Heights, and West Park Plaza mall in midtown. In addition, several new business parks were developed on the city's west end during this period. Billings was affected by the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] in May; the city received about an inch of ash on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2000/fs036-00/ Mount St. Helens - From the 1980 Eruption to 2000, Fact Sheet 036-00]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]] blanketed Billings in smoke for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/yfire.html Yellowstone's Year Of Fire-1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, Billings saw further enlargement of its service sector with the arrival of new shopping centers built around stores such as Target, Wal Mart and Office Depot, all of which built multiple outlets in the Billings area. With the addition of more interchange exits along [[I-90]], even more hotel chains and service industry outlets are being built in Billings. Development of more business parks and large residential developments on the city's west end, South Hills area Lockwood and the Billings Heights were all part of the 1990s. Billings received the [[All-America City Award]] in 1992.

===21st century===

In the 21st century, Billings saw the development of operations centers in the city's business parks and downtown core by such national companies as GE, Wells Fargo and First Interstate Bank. It also saw renewed growth in the downtown core with the addition of numerous new buildings, new parking garages and a new MET Transit Center and in 2002 [[Skypoint]] was completed. Downtown also saw a renaissance of the historic areas within the downtown core as building after building was restored to its previous glory. In 2007, Billings was designated a [[Preserve America Community]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preserveamerica.gov/12-26-07PAcommunity-billingsMT.html Preserve America Community.]&lt;/ref&gt; With the completion of the Shiloh interchange exit off [[Interstate 90]], The TransTech  Center was developed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transtechcenter.com/ Transtech Center]&lt;/ref&gt; and yet more hotel development as well. In 2010 the Shiloh corridor was open for business with the completion of the Shiloh parkway, a {{convert|4.8|mi|km|adj=on}} multi-lane street with eight [[roundabouts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/government-and-politics/article_146041ab-beff-52c0-97a1-791734c50f36.html Shiloh Road open end to end]&lt;/ref&gt; Even more shopping centers were developed in the 21st century. Some of the new centers are Shiloh Crossing which brought the first [[Kohl's]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kohlscorporation.com/maps/SiteAdvantage/advantage.asp Kohl's Department Stores: Store Locator]&lt;/ref&gt; department store to Montana, Billings Town Square with Montana's first [[Cabela's]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabelas.com/retail-stores-billings.shtml Cabela's Billings, MT Store - 4550 King Avenue East - Billings, MT 59101 - Store Locations : Cabela]&lt;/ref&gt; and West Park Promenade, Montana's first open-air shopping mall.

On June 20, 2010 (Father's Day), a tornado, dubbed by the media the [[Fathers Day Tornado]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews1&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/21/national/main6602309.shtml Montana Tornado Rips Roof off Sports Arena - CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kulr1&quot;&gt;[http://www.kulr8.com/younews/96832384.html Last pics of Father's Day Tornado &amp;#124; KULR-8 News, Sports, Weather - Billings, Montana YouNewsâ¢]&lt;/ref&gt; touched down in the downtown core and Heights sections of Billings. The [[Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark]] and area businesses suffered major damage. While the nation has been feeling the effects of a recession, Billings's economy has been strong. Construction and housing starts have been up has well as large investments in the community by national companies and major new road construction projects. The state's economy is healthier than most states but as western Montana is suffering from a crash in real estate and the near demise of its timber industry, eastern Montana and North Dakota are experiencing an energy boom due to coal and the [[Bakken formation]]  the largest oil discovery in U.S. history.&lt;ref name=&quot;marketwire.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wallstreet-online.de&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2012poleshift.wetpaint.com&quot;/&gt; Billings is Montana's oasis of economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://billingsgazette.com/business/article_b322d771-a414-54b0-b344-009ca2993bb9.html Eastern part of state faring better economically]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is divided by the Rims, long cliffs, also called the [[Rimrocks]]. The Rims run to the north and east of the downtown core, separating it from the Heights to the north and Lockwood to the east, with the cliffs to the north being {{convert|500|ft|m}} tall and to the east of downtown, the face rises {{convert|800|ft|m}}. The [[Yellowstone River]] runs through the southeast portion of the city. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 33.8&amp;nbsp;square miles (87.6&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²), of which 33.7&amp;nbsp;square miles (87.3&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) is land and 0.1&amp;nbsp;square mile (0.3&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) (0.33%) is water.

==Climate==
Billings has a semi-arid climate ([[Koppen climate classification|Koppen]] ''BSk''),&lt;ref&gt;Peel, M. C., Finlayson, B. L., and McMahon, T. A.: [[Media:Americas Koppen Map.png|Updated world map of the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification]], Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 11, 1633-1644, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with hot summers, and cold, dry winters. In the summer, the temperature can rise to over {{convert|100|Â°F|0}} (1 to 3 times per year)&lt;ref name = &quot;NCDC Billings Airport&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NCDC Downtown Billings &quot; /&gt; while the winter can bring temperatures below zero (-17Â°C), with 17 to 18 such nights per year.&lt;ref name = &quot;NCDC Billings Airport&quot; /&gt; The snowfall averages about 57&amp;nbsp;inches a year, but because of warm [[Chinook winds]] that pass through the region between December and March, the snow does not usually accumulate heavily or remain on the ground for long. First frosts generally come early (late September to early October) and last frosts (late April to early May) late.&lt;ref name = &quot;NCDC Billings Airport&quot; /&gt; Spring and autumn in Billings are usually mild, but brief. Winds, while strong at times, are considered light compared with the rest of Montana and the Rocky Mountain front.

===Severe weather===
Although far from [[Tornado Alley]], Billings is not immune from severe weather, but tornadoes are very rare in Billings. In most cases, severe storms travel fast at 25 to 30 miles per hour and either veer to the north or south of the city. The first recorded tornado to touch down in Billings was on June 2, 1958. On June 20, 2010, a tornado dubbed the [[Fathers Day Tornado]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kulr1&quot;/&gt; touched down in the Billings Heights and Downtown sections of the city. The tornado was accompanied by hail up to golf ball size, dangerous cloud to ground lightning, and heavy winds. The tornado destroyed a number of businesses and severely damaged the 12,000-seat [[Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtstandard.com/news/state-and-regional/article_b8d6f6ec-7cc5-11df-886c-001cc4c002e0.html UPDATED: Tornado heavily damages MetraPark, Billings stores]&lt;/ref&gt;
