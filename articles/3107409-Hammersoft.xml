War crimes charges against him have been dismissed but may be refiled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo/detainees/682-ghassan-abdullah-al-sharbi Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi â The GuantÃ¡namo Docket â The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:48-tentcity.standalone.prod affiliate.56.JPG|thumb|The Bush Presidency plans to hold up to 80 of the new Congressionally authorized Military Commissions in a $12 million tent city.]]

Ghassan was born in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] but attended [[high school]] in the United States, and went on to study [[electrical engineering]] at [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in Arizona.&lt;ref name=&quot;the&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuters060427&gt;[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N27179388.htm Saudi man admits enemy role at Guantanamo hearing], ''[[Reuters]]'', April 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was captured by Pakistani forces during a raid at [[Faisalabad]], [[Pakistan]] in March 2002. He wasn't brought to Bahrain Airbase, as prisoner #237, for interrogation until June when he was chiefly interrogated by two soldiers romantically linked to each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;the&quot;&gt;Mackey, Chris. &quot;The Interrogators&quot;, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking fluent English, he appeared &quot;dismissive and aloof&quot;, and said that he was glad to see the Taliban ruling Afghanistan, quoting statistics that showed a dramatic decrease in [[crime rate]]s and new schools built under their government.&lt;ref name=&quot;the&quot; /&gt;

He asked the interrogations chief whether he had read anything by [[T. E. Lawrence]], or ''From Beirut to Jerusalem'', and later dismissed the interrogator's statement that he was a graduate of [[Fordham University]] by retorting that it was a &quot;third-tier school&quot;. He offered the names, addresses and phone numbers of several American classmates, professors and landlords he said would vouch for him having done nothing wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;the&quot; /&gt; The interrogator later remarked that al-Shirbi had a &quot;seeming preoccupation with death&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;the&quot; /&gt;

When it was arranged to transfer al-Shirbi to Guantanamo, he calmly told his interrogators that &quot;after a while, the truth would blur for him and that he would just say whatever we wanted to hear just to have the solitude that would come from the end of our questioning&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;the&quot; /&gt;

In testimony before the [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] in Guantanamo, he accepted the title &quot;[[enemy combatant]]&quot; as well as all 15 charges against him. Upon dismissal from the room, Ghassan chanted &quot;May God help me fight the infidels or the unfaithful ones.&quot;

On November 7, 2005, the [[United States]] charged Ghassan and four other detainees  They will face a trial before a military commission.  Ghassan, [[Jabran Said bin al Qahtani]], [[Binyam Ahmed Muhammad]], and [[Sufyian Barhoumi]] face conspiracy to murder charges.  [[Omar Khadr]] faces both murder and conspiracy to murder charges.

Al-Sharbi initially wanted to decline legal representation.&lt;ref name=BurlFP&gt;[http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060410/NEWS01/604100316/1009/NEWSWEEK Vermont lawyers represent Guantanamo detainees], ''[[Burlington Free Press]]'', April 13, 2006 {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His lawyer, [[Bob Rachlin]], is trying to arrange for Al-Sharbi to talk, by phone, with his parents, hoping they will be able to convince him to accept Rachlin's legal assistance.

On April 27, 2006 al Sharbi acknowledged membership in al Qaeda, and told his military commission:&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters060427&quot;/&gt;
* ''&quot;I came here to tell you I did what I did and I'm willing to pay the price&quot;
* ''&quot;Even if I spend hundreds of years in jail, that would be a matter of honor to me,&quot;
* ''&quot;I fought the United States, I'm going to make it short and easy for you guys: I'm proud of what I did.&quot;

On May 29, 2008
Ghassan Abdullah al-Sharbi,
Sufyian Barhoumi
and
Jabran al-Qathani
were charged before the Congressionally authorized military commissions.&lt;ref name=TheJurist20080530&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carol J. Williams]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that all five men had been connected by [[Abu Zubaydah]] -- one of the three captives the CIA has acknowledged was interrogated using the controversial technique known as &quot;[[waterboarding]]&quot;.

Williams quoted the men's attorneys, who anticipated the five men would be re-charged in thirty days.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes2008-10-21/&gt;
They told Williams that: ''&quot;... prosecutors called the move procedural&quot;,''
and attributed it to the resignation of fellow Prosecutor [[Darrel Vandeveld]], who resigned on ethical grounds.  Williams reported that [[Clive Stafford Smith]] speculated that the Prosecution's dropping of the charges, and plans to subsequently re-file charges later was intended to counter and disarm the testimony Vandeveld was anticipated to offer, that the Prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence.

==Sleep deprivation==

On August 7, 2008 the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that the Guantanamo guards defied their orders to discontinue the illegal practice of arbitrarily moving captives multiples times a day to deprive them of sleep.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost20080807&gt;

| accessdate=2008-08-07
| quote=Defense Department investigations of abuse had previously revealed that the program was used in a limited manner and only on high-value detainees, but the documents indicate that the program was far more widespread and that the technique was still used months after it was banned at the facility in March 2004. Detainees were moved dozens of times in just days and sometimes more than a hundred times over a two-week period.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The report stated
Ghassan Abdullah al-Sharbi was subjected to the [[Frequent flyer program (Guantanamo)|&quot;frequent flyer&quot;]]  program from November 2003 to February 2004.

[[Robert Rachlin]], one of his lawyers, stated:
{{quotation|
&quot;We have to assume that the frequent flyer program, what its details were, was not designed to strengthen the comfort and resolve of the prisoner. Sleep deprivation is coercive. Of course it troubles me.&quot;}}

==Dropped his habeas petition==

On March 10, 2009 [[US District Court Judge]] [[Emmet Sullivan]] dismissed a [[habeas corpus]] petition filed on Al Sharbi's behalf.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost2009-03-10&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Sullivan dismissed the petition, which had been initiated by Al Sharbi's father, at Al Sharbi's own request.  Al Sharbi's lawyer [[Robert Rachlin]] confirmed that Al Sharbi had consistently declined all assistance, and described him as &quot;an aspiring martyr&quot;.
