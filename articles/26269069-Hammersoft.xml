* On Day 5, Marion left the show because she didn't feel at ease in the house.
* On Day 10, La Voix (Big Brother) announced that Ahmed was to be ejected from the show. He was ejected due to his inappropriate behavior towards some of the housemates.
* AmÃ©lie discovered that Ahmed was an elected housemate. ChristmaÃ«lle correctly guessed that Julie was an elected housemate. Because of this, they were both allowed to enter the Main House.

=== Week 5 (August 07th to August 13th) ===
* The nominees this week were Alexandre and BenoÃ®t.

The red phone also gave ChrismaÃ«lle a &quot;double nomination&quot; for the following nominations, and presented Julie with a dilemma - if she was to leave the house, AmÃ©lie would receive immunity from future nominations. If she declined, AmÃ©lie would have to leave the house. Julie decided to leave the house. The phone also gave Maxime the chance to automatically nominate a female in the next nominations.
* After one week in the secret room, Anne-Krystel and Bastien moved back to the main house. La Voix revealed that Bastien would be automatically nominated for revealing his secret mission to Stephanie.

However, when the red phone to Julie offered to choose between leaving the game and provide immunity to Amelie or vice versa, Julie chose to leave the game Amelie is immune.
*Senna giving heavy clues about his secret AmÃ©lie, it is automatically nominated alongside Stephanie share the same secret. AmÃ©lie narrowly escapes the nomination thanks to his immunity.

The other is nominated by Benoit, Robin Thomas and unanimously choosing Anne-Krystel.
*Girls nominated alongside Bastien, Senna and Stephanie are Anne-Krystel and Shine. Shine is eliminated with 7% of the vote.

==Nominations==
Nominations follow a different formula than is typical of the Big Brother franchise. Each week the housemates alternate nominations: male housemates nominate female housemates one week, and female housemates nominate male housemates the following week. In some weeks housemates are only permitted to nominate one housemate, rather than the typical two; this, usually occurs when at least one housemate has been already nominated by La Voix (Big Brother).

&lt;small&gt;{{note|1|Note 1}}:  In round one of nominations, the Anti-Room housemates, AmÃ©lie, Maxime and Chrismaelle, were exempt from nominations. With this exemption, they were given a mission to uncover &quot;The Elected&quot; (Ahmed, Anne-Krystel, and Julie). Should they pass their mission, all three Anti-Room housemates will enter the main house on day 10 and &quot;The Elected&quot; housemates will be evicted. Should they fail their mission, all three Anti-Room housemates will be evicted.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|2|Note 2}}:  Initially in round one of nominations, only female housemates living in the actual house were going to nominate and only male housemates living in the actual house could be nominated. However, Robin revealed his secret. Following this, Big Brother announced to the housemates that Robin and Benoit were nominated for eviction and that the viewers were voting to save or evict them as a pair. If Robin had not revealed his secret, the nominees would have been Antony and Ahmed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|3|Note 3}}:  Before the second round of nominations, the housemates living in the main house had to vote for which of the Anti-Room housemates they wanted to save from nomination. The housemates chose to save Maxime meaning that Julie was nominated for eviction.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|4|Note 4}}:  In round two of nominations, only the female housemates were allowed to nominate and only the male housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|5|Note 5}}:  In round three of nominations, each housemate was asked to nominate one housemate of the opposite gender for eviction.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|6|Note 6}}:  In round four of nominations, Maxime was automatically nominated for eviction by Big Brother for revealing his secret.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|7|Note 7}}:  In round four of nominations, only male housemates were allowed to nominate and only female housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|8|Note 8}}: Originally, Julie and Anne-Krystel received the most nominations and were to face eviction with Maxime. However, Coralie revealed clues to her secret and was therefore nominated with Maxime and Julie, who received the most nominations.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|9|Note 9}}:  In round five of nominations, only the female housemates were allowed to nominate and only the male housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|10|Note 10}}:  In round five of nominations, Senna was exempt and could not be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|11|Note 11}}:  During the fifth round of nominations, Anne-Krystel and Bastien were both in the Secret room and could not nominate or be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|12|Note 12}}: In round six of nominations, Bastien and Senna were automatically nominated for eviction for revealing their secrets.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|13|Note 13}}:  In round six of nominations, only male housemates were allowed to nominate and only female housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|14|Note 14}}:  In round seven of nominations, only the female housemates were allowed to nominate and only the male housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|15|Note 15}}:  In round seven of nominations, Senna had the power to remove one housemate from the nominations list and replace them with another. He chose to save himself and nominate Robin in his place.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|16|Note 16}}:  In round eight of nominations, Senna was automatically nominated for eviction and was the only housemate permitted to nominate.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|17|Note 17}}:  In round eight of nominations, Senna was automatically nominated for eviction and was the only housemate permitted to nominate.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|18|Note 18}}:  In round eight of nominations, ChrismaÃ«lle, as well as all male housemates apart from Senna, was exempt from nominations.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|19|Note 19}}:  In round nine of nominations, all housemates had to nominate four of their fellow housemates to face eviction.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|20|Note 20}}:  In round ten of nominations, only female housemates could nominate and only male housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|21|Note 21}}:  In round ten of nominations, ChrismaÃ«lle and Thomas both chose to be automatically nominated in order to see their significant others.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|22|Note 22}}:  During round eleven of nominations, Bastien revealed his secret and was therefore automatically nominated for eviction by himself.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|23|Note 23}}:  In round twelve of nominations, only male housemates could nominate and only female housemates could be nominated.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|24|Note 24}}:  During round twelve of nominations, Benoit was in the Red room after having been fake evicted by Bastien.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|25|Note 25}}:  In round thirteen of nominations, the housemates were initially going to nominate in pairs, however, because Benoit revealed Anne-Krystel's secret she was given an exemption while all other housemates were automatically nominated for eviction.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|26|Note 26}}: Bastien having a place in finale acquired, he is the only one not to be to nominate.&lt;/small&gt;
