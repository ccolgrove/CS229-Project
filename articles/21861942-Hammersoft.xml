==Personal life and family==
He was born in [[New York City]] on March 29, 1871 as '''Isaac Irving Brokaw''' to Isaac Vail Brokaw and Elvira Tuttle Gould. He was a member of a wealthy New York City family, his father having founded the [[Brokaw Brothers]] men's clothing stores. His brothers were lawyer and sportsman [[George Tuttle Brokaw]] (whose first wife was Clare Booth, later Luce), Howard Crosby Brokaw, and Frederick Brokaw, who drowned at Elberon, New Jersey, while a student at Princeton. Noted cousins included sportsmen [[William Gould Brokaw]] and Clifford Vail Brokaw, their sisters Florence Brokaw, of Martin Hall, (Mrs. James E. Martin, later Mrs. Preston Pope Satterwhite) and Lilla Brokaw (Mrs. H. Bramhall Gilbert, later Mrs. Cyril Patrick William Francis Radclyffe Dugmore).

On February 4, 1903, Brokaw married Lucile Nave in St. Joseph. Her family co-owned the [[Nave &amp; McCord Mercantile Company]], a chain of wholesale stores in the Midwest. They had three daughters:
*Barbara (Mrs. Leonard Jarvis Cushing)
*Louise, aka Mimi (Mrs. Richard Derby Tucker)
*Lucile (Mrs. James Duane Pell Bishop and later Mrs Rombout van Riemsdyk). She became an artist.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070947/2/index.htm#ixzz18YzkY0Xj] Lucile Brokaw was the model for what is considered the first &quot;action&quot; fashion photograph, taken by [[Martin Munkacsi]] and published in [[Harper's Bazaar]] in 1933. In it she appears running down a beach.[http://store.metmuseum.org/posters+prints/martin-munkacsi-lucile-brokaw-piping-rock-beach-long-island-exhibition-poster/invt/80007346/?temp=enlarged&amp;layout=empty]

Irving Brokaw died March 19, 1939, in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]].

==Career==
As a figure skater, Brokaw competed in early national championships in the United States that predated the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] and won the events in 1906 and 1908. He competed at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in figure skating, where he [[figure skating at the 1908 Summer Olympics|placed 6th]]. The 1908 Olympics were the first Games in which figure skating was contested. Brokaw became the first American to compete in skating, and by extension any Winter Olympic sport, at the Olympic Games.

He was later elected as an honorary president of the [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]], and made large contributions to skating techniques. 

Brokaw graduated from New York Law School and 1907, but never practiced law as a profession. He was also a well-known artist, and a member of The Salons of America, an art society, and also of the Huguenot Society. 

In the 1910, Brokaw wrote the book &quot;The Art of Skating&quot;, which was referred to as the &quot;figure skater's bible&quot; by [[Time Magazine]]. In 1976, he was posthumously inducted into the [[United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame]].
