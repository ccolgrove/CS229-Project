'''FreeCreditScore.com''' and '''FreeCreditReport.com''' are websites owned by Experian Consumer Direct, a subsidiary of the credit bureau [[Experian]]. The sites offer users their personal [[Credit history|credit reports]] from Experian on the condition that they sign up for Experian's Triple Advantage [[credit monitoring]] program for a fee. The credit report also comes with the user's [[PLUS]] [[Credit score (United States)|credit score]]. The membership may be canceled with no charge within 7 days of signup.

The sites, their benefactors, and related business entities have received multiple federal injunctions on deceptive marketing and business practices.&lt;ref name=FTCvECD&gt;http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0223263/0223263.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abusive practices==
FreeCreditReport.com has been the subject of two major lawsuits. In 2005, the site's owner, Experian Consumer Direct, was sued by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for deceptive marketing tactics.  They settled for $950,000 in the form of free credit monitoring for those affected and agreed not to use deceptive and misleading claims about free offers and to offer full disclosure of terms and conditions of any free offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/08/consumerinfo.shtm|title=Marketer of &quot;Free Credit Reports&quot; Settles FTC Charges|date=2005-08-16|accessdate=2009-06-06|work=[[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/ftc_consumerinfo.html|title=Marketer of &quot;Free Credit Reports&quot; Settles FTC Charges|date=2005-08-16|accessdate=2008-03-27|work=Consumer Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The penalty was largely seen as ineffective since it amounted to a small fraction of the $72 million dollar annual advertising budget for free credit report. They were further subjected to a 2006 inquiry by the [[Florida]] [[Attorney General]] for violating [[Florida]]'s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://redtape.msnbc.com/2006/11/florida_ag_inve.html|title=Florida AG investigates FreeCreditReport.com|first=Bob|last=Sullivan|date=2006-11-15|accessdate=2008-03-27|work=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[MSNBC.com]] investigation of the website called it &quot;misleading&quot;, &quot;deceptive&quot; and a &quot;scam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://redtape.msnbc.com/2006/09/dont_fall_for_f.html|title=Don't fall for FreeCreditReport.com|date=2006-09-12|accessdate=2008-03-27|first=Bob|last=Sullivan|work=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has also been identified as a [[scam]] by ConsumerFraudReporting.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.consumerfraudreporting.org/freecreditreportdotcom.php|title=FreeCreditReports.com Scam at ConsumerFraudReporting.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/your-money/credit-scores/03scores.html &quot;A Free Credit Score Followed by a Monthly Bill&quot;] article by [[Ron Lieber]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''  November 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising practices of FreeCreditReport.com were specifically addressed in the [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]].  Now any company who advertises a 'free credit report' on TV or radio must include the statement: &quot;This is not the free credit report provided for by Federal law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://allbusiness.sfgate.com/economy-economic-indicators/economic-indicators/12345170-1.html | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Small Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasfaa.org/publications/2009/gccbill052109.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CARDAct&quot;&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-627]&lt;/ref&gt; The law also calls for the Federal Trade Commission to issue new rules that will force free credit report advertisers to inform consumers that the only place for a free credit report is [[AnnualCreditReport.com]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CARDAct&quot;/&gt;

==Advertising==
===Singing ad campaign===
In October 2007,&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2008-04-13-ad-track_N.htm|title=Ad Track: Starbucks splash stick says no to sploshing|publisher=USA Today|pages=2B|accessdate=2009-06-12|date=2008-04-13|last=Petrecca|first=Laura|coauthors=Theresa Howard and Bruce Horovitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experian Consumer Direct began airing an [[advertising]] campaign featuring singer Eric Violette as a man struggling with difficult life circumstances due to his poor credit score, and his ignorance of it. The commercials feature jingles written using various distinctive forms of popular music. To date the company has aired nine different commercials, which have aired in different orders in different markets. The commercials featuring Violette and his band stopped airing in February 2010 to focus advertising on FreeCreditScore.com and a new band.

The themes/motifs of the commercials include, in order:

* Pirate-themed restaurant
* Living with in-laws
* Country Western stage show
* Renaissance Fair
* Used car
* Bicycle riding
* Hip-hop pool party
* Roller Coaster
* Small town / cell phone shop
* Country Bar in Reno

Most feature references to the original &quot;Pirate&quot; commercial; either lyrically, or by including it as part of the background.

Violette was born June 12, 1981 in [[Montreal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahalo.com/Eric_Violette Eric Violette - Mahalo.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and attended the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericviolette.com/home.php# ericviolette.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The commercials prepared by David Muhlenfeld &amp; Shakur Green at the [[The Martin Agency]] began appearing in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.richmond.com/content/2008/aug/27/i-could-have-seen-this-coming-at-me-like-an-atom-b/]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Violette's [[Canadian French]] accent, his voice has been dubbed in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mahalo.com/Eric_Violette Eric Violette - Mahalo.com&lt;/ref&gt; He earlier did a [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] commercial in French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQMt7fcqLD8 Youtube Sirius Commercial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|id=3082393|name=Eric Violette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his character by the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Violette said that &quot;He's a guy who has a lot of dreams and hopes. But he's not able to make them concrete because I think he's a little bit lazy. He's the kind of guy who always has bad luck . . . but I'm sure he has a good heart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The commercials have spawned various homages including many parodies on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/business/media/04adco.html The High Cost of a âFree Credit Reportâ New York Times - August 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[MADtv]]'' parodied the ads in a sketch that featured a young man cursed by bad luck after getting a credit card his senior year of high school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuKYP2cBvBA&lt;/ref&gt; After racking up $80,000 in debt, he ends up in jail, escapes and eventually winds up living with a skinhead named Fang &quot;in a soggy cardboard box&quot;. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] produced two public service announcements parodying the commercials to remind citizens of the right to annual [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act|free credit reports]] from [[annualcreditreport.com]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/impressions/2009/04/07/credit-crunch?page=0,1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freecreditscore Band Campaign===
In May 2010 a nationwide band search began to find the new face of freecreditscore.com. Live auditions were held in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Bands could also submit videos of themselves online at freecreditscoreband.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freecreditscoreband.com/&lt;/ref&gt; for consideration.  Many were typical entries, but some bands, apparently as a joke, submitting videos as well, most notably [[Comparative Anatomy (band)]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlkCgitUt0U&lt;/ref&gt;. In August 2010 [[The Victorious Secrets]]&lt;ref&gt;http://freecreditscoreband.com/&lt;/ref&gt; were named the new FCS Band.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/features/the-victorious-secrets-named-new-freecreditscore-1004109237.story#/features/the-victorious-secrets-named-new-freecreditscore-1004109237.story&lt;/ref&gt;
