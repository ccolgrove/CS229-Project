Egypt is thus a [[transcontinental country]], and a major power in [[Africa]], the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[Middle East]] and the [[Muslim world]]. Covering an area of about {{convert|1010000|km2|sp=us}}, Egypt is bordered by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the north, the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]] to the northeast, the [[Red Sea]] to the east, [[Sudan]] to the south and [[Libya]] to the west.

The large areas of the [[Sahara]] Desert are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]] and other major cities in the [[Nile Delta]].

Monuments in Egypt such as the [[Giza pyramid complex]] and its [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]] were constructed by its [[Ancient Egypt|ancient civilization]]. Its ancient ruins, such as those of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Karnak]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]] outside [[Luxor]], are a significant focus of archaeological study. The [[tourism in Egypt|tourism]] industry and the [[Red Sea Riviera]] employ about 12% of Egypt's workforce.

The [[economy of Egypt]] is one of the most diversified in the Middle East, with sectors such as tourism, agriculture, industry and service at almost equal production levels.

In early 2011, Egypt [[2011 Egyptian revolution|underwent a revolution]], which resulted in the ousting of President [[Hosni Mubarak]] after nearly 30 years in power.

{{main|Prehistoric Egypt}}
There is evidence of [[rock carvings]] along the [[Nile]] terraces and in desert oases. In the [[10th millennium BC]], a culture of [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[fishing|fishers]] replaced a [[cereal|grain]]-grinding [[culture]]{{fact|date=November 2011}}. Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 8000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, forming the [[Sahara]]. Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural [[Economic system|economy]] and more centralized [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;Midant-Reynes, BÃ©atrix. ''The Prehistory of Egypt: From the First Egyptians to the First Kings''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Badarian]] culture and the successor [[Naqada]] series are generally regarded as precursors to [[Ancient Egypt|dynastic Egypt]]. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphic]] inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on [[Naqada]] III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Kathryn A.

A unified kingdom was founded c. 3150 BC by King [[Menes]], leading to a [[List of Egyptian dynasties|series of dynasties]] that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], [[Art of Ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs. The [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|first two ruling dynasties]] of a unified Egypt set the stage for the [[Old Kingdom]] period, ''c''. 2700â2200 BC., which constructed many [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], most notably the [[Third dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] [[pyramid of Djoser]] and the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza Pyramids]].

A [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|second period of disunity]] heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the [[Semitic]] [[Hyksos]]. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC and founded a new capital at [[Avaris]]. They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by [[Ahmose I]], who founded the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and relocated the capital from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].

The [[New Kingdom]] ''c''. 1550â1070 BC began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an [[Power in international relations|international power]] that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as [[Tombos]] in [[Nubia]], and included parts of the [[Levant]] in the east. This period is noted for some of the most well known [[Pharaoh]]s, including [[Hatshepsut]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Akhenaten]] and his wife [[Nefertiti]], [[Tutankhamun]] and [[Ramesses II]]. The first historically attested expression of [[monotheism]] came during this period as [[Atenism]]. Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom. The country was later invaded and conquered by [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], [[Kingdom of Kush|Nubians]] and [[Assyria]]ns, but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] was a powerful [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] state, extending from southern [[Syria]] in the east, to [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] to the west, and south to the frontier with [[Nubia]]. [[Alexandria]] became the capital city and a center of [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] culture and trade. To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace, they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs. The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions, had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress, and participated in Egyptian religious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bowman | first = Alan K | title= Egypt after the Pharaohs 332 BC â AD 642 | publisher=[[University of California Press]] | location=Berkeley | year=1996 | edition=2nd | pages=25â26 | isbn=0520205316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stanwick | first = Paul Edmond | title= Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek kings as Egyptian pharaohs | publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] | location=Austin | year=2003 | isbn=0292777728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last ruler from the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] line was [[Cleopatra VII]], who committed suicide with her lover [[Mark Antony]], after [[Caesar Augustus]] had captured them.
The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians often caused by an unwanted regime and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome. Nevertheless [[Hellenistic culture]] continued to thrive in Egypt well after the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Muslim conquest]].

Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the 1st century. [[Diocletian]]'s reign marked the transition from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The [[New Testament]] had by then been translated into Egyptian. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, a distinct [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]] was firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, Jill.

The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief [[Aegyptus (Roman province)#Persian and Arab conquests|Persian]] invasion early in the 7th century, until in AD 639, Egypt was [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|absorbed into the Islamic Empire]] by the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]]. When they defeated the Byzantine Armies in Egypt, the Arabs brought [[Sunni Islam]] to the country. Early in this period, Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices, leading to various [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders that have flourished to this day. These earlier rites had survived the period of [[Coptic Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim rulers nominated by the [[Caliphate|Islamic Caliphate]] remained in [[History of Arab Egypt|control of Egypt]] for the next six centuries, with [[Cairo]] as the seat of the Caliphate under the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]]. With the end of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[Ayyubid dynasty]], the [[Mamluk]]s, a [[Turkic people|Turco]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]] military caste, took control about AD 1250.

The brief [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]] led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] began in 1798. The expulsion of the French in 1801 by [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]], [[Mamluk]], and [[British people|British]] forces was followed by four years of anarchy in which Ottomans, Mamluks, and [[Albanians]] -- who were nominally in the service of the Ottomans -- wrestled for power. Out of this chaos, the commander of the Albanian regiment, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] ([[Kavalali Mehmed Ali Pasha]]) emerged as a dominant figure and in 1805 was acknowledged by the [[Sultan]] in [[Istanbul]] as his [[viceroy]] in Egypt; &lt;!--[[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power]] --&gt;the title implied subordination to the [[Sultan]] but this was in fact a polite fiction: Ottoman power in Egypt was finished and Muhammad Ali, an ambitious and able leader, established a [[dynasty]] that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of 1952. In later years, the dynasty became a British puppet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin 1973, p 2&quot;&gt;Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin, ''Nasser of the Arabs'', published ''circa'' 1973, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

His primary focus was military: he annexed [[Northern Sudan]] (1820â1824), [[Syria]] (1833), and parts of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and [[Anatolia]]; but in 1841 the European powers, fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself, forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans, but he kept the Sudan and his title to Egypt was made hereditary. A more lasting result of his military ambition is that it required him to modernize the country. Eager to adopt the military (and therefore industrial) techniques of the great powers, he sent students to the West and invited training missions to Egypt. He built industries, a system of canals for irrigation and transport, and reformed the [[civil service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin 1973, p 2&quot;/&gt;

The introduction in 1820 of long-staple [[cotton]], the Egyptian variety of which became notable, transformed its agriculture into a cash-crop [[monoculture]] before the end of the century. The social effects of this were enormous: land ownership became concentrated and many foreigners arrived, shifting production towards international markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin 1973, p 2&quot;/&gt;

===British colony===
{{main|History of modern Egypt}}
British rule lasted from 1882 when the British succeeded in defeating the Egyptian Army [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|at Tel El Kebir]] in September and took control of the country, to the [[1952 Egyptian revolution]] which made Egypt a republic and when British advisers were expelled.

Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim]] (in September 1848), then by a grandson [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] (in November 1848), then by [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said]] (in 1854), and [[Isma'il Pasha|Isma'il]] (in 1863).
&lt;!--In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the Government. Members of the Assembly were elected from across Egypt and came to have an important influence on Government decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, James. ''Egypt: A Short History.'' Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2000. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; That's hogwash, the assembly had almost no power and rarely met--&gt;
Abbas I was cautious. Said and Ismail were ambitious developers, but they spent beyond their means. The [[Suez Canal]], built in partnership with the French, was completed in 1869. The cost of this and other projects had two effects: it led to enormous debt to European [[bank]]s, and caused popular discontent because of the onerous [[tax]]ation it required. In 1875 Ismail was forced to sell Egypt's share in the canal to the British Government. Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French [[Dual control|controllers]] who sat in the Egyptian cabinet, and, &quot;with the financial power of the bondholders behind them, were the real power in the Government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nejla M. Abu Izzeddin, ''Nasser of the Arabs&quot;, p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Local dissatisfaction with Ismail and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in 1879, with [[Ahmad Urabi]] a prominent figure. In 1882 he became head of a nationalist-dominated ministry committed to democratic reforms including parliamentary control of the budget. Fearing a reduction of their control, the UK and France intervened militarily, bombarding Alexandria and crushing the Egyptian army at the [[battle of Tel el-Kebir]].&lt;ref&gt;Anglo French motivation: Derek Hopwood, ''Egypt: Politics and Society 1945â1981''. London, 1982, George Allen &amp; Unwin. p 11.&lt;/ref&gt; They reinstalled Ismail's son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tewfik]] as figurehead of a ''de facto'' British protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;De facto protectorate: Joan Wucher King, ''Historical Dictionary of Egypt''. Metuchen, New Jersey, USA; 1984; Scarecrow. p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cairo-Demonstrations1919.jpg|thumb|upright|Female nationalists demonstrating in [[Cairo]], 1919]]
In 1914 the Protectorate was made official, and the title of the head of state, which had changed from ''pasha'' to ''[[Khedivate of Egypt|khedive]]'' in 1867, was changed to ''[[Sultanate of Egypt|sultan]]'', to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan, who was backing the [[Central powers]] in [[World War I]]. [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]] was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]], as sultan.&lt;ref&gt;James Jankowski, ''Egypt, A Short History'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the [[Dinshaway Incident]] prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement. After the First World War, [[Saad Zaghlul]] and the [[Wafd Party]] led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local [[Legislative Assembly]]. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to [[Malta]] on 8 March 1919, the country arose in its [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. The revolt led the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916â1922)|UK government]] to issue a [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|unilateral declaration of Egypt's independence]] on 22 February 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, ''op cit''., p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kingdom====
{{main|Kingdom of Egypt}}
The new government drafted and implemented a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] in 1923 based on a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] system. [[Saad Zaghlul]] was popularly elected as [[Prime Minister of Egypt]] in 1924. In 1936 the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military ''[[coup d'Ã©tat]]'' known as the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]]. The [[Free Officers Movement]] forced King [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] to abdicate in support of his son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad]].
British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954.&lt;ref name=factbook-history&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|work=CIA- The World Factbook|accessdate=2 February 2011|quote= Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the British-backed monarchy in 1952.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic===
On 18 June 1953, the Egyptian Republic was declared, with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]{{ndash}} the real architect of the 1952 movement{{ndash}} and was later put under [[house arrest]]. Nasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President in June, 1956. British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on 13 June 1956. He [[nationalization|nationalized]] the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956, prompting the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].

In the 1967 [[Six Day War]], Israel invaded and occupied Egypt's [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Gaza Strip]], which Egypt had occupied since the [[1948 ArabâIsraeli War]].  Three years later President Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1970. Sadat switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972. He launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy, while clamping down on religious and secular opposition.

In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]], a surprise attack against the Israeli forces occupying the Sinai Peninsula and the [[Golan Heights]]. It was an attempt to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier. Sadat hoped to seize some territory through military force, and then regain the rest of the peninsula by diplomacy. The conflict sparked an international crisis between the US and the USSR, both of whom intervened. The second UN-mandated ceasefire halted military action. While the war ended with a military stalemate, it presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai in return for peace with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The 1973 Arab-Israeli War: Arab Policies, Strategies, and Campaigns | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1997/Jordan.htm | author=[[USMC]] Major Michael C. Jordan | publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | year=1997 | accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in 1977, which led to the 1979 [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty|peace treaty]] in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat's initiative sparked enormous controversy in the [[Arab world]] and led to Egypt's expulsion from the [[Arab League]], but it was supported by most Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vatikiotis|p=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamentalist military soldier assassinated Sadat in Cairo in 1981. He was succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].

In 2003, the [[Kefaya|Egyptian Movement for Change]], popularly known as ''Kefaya'', was launched to oppose the Mubarak regime and to establish [[democracy|democratic]] reforms and greater [[civil liberties]].

===2011 revolution===
{{main|2011 Egyptian revolution}}
[[File:Tahrir Square on February11.png|thumb|Celebrations in [[Tahrir Square]] after [[Omar Suleiman]]'s statement announcing [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s resignation]]

On 25 January 2011, widespread protests began against Mubarak's regime. The objective of the protest was the removal of Mubarak from power. These took the form of an intensive campaign of [[civil resistance]] supported by a very large number of people and mainly consisting of continuous mass demonstrations. By 29 January it was becoming clear that Mubarak's regime had lost control when a curfew order was ignored, and the army took a semi-neutral stance on enforcing the curfew decree. Some protesters, a very small minority in Cairo, expressed nationalistic views against what they deemed was foreign interference, highlighted by the then-held view that the U.S. administration had failed to take sides, as well as linking the regime with Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;mubarak_israel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newshopper.sulekha.com/malaysia-egypt-protest_photo_1689167.htm|title=Malaysia Egypt Protest Pictures &amp; Photos|date=31 January 2011|publisher=AP Photo/Lai Seng Sin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2011, Mubarak resigned and fled Cairo. Vice President [[Omar Suleiman]] announced that Mubarak had stepped down and that the [[Egyptian military]] would assume control of the nation's affairs in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

As a result of their conditional independence from Great Britain in 1922, the Egyptian royal family issued a Royal Decree establishing a national flag.  This first flag was a major step for Egypt, and its colors were green with a white crescent and three stars in the middle.


The next version of the flag was established in 1958 by Presidential Decree, to incorporate aspects of Syria and Egypt, since they were merged into one country, the United Arab Republic.  This new flag had three colors: red, white with two green stars, and black. The rectangular flag had a width of 1/3 the size of its length.


The flag was changed once again in 1972, with an amendment to the law.  This new flag had the stars removed, and replaced with a golden hawk.  The hawk was replaced in 1984 by the golden eagle of [[Saladin|Salah El Dine]], the Ayubbid Sultan of the [[Crusades]] who ruled Egypt and Syria in the 12th century. This flag still waves over Egypt today.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/aboute.htm |title=About Egypt, An Overview of Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, due to the aridity of Egypt's climate, population centres are concentrated along the narrow Nile Valley and Delta, meaning that about 99% of the population uses only about 5.5% of the total land area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iodeweb1.vliz.be/odin/bitstream/1834/383/1/Hamza.pdf |title=Land use and Coastal Management in the Third Countries: Egypt as a case |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Egypt is bordered by Libya to the west, Sudan to the south, and by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the east. Egypt's important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a [[transcontinental nation]], it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between Africa and Asia, traversed by a navigable waterway (the [[Suez Canal]]) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean by way of the Red Sea.

Apart from the Nile Valley, the majority of Egypt's landscape is desert. Winds create prolific [[Dune|sand dunes]] that peak at more than {{convert|100|ft}} high. Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara Desert]] and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts that protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats were referred to as the &quot;red land&quot; in ancient Egypt.

Towns and cities include [[Alexandria]], the second largest city; [[Aswan]]; [[Asyut]]; [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital and largest city; [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]]; [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu; [[Hurghada]]; [[Luxor]]; [[Kom Ombo]]; [[Port Safaga]]; [[Port Said]]; [[Sharm el Sheikh]]; [[Suez]], where the Suez Canal is located; [[Zagazig]]; and [[Minya, Egypt|Al-Minya]]. [[Oasis|Oases]] include [[Bahariya Oasis|Bahariya]], [[Dakhla Oasis|el Dakhla]], [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]], [[Kharga Oasis|el Kharga]] and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]. [[Protectorates]] include Ras Mohamed National Park, Zaranik Protectorate and Siwa.

Most of Egypt's rain falls in the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;Soliman, KH. ''Rainfall over Egypt''. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, vol. 80, issue 343, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; South of Cairo, rainfall averages only around {{convert|2|to|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year and at intervals of many years.

[[Snow]] falls on Sinai's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as Damietta, Baltim, Sidi Barrany, etc. and rarely in Alexandria. [[Frost]] is also known in mid-Sinai and mid-Egypt.

Temperatures average between {{convert|80|F}} and {{convert|90|F}} in summer, and up to {{convert|109|F}} on the Red Sea coast. Winter temperatures average between {{convert|55|F}} and {{convert|70|F}}. A steady wind from the northwest helps lower temperatures near the Mediterranean coast. The [[Khamaseen]] is a wind that blows from the south in spring, bringing sand and dust, and sometimes raises the temperature in the desert to more than {{convert|100|F}}.

Prior to the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], the Nile flooded annually (colloquially ''The Gift of the Nile'') replenishing Egypt's soil. This gave the country consistent harvest throughout the years.

The potential rise in sea levels due to [[global warming]] could threaten Egypt's densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country's economy, agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures, a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into [[environmental refugees]] by the end of the century, according to some climate experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77240 |title=Contingency planning for rising sea levels in Egypt &amp;#124; IRIN News, March 2008 |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Egypt}}

Egypt has been officially named a &quot;[[Republic]]&quot; since 18 June 1953. However, it has been under [[Emergency law in Egypt|Emergency Law]] continually since 1967 (with the exception of an 18-month break in 1980).&lt;ref name=fidh&gt;{{cite web|title=The Emergency Law in Egypt|url=http://www.fidh.org/THE-EMERGENCY-LAW-IN-EGYPT|work=International Federation for Human Rights|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=1 year â  18 months â did it start in 1979 or continue into 1981?|date=January 2011}}
Between 1981 and 2011, Egypt was ruled [[autocrat]]ically by [[Hosni Mubarak|Mohamed Hosni Mubarak]], who came to power after the assassination of President [[Anwar Sadat|Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cambanis |first=Thanassis |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=global-home |title=Succession Gives Army a Stiff Test in Egypt |location=Egypt |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Heads of government of Egypt|Prime Minister]] [[Ahmed Shafik]] was sworn in as Prime Minister on 29 January 2011, following the resignation of [[Ahmed Nazif]]. Since President Mubarak's resignation during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|2011 revolution]], Egypt's de facto government has been the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], chaired by [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]].

Although power is nominally organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], whereby the executive power is theoretically divided between the President and the [[Prime Minister of Egypt|Prime Minister]], in practice it has rested almost solely with the President who traditionally has been elected in single-candidate elections for more than fifty years. Egypt has also held regular multi-party parliamentary elections. The last presidential election, in which Mubarak won a fifth consecutive term, [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|was held in September 2005]]. In 2009, Dr. [[Ali El Deen Hilal Dessouki]], Media Secretary of the NDP, described Egypt as a &quot;[[pharaonic]]&quot; political system, and democracy as a &quot;long term goal&quot;. Dessouki also stated that &quot;the real center of power in Egypt is the military&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;09CAIRO1468&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/07/09CAIRO1468.html|title=NDP Insider: Military will ensure transfer of power|date=30 July 2009|publisher=US Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late February 2005, Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country's presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls in the upcoming presidential election. For the first time since the [[Free Officers Movement|1952 movement]], the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. The President said his initiative came &quot;out of my full conviction of the need to consolidate efforts for more freedom and democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Business Today Egypt.

Most Egyptians were skeptical about the process of [[democratization]] and the intent of the election rules. Less than 25% of the country's 32 million registered voters (out of a population of more than 72 million) turned out for the 2005 elections.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, Edward M.

Thirty-four constitutional changes voted on by parliament on 19 March 2007 prohibit parties from using religion as a basis for political activity, allow the drafting of a new anti-terrorism law to replace the emergency legislation in place since 1981, authorize broad police powers of arrest and surveillance, give the president power to dissolve parliament and end judicial election monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6472031.stm |title=Anger over Egypt vote timetable |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition members of parliament abstained from voting on the proposed changes. Only 27% of registered voters turned out under heavy police presence and tight political control. It was officially announced on 27 March 2007 that 75.9% of those who participated in the referendum approved the [[constitutional amendment]]s. The results were endorsed by the rump parliament, thus allowing the introduction of laws that curb the activity of opposition elements, particularly Islamists.

The Egyptian military receives billions of dollars of aid from the United States. It remains Egypt's most powerful institution. It has dozens of factories manufacturing weapons as well as consumer goods, and it exempts itself from laws that apply to other sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[CIA World Factbook]] states that the legal system is based on [[Sharia law|Islamic]] and civil law (particularly [[Napoleonic code]]s); and that judicial review takes place by a Supreme Court, which accepts compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction only with reservations.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|work=CIA- The World Factbook|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Egypt}}
[[File:G8 italy 2009.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] in the [[G8]] Summit in [[Italy]] 2009]]
Egypt's foreign policy is supported by its [[population size]], historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position. It has extensive political influence in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. [[Cairo]] has been a crossroads of regional commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and Islamic institutions are at the center of the region's social and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural development]].

The permanent [[Headquarters of the Arab League]] are located in Cairo and the Secretary General of the Arab League has traditionally been Egyptian. Former Foreign Minister [[Amr Moussa]] is the current group's Secretary General. The Arab League briefly moved from Egypt to [[Tunis]] in 1978 to protest the [[Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty]], returning in 1989.

Egypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, with the signing of the treaty. Despite the peace treaty, Israel is still largely considered an enemy country within Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Massive Israel protests hit universities&quot; (Egyptian Mail, 16 March 2010) &quot;According to most Egyptians, almost 31 years after a peace treaty was signed between Egypt and Israel, having normal ties between the two countries is still a potent accusation and Israel is largely considered to be an enemy country&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab states, and in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestinian dispute]]. Egypt is a [[Major non-NATO ally|major ally]] of the United States.

Former Egyptian [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] served as [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from 1991 to 1996.

In the 21st century, Egypt has had a major problem with immigration, as millions of Africans flee poverty and war. Border control methods can be &quot;harsh, sometimes lethal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Desperate on the Border, ALASDAIR SOUSSI, Jerusalem Report, 9 Nov. 1953, [http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1225910074439&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian military has recently undergone massive modernization, mostly in its Air Force. Egypt is speculated by Israel to be the second country in the region with a [[spy satellite]], [[EgyptSat 1]], and is planning to launch 3 more satellites (DesertSat1, EgyptSat2 &amp; DesertSat2) over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Yaacov. &quot;Egypt to launch first spy satellite&quot;, [[Jerusalem Post]], 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Governorates of Egypt|Regions of Egypt}}
{{Egypt Governorates Map|thumb|float=left}}
Egypt is divided into 27 [[Governorates of Egypt|governorates]]. The governorates are further divided into [[Regions of Egypt|regions]]. The regions contain towns and villages. Each governorate has a capital, sometimes carrying the same name as the governorate.

In April 2008, Cairo and Giza were subdivided into 4 governorates, namely the governorates of Cairo, Giza, 6 October and Helwan. As of April 2011, 6 October and Helwan governorates were again incorporated into Giza and Cairo respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/10037/Egypt/Egypts-PM-centralises-Helwan-and--October-governor.aspx |title=Egypt's PM centralises Helwan and 6&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;governorates|publisher=Ahram Online|date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the city of Luxor was declared an independent governorate.

The ''[[Upper Egypt|Upper]]'' governorates are located south of Cairo, while the ''[[Lower Egypt|Lower]]'' governorates are located in the [[Nile Delta|Delta of the Nile]], north of Cairo.

Several local and international human rights organizations, including [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]], have for many years criticized Egypt's human rights record as poor. In 2005, President [[Hosni Mubarak]] faced unprecedented public criticism when he clamped down on [[Kefaya|democracy activists]] challenging his rule. Some of the most serious human rights violations, according to HRW's 2006 report on Egypt, are routine [[torture]], arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot;&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/egypt12212.htm Egypt: Overview of human rights issues in Egypt]. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt has also been cited for discriminatory personal status laws governing marriage, custody and inheritance, which critics say put women at a disadvantage. Laws concerning [[Copt]]ic [[Christian]]s which place restrictions on church building and open worship have been recently eased, but major construction still requires Government approval, while sporadic attacks on Christians and churches continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19813&amp;sec=36&amp;cont=3 Church Building Regulations Eased]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intolerance of [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|BahÃ¡'Ã­s]] and unorthodox Muslim sects, such as [[Sufism|Sufis]] and [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]], also remains a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot; /&gt;

The Egyptian legal system only recognizes three religions: [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]. When the Government moved to computerize identification cards, members of religious minorities, such as [[BahÃ¡'Ã­]]s, could not obtain [[Egyptian Identification Card Controversy|identification documents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;International Religious Freedom Report 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108481.htm|title= Egypt, International Religious Freedom Report 2008|date=19 September 2008|publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths can obtain identity cards without listing their faiths, and without becoming officially recognized.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Cynthia |last=Johnston |title= Egypt Baha'is win court fight over identity papers|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL29677385.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080215133731/http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL29677385.html|archivedate=15 February 2008 |publisher=Reuters |date=29 January 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (For more on the status of religious minorities, see the [[Egypt#Religion|Religion]] section.)

In 2005, the [[Freedom House]] rated [[political rights]] in Egypt at &quot;6&quot; (with 1 representing the most free and 7 the least), [[civil liberties]] as &quot;5&quot; and gave it the freedom rating of &quot;Not Free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/pdf/Charts2006.pdf|title=Freedom in the World 2006|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|date=16 December 2005|accessdate=27 July 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;br /&gt;See also [[Freedom in the World 2006]], [[List of indices of freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt; It however noted that &quot;Egypt witnessed its most transparent and competitive presidential and legislative elections in more than half a century and an increasingly unbridled public debate on the country's political future in 2005.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2006&amp;country=6956 |title=Freedom House.

In 2007, [[Amnesty International]] released a report criticizing Egypt for [[torture]] and illegal detention. The report alleges that Egypt has become an international center for torture, where other nations send suspects for interrogation, often as part of the [[War on Terror]]. The report calls on Egypt to bring its [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorism laws]] into accordance with international human rights statutes and on other nations to stop sending their detainees to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6544149.stm |title=Egypt torture centre, report says |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report, claiming that it was inaccurate and unfair, as well as causing deep offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6551401.stm |title=Egypt rejects torture criticism |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-13 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian Organization for Human Rights]] (EOHR) is one of the longest-standing bodies for the defence of [[human rights in Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.eohr.org |title=Egyptian Organization for Human Rights |publisher=En.eohr.org |date= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the Government established the National Council for Human Rights, headquartered in Cairo and headed by former [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] who directly reports to the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchr.org.eg/En/home.asp Official page of the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The council has come under heavy criticism by local activists, who contend it undermines human rights work in Egypt by serving as a propaganda tool for the Government to excuse its violations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eohr.org/press/2003/6-3.HTM Egyptian National Council for Human Rights Against Human Rights NGOs]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}.

According to the [[World Health Organization]] in 2008, an estimated 91.1% of Egypt's girls and women aged 15 to 49 have been subjected to [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Female genital mutilation and other harmful practices |publisher=Who.int |year=2011 |accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Egypt}}

Egypt's economy depends mainly on agriculture, media, petroleum exports, and tourism; there are also more than three million Egyptians working abroad, mainly in [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[Persian Gulf]] and Europe. The completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] in 1970 and the resultant [[Lake Nasser]] have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population, limited [[arable land]], and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/egypt_2.htm|title=Egypt: Economy|publisher=LookLex Encyclopedia|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Suez Canal Bridge close-up.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Suez Canal Bridge]]]]
The government has invested in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has received U.S. [[foreign aid]] (since 1979, an average of $2.2 billion per year) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war. Its main revenues however come from tourism as well as traffic that goes through the Suez Canal.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Egypt has a developed energy market based on coal, oil, [[natural gas]], and [[Hydropower|hydro power]]. Substantial coal deposits are in the northeast Sinai, and are mined at the rate of about {{convert|600000|t|lk=on|sp=us}} per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the [[Gulf of Suez]], and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at {{convert|1,940|km3}},&lt;!--according to Economy of Egypt article--&gt; and [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] is exported to many countries.

Economic conditions have started to improve considerably after a period of stagnation from the adoption of more liberal economic policies by the Government, as well as increased revenues from tourism and a booming [[stock market]]. In its annual report, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) has rated Egypt as one of the top countries in the world undertaking economic reforms.&lt;ref name=IMF&gt;{{cite web|last=Enders|first=Klaus|title=Egypt: Reforms Trigger Economic Growth|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2008/car021308a.htm|work=Internation Monetary Fund|accessdate=2 February 2011|quote=In its most recent review of Egypt's economy, the IMF says the expansion has broadened from energy, construction, and telecommunications to such labor-intensive sectors as agriculture and manufacturing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some major economic reforms taken by the new government since 2003 include a dramatic slashing of customs and tariffs. A new [[Tax law|taxation law]] implemented in 2005 decreased corporate taxes from 40% to the current 20%, resulting in a stated 100% increase in [[tax revenue]] by the year 2006.

[[File:A Boat in the Nile River.JPG|thumb|upright|Tourists ride in a traditional Nile boat.]]

[[Foreign direct investment]] (FDI) into Egypt has increased considerably in the past few years, exceeding $6 billion in 2006, due to the recent [[Liberal theory of economics|economic liberalization]] and [[Privatization|priva]][[List of privatizations#Egypt|tization]] measures taken by minister of investment Mahmoud Mohieddin.

Although one of the main obstacles still facing the Egyptian economy is the trickle down of the wealth to the average population, many Egyptians criticize their Government for higher prices of basic goods while their [[Standard of living|standards of living]] or purchasing power remains relatively stagnant. Corruption is often cited by Egyptians as the main impediment to further economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=27105 |title=IRIN Middle East &amp;#124; Middle East &amp;#124; Egypt: Corruption hampering development, says opposition report &amp;#124; Other &amp;#124; Breaking News |publisher=Irinnews.org |date= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2963 Daily News Egypt â Full Article]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rania Al Malky |url=http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2978 |title=et&amp;nbsp;â Full Story |publisher=Egypttoday.com |date= |accessdate=25 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government promises major reconstruction of the country's infrastructure, using money paid for the newly acquired third mobile license ($3 billion) by [[Etisalat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstodayegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6902|title=Etisalat Wins Third License|author=Fatima El Saadani|month=August | year=2006|publisher=Business Today|accessdate=21 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's most prominent multinational companies are the [[Orascom Group]] and Raya Contact Center. The IT sector has expanded rapidly in the past few years, with many start-ups selling outsourcing services to North America and Europe, operating with companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and other major corporations, as well as many small and medium enterprises. Some of these companies are the [[Xceedcc|Xceed Contact Center]], Raya, E Group Connections and C3. The sector has been stimulated by new Egyptian entrepreneurs with Government encouragement.

An estimated 2.7 million Egyptians abroad contribute actively to the development of their country through [[remittances]] (US$ 7.8 billion in 2009), as well as circulation of human and social capital and investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMEgypt&quot;/&gt;

[[Egyptians]] are by far the largest ethnic group in Egypt at 91% of the total population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Factbook&quot; /&gt; Ethnic minorities include the [[Abaza people|Abazas]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Greeks]], [[Bedouin]] Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Berber language|Berber]]-speaking [[Siwis]] ([[Berber people|Amazigh]]) of the [[Siwa Oasis]], and the [[Nubian people|Nubian]] communities clustered along the Nile. There are also tribal [[Beja people|Beja]] communities concentrated in the south-eastern-most corner, and a number of [[Dom people|Dom]] clans mostly in the Nile Delta and [[Faiyum]] who are progressively becoming assimilated as urbanization increases. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], an estimated 2.7 million Egyptians live abroad. Approximately 70% of Egyptian migrants live in Arab countries (923,600 in [[Saudi Arabia]], 332,600 in [[Libya]], 226,850 in [[Jordan]], 190,550 in [[Kuwait]] with the rest elsewhere in the region) and the remaining 30 % are living mostly in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] (318,000 in the [[US]], 110,000 in [[Canada]] and 90,000 in [[Italy]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;IOMEgypt&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |publisher=International Organization for Migration|title=Migration and Development in Egypt: Facts and Figures|year=2010|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Egypt}}

The [[official language]] of the Republic is [[Modern Standard Arabic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Provisional Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/LastPage.aspx?Category_ID=1155 |title=Constitutional Declaration: A New Stage in the History of the Great Egyptian People |date=30 March 2011 |publisher=Egypt State Information Service |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[spoken language]]s are: [[Egyptian Arabic]] (68%), [[Sa'idi Arabic]] (29%), [[Bedawi Arabic|Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic]]&lt;!--don't reduce the name, there are many similar named dialects--&gt; (1.6%), [[Sudanese Arabic]] (0.6%), [[Domari language|Domari]] (0.3%), [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]] (0.3%), [[Beja language|Beja]] (0.1%), [[Siwi language|Siwi]] and others. Additionally, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] are the main languages of immigrants. In Alexandria in the 19th century there was a large community of [[Italian Egyptians]] and Italian was the &quot;[[lingua franca]]&quot; of the city.

The main taught foreign languages in schools are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and sometimes Italian.

The historical languages include the [[Egyptian languages]] (also known as Copto-Egyptian) consisting of ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and form a separate branch among the family of [[Afro-Asiatic languages]].

The &quot;[[KoinÃ©]]&quot; dialect of the [[Greek language]] was important in [[Hellenistic]] Alexandria, and was used in the [[philosophy]] and [[science]] of that culture, and was also studied by later Arabic scholars.

===Religion===
Egypt hosts two major religious institutions, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] established in the middle of the 1st century by [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark the Evangelist]], and [[Al-Azhar University]] founded in 970 CE by the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] as the first{{Dubious|date=December 2010}} Islamic University in the world.

====Islam====
[[File:Cairo mosques.jpg|thumb|right|Cairo's unique cityscape with its ancient [[mosque]]s. Cairo is known as the ''&quot;city of a thousand minarets&quot;'']]
Egypt is a predominantly [[Sunni]] Muslim country with [[Islam]] as its state religion. The percentage of the adherents of various religions is a controversial topic in Egypt, with different sources citing different figures. Around 90% are identified as Muslim.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S.Dept of State/Egypt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm |title=Background Note: Egypt |date=10 November 2010 |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] [[Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs]] |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pewforum1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |title=Mapping The Global Muslim Population |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The world factbook/Egypt/&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|title=Egypt from &quot;The World Factbook&quot;|date=4 September 2008|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCO/Egypt/&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|title=Egypt from &quot;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&quot;|date=15 August 2008|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office -UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;msn encarta/Egypt&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557408_3/Egypt.html|title=Egypt from &quot;msn encarta&quot;|date=30 September 2008 |publisher= [[Microsoft Encarta|Encarta]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of Muslim Egyptians also follow native [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Tariqah|orders]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Valerie J. ''Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt''. University of South Carolina Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a minority of [[Shi'a]]. Islam plays a central role in the lives of most Egyptian Muslims. The [[Adhan]] (Islamic call to prayer) is heard five times a day, and has the informal effect of regulating the pace of everything from business to media and entertainment. [[Cairo]] is famous for its numerous [[mosque]] [[minaret]]s and is justifiably dubbed &quot;the city of 1,000 minarets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent on Cairo&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title= Cairo: Welcome to the city of 1,000 minarets|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/cairo-welcome-to-the-city-of-1000-minarets-692635.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|location=London|author= Robin Barton|date=19 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cairo also comprises a significant number of church [[Steeple (architecture)|towers]].

====Christianity====

They are also the victims of discriminatory religious laws, anti-Christian judges, and anti-Christian state police. Anti-Christian laws include laws governing repairing old churches or constructing new ones, which are usually impossible tasks, requiring presidential permission to build a new church, and a governorâs permission to renovate even the bathroom in an already-built church.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews.go.com&quot;/&gt; Anti-Christian judges tend to &quot;legislate from the bench&quot;.

====Religious minorities====
{{see|Egyptian identification card controversy}}
Egypt recognizes only three religions; Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Other faiths practiced by Egyptians, such as s small [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|BahÃ¡'Ã­]] community, are not recognized by the state. Individuals wishing to include such religions on their state issued identifications are denied, and had been put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith. A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognized faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Religious Freedom Report 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;/&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Egypt}}
{{Life in Egypt}}
[[File:LibraryAlexandria1-Omar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] is a commemoration of the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]] in Egypt's second largest city.]]
[[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] has six thousand years of [[Recorded History|recorded history]]. [[Ancient Egypt]] was among the earliest [[civilization]]s and for millennia, Egypt maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the Middle East and other African countries. After the Pharaonic era, Egypt itself came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], Christianity, and Islamic culture. Today, many aspects of Egypt's ancient culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself with roots in ancient Egypt.

Egypt's capital city, Cairo, is Africa's largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a center of learning, culture and commerce. Egypt has the highest number of [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureates]] in Africa and the Arab World. Some Egyptian born politicians were or are at the helm of major international organizations like [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] of the [[United Nations]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] of the [[IAEA]].

Egypt is a recognized cultural trend-setter of the Arabic-speaking world, and contemporary Arab culture is heavily influenced by Egyptian literature, music, film and television. Egypt gained a regional leadership role during the 1950s and 1960s, which gave a further enduring boost to the standing of Egyptian culture in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49061 |title=MIDEAST: Egypt Makes Cultural Clout Count (IPS, Oct.&amp;nbsp;29,&amp;nbsp;2009) |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity===
{{Main|Egyptians#Identity}}
[[File:Nahdet Misr.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]'s ''Egypt's Renaissance'' 1919â1928, [[Cairo University]]]]
The Nile Valley was home to one of the [[Ancient Egypt|oldest cultures in the world]], spanning three thousand years of continuous history. When Egypt fell under a [[History of Egypt|series of foreign occupations]] after 343 BC, each left an indelible mark on the country's [[Culture of Egypt|cultural landscape]]. Egyptian identity evolved in the span of this long period of occupation to accommodate, in principle, two new religions, [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]; and a new language, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and its spoken descendant, [[Egyptian Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youregypt.com/issue3/topic.htm|title=The Egyptian Identity: Pharaohs, Moslems, Arabs, Africans, Middle Easterners or Mediterranean People?|author=Raymon Kondos|date=15 February|accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two thousand years of occupation, three ideologies competed for the attention of newly independent Egyptians: ethno-territorial [[Egyptian nationalism]], secular [[Arab nationalism]]/[[pan-Arabism]], and [[Islamism]]. Egyptian nationalism predates its Arab counterpart by many decades, having roots in the 19th century and becoming the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists and intellectuals until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, James. &quot;Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism&quot; in Rashid Khalidi, ed. ''The Origins of Arab Nationalism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990, pp. 244â45&lt;/ref&gt; Arab nationalism reached a peak under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] but subsided under [[Anwar El Sadat|Sadat]]; meanwhile, the ideology espoused by [[Islamism|Islamists]] such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] is present in small segments of the lower-middle strata of Egyptian society.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, Adeed. ''Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2003, pp. 264â65, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of early 19th-century scholar Rifa'a et-Tahtawi led to the Egyptian Renaissance, marking the transition from [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Medieval]] to [[History of Modern Egypt|Early Modern]] Egypt. His work renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and exposed Egyptian society to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles. Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer [[Ali Mubarak]] a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars, such as [[Suyuti]] and [[Maqrizi]], who themselves studied the [[History of ancient Egypt|history]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|antiquities]] of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, ''op cit''., p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt's renaissance peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through the work of people like [[Muhammad Abduh]], [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], [[Muhammad Loutfi Goumah]], [[Tawfiq el-Hakim]], [[Louis Awad]], [[Qasim Amin]], [[Salama Moussa]], [[Taha Hussein]] and [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]. They forged a [[liberalism|liberal]] path for Egypt expressed as a commitment to personal freedom, [[secularism]] and faith in science to bring progress.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, ''op cit''., p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and architecture===
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Ramose 002.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] painting from the tomb of [[Thebes, Egypt|Theban]] governor [[Ramose]] in [[Deir el-Madinah]]]]
The Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in art and architecture. The wall paintings done in the service of the [[Pharaoh]]s followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Egyptian civilization is renowned for its colossal [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], [[Egyptian temple|temple]]s and monumental tombs. Well-known examples are the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] designed by ancient architect and engineer [[Imhotep]], the [[Sphinx]], and the temple of [[Abu Simbel]]. Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene, from the vernacular architecture of [[Hassan Fathy]] and [[Ramses Wissa Wassef]], to [[Mahmoud Mokhtar]]'s sculptures, to the distinctive [[Coptic art|Coptic iconography]] of [[Isaac Fanous]].

The [[Cairo Opera House]] serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital. Egypt's media and arts industry has flourished since the late 19th century, today with more than thirty satellite channels and over one hundred motion pictures produced each year. Cairo has long been known as the &quot;Hollywood of the Middle East;&quot; its annual film festival, the [[Cairo International Film Festival]], has been rated as one of 11 festivals with a top class rating worldwide by the International Federation of Film Producers' Associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Film Festivals |url=http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html |title=Cairo Film Festival information |publisher=Ukhotmovies.com |date=2005-12-01 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To bolster its media industry further, especially with the keen competition from the [[Persian Gulf Arab States]] and [[Lebanon]], a large media city was built. Some Egyptian-born actors include [[Omar Sharif]].

===Media===
{{Main|Media of Egypt}}
Egyptian [[Mass media|media]] are highly influential throughout the [[Arab World]], attributed to large audiences and increasing freedom from government control.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/country_profiles/737642.stm#media Country profiles: Egypt] ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tbs&gt;[http://www.tbsjournal.com/Archives/Fall05/Levinson.html &quot;Plus ca Change: The Role of the Media in Egypt's First Contested Presidential Elections&quot;], ''TBS''&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of the media is guaranteed in the constitution; however, many laws still restrict this right.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=fh&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|Egyptian presidential election of 2005]], Ahmed Selim, office director for Information Minister [[Anas al-Fiqi]], declared an era of a &quot;free, transparent and independent Egyptian media.&quot;&lt;ref name=tbs/&gt;

Today, the Egyptian media is experiencing greater freedom. Several Egyptian [[Talk shows]], like ''90 Minutes'' and ''Al- Ashera Masa'an'', which air on private channels, and even state television programs such as ''El-beit beitak'' criticize the Government, which was previously banned.

===Literature===
[[Literature]] is an important cultural element in the life of Egypt. Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of [[Arabic literature]], and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/EgyptOnline/Culture/000001/0203000000000000000567.htm|title=Global influence of Egyptian culture|date=4 February 2006|publisher=Egypt State Information Service|accessdate=21 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern Egyptian novel ''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]'' by [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] was published in 1913 in the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian vernacular]].&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, ''op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]] was the first Arabic-language writer to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Egyptian women writers include [[Nawal El Saadawi]], well known for her [[feminism|feminist]] [[activism]], and [[Alifa Rifaat]] who also writes about women and tradition.

Vernacular poetry is perhaps the most popular [[literary genre]] among Egyptians, represented by the works of [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]] (Fagumi), [[Salah Jaheen]] and [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]]. In their belief, boats were used by the dead to accompany the sun around the world, as Heaven was referred to as âUpper Watersâ. In Egyptian mythology, every night the serpentine god Apophis would attack the Sun Boat as it brought the sun (and as such order )back to the Kingdom in the morning. It is referred to as the âBoat of Millionsâ as all the gods and souls of the blessed dead may at one point or another be needed to defend or operate it.

===Music===

[[File:Egyptian musicians.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Upper Egyptian folk musicians from [[Kom Ombo]].]]
[[Music of Egypt|Egyptian music]] is a rich mixture of indigenous, Mediterranean, African and Western elements. In [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]], Egyptians were playing harps and flutes, including two indigenous instruments: the [[ney]] and the [[oud]]. [[Percussion]] and vocal music also became an important part of the local music tradition ever since. Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who influenced the later work of Egyptian music giants such as [[Sayed Darwish]], [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]] and [[Abdel Halim Hafez]]. From the 1970s onwards, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, while Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other festivities. Some of the most prominent contemporary Egyptian pop singers include [[Amr Diab]] and [[Mohamed Mounir]].

===Festivals===
Egypt celebrates many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as ''mulid''. They are usually associated with a particular Coptic or Sufi saint, but are often celebrated by all Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion. [[Ramadan]] has a special flavor in Egypt, celebrated with sounds, lights (local lanterns known as ''fawanees'') and much flare that many Muslim tourists from the region flock to Egypt during Ramadan to witness the spectacle. The ancient spring festival of [[Sham El Nessim|Sham en Nisim]] ([[Coptic language|Coptic]]: {{Coptic|Ï¬â²±â²ââ²â²â²â²¥â²â²}} ''shom en nisim'') has been celebrated by Egyptians for thousands of years, typically between the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian months]] of [[Paremoude]] (April) and [[Pashons]] (May), following [[Easter]] Sunday.

Egypt is one of the boldest countries in the middle east in the music industry. The next generation of the Egyptian music is considered to be the rise, as the music was disrupted by some foreign influences, bad admixing, and abused oriental styles.
The new arising talents starting from the late 1990s are taking over the rein now as they play different genres of many cultures.
Rock And Metal music are prevailing widely in Egypt now,as much as the oriental jazz and folk music are becoming well-known now to the Egyptian and non-Egyptian fans

===Sports===
[[File:Cairo International Stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Cairo International Stadium]]]]
[[Football (soccer)|Football]] is the Popular [[National Sport]] of Egypt. Egyptian Football clubs [[Al-Ahly]], [[El Zamalek]], [[Ismaily]], [[El-Ittihad El-Iskandary]] and [[El Masry]] are the most popular teams and enjoy the reputation of long-time regional champions. The great rivalries keep the streets of Egypt energized as people fill the streets when their favorite team wins. The [[Cairo Derby]] is one of the fiercest derbies in Africa and the world, the BBC even picked it as one of the toughest 7 derbies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Egypt national football team|Egyptian national football team]] is ranked among the best in the world according to the [[FIFA World Rankings]]. The country is home to many African championships such as the [[Africa Cup of Nations]]. While, [[Egypt national football team|Egypt's national team]] has not qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] since 1990, the Egyptian team won the Africa Cup Of Nations an unprecedented seven times, including two times in a row in 1957 and 1959 and an unprecedented three times in a row in 2006, 2008, and 2010 setting a world record.

[[Squash (sport)|Squash]] and [[tennis]] are other popular sports in Egypt. The Egyptian squash team has been known for its fierce competition in international championships since the 1930s. [[Amr Shabana]] is Egypt's best player and the winner of the world open three times and the best player of 2006.

The Egyptian Handball team also holds another record; throughout the 34 times the [[African Handball Nations Championship]] was held, Egypt won first place five times (including 2008), five times second place, four times third place, and came in fourth place twice. The team won 6th and 7th places in 1995, 1997 at the World Men's Handball Championship, and twice won 6th place at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics.

In 2007, [[Omar Samra]] joined Ben Stephens (England), Victoria James (Wales) and Greg Maud (South Africa) in putting together an expedition to climb Mount Everest from its South side. The Everest expedition began on 25 March 2007 and lasted for just over 9 weeks. On the 17 May at precisely 9:49 am Nepal time, Omar became the first and youngest Egyptian to climb 8,850m Mount Everest. He also became the first Egyptian to climb Everest from its South face, the same route taken by Sir Edmund Hilary and Sherpa Tenzing in 1953.
