'''The DePaul Blue Demons''' are the intercollegiate athletic teams of [[DePaul University]], located in [[Chicago Illinois]]. The Blue Demons participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] and is a member of the [[Big East Conference]].

In 1900, when the first athletic team to represent DePaul University was organized, the monogram &quot;D&quot; was selected for the uniforms. From this originated the nickname &quot;D-men&quot; which evolved into &quot;Demons.&quot; The blue, which combines with Demons, signifies loyalty and was chosen in 1901 by a vote of the student body. The university's official school colors are [[royal blue]] (PMS 287) and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] (PMS 185).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depaulbluedemons.com/trads/a-to-z.html DePaul Basketball A-to-Z â DePaul University Athletics.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Men's basketball===
{{Main|DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball}}
The school is well known for its basketball program which gained prominence under [[Ray Meyer]] who led the team to the NCAA Division I basketball [[Final Four]] in the 1978â1979 season. The school's only national championship came in 1945 after winning the NIT tournament. The team has played at the [[Allstate Arena]] since 1980.

The men's basketball coach, [[Jerry Wainwright]], was fired on January 11, 2010. Assistant coach Tracy Webster will be the interim coach for the remainder of the current season. Wainwright still had two years remaining on his contract at the time of his firing. Wainwright's first season with his young team was erratic, beating No. 16 [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]] 84-81 before falling to Old Dominion by a score of 87â43 (the worst defeat in the team's history), and then beating future Big East Champion, [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]], 108â69 on March 2, 2006. In the 2006â2007 season, the Blue Demons beat powerhouse #5 [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]], pulling off one of the greatest upsets in school history. They also beat 2006 NCAA tournament teams [[California]], [[Northwestern State]], [[Marquette University|Marquette]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Villanova University|Villanova]]. The team made it to the NIT and lost in the bracket final to Air Force.

The Demons opened up the 2008 season with two of their star players gone to the NBA. But freshman [[Dar Tucker]] and [[Mac Koshwal]] look to fill in those spots and senior Draelon Burns is already a star. Four games into the 2007-2008 season, Wainwright logged his 200th career win as a head coach. He has made six post-season appearances in his previous 12&amp;nbsp;years as head coach. The 2007â08 season saw the Demons with a 10â19 record, but there were high points in the year. DePaul had upsets over [[Villanova University]],  then ranked #15 nationally and ultimately a member of the NCAA Sweet Sixteen, and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. However, things took a turn for the worse during the 2008-2009 season. DePaul went 0-18 in regular season Big East play, setting a school-record for longest losing streak, before winning their first [[Big East Conference]] [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|tournament]] game against Cincinnati.  During the 2009-10 season, head coach Jerry Wainwright was fired and replaced by [[Oliver Purnell]] of [[Clemson University]] after the season ended.

===Women's basketball===
DePaul's NCAA women's basketball reached the Sweet 16 for the first time in the program's history in 2006. Head Coach [[Doug Bruno]] is entering his 22nd year as head coach of the team. He recently completed a two-year term as president of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbca.org/Board.asp WBCA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Softball===
The DePaul women's softball team has participated four times in the [[Women's College World Series]] since 1999. It finished the 2006-07 season ranked sixth in the final USA Today/NFCA Poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfca.org/news/index.php?id=2785 NFCA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The women's softball team has participated in the NCAA World Series several times in recent years. Head coach Eugene Lenti and his staff were named National Fastpitch Coaches Association Mideast Region Staff of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfca.org/news/index.php?id=2793 NFCA website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
===Mascot===
DePaul's mascot is DIBS which stands for Demon In a Blue Suit. DIBS is present at every Blue Demons basketball game and makes frequent appearances at DePaul's Lincoln Park Campus and charity appearances around the Chicago metropolitan area. While the Blue Demon nickname has been around for many years, the Blue Demon mascot took the game floor for the first time in 1968 with a papier-mache head and old warm-up suit. Through the years, the Blue Demon has taken on many forms in its evolution and was dubbed DIBS in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depaulbluedemons.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=15600&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=1285279 View the DePaul Blue Demons site]&lt;/ref&gt;
