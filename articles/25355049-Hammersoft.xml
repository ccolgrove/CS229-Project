&quot;'''Winter Winds'''&quot; is the second single by London folk quartet, [[Mumford &amp; Sons]] released from their debut album, ''[[Sigh No More (Mumford &amp; Sons album)|Sigh No More]]''. It was released in the [[UK]] on 6 December 2009. In the UK the single missed out on the top 40 peaking at number 44, but managed to peak to number 29 in Belgium. [[Marcus Mumford]] has said that this is his favorite song to sing live.

==Critical reception==
Fraser McAlpine of the [[BBC]] Chart Blog gave the song a positive 5-star review stating that it would serve as an &quot;amazing Christmas carol equivalent&quot; for a 'winterval' type holiday, as &quot;it's quietly optimistic, pleased without being smug, melancholy but uplifting&quot; and &quot;sure of itself, but only because all the lessons learned have been hard-won, and generally reflective of times gone by&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2009/12/mumford_and_sons_winter.shtml|work=[[BBC]]|publisher=bbc.co.uk|author=Fraser McAlpine|title=Mumford &amp; Sons - 'Winter Winds'|date=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
