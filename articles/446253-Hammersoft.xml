'''West Texas A&amp;M University''' (also known as '''WTAMU''', '''WT''', and formerly '''West Texas State'''), part of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]], is a [[public university]] located in [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]], [[Texas]], a small [[city]] south of [[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]. West Texas A&amp;M opened on September 20, 1910. West Texas A&amp;M University was originally called West Texas State [[Normal school|Normal College]] and started out as one of the seven state-funded [[normal school|teacher college]]s.

==History==
In the first school year, '''West Texas State Normal College''' had 152 students and 16 faculty members. Its first president was Robert B. Cousins. A year after the [[Texas Legislature|Texas State House of Representatives]] approved the bill to establish West Texas State Normal College, construction began on the school's Administration Building. It consisted of the school's only classrooms, laboratory, library, and offices. On March 25, 1914, the school burned down; however, classes continued in local churches, courthouses, and vacant buildings. Later, in 1916, a new Administration Building opened.

The first four-year college degrees were granted in 1919. In the following years the college was admitted to: American Association of Teachers Colleges in 1922, Association of Texas Colleges in 1923, and Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1925. The school changed its name to '''West Texas State Teachers College''' in 1923. In the early 1930s, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society built its [[Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum]] on the campus. 

In 1948, a nonconformist leftist [[sociology]] professor, [[Joseph L. Duflot]] (1881â1957), created a sensation on campus when he told a meeting of the [[American Federation of Labor]] in Amarillo that &quot;modern capitalism&quot; is the &quot;No. 1 enemy of the United States economy.&quot; A powerful legislator at the time, Sam Hanna of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]], warned that state funding could be jeopardized for any college with &quot;a communist&quot; on the faculty. Though the West Texas regents first dismissed Duflot, he survived a second vote, and regent H.L. Mills praised him for &quot;the courage of his convictions&quot;.&lt;ref name=WTHA&gt;Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Kuhlman, &quot;The Red Scare at West Texas State&quot;, [[West Texas Historical Association]], annual meeting, West Texas A&amp;M University in Canyon, April 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Many returning veterans from [[World War II]] enrolled at the institution in the latter 1940s, taking advantage of new [[G.I. Bill of Rights]] assistance. Conditions were so overcrowded for a time that the former soldiers slept in the [[gym]]nasium, and beds were brought from a former [[Prisoner of War]] camp in [[Hereford, Texas|Hereford]].&lt;ref name=WTHA/&gt;

In 1949, the school again changed its name, this time to '''West Texas State College'''. During the [[Cold War]], attention at West Texas was focused on [[anti-communism]]. One history professor, John Cook, claimed that many of the films shown on campus, such as ''Communism on the Map'', were &quot;propaganda&quot;. During this time too, the [[historian]] [[J. Evetts Haley]] ran for [[governor of Texas]] on a staunchly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] platform, but the office went to [[Price Daniel|Marion Price Daniel, Sr.]].&lt;ref name=WTHA/&gt;

During the 1960s, the school changed from a regional teacher's college to a state university. In 1963, the [[List of Governors of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[John B. Connally]] signed a bill to change the school's name to '''West Texas State University'''. The newly named school would gain a [[Liberal arts college|College of Arts and Sciences]], a [[graduate school]], and professional [[Business school|schools of business]]. Near the end of the 1960s, West Texas State obtained its own [[board of regents]], established a School of [[Agriculture]], a School of [[Fine art|Fine Art]]s, and created a [[Nursing school|Department of Nursing]].

By 1970, the student enrollment neared 8,000, but was decreasing. The primary reasons were the changes in the selective service system and increases in tuition. The university's funding was largely enrollment-driven, and this caused serious financial problems for the school. 

The [[Campus radio|college radio]] station [[KWTS]] began broadcasting in 1972. The West Texas State athletics were in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Missouri Valley Conference]], but the school decided to change its status to [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] and the [[Lone Star Conference]] in 1984. 

In 1986, WT President Ed Roach was the subject of protests and calls for his resignation over the amount of money spent on the campus' Presidential House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3CECCB2525036&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=President Gets Backing of Regents|work=Dallas Morning News|date=November 20, 1986|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|7301|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} house cost $991,000, which was more than the $494,900 authorized by the State College Coordinating Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3CEBDDC7FB528&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=State wants WTSU to repay overrun on President's House|date=October 30, 1986|first=Ken|last=Herman|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Roach was indicted for diverting scholarship money to meet other budget deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-university chief indicted He's 1 of 3 charged in West Texas scholarship funds case|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED5629AE54141E0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|date=December 11, 1991|work=Dallas Morning News|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university joined the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]] on September 1, 1990, and started to use the name West Texas A&amp;M University in 1993. The school's first president under the new system was Barry B. Thompson. Early in Thompson's tenure, he dropped the school's [[American football|football]] program, but the program returned a year later without athletic scholarships.

President Thompson was appointed Chancellor of the Texas A&amp;M University System in 1994 and Russell C. Long became the new president. During Long's tenure, the school renovated buildings, maintained its student enrollment growth, and added its first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in agriculture. 

The school had a long-term connection with [[T. Boone Pickens]] who was appointed to its Board of Regents in 1969. On March 21, 1973, Pickens resigned from the Board of Regents in protest, but was reappointed in 1981 and became its chair in 1982.  He continued to chair its Board until its merger with the Texas A&amp;M system in 1990.  In 1987, he pledged a $1.5 million matching gift to endow its business school, which was named in his honor.  On November 24, 2004, the school issued a press release stating that it planned to remove Pickens' name from the T. Boone Pickens College of Business after university officials came to believe he had not completed pledges he made to the university. In fact, Pickens had satisfied his pledge, but asked to have his name removed.  On December 1, 2004, the then President Russell C. Long acknowledged the error and agreed to remove Pickens' name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amarillo.com/stories/120204/new_733130.shtml|work=Amarillo Globe News|title=WT: Pickens exceeds pledged donations |first=Brandi|last=Dean|date=December 2, 2004|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Pickens donated $165 million to [[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater]].  In 2007, Pickens endowed the &quot;Pickens Professorship of Business&quot; and in 2010 he endowed the &quot;Pickens Professorship of Management.&quot;  The business school as a whole remains unnamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtamu.edu/academics/college-of-business-professorship.aspx|title=College of Business Professorships|accessdate=2010-08-22|publisher=West Texas A&amp;M Univ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, Long retired from his position as the school's president, and J. Patrick OâBrien took that office. As of 2006, West Texas A&amp;M University has approximately 7,000 students. The university contains over 60 [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]]-[[academic degree|degree]] programs, 40 [[Postgraduate education|graduate]]-degree programs, and one [[Doctorate|doctoral]] program
