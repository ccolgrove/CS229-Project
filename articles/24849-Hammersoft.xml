The '''Panama Canal''' ({{lang-es|Canal de PanamÃ¡}}) is a {{convert|77|km|mi|0|adj=on}} [[ship canal]] in [[Panama]] that joins the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. Built from 1904 to 1914, the canal has seen annual traffic rise from about 1,000 [[ship]]s early on to 14,702 vessels measuring a total of 309.6 million [[Measurement ton|Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons]] in 2008. In total, over 815,000 vessels have passed through the canal.&lt;ref name=&quot;canalusage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/routes.html |title=Panama Canal Traffic â Years 1914â2010 |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been named one of the [[seven modern wonders of the world]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ASCE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/content.aspx?id=2147487305 |title=Seven Wonders |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest and most difficult [[engineering]] projects ever undertaken, the canal had an enormous impact on [[shipping]] between the two oceans, replacing the long and treacherous route via either the [[Strait of Magellan]] or [[Cape Horn]] at the southernmost tip of [[South America]]. A ship sailing from [[New York City|New York]] to [[San Francisco]] via the canal travels {{convert|9500|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}, well under half the {{convert|22500|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} route around Cape Horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.czbrats.com/AmPan/index.htm |title=The Americans in Panama |first=William R. |last=Scott |publisher=Statler Publishing Company |location=New York, NY |year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a canal in Panama dates to the early 16th century. The first attempt to construct a canal began in 1880 under [[French Third Republic|French]] leadership, but was abandoned after 21,900 workers died, largely from disease (particularly [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]) and [[landslide]]s. The United States launched a second effort, incurring a further 5,600 deaths but succeeding in opening the canal in 1914. The U.S. controlled the canal and the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] surrounding it until the 1977 [[TorrijosâCarter Treaties]] provided for the transition of control to Panama. From 1979 to 1999 the canal was under joint U.S.âPanamanian administration, and from 31 December 1999 command of the waterway was assumed by the [[Panama Canal Authority]], an agency of the Panamanian government.

While the Pacific Ocean is west of the [[isthmus]] and the Atlantic to the east, the 8- to 10-hour journey through the canal from the Pacific to the Atlantic is one from southeast to northwest. This is a result of the isthmus's &quot;curving back on itself&quot; in the region of the canal. The [[Bridge of the Americas]] ({{lang-es|Puente de las AmÃ©ricas}}) at the Pacific end is about a third of a degree of longitude east of the end near Colon on the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=&quot;acptraffic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/reports/table01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Panama Canal Traffic â Fiscal Years 2002â2004 |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum size of vessel that can use the canal is known as ''[[Panamax]]''. A Panamax cargo ship typically has a [[deadweight tonnage|DWT]] of 65,000â80,000 [[tonne]]s, but its actual cargo is restricted to about 52,500 tonnes because of [[Draft (hull)|draft]] restrictions in the canal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lr.org/Images/30%20ship%20sizes_tcm155-173543.pdf ''Modern ship size definitions''], from Lloyd's register&lt;/ref&gt; The longest ship ever to transit was the ''San Juan Prospector'', now ''Marcona Prospector'', an [[ore-bulk-oil carrier]] that is {{convert|973|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} long, with a beam of {{convert|106|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rainforest.montclair.edu/pwebrf/rainforest/Region/panama.html ''Background of the Panama Canal''], Montclair State University&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Panama.A2003087.1850.250m.jpg|thumb|Satellite image showing location of Panama canal. Dense jungles are visible in green.]]
  {{Main|History of the Panama Canal}}

===Early proposal===
The earliest mention of a canal across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] dates to 1534, when [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Spain]] ordered a survey for a route through Panama that would ease the voyage for ships traveling to and from [[Spain]] and [[Peru]], as well as give the Spanish a tactical military edge over the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/index.html |title=A History of the Panama Canal: French and American Construction Efforts|publisher=Panama Canal Authority |accessdate=2007-09-03}}; Chapter 3, ''[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/early.html Some Early Canal Plans]''&lt;/ref&gt; During his expedition of 1788â1793, [[Alessandro Malaspina]] demonstrated the feasibility of a canal and outlined plans for its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Caso |first= Adolph | coauthors= Marion E. Welsh |title= They Too Made America Great |year= 1978 |publisher= Branden Books |isbn= 0828317143 |page= 72}}; online at [http://books.google.com/books?id=7q3WTS1IREkC Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Given the strategic location of Panama and its [[isthmus]] separating two great oceans, other forms of trade links were attempted over the years. The ill-fated [[Darien scheme]] was an attempt launched by the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in 1698 to set up an overland [[trade route]], but was defeated by the generally inhospitable conditions, and abandoned in July of 1699.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinnaird.net/darien.htm |title=Darien Expedition |notes=extensive background, including a detailed description, maps, lists of ships and people involved, and chronology |accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discovery of gold in California created a great deal of interest in a crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Finally, the [[Panama Canal Railway|Panama Railway]] was built across the isthmus, opening in 1855. This overland link became a vital piece of infrastructure, greatly facilitating trade and largely determining the later canal route.

Also in 1855, [[William Kennish]], a Manx-born engineer in the employ of the United States government, surveyed and issued a report on a route for a proposed Panama Canal.&lt;ref name=mw&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/worthies/p118.htm ''&quot;Manx Worthies&quot;''].&lt;/ref&gt; His report was published in a book entitled ''The Practicality and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rAwsAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=william+kennish&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lZpfP9ZKq9&amp;sig=7AXnp--aBGqytMe2vcb9DIXvJPY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rDFvS7rSNqimtgeNlpiUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwBA ''The Practicality and Importance of a Ship Canal to Connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans''].&lt;/ref&gt;

===French construction attempt===
An all-water route between the oceans was still seen as the ideal solution, and the idea of a canal was enhanced by the French success of the [[Suez Canal]] (which took 10 years to build the 102 mile canal, more than twice the length of the Panama Canal). The [[France|French]], under [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], began construction on a sea-level canal (''i.e.'', without locks) through what was then [[Colombia]]'s province of Panama, on January 1, 1880. The French began work in a rush, with insufficient prior study of the [[geology]] and [[hydrology]] of the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapterurl=http://www.czbrats.com/Builders/FRCanal/failure.htm |chapter=The French Failure |title=America's Triumph in Panama |first=Ralph E. |last=Avery |publisher=L.W. Walter Company |location=Chicago, IL |year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation was conducted at such a steep angle that, in some years, rain-induced landslides poured nearly as much material into the canal as had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Rocco |first= Fiammetta |title= The Miraculous Fever-Tree |year= 2003 |publisher= HarperCollins |isbn= 0006532357 |page= 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, disease, particularly [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], sickened and killed vast numbers of employees, ranging from laborers to top directors of the French company. Public health measures were ineffective because the role of the [[mosquito]] as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] was then unknown. These conditions made it impossible to maintain an experienced work force as fearful technical employees quickly returned to France. Even the hospitals contributed to the problem, unwittingly providing breeding places for mosquitoes inside the unscreened wards. Actual conditions were hushed up in France to avoid recruitment problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt; In 1893, after a great deal of work, the French scheme was abandoned due to disease and the sheer difficulty of building a sea-level canal, as well as lack of French field experience, such as with downpours that caused steel equipment to rust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/index.html |title=Read our history: The French Canal Construction |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high toll from disease was one of the major factors in the failure; as many as 22,000 workers were estimated to have died during the main period of French construction (1881â1889).&lt;ref name=&quot;French&quot;/&gt;

Beyond the hygienic and technical difficulties, [[Panama scandals|financial mismanagement and political corruption]] also contributed to the French failure.

===U.S. construction===
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|right|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] is shown in this photograph from 1907]]
At this time, various interests in the [[United States]] were also expressing interest in building a canal across the isthmus, with some favouring a route across [[Nicaragua]] (see [[Nicaragua Canal]] and [[Ecocanal]]) and others advocating the purchase of the French interests in Panama. Eventually, in June 1902, the U.S. Senate voted in favor of pursuing the Panamanian option, provided the necessary rights could be obtained. (It is claimed that the vote was swayed by [[William Nelson Cromwell]].&lt;ref&gt;''Overthrow'', Stephen Kinzer, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;)

On January 22, 1903, the [[Hay-Herran Treaty]] was signed by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John M. Hay]] and Dr. [[TomÃ¡s HerrÃ¡n]] of Colombia. It would have granted the [[United States]] a renewable [[lease]] in perpetuity from [[Colombia]] on the land proposed for the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h930.html |title=Hay-HerrÃ¡n Treaty |publisher=U-s-history.com |date=1903-11-18 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often misinterpreted as the &quot;99-year lease&quot; due to misleading wording included in article 22 of the agreement that refers to property within the land but does not pertain to the control of the canal and the right for the United States to renew the lease indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/pan001.asp |title=Avalon Project - Convention for the Construction of a Ship Canal (Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty), November 18, 1903 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was ratified by the United States Senate on March 14, 1903, but the [[Senate of Colombia]] did not ratify the treaty. Philippe Bunau-Varilla, chief engineer of the French canal company, told Roosevelt and Hay of a possible revolt and hoped that the U.S. would support it with troops and money. President of the [[United States]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] changed tactics, promising support for the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]]. On November 2, 1903, U.S. warships blocked sealanes for Colombian troops from coming to put down the revolt, while dense jungles blocked land routes. Panama achieved independence on November 3, 1903 when the [[United States]] [[Overseas interventions of the United States|sent]] naval forces to encourage [[Colombia]]'s surrender of the region. The United States quickly recognized them. Also, on November 6, 1903, [[Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla|Phillipe Bunau-Varilla]], Panama's ambassador to the United States, signed the [[Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty]], granting rights to the United States to build and indefinitely administer the Panama Canal. Although Bunau-Varilla was serving as Panama's ambassador, he was a French citizen and was not authorized to sign treaties on behalf of Panama without Panamanian review.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} This treaty would later become a contentious diplomatic issue between Panama and the U.S..

The United States, under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], bought out the French equipment and excavations for US$40 million and began work on May 4, 1904. The United States paid Colombia $10 million in 1921 and (later $250,000 per annum), seven years after completion of the canal, for redress of President Roosevelt's role in the creation of Panama, and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the [[Thomson-Urrutia Treaty]].

===Isthmian Canal Commission===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
{{Main|Isthmian Canal Commission}} 
The U.S. Government created the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] to oversee the construction of the Panama Canal in the early years of American involvement. Established in 1904, it was given control of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] over which the [[United States]] exercised sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Parker. ''Hell's Gorge: The Battle to Build the Panama Canal'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The commission reported directly to [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[William Taft]].   

[[Joseph Bucklin Bishop]], an associate of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and a strong editorial advocate for U.S. participation in the Canal project was appointed Executive Secretary of the [[Isthmian Canal Commission]] in Washington, D.C. the following year. Bishop was tasked with managing the Commissionâs day-to-day matters but also with ensuring public support for the canal through public relations and by keeping the projectâs official history. Bishopâs promised $10,000 annual salary was relentlessly criticized by Rooseveltâs opponents in Congress, mostly because it was twice what each of them made.  Opposition newspapers joined in the criticism.  In the summer of 1907, when escalating allegations of cronyism surrounding Bishopâs appointment threatened appropriations for Panama Canal construction, Secretary of War, [[William Howard Taft]], surely with Rooseveltâs quiet consent, ordered Bishop out of Washington to Panama where the partisan political heat would be less intense. âI accept your decision without reluctance,â Bishop informed Taft, âand shall go to the Isthmus, not sadly but cheerfullyâ.&lt;ref&gt;My Dear Bishop, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  It would not be his first trip to Panama. In the fall of the previous year, Bishop had gone ahead to advance Rooseveltâs historic inspection tour, the first time a sitting President had journeyed outside the U.S. 

Joseph Bucklin Bishop would, except for month-long summer breaks, remain on the isthmus for seven years, serving clandestinely at first as Theodore Rooseveltâs âeyes and earsâ.  He reported back on the âastonishingâ progress that [[Army Corps of Engineers]] Colonel [[George Washington Goethals]] and his team were making excavating the âbig ditchâ and building dams and locks.  Before long, Bishop became Goethalsâs trusted aide, serving as his first line of defense against workers with complaints and grievances.  But Bishopâs greatest achievement in Panama would be as founding editor of ''The Canal Record'', a weekly newspaper for the thousands of workers in Panama.  His regular reports of cubic yards dug by rival work divisions, and the competitive baseball games they played created a spirit of healthy competition that lifted worker morale and productivity. The âgood newsâ of The Canal Record also built vital public support on newspaper [[editorial page]]s back home and in the halls of the [[United States Congress]] where annual [[appropriation (law)|appropriation]]s were required to keep the canal project moving forward.

===Planning and construction begins===
{{copy edit|date=December 2011}}
[[John Frank Stevens]], Chief Engineer from 1905 to 1907, successfully argued the case against the incredibly massive excavation required for a sea-level canal like the French had tried to build and convinced Theodore Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of a canal built with [[dam]]s and [[Lock (water transport)|locks]]. One of Stevens' primary achievements in Panama was in building the infrastructure necessary to complete the canal. He had the [[Panama Railway]] rebuilt and upgraded with modern heavy-duty equipment. Implementing the recommendations of [[Walter Reed]] and [[William Crawford Gorgas|Dr. William Gorgas]], Stevens also built proper housing with screens for canal workers and oversaw investment in extensive sanitation and [[mosquito]]-abatement programs that minimized the spread of the deadly mosquito-spread diseasesâparticularly [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]]. The mosquito had been identified as the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] (disease spreading agent) by Cuban physician and scientist Dr. [[Carlos Finlay]] in 1881. Finlay's theory and investigative work had recently been confirmed by Dr. Walter Reed while in [[Cuba]] with the [[U.S. Army]] after the [[Spanish-American War]] (1898) (see also [[Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal]]).

With the diseases under control, and after significant work on preparing the infrastructure and [[railroad]], construction of an elevated canal with locks began in earnest.  Even the construction of the Panama Canal with locks still required the excavation of an enormous volume of material and was envisioned by John Frank Stevens as a massive earth-moving project using the Panama Railway as efficiently as possible. The railroad, starting in 1904, had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate all the new [[rolling stock]] of about 115 heavy-duty locomotives and 2,300 dirt spoils railroad cars. There were about 102 of the new railroad-mounted [[steam shovel]]s brought in from the United States and elsewhere. The steam shovels were some of the largest in the world in 1906 when they were introduced. The new railroad closely paralleled the canal where it could and was moved and reconstructed where it interfered with the canal work. In many places the new [[Lake Gatun]] flooded over the original rail line and a new rail line had to be raised above the water by massive dirt fills and bridges.  

[[Image:MarioModel90 1908.jpg|thumb|A Marion steam shovel excavating the Panama Canal in 1908]]
The Panama Canal Railway, besides hauling thousands of men, all the millions of tons of equipment and supplies, did much more.  Essentially all of the hundreds of millions of cubic yards of material removed from the required canal cuts were broken up by explosives, loaded by steam shovels mounted on one set of railroad tracks onto spoils cars on parallel tracks, and hauled out by locomotives. Most of the cars carrying the dirt spoils were wooden [[flat car]]s lined with steel floors that used a crude but effective unloading deviceâthe [[Lidgerwood system]]. The railroad cars had only one side and steel aprons bridged the spaces between the cars. The rock and dirt was first blasted loose by explosives. Two sets of tracks were then built or moved up to where the loosened material lay. The steam shovels, moving on one set of tracks, picked up the loosened dirt and then piled it on the steel-floored flat cars traveling on a parallel set of tracks. The dirt was piled high up against the one closed side of the car. The train moved forward as the cars were filled until all cars were filled. A typical train had twenty dirt cars arranged as essentially one long [[gondola_(rail)|gondola]] car. On arrival of the train at one of the approximately 60 different dumping grounds, a three-ton steel plow was put on the last car (or a car carrying the plow was attached as the last car) and a huge winch with a braided steel cable stretching the length of all cars was attached to the engine. The winch, powered by the trainâs steam engine, pulled the plow the length of the dirt-loaded train by winching up the steel cable. The plow scraped the dirt off the railroad cars, allowing the entire train-load of dirt cars to be unloaded in about ten minutes or less. The plow and winch were then detached for use on another train. Another plow, mounted on a steam engine, then plowed the dirt spoils away from the track.&lt;ref&gt;DuTemple, Lesley A. &quot;The Panama Canal&quot;; 2002; pp 50â55; Lerner Publishing Group; ISBN-978-0822500797&lt;/ref&gt; When the fill got large enough, the track was relocated on top of the old fill to allow almost continuous unloading of new fill with a minimum amount of effort. When the steam shovels or dirt trains needed to move to a new section, techniques were developed by William Bierd, former head of the Panama Railroad, to pick up large sections of track and their attached ties by large steam-powered cranes and relocate them intactâwithout disassembling and rebuilding the track. A dozen men could move a mile of track a dayâthe work previously done by up to 600 men. This allowed the tracks used by both the steam shovels and dirt trains to be quickly moved to wherever they needed to go. While constructing the [[Gaillard Cut]], about 160 loaded dirt trains went out of the cut daily, and returned emptyâone train about every one and a half minutes of the day. 

The railroads, [[steam shovel]]s, enormous [[steam-powered crane]]s, [[rock crusher]]s, [[cement mixer]]s, [[dredge]]s, and pneumatic power drills used to drill holes for explosives (about {{convert|30000000|lb|t}} were used) were some of the new (in 1906) pieces of construction equipment used to construct the canal. Nearly all this new equipment was built by new, extensive machine building technology developed and built in the United States by companies such as the [[Joshua Hendy Iron Works]]. In addition, the canal used large refrigeration systems for making ice, extensive large electrical motors to power the pumps and controls on the canal's locks and other new technology. They built extensive electrical generation and distribution systemsâone of the first wide-scale uses of large electrical motors and generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Panama_Canal_Electrical_and_Control_Installations,_1914 |title=Milestones:Panama Canal Electrical and Control Installations, 1914 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical-powered [[Steam donkey|donkey engines]] pulled the ships through the locks on railroad tracks laid parallel to the locks. New technology, not available before, allowed massive earth cuts and fills to be used on the new railroad and canal that were many times larger than those done in the original 1851â1855 railroad construction. The Americans  replaced the old French equipment with machinery designed for a larger scale of work (such as the giant hydraulic crushers supplied by the Joshua Hendy Iron Works) to quicken the pace of construction.&lt;ref name=French/&gt; President Roosevelt had the former French machinery [[minted]] into [[medal]]s for all workers who spent at least two years on the construction to commemorate their contribution to the building of the canal. These medals featured Roosevelt's likeness on the front, the name of the recipient on one side, and the worker's years of service, as well as a picture of the [[Gaillard Cut|Culebra Cut]] on the back.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=195|title=The Roosevelt Medal|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kroonland in Panama Canal, 1915.jpg|thumb|right|[[SS Kroonland|SS ''Kroonland'']] at the Culebra Cut while transiting the Panama Canal on 2 February 1915.]]

In 1907, when [[John Frank Stevens]] resigned, Roosevelt appointed U.S. Army Colonel [[George Washington Goethals]] as Chief Engineer of the Panama Canal. 

[[Ellicott Dredges]], a Baltimore, Maryland, USA company formerly known as the Ellicott Machine Company, built the cutter [[dredges]] used in some of the construction of the Panama Canal after the cuts were deep enough to float them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/Panama-Canal-The-Big-Dig-of-Central-America/7868/|title=Panama Canal: The Big Dig of Central America|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2010-08-27|publisher=Construction Equipment Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first machine delivered was a steam-driven, {{convert|900|hp|abbr=on}}, 20-inch dredge. In 1941, Ellicott Dredges also built the dredge MINDI, a {{convert|10000|HP|abbr=on}}, 28-inch cutter suction dredge still operating in the Panama Canal.

The building of the canal was completed in 1914, two years ahead of the target date of June 1, 1916. The canal was formally opened on August 15, 1914 with the passage of the cargo ship [[SS Ancon|SS ''Ancon'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/index.html|title=Read our history: American Canal Construction|publisher=Panama Canal Authority|accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, this was also the same month that fighting in [[World War I]] (the [[Great War]]) began in [[Europe]]. The advances in [[hygiene]] resulted in a relatively low death toll during the American construction; still, about 5,600 workers died during this period (1904â1914). This brought the total death toll for the construction of the canal to around 27,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/history/history/end.html|title=A History of the Panama Canal: French and American Construction Efforts|publisher=Panama Canal Authority|accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
By the 1930s it was seen that water supply would be an issue for the canal; this prompted the building of the [[Madden]] Dam across the [[Chagres River]] above [[Gatun Lake]]. The dam, completed in 1935, created Madden Lake (later Alajuela Lake), which acts as additional water storage for the canal.&lt;ref&gt; [http://books.google.com/books?id=2ikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=1930+plane+%22Popular&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ALyXTujZIsTC0AH14e3IBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=1930%20plane%20%22Popular&amp;f=true &quot;Panama Dam to Aid Canal Traffic.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1930, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, construction began on a further major improvement: a new set of locks for the canal, large enough to carry the larger warships which the United States was building at the time and had planned to continue building. The work proceeded for several years, and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach channels, but the project was canceled after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czbrats.com/Articles/3rdlocks/3rdlocks.htm ''Enlarging the Panama Canal''], Alden P.

|title=Statement on the Panama Canal Treaty Signing
|description=Jimmy Carter's speech upon signing the Panama Canal treaty, 7 September 1977.}}
After the war, U.S. control of the canal and the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] surrounding it became contentious as relations between Panama and the U.S. became increasingly tense. Many Panamanians felt that the Canal Zone rightfully belonged to Panama; student protests were met by the fencing in of the zone and an increased military presence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czbrats.com/Jackson/martyrs/martyrs.htm ''The Martyrs of 1964''], by Eric Jackson&lt;/ref&gt; The unrest culminated in riots in which approximately 20 Panamanians and 3â5 U.S. soldiers were killed on [[Martyrs' Day (Panama)|Martyr's Day]], January 9, 1964. Negotiations toward a new settlement began in 1974, and resulted in the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]]. Signed by [[President of the United States]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Omar Torrijos]] of Panama on September 7, 1977, this mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal. The treaty led to full Panamanian control effective at noon on December 31, 1999, and the [[Panama Canal Authority|Panama Canal Authority (ACP)]] assumed command of the waterway.

Before this handover, the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the container shipping ports located at the canalâs Atlantic and Pacific outlets. The contract was not affiliated with the ACP or Panama Canal operations and was won by the firm [[Hutchison Whampoa]], a [[Hong Kong]]-based shipping concern whose owner is [[Li Ka Shing]].

The canal consists of [[reservoir|artificial lakes]], several improved and artificial [[channel (geography)|channels]], and three sets of [[canal lock|locks]]. An additional artificial lake, Alajuela Lake (known during the American era as Madden Lake), acts as a [[reservoir]] for the canal. The layout of the canal as seen by a ship passing from the Pacific end to the Atlantic is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historicals.ncd.noaa.gov/historicals/histmap.asp |title=Historical Map &amp; Chart Project |accessdate=2007-09-03 |publisher=[[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- These distances are measured as accurately as I can from a 1940 nautical chart of the canalâU.S. Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey no. 955, May 1940. See the reference above. ~~~~ --&gt;
* From the [[buoy]]ed entrance channel in the [[Gulf of Panama]] ([[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] side), ships travel {{convert|13.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} up the channel to the Miraflores locks, passing under the [[Bridge of the Americas]].
* The two-stage [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores]] lock system, including the approach wall, is {{convert|1.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a total lift of 16.5&amp;nbsp;meters (54&amp;nbsp;ft) at mid-tide.
* The artificial Miraflores Lake is the next stage, {{convert|1.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and 16.5&amp;nbsp;meters (54&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.
* The single-stage Pedro Miguel lock, which is {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, is the last part of the ascent with a lift of 9.5&amp;nbsp;meters (31&amp;nbsp;ft) up to the main level of the canal.
* The [[Gaillard Cut|Gaillard (Culebra) Cut]] slices {{convert|12.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} through the [[continental divide]] at an altitude of 26&amp;nbsp;meters (85&amp;nbsp;ft), and passes under the [[Centennial Bridge, Panama|Centennial Bridge]].
* The [[Chagres River]] (RÃ­o Chagres), a natural waterway enhanced by the damming of Lake GatÃºn, runs west about {{convert|8.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, merging into Lake Gatun.
* [[Gatun Lake]], an artificial lake formed by the building of the [[Gatun Dam]], carries vessels {{convert|24.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} across the isthmus.
* The GatÃºn locks, a three-stage flight of locks {{convert|1.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, drop ships back down to sea level.
* A {{convert|3.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} channel forms the approach to the locks from the Atlantic side.
* LimÃ³n Bay (BahÃ­a LimÃ³n), a huge natural harbour, provides an anchorage for some ships awaiting passage, and runs {{convert|8.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the outer breakwater.

Thus, the total length of the canal is {{convert|77.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

==Lock size==
{{Main|Panama Canal Locks}}
[[File:Gatun lock gate.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Miter [[Lock (water transport)|lock]] gate at GatÃºn]]
[[File:WorkerAtMirafloresLocksPanamaCanal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lock (water transport)|Lock]] gate at Miraflores]]

The size of the locks determines the maximum size of ships allowed passage. Because of the importance of the canal to international trade, many ships are built to the maximum size allowed.  These are known as [[Panamax]] vessels.

Initially the [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] at Gatun had been designed to be {{convert|28.5|m|ft|sp=us}} wide. In 1908 the [[United States Navy]] requested that width be increased to at least {{convert|36|m|ft|sp=us}} which would allow the passage of U.S. naval ships. Eventually a compromise was made and the locks were built {{convert|33.53|m|ft|sp=us}} wide. Each lock is {{convert|320|m|ft|sp=us}} long with the walls ranging in thickness from {{convert|15|m|ft|sp=us}} at the base to {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} at the top. The central wall between the parallel locks at GatÃºn is {{convert|18|m|ft|sp=us}} thick and stands in excess of {{convert|24|m|ft|sp=us}} high. The steel lock gates measure an average of {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=us}} thick, {{convert|19.5|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|20|m|ft|sp=us}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.co.uk/~sl5763/panama.htm |title=The Panama Canal |accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the size of the locks, specifically the Pedro Miguel Locks, along with the height of the [[Bridge of the Americas]] at Balboa, that determine the Panamax metric and limit the size of ships that may use the Canal.{{-}}

The 2006 [[Panama Canal expansion project|Third lock lane project]] will create larger locks, and deeper and wider channels, allowing bigger ships to transit. The allowed dimensions of ships will increase by 25% in length, 51% in beam, and 26% in draft, as defined by [[Panamax#New Panamax|New Panamax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/common/maritime/advisories/2009/a-02-2009.pdf |title=New Panamax publication by ACP|date = November 2006|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tolls==
[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off|RORO carriers]], such as this one at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to use the canal]]

Tolls for the canal are decided by the Panama Canal Authority and are based on vessel type, size, and the type of cargo carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/tolls.html |title=Maritime Operations&amp;nbsp;â Tolls |publisher=Panama Canal Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[container ship]]s, the toll is assessed per the ship's capacity expressed in [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s or TEUs. One TEU is the size of a container measuring {{convert|20|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|8|ft|m|2}} by {{convert|8.5|ft|m|1}}. Effective May 1, 2009, this toll is US$72.00 per TEU. A Panamax container ship may carry up to {{TEU|4,400}}. The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo (âin ballastâ). {{As of|2009|05|01|df=US}}, the ballast rate is US$57.60 per TEU.

Passenger vessels in excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS), known popularly as [[cruise ships]], pay a rate based on the number of berths, that is, the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds. The per-berth charge is currently $92 for unoccupied berths and $115 for occupied berths.  Started in 2007, this charge has greatly increased tolls for such vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Panama Canal Toll Table http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/tolls.html&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger vessels of less than 30,000 tons or with less than 33 tons per passenger are charged on the same &quot;per-ton&quot; schedule as freighters.&lt;ref&gt;Almost all major cruise ships have more than 33 tons per passenger; the rule of thumb for cruiseline comfort is generally given as a minimum of 40 tons per passenger. Note that a ton is not a unit of weight, but displacement, and represents a volume of about 100 cubic feet.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most other types of vessel pay a toll per [[tonnage|''PC/UMS net ton'']], in which one &quot;ton&quot; is actually a volume of {{convert|100|cuft|m3|2}}. (The calculation of [[tonnage]] for commercial vessels is quite complex.) {{As of|2008|alt=As of fiscal year 2008}}, this toll is US$3.90 per ton for the first 10,000 tons, US$3.19 per ton for the next 10,000 tons, and US$3.82 per ton for the next 10,000 tons, and US$3.76 per ton thereafter. As with container ships, a reduced toll is charged for freight ships &quot;in ballast&quot;.

Small vessels up to 583 PC/UMS net tons when carrying passengers or cargo, or up to 735 PC/UMS net tons when in ballast, or up to 1,048 fully loaded displacement tons, are assessed minimum tolls based upon their [[length overall]], according to the following table {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}:

The most expensive regular toll for canal passage to date was charged on May 16, 2008 to the ''[[Disney Magic]]'', which paid US$331,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://noticias.terra.com/noticias/articulo/html/act1287447.htm|title=Crucero paga cifra rÃ©cord en Canal de PanamÃ¡|publisher=Terra Noticias|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2009-08-08|language=Spanish}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2008-06-24|title=ACP rectifica rÃ©cord en pago de peaje|publisher= La Prensa|url=http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2008/06/24/hoy/negocios/1416962.html

Ninety-seven years since its opening, the canal continues to enjoy great success. Even though world shippingâand the size of ships themselvesâhas changed markedly since the canal was designed, it continues to be a vital link in world trade, carrying more cargo than ever before, with fewer overhead costs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Nevertheless, the canal faces a number of potential problems.

===Efficiency and maintenance===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:admbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|The Administration Building of the Panama Canal is in [[Balboa, Panama]]]] --&gt;

There were fears that efficiency and maintenance would suffer following the U.S. withdrawal; however, this does not appear to have been the case. Capitalizing on practices developed during the American administration, canal operations are improving under Panamanian control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.si.edu/smithsonian/issues04/mar04/panama.html |title=A Man, A Plan, A Canal: Panama Rises |work=Smithsonian Magazine |month=March |year=2004 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canal Waters Time (CWT), the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal, including waiting time, is a key measure of efficiency; according to the ACP, since 2000, it has oscillated between 20 and 30 hours.  The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade, varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year across approximately 14,000 total annual transits.&lt;ref name=annualreport2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/common/general/reports/informe-anual-2005.pdf |format=PDF |title=ACP 2005 Annual Report |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |year=2005 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metrics2008&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/pr/press-releases/2008/10/24/pr300.html|title=News - PanCanal.com; Panama Canal Authority Announces Fiscal Year 2008 Metrics |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=metrics2009&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/pr/press-releases/2009/10/30/pr366.html|title=News - PanCanal.com; Panama Canal Authority Announces Fiscal Year 2009 Metrics |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An official accident is one in which a formal investigation is requested and conducted.

Increasing volumes of imports from [[Asia]] which previously landed on the U.S. west-coast ports are now passing through the canal to the American east coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.colliers.com/Content/Attachments/Corporate/Services/NewYorkTimes112204.htm |title=New York Port Hums Again, With Asian Trade |first=Eric |last=Lipton |work=New York Times |date=2004-11-22}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of oceangoing transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (the Canalâs fiscal year runs from October to September).&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/general/reporte-anual/2009/pdf/InformePDFingles.pdf |format=PDF |title=ACP 2009 Annual Report |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and in the numbers of Panamax vessels passing, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million [[tonnage|PC/UMS tons]] in fiscal year 1999 to a record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;acptraffic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;annualreport2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/reports/table01.pdf|title=Panama Canal Traffic - Fiscal Years 2006 through 2008 |publisher=Panama Canal Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reduction in total transits due to the negative impact of vessel size (e.g., the inability of large vessels to pass each other in the [[Gaillard Cut]]), this represents significant overall growth in canal capacity.

[[File:Panama Canal Bucket Dredge.jpeg|thumb|A [[Dredger|bucket dredge]] works to deepen and widen the canal.]]
The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) has invested nearly US$1 billion in widening and modernising the canal, with the aim of increasing capacity by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/1999/panama.canal/stories/operation/ |title=Transfer heavy on symbolism, light on change |first=Steve |last=Nettleton |publisher=CNN Interactive |year=1999}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACP cites a number of major improvements, including the widening and straightening of the Gaillard Cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels, the deepening of the navigational channel in Gatun Lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply, and the deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific entrances of the canal. This is supported by new equipment, such as a new drill barge and suction dredger, and an increase of the [[Tugboat|tug boat]] fleet by 20%. In addition, improvements have been made to the operating machinery of the canal, including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet, the replacement of more than 16&amp;nbsp;km of locomotive track, and new lock machinery controls. Improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/projects/overview.html |title=Modernisation &amp; Improvements |publisher=Panama Canal Authority}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacity===
The canal is presently handling more vessel traffic than had ever been envisioned by its builders. In 1934 it was estimated that the maximum capacity of the canal would be around 80 million tons per year;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.czimages.com/CZMemories/thirdlocks/tlpage3.htm |title=The Land Divided - A History of the Panama Canal and other Isthmian Canal Projects |first=Gerstle |last=Mack |year=1944}}&lt;/ref&gt; as noted above, canal traffic in 2009 consisted of 299.1 million tons of shipping.
[[File:Gatun Lake.jpg|thumb|right|The water that is used to raise and lower vessels in the Canal is fed by gravity from Gatun Lake (pictured above) into each set of locks.]]

To improve capacity, a number of improvements have been imposed on the current canal system. These improvements aim to maximise the possible use of current locking system:&lt;ref name=&quot;3rdLockProposal&quot;&gt;[http://www.acp.gob.pa/eng/plan/documentos/propuesta/acp-expansion-proposal.pdf  ''Proposal for the Expansion of the Panama Canal'' by the ''Panama Canal Authority''], p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;
* Implementation of an enhanced locks lighting system;
* Construction of two tie-up stations in Gaillard Cut;
* Gaillard Cut widening from {{convert|192|to|218|m|ft}};
* Improvements to the tugboat fleet;
* Implementation of the carousel lockage system in Gatun locks;
* Development of an improved vessel scheduling system;
* Deepening of Gatun Lake navigational channels from {{convert|10.4|to|11.3|m|ft}} PLD
* Modification of all locks structures to allow an additional draft of about {{convert|0.30|
m|ft}};
* Deepening of the Pacific and Atlantic entrances;
* Construction of a new spillway in Gatun, for flood control.
These improvements will enlarge the capacity from 280â290 million PCUMS (2008) to 330â340 PCUMS (2012).

===Competition===
Despite having enjoyed a privileged position for many years, the canal is increasingly facing competition from other quarters. Because canal tolls are expected to rise, some critics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_13/issue_06/business_03.html |title=Shipping industry complains about PanCanal toll hikes |first=Eric |last=Jackson |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the [[Suez Canal]] may become a viable alternative for cargo en route from Asia to the U.S. east coast.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The Panama Canal, however, continues to serve more than 144 of the worldâs trade routes and the majority of canal traffic comes from the &quot;All-Water Route&quot; (the route from Asia to the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts via the Panama Canal).{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The increasing rate of melting of ice in the [[Arctic Ocean]] has led to speculation that the [[Northwest Passage]] or [[Arctic Bridge]] may become viable for commercial shipping at some point in the future. This route would save {{convert|9,300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the route from Asia to Europe compared with the Panama Canal, possibly leading to a diversion of some traffic to that route. However, such a route is beset by unresolved territorial issues and would still hold significant problems owing to ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/jun/12/20050612-123835-3711r/ |title=Northwest Passage redux |first=Levon |last=Sevunts |work=The Washington Times |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2009-04-20}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1429085&amp;C=america |title=Conservative Leader Harper Asserts Canada's Arctic Claims |first=Michel |last=Comte publisher=DefenceNews.com (Agence France-Presse) |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water issues===
[[File:Gatun locks showing the &quot;mule&quot; locomotives at work.jpg|thumb|Gatun locks showing the &quot;mule&quot; locomotives at work]]
Gatun Lake is filled with rainwater, and the lake accumulates excess water during wet months. The water is lost to the oceans at a rate of {{convert|101000|m3|usgal impgal|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} per lock-cycle going downwards. Since a ship will have to go upward to Lake Gatun first and then descend, a single passing will cost double the amount, but the same waterflow cycle can be used for another ship passing in the opposite direction. The ship's submerged volume is not relevant to the amount of water.&lt;ref name=acpfaq/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/noticiero/canal-faqs/physical/14.html |title=The Panama Canal - Frequently Asked Questions |quote=Each lock chamber requires {{convert|101000|m3|usgal impgal|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} of water. An average of {{convert|52000000|usgal|L impgal|abbr=on}} of fresh water are used [in a single passing].}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[dry season]], when there is less rainfall, there is also a shortfall of water in Gatun Lake.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

As a signatory to the [[United Nations]] [[Global Compact]] and a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the ACP has developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion, which will protect the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the Canal Watershed. After completion, expansion will guarantee the availability and quality of [[water resources]] by using unique water-saving basins at each new lock. These water-saving basins will diminish water loss and preserve freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing water from the basins into the locks. Each lock chamber will have three water-saving basins, which will reuse 60 percent of the water in each transit. There are a total of nine basins for each of the two lock complexes, and a total of 18 basins for the entire project.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The Pacific side sea level is about 20 centimeters (8&amp;nbsp;inches) higher than that of the Atlantic side due to differences in ocean conditions such as water densities and weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pol.ac.uk/psmsl/puscience/ |title=Sea Level: Frequently asked questions and answers |publisher=Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory |accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==
As demand is rising, the canal is positioned to be a significant feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future. However, changes in shipping patternsâparticularly the increasing numbers of post-Panamax shipsâwill necessitate changes to the canal if it is to retain a significant [[market share]]. It is anticipated that by 2011, 37% of the world's container ships will be too large for the present canal, and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share. The maximum sustainable capacity of the present canal, given some relatively minor improvement work, is estimated at between 330 and 340 million PC/UMS tons per year; it is anticipated that this capacity will be reached between 2009 and 2012. Close to 50% of transiting vessels are already using the full width of the locks.&lt;ref name=acpthird&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/esp/plan/documentos/propuesta/acp-proposla-relevant-information.pdf |format=PDF |title=Relevant Information on the Third Set of Locks Project |publisher=Panama Canal Authority |date=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2006-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An enlargement scheme similar to the 1939 [[History of the Panama Canal#The Third Locks Scheme|Third Lock Scheme]], to allow for a greater number of transits and the ability to handle larger ships, has been under consideration for some time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesspanama.com/investing/why_invest/panama_canal.php |title=The Panama Canal |publisher=Business in Panama |notes=an article on proposed future development of the canal |accessdate=2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been approved by the government of Panama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4876322.stm |title=Panama Canal set for $7.5bn revamp |first=Jane |last=Monahan |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is in progress, with completion expected in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/pr/press-releases/2010/03/12/pr379.html |title=Panama Canal Authority: Panama Canal Expansion is &quot;2009 Project Finance Deal of the Year&quot;, 12 March 2010 |publisher=Pancanal.com |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost is estimated at US$5.25 billion, and the project will double the canal's capacity and allow more traffic and the passage of longer and wider ships. This proposal to expand the canal was approved in a [[Panama Canal expansion referendum, 2006|national referendum]] by approximately 80% on October 22, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/10627208/ |title=Panama approves $5.25 billion canal expansion |publisher=[[MSNBC.com]] |date=2006-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third set of locks project===
{{Main|Panama Canal expansion project}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:newlocks1.jpg|right|thumb|The new locks will be in triple flights, with sliding lock gates on each chamber]] --&gt;

The current plan is for two new flights of locks to be built parallel to, and operated in addition to, the old locks: one to the east of the existing GatÃºn locks, and one south west of Miraflores locks, each supported by approach channels. Each flight will ascend from ocean level direct to the GatÃºn Lake level; the existing two-stage ascent at Miraflores / Pedro Miguel will not be replicated. The new lock chambers will feature sliding gates, doubled for safety, and will be 427&amp;nbsp;meters (1,400&amp;nbsp;ft) long, 55&amp;nbsp;meters (180&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, and 18.3&amp;nbsp;meters (60&amp;nbsp;ft) deep; this will allow the transit of vessels with a beam of up to 49&amp;nbsp;meters (160&amp;nbsp;ft), an overall length of up to 366&amp;nbsp;meters (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft) and a draft of up to 15&amp;nbsp;meters (50&amp;nbsp;ft), equivalent to a container ship carrying around 12,000 twenty-foot (6.1&amp;nbsp;m) long containers (TEU).

The new locks will be supported by new approach channels, including a {{convert|6.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut, skirting around Miraflores Lake. Each of these channels will be 218&amp;nbsp;meters (715&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, which will require post-Panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time. The Gaillard Cut and the channel through GatÃºn Lake will be widened to no less than 280&amp;nbsp;meters (918&amp;nbsp;ft) on the straight portions and no less than 366&amp;nbsp;meters (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft) on the bends. The maximum level of GatÃºn Lake will be raised from reference height 26.7&amp;nbsp;meters (87.5&amp;nbsp;ft) to 27.1&amp;nbsp;meters (89&amp;nbsp;ft).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:newlockscrosssection.jpg|right|thumb|The water storage basins adjacent to each lock chamber are staged in height to allow each of them in turn to be filled by gravity as the lock chamber drains.]] --&gt;Each flight of locks will be accompanied by nine water reutilization basins (three per lock chamber), each basin being approximately 70&amp;nbsp;meters (230&amp;nbsp;ft) wide, 430&amp;nbsp;meters (1410&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 5.50&amp;nbsp;meters (18&amp;nbsp;ft) deep. These gravity-fed basins will allow 60% of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks will consequently use 7% less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes. The deepening of GatÃºn Lake, and the raising of its maximum water level, will also provide significant extra water storage capacity. These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without the construction of new reservoirs.

The estimated cost of the project is US$5.25 billion. The project is designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC/UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC/UMS tons in 2025; the expanded canal will have a maximum sustainable capacity of approximately 600 million PC/UMS tons per year. Tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage, and will not depend on the locks used.

The new locks are expected to open for traffic in 2015. The present locks, which will be 100 years old by that time, will then have greater access for maintenance, and are projected to continue operating indefinitely.&lt;ref name=acpthird/&gt; An article in the February 2007 issue of ''Popular Mechanics'' magazine describes the plans for the canal, focusing on the engineering aspects of the expansion project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/transportation/4212183.html |title=The Panama Canal's Ultimate Upgrade |first=Brad |last=Reagan |work=Popular Mechanics |month=February |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a follow-up article in the February 2010 issue of ''Popular Mechanics'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/transportation/4344444.html?page=1 |title=The Panama Canal Gets a New Lane |first=Andrew |last=Kaufman |work=Popular Mechanics |month=February |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2007, thousands of [[Panamanians]] stood across [[ParaÃ­so]] Hill in Panama to witness a huge [[explosion]] and the launch of the Expansion Program. The first phase of the project will be dry [[excavations]] of the 218 meter (715&amp;nbsp;ft) wide [[trench]] connecting the [[Culebra Cut]] with the [[Pacific coast]], removing 47 million cubic meters of earth and rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0334522620070904 |title=Work starts on biggest-ever Panama Canal overhaul |publisher=Reuters |date=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building the new canal===
It was announced in July 2009 that the [[Belgium|Belgian]] dredging company [[Jan De Nul]], together with a consortium of contractors consisting of the [[Spain|Spanish]] Sacyr Vallehermoso, the [[Italy|Italian]] Impregilo and the Panamanian company Cusa, had been awarded the contract to build  the six new locks. The contract will result in $100 million in dredging works over the next few years for the company, and a great deal of work for the company's construction division. The design of the locks is a carbon copy of the Berendrecht lock which is 68m wide and 500m long, making it the largest lock in the world. Completed in 1989 by the [[Port of Antwerp]], which De Nul helped build, the company still has engineers and specialists who were part of that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediargus.be/flanderstoday.admin.en/rss/22548040.html?via=rss&amp;language=en |title=De Nul dredging company to build locks in Panama Canal |publisher=Flanders Today |date=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rival Colombia rail link===
China is looking into constructing a 220&amp;nbsp;km railway between Colombia's Pacific and Caribbean coasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7e14756c-37a9-11e0-b91a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DvyP1xhi| coauthors= John Paul Rathbone, Naomi Mapstone | title=China in talks over Panama Canal rival|publisher=Financial Times|date=2011-02-13|accessdate=2011-02-14|(subscription required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/02/14/colombias-smart-canal/ | first=Jonathan | last=Wheatley | title=Colombiaâs smart canal | publisher=Financial Times|date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-02/14/c_13731374.htm | title=China in talk with Columbia over transcontinental railway: Colombian president | publisher=Xinhuanet | date=2011-02-14|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch-co-rail&quot;&gt;Branigan, Tania and Lin Yi.

==Canal Pilots==
During the last one hundred years, the [[Autoridad del Canal de PanamÃ¡]] has appointed a few &quot;Panama Canal Honorary Pilots&quot;. The most recent of these were Commodore Ronald Warwick,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buckinghamcovers.com/shop/signer.php?signer_id=458]&lt;/ref&gt; a former [[Captain (nautical)|Master]] of the [[Cunard Line]]'s [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']], who has traversed the Canal more than 50 times, and Captain Raffaele Minotauro, Master Senior Grade, of the former Italian governmental navigation company known in the shipping world as the &quot;[[Italian Line]].

==Gatun Lake==
Created in 1913 by the damming of the Charges River, [[Gatun Lake]] is an essential part of the Panama Canal which forms a water passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, permitting ship transit in both directions. At the time it was formed Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world. The impassable rain-forest around Gatun Lake has been the best defense of the Panama Canal. Today these areas have endured practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas on earth that various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat. World famous Barro Colorado Island, which was established for scientific study when the lake was formed and is today operated by the Smithsonian Institution, is the largest island on Gatun Lake. Many of the most important ground breaking scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here. Lake Gatun encompasses approximately {{convert|180|sqmi|km2}}, a vast tropical ecological zone part of the Atlantic Forest Corridor and Eco-tourism on Gatun Lake has become a worthwhile industry for Panamanians.

Gatun Lake also serves to provide the millions of gallons of water necessary to operate the Panama Canal locks each time a ship passes through and provides drinking water for Panama City and Colon. Angling is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake. It is suspected that the Cichla Pleiozona species of Peacock Bass was introduced by accident to Gatun Lake by a renowned Panamanian aquarist and doctor in 1958. Locally called Sargento these peacock bass are not a native game fish of Panama but originate from the Amazon, Rio Negro and Orinoco river basins of South America where they are called Tucanare or Pavon and are considered a premier game fish. Since 1958 the Cichla Pleiozona species of Peacock Bass have flourished to become the dominant angling game fish in Gatun Lake.
