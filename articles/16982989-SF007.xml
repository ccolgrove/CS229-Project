== Introduction ==
[[Open source software]] can be sold and used commercially.  It is a part of the [[software industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The use of [[dual-licensing]] provides an offer of the software under an [[open source license]] but also under separate proprietary license terms.  Customers can be attracted to a no-cost and open source edition, then be part of an [[up-selling|up-sell]] to a commercial enterprise edition.

Further, customers will learn of open source software in a company's portfolio and offerings but generate business in other proprietary products and solutions, including commercial [[technical support]] contracts and services.  Another possibility is offering open source software in [[source code]] form only, while providing [[executable]] binaries to paying customers only.  With permissive software, any company can distribute the package without the source or [[Free software definition|software freedoms]].

Some companies provide the latest version available only to paying customers.  Companies provide proprietary extensions, modules, plugins or add-ons to an open source package.  Independent developers often accept donations.  [[SourceForge]], for example, lets users donate money to hosted projects which have chosen to accept donations.  Users of a software may come together and pool money into a bounty for the implementation of a desired feature or functionality.

Other financial situations include partnerships with other companies.  Sometimes a commercial version may be sold to finance the continued development of the free version.

Sell [[subscription business model|subscriptions]] for online accounts and server access.  Combine desktop software with a service, [[software plus services]].

Governments, companies or other non-governmental organizations may develop internally or hire a contractor for custom in-house modifications to software, then release that code under an open source license.

== Hybrid ==
A vendor forks a non-copyleft software project then adds closed-source additions to it and sells the resulting software. After a fixed time period the patches are released back upstream under the same license as the rest of the codebase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=sprewell_licensing Phoronix - Towards A Real Business Model For Open-Source Software]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

Much of the Internet runs on open source software tools and utilities such as [[Linux]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[MySQL]], and [[PHP]], known as the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP stack]] for web servers. Using open source appeals to software developers for three main reasons: low or no cost, access to [[source code]] they can tailor themselves, and a shared community that ensures a generally robust code base, with quick fixes for any new issues that surface. 

Despite doing much business in proprietary software, some companies like [[Oracle Corporation]] and [[IBM]] participated in developing free and open source software to deter from [[monopoly|monopolies]] and take a portion of [[market share]] for themselves.  See [[Commercial open source applications]] for the list of current commercial open source offerings.  [[Netscape]]'s actions were an example of this, and thus [[Mozilla Firefox]] has become more popular, stealing market share from Internet Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Netscape Navigator#The fall of Netscape]]&lt;/ref&gt;
