'''Tatra T815''' is a [[truck]] family, produced by [[Czech republic|Czech]] company [[Tatra (car)|Tatra]]. It uses the traditional [[Tatra_%28company%29#Tatra_concept|tatra concept]] of rigid backbone tube and [[Swing axle|swinging half-axles]] giving independent suspension. The vehicles are available in [[4x4]], 6x6, 8x8, 10x8, 10x10, 12x8 and 12x12 variants. There are both air-cooled and liquid-cooled engines available with power ranging from {{convert|230|-|610|kW|hp}}. As a successor to [[Tatra T813]] it was originally designed for extreme off-road condition, while nowadays there are also variants designated for mixed (both off- and on-road) use.

The T815 and its descendant models brought the Czech truck racer [[Karel Loprais]] to victory six times in the [[Paris Dakar Rally]].

Designed to eventually replace [[Tatra T148|T148]] the prototype T157 was introduced in 1970 and several more prototypes were designed between 1970 and 1974 period but no production resulted. Due to protests from another Czech manufacturer [[LIAZ (Czech Republic)|LIAZ]] which was assigned by the government central planning committee to manufacture trucks of similar class Tatra dropped the T157  and instead  started to concentrate on a heavier class as the replacement for [[Tatra T813|T813]] and T148 which was introduced in 1983 as T815 series. In 1989 Tatra modernized T815 series and introduced new T815-2 which received further upgrade in 1994 and just 3 years later in 1997 the new cabin TerrNÂ°1 is introduced. Another facelift followed in 2000 where changes included among others new instrument panel and cab attachment and for the first time there is a option for fitment of liquid-cooled engines. The latest facelift of cabin came in July 2010. Due to emission requirements changes in 2003 Tatra developed all new V8 engine T3C to comply with Euro III where it followed the tradition once again with its air cooling design. The further developed T3D engine was introduced in 2006 with its SCR and Euro IV compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatra T815|url= http://www.tatra-page.kx.cz/Description/T-815.htm|language=czech |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
{{See also|backbone chassis}}
While most other manufacturers derive their trucks from road applications, Tatra T815 was purposely designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions are derived from the off-road original concept. The principle consists in a [[Backbone chassis|central load-carrying tube]] with independently suspended swinging half-axles bolted as one whole. This gives Tatra vehicles outstanding driving qualities in the most difficult terrains. The concept allows higher off-road speed compared to [[Body-on-frame|classical rigid axle design]].

===Central load-carrying tube===
The primary structural feature of Tatra trucks is the central load carrying tube, also called a backbone frame. All other parts of the truck are mounted to this rigid assembly. The inherently high torsional and flexural rigidity of this layout protects superstructures from the motions and forces on the axles. Torque distribution to the axles is also carried within the backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Central load carrying tube|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/roura_en.asp|accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential===
Tatra differentials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatra axles|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/naprava_en.asp|accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a unique design that uses two opposing spiral bevel gears instead of the usual single set. The differential gears are part of the input drive shaft rather than between the output axles as in a [[Differential (mechanical device)|conventional differential]]. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, âlockingâ the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the dual output bevel gears allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input drive shaft goes essentially straight thru the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.

===Suspension===
====Front====
* Mechanical suspension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatra front suspension|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/perov_en.asp|accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of load capacity up to 8 tons per axle by torsion bars â for versions with one steered front axle (4x4 and 6x6) or by leaf springs â for versions with two steered axles (8x8, 10x10 or 12x12).
* Air-bellows,  with a load capacity of 9 tons per axle and a possibility of a ground clearance regulation.

====Rear====
* Mechanical â by leaf springs,  with a load capacity of up to 11.5 tons per axle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatra rear suspension|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/perov1_en.asp|accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air-bellows with a load capacity of 10 tons per axle and a possibility of a ground clearance regulation
* Tatra ''King Frame'' suspension system - combination of an air-bellow with a coil spring placed inside, with a load capacity of up to 11.5 tons per axle or combination of air-bellows with leaf springs, with a load capacity of 13, 15 and 16.5 tons per axle.

All suspension types are equipped with telescopic shock absorbers; some versions also have stabilizer torsion bars.

===Engine===
The Tatra engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatra engines|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/motor_en.asp|accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an air-cooled, 12.7 liter 90Â° [[V8 engine|V8]] diesel engine with direct fuel injection. It is turbo-supercharged, and equipped with an intake air cooler placed directly over the engine. The engine is equipped with a mechanically controlled in-line injection pump. Its roller crankshaft bolted together from individual segments belongs among unique technical solutions. The engine is available in emission specifications [[Euro 2]] - [[Euro 5]] with power output ranging from {{convert|230|to|325|kW|hp}} and {{convert|1400|-|2100|Nm|abbr=on}} torque. V10 and V12 air-cooled Tatra engines also used to be part of T815 line.

Tatra T815 can be fitted also with water-cooled engines made by other manufacturers - notably [[Cummins ISL|Cummins]] and [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] with power ranging from {{convert|260|to|440|kW|hp}} with {{convert|1550|-|2750|Nm|abbr=on}} torque.

The most powerful [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine that can be fitted in T815 has {{convert|610|kW}} displacing 21,930&amp;nbsp;cc.

===Transmission===
[[File:Autojerab-AD30-8X8.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Tatra T815 8x8 crane with low cab]]
* Manually controlled mechanical Tatra transmission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Tatra transmissions|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/prevod_en.asp|accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is mounted directly on the auxiliary transmission case, and which, therefore, is an integrated part of the chassis with 10 or 14 gears with two auxiliary gears.
* An electronically controlled gear shifting  Tatra - a driver using a joystick just pre-sets a speed gear, and after the clutch is engaged, the speed shifting is carried out. The driver is informed about the shifted speed gear by means of a dashboard display.
* [[Twin Disc]] which is a six-gear auto transmission of 1189 or 1177 type
* [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] six or seven-gear automatic transmission with a compact construction in one case, with a torque converter, which are mounted directly on the engine

===Cab===
[[File:Brno, Autotec 2008, hasiÄskÃ¡ Tatra.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Tatra T815 TERRN&amp;deg;1 4x4 fire engine]]
Tatra T815 is equipped with own Tatra-produced [[Cab Over Engine|COE]] cab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tatra cab|url=http://www.tatra.cz/web_en/kabina_en.asp|accessdate= 11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is basic version, extended version with room behind seats used for a berth and especially for fire-fighting applications a long four-door cab enabling transportation of up to six persons.

There is also special low cab version used mostly for cranes and other special applications. The cab is situated in front of the front axle.

===Equipment===
