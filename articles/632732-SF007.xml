The network is funded by the [[Higher Education Authority]] and is a [[Wide area network|WAN]]-based network.

In 1984 the network was created with assistance from [[Dublin Institute of Technology]], [[Dublin City University]], [[University of Limerick]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|University College, Cork]], [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|University College, Dublin]] and [[National University of Ireland, Galway|University College, Galway]]. Today approximately 50 organisations support its work, including the [[Institutes of technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]] as well as other colleges and non-education organisations in Ireland.

HEAnet helped set up [[Internet Neutral Exchange|INEX]], the Internet Neutral EXchange, to allow [[internet service provider]] systems to interchange traffic within Ireland and was the first to connect at 10 Gbit/s. HEAnet is connected to INEX via two 10 Gbit/s links, [[JANET]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] via two 1 Gbit/s links, [[GEANT]] in Europe via two 10 Gbit/s links and the General Internet via two 10 Gbit/s links. They also have several links to research networks in [[North America]]. Additionally there are several non-research links to the USA, Europe and South-East Asia.

HEAnet also hosts a popular [http://ftp.heanet.ie mirror service], which acts as a mirror for projects such as [[SourceForge.net]], [[Debian]], [[Gentoo]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Red Hat]].
