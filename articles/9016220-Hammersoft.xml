In '''''[[Power Rangers Operation Overdrive]]''''', the [[Operation Overdrive Power Rangers]] use exploratory-based [[Zord]]s, which can be controlled through the [[Control Console Drivers]]. During the last fight against Flurious they were shown to be damaged, not destroyed.

All of the Zords in Operation Overdrive are collectively known as the DriveMax Zords. Their numbers reflect the order in which they were given to the Rangers and, in the case of Zords 1-5, reflect the chain of command among the five core Rangers. The DriveMax Zords can be broken down into the following groups:

==Primary DriveMax Zords==
The 5 core Rangers' primary Zords. They are typically called first and make up the Rangers' primary Megazord.

===1. Dump Driver===
[[Dump truck|Dump]] Driver: The Dump Driver is the Red Ranger's main Zord. It is capable of hauling many tons of material and is equipped with lasers, and claws. When the DriveMax Megazord, Super DriveMax Megazord or DriveMax Ultrazord is formed, the Dump Driver makes up the Head, Main Body, and Legs.

===2. Speed Driver===
[[Open wheel car|Speed]] Driver: The Speed Driver is the Black Ranger's main Zord. It is capable of high speed and is equipped with missiles. When the DriveMax Megazord is formed, the Speed Driver makes up the Chest. When the Super DriveMax Megazord or DriveMax Ultrazord is formed the Speed Driver makes up the back.

===3. Gyro Driver===
[[Autogyro|Gyro]] Driver: The Gyro Driver is the Blue Ranger's main Zord. It is capable of high speed flight and is equipped with lasers and a rescue line. When the DriveMax Megazord is formed, the Gyro Driver makes up the Helmet and Back. When the Super DriveMax Megazord is formed, it makes up the spine, and when the DriveMax Ultrazord is formed, it makes up the waist.

===4. Dozer Driver===
[[Bulldozer|Dozer]] Driver: The Dozer Drive is the Yellow Ranger's main Zord. It is capable of earth dozing and is equipped with lasers. When the DriveMax Megazord is formed, the Dozer Driver make up the Right Arm. When the Super DriveMax Megazord or DriveMax Ultrazord is formed, it becomes part of the right leg. The Dozer and Sub Drivers can combine with Flash Point Megazord to form a currently unnamed formation that allows Flash Point to use the Drive Digger Saber Mode.

===5. Sub Driver===
[[Submarine|Sub]] Driver: The Sub Driver is the Pink Ranger's main Zord. It is the only zord capable of deep sea searching, in part by having a double plated hull, which makes it impervious to millions of [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] of water pressure. It is also equipped with mounted laser cannons. The speed of the Sub Driver borders breaking the sound barrier. When the DriveMax Megazord is formed, the Sub Driver forms the left arm. When the Super DriveMax Megazord or DriveMax Ultrazord is formed, it becomes a component of the left leg. The Dozer and Sub Drivers can combine with Flash Point Megazord to form a currently unnamed formation that allows Flash Point to use the Drive Digger Saber Mode.

==Auxiliary DriveMax Zords==
Additional DriveMax vehicles that can power-up the DriveMax Megazord as well as the Flashpoint Megazord. These Zords themselves can combine and form the Dual Drive Megazord.

===6. Drill Driver===
[[Tunnel boring machine|Drill]] Driver: Being exceptionally powerful, the orange Drill Driver was difficult to operate during its first use by the Red Ranger but is now driven by the Yellow Ranger. It is capable of drilling through material (earth, ice, etc.) at high speeds. It can replace the Dozer Driver on the DriveMax Megazord to form the DriveMax Megazord Drill Formation, giving the Megazord a finishing move where it uses the Drill to pierce through an enemy. With the Crane Driver combined, it forms the DriveMax Megazord Drill and Crane Formation, allowing the Megazord to lift its enemies off the ground and suspending them in mid-air while using the Drill finisher. With the Cement Driver combined, it forms the DriveMax Megazord Drill and Mixer Formation allowing the Megazord to do both its Drill and Mixer finishing moves. It is also the right arm for the Dual Drive Megazord, Super DriveMax Megazord and the DriveMax Ultrazord. The Drill and the Shovel Drivers can also combine with the Flash Point Megazord to form the Flash Point Megazord Drill and Shovel Formation replacing Rescue Runners 1 and 2. In addition, the Drill and Cement Drivers can attach to Flash Point Megazord to form Flash Point Megazord Drill and Mixer Formation.

===7. Shovel Driver===
[[Excavator|Shovel]] Driver: The [[cyan]] Shovel Driver is the Pink Ranger's second Zord. It is capable of digging through earth and using a powerful swing attack. It can replace the Sub Driver on the DriveMax Megazord to form the DriveMax Megazord Shovel Formation, giving the Megazord a Power Punch finisher. It is also the left arm for the Dual Drive Megazord, Super DriveMax Megazord and the DriveMax Ultrazord. The Shovel and the Drill Drivers can also combine with the Flash Point Megazord to form the Flash Point Megazord Drill and Shovel Formation replacing Rescue Runners 1 and 2.

===8. Cement Driver===
[[Concrete mixer|Cement]] Driver: The green Cement Driver is the Blue Ranger's second Zord. It is capable of firing a blast of cement, immobilizing and containing a target. It can replace the Sub Driver on the DriveMax Megazord to form the DriveMax Megazord Mixer Formation, giving the Megazord a cement-blast finisher. With the Drill Driver combined, it forms the DriveMax Megazord Drill and Mixer Formation allowing the Megazord to do both its Drill and Mixer finishing moves. This is also possible for Flash Point Megazord, forming Flash Point Megazord Drill and Mixer Formation. Finally, the Cement Driver functions as the right leg for the Dual Drive Megazord, and the right foot for the Super DriveMax Megazord and DriveMax Ultrazord.

===9. Crane Driver===
[[Crane (machine)#Truck-mounted crane|Crane]] Driver : The purple Crane Driver the Black Ranger's second Zord, though it was temporarily driven by the Red Ranger at one point. It is capable of grabbing enemies with its claw and then swinging them around in the air with a powerful attack. It can replace the Sub Driver on the DriveMax Megazord to form DriveMax Megazord Crane Formation, allowing the Megazord to use its crane arm for a long-distance punch or to retrieve items from afar. Together with the Drill Driver, it forms the DriveMax Megazord Drill and Crane Formation, allowing the Megazord to lift its enemies off the ground and suspending them in mid-air while using the Drill finisher. It is also the left foot and helmet for the Super DriveMax Megazord and DriveMax Ultrazord and left leg for the Dual Drive Megazord.

===10. Sonic Streaker===
Sonic Streaker: A multi-colored [[jet plane]], piloted by the Red Ranger as his second Zord. It has the same speed and agility of S.H.A.R.C., but with the most advanced weapons. When the Dual Drive Megazord is formed it makes up the body and head. When the DriveMax Ultrazord is formed, the Sonic Streaker makes up of the wings, the chest, the belt, and the helmet which covers the head entirely.

==Rescue Runners==
The Rescue Runners are the Mercury Ranger's personal fleet of DriveMax Zords. They are based on rescue and emergency vehicles.

===11. Rescue Runner 3===
Rescue Runner 3  : A red [[fire truck]] designed for Tyzonn by Andrew Hartford. It has hydraulic lifts to raise the Zord to any height to extinguish fires or attack enemies. It is the legs, torso and head of the Flash Point Megazord.

===12. Rescue Runner 1===
Rescue Runner 1: An [[ambulance]] designed by Andrew and given to Tyzonn. It is controlled by Tyzonn from the cockpit of the Fire Truck Zord. It hovers in the air, allowing it to fly around enemies and blast them with its lasers. It becomes the left arm of the Flash Point Megazord. Rescue Runners 1 and 2 can combine with DriveMax Ultrazord; the formation is currently unnamed and only showed up in one appearance, where the Ultrazord stayed dormant while Flash Point finished the battle. They can also combine with DriveMax Megazord to form a currently unnamed formation that allows DriveMax to fire the Rescue Runners' lasers.

===13. Rescue Runner 2===
Rescue Runner 2: A [[police car]] designed by Andrew and given to Tyzonn. It is also controlled by Tyzonn from the cockpit of the Fire Truck Zord. It hovers in the air, allowing it to fly around enemies and blast them with its lasers. It becomes the right arm of the Flash Point Megazord. Rescue Runners 1 and 2 can combine with DriveMax Ultrazord; the formation is currently unnamed and only showed up in one appearance, where the Ultrazord stayed dormant while Flash Point finished the battle. They can also combine with DriveMax Megazord to form a currently unnamed formation that allows DriveMax to fire the Rescue Runners' lasers.

==BattleFleet Zord==
The BattleFleet Zord is an amphibious battleship composed of five smaller component Zords. Like the Rescue Runners, they follow the same numerical sequence as the other DriveMax Zords, despite having a unique name, suggesting again that all 18 Zords are collectively known as the DriveMax Zords.

==Megazords==
===DriveMax Megazord===
When the Rangers combine their five primary Zords, they form the DriveMax Megazord. The Megazord is armed with the Drive Digger shovel and a [[pick axe]] to attack its opponents. These two weapons can be joined together to form the Drive Digger Saber Mode. With the Saber, the DriveMax Megazord can form an energy seal, shaped like the Operation Overdrive logo, to slash at opponents, destroying them.

====DriveMax Megazord Modes====
*Mega Truck: The DriveMax Megazord can transform into a truck form, the Mega Truck, that has Speed and Gyro Driver as the tractor portion and Dump Driver as the trailer, with Dozer and Sub Driver in Dump Driver's bucket.

===Super DriveMax Megazord===
When the Rangers combine the Drill, Shovel, Cement, and Crane Drivers with the DriveMax Megazord, it forms the Super DriveMax Megazord. This combination can use the Cement Driver to freeze an opponent, and can headbutt enemies using its helmet. Its finishing attack involves a double strike with the Drill and Shovel Drivers while thrusting itself forward using the Cement and Crane Drivers to roll along the ground.

===DriveMax Ultrazord===
When the Super DriveMax Megazord combines with the powerful Sonic Streaker, they form the DriveMax Ultrazord. It is capable of flight and destroys enemies by charging the solar panel on its chest and firing an energy blast at them. It can also switch arms with the Flash Point Megazord, replacing the Drill and Shovel Drivers with Rescue Runners 1 and 2.

The DriveMax Ultrazord was piloted by four of the returning Power Rangers [[Tori Hanson]], [[Kira Ford]], [[Bridge Carson]] and [[Xander Bly]] in the 15th anniversary team-up special [[Once A Ranger]], when the Overdrive Rangers had lost their powers. But the right arm was damaged during battle.

====DriveMax Ultrazord Modes====
*DriveMax Ultrazord Rescue Formation: A combined Megazord of Ultra Zord and Flash Point Megazord.

===Flash Point Megazord===
When the Mercury Ranger's Rescue Runners combine, they form the Flash Point Megazord. Its primary weapons are the water cannons on the Fire Truck Zord and the lasers on Rescue Runners 1 and 2. It uses the Fire Truck's hydraulic lifts as legs that can raise and lower the Megazord to evade attacks. Its finisher, ''Hydro Blast'', involves all three of its water cannons, including one normally retracted behind its head, firing at once.

The Flash Point Megazord was piloted by [[Adam Park]], the second Black Ranger of the [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]] in the 15th anniversary team-up special [[Once A Ranger]].
