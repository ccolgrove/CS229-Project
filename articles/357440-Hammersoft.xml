'''MÃ¡rio Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Tower and Sword|GColTE]]&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]]&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Liberty|GColL]]&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Elephant|KE]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pt|ËmaÉ¾iu suËaÉ¾É¨Ê}}; born 7 December 1924), [[Portugal|Portuguese]] politician, served as [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] from 1976 to 1978 and from 1983 to 1985, and subsequently as the [[List of Presidents of Portugal|17th]] [[President of Portugal]] from 1986 to 1996.

==Family==
Soares is the son of JoÃ£o Lopes Soares ([[Leiria]], Arrabal, 17 November 1878 - [[Lisbon]], Campo Grande, 31 July 1970), Founder of the ColÃ©gio Moderno in Lisbon, [[Minister (government)|Minister]] and then anti-fascist republican activist who had been a [[Priest#Roman Catholic and Orthodox|Priest]] for some time before marrying Elisa Nobre Baptista ([[SantarÃ©m, Portugal|SantarÃ©m]], Pernes, 8 September 1887 - [[Lisbon]], Campo Grande, 28 February 1955), MÃ¡rio Soares's mother, at the 7th Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon on 5 September 1934. His father also had another son by an unknown mother named Tertuliano Lopes Soares. His mother had previously been married and had two children, J. Nobre Baptista and CÃ¢ndido Nobre Baptista. MÃ¡rio Soares was raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], but came to identify himself as a [[Laicism|laic]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] and [[Atheism|atheist]].

==Early life==
Soares was born in [[Lisbon]], CoraÃ§Ã£o de Jesus, and graduated in [[History]] and [[Philosophy]] from the [[University of Lisbon]]. He became a university lecturer in 1957, but his activities in opposition to the dictatorship of [[AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar]] led to repeated arrests. He was active in resistance groups such as the Movement for Anti-Fascist National Unity and the Movement for Democratic Unity.

Soares began his studies at ColÃ©gio Moderno, owned by his father. There, for a short period he was taught [[Geography]] by [[Ãlvaro Cunhal]], who would later became the towering figure of Portuguese Communism and one of Soares' greatest political rivals. 

While a student at University, Soares joined the [[Portuguese Communist Party]], being responsible for the youth section. In this capacity, he organised demonstrations in [[Lisbon]] to celebrate the end of [[World War II|WWII]]. He was first arrested by [[PIDE]], the Portuguese political police, in 1946, when he was a member of the Central Committee of the [[Movement of Democratic Unity]] ({{lang-pt|Movimento de Unidade DemocrÃ¡tica}}), at the time chaired by [[MÃ¡rio Azevedo Gomes]]. Soares was arrested twice in 1949. On those latter occasions, he was the secretary of General [[Norton de Matos]], a candidate for the Presidency. However, he became estranged from [[Norton de Matos]], when the latter discovered Soares's Communist sympathies.  
    
Soares married [[Maria Barroso|Maria de Jesus Barroso Soares]], an [[actress]], in 22 February 1949, while in the [[Aljube]] prison, at the 3rd Conservatory of the Civil Register of [[Lisbon]]. They have a son, the former Lisbon Mayor [[JoÃ£o Soares (politician)|JoÃ£o Soares]], and a daughter, Isabel Barroso Soares, b. 1951, who manages the ColÃ©gio Moderno.
    
Soares's multiple arrests for political activism made it impossible for him to continue with his career as a lecturer of history and philosophy. Therefore, he decided to study law and become an attorney of the bandits (including himself).

==Political activity during the ''Estado Novo''==
In 1958, Soares was very active in the presidential election supporting General [[Humberto Delgado]]. Later, he would become Delgado's family lawyer, when Humberto Delgado was murdered in 1965, in [[Spain]], by agents of the dictatorship's secret police (PIDE).

In April 1964, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], Soares together with [[Francisco Ramos da Costa]] and [[Manuel Tito de Morais]] created the ''AcÃ§Ã£o Socialista Portuguesa'' ([[Portuguese Socialist Action]]). At this point he was already quite distant from his former Communist friends (having quit the Communist Party in 1951); his views were now clearly inclined to [[economic liberalism]]. 

In March 1968, Soares was arrested again by PIDE, and a military tribunal sentenced him to banishment in the colony of [[SÃ£o TomÃ©]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. His wife and two children, Isabel and JoÃ£o, accompanied him. However, they returned to Lisbon eight months later for in the meantime dictator [[Salazar]] had been replaced by [[Marcello Caetano]]. The new dictator wanted to present a more democratic face to the world, so many political prisoners, Soares among them, were released.     

In the 1969 general election, which was rigged, the democratic opposition (whose political rights were severely restricted) entered with two different lists. MÃ¡rio Soares participates actively in the campaign supporting the ''ColigaÃ§Ã£o Eleitoral de Unidade DemocrÃ¡tica'' or CEUD ([[Electoral Coalition for Democratic Unity]]). CEUD is clearly anti-fascist, but they also reaffirmed their opposition to Communism.

In 1970, Soares was exiled to [[Rome]], [[Italy]], but eventually settled in [[France]] where he taught at the [[University of Vincennes|Universities of Vincennes]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Rennes 2 â Upper Brittany|Rennes]]. In 1973, the Portuguese Socialist Action became the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], and Soares was elected Secretary-General. The Socialist party was created under the umbrella of [[Willy Brandt]]'s SPD in [[Bad MÃ¼nstereifel]], [[Germany]], on 19 April 1973.

==Democracy==
On 25 April 1974, elements of the [[Military of Portugal|Portuguese Army]] seized power in Lisbon, overthrowing Salazar's successor, [[Marcelo Caetano]]. Soares and other political exiles returned home to celebrate what was called the &quot;[[Carnation Revolution]].&quot;

In the provisional government which was formed after the revolution, led by the Movement of the Armed Forces (MFA), Soares became minister for overseas negotiations, charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas colonies. Among other encounters, he met with [[Samora Machel]], the leader of [[Frelimo]], to negotiate the independence of [[Mozambique]].

Within months of the revolution however, it became apparent that the [[Portuguese Communist Party]], allied with a radical group of officers in the MFA, was attempting to extend its control over the government. The Prime Minister, [[Vasco dos Santos GonÃ§alves]], was accused of being an agent of the Communists and a bitter confrontation developed between the Socialists and Communists over control of the newspaper ''[[RepÃºblica]]''.

==Prime minister==
Democratic government was finally established when national elections were held in April 1976. The Socialists won a plurality of seats and Soares became [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]]. But the deep hostility between the Socialists and the Communists made a left-wing majority government impossible, and Soares formed a weak minority government. Vast fiscal and current account deficits generated by previous governments forced Soares to adopt a strict austerity policy, which made him deeply unpopular. Soares had to resign from office after only two years, in 1978.

The wave of left-wing sentiment which followed the 1974 revolution had now dissipated, and a succession of conservative governments held office until 1983, when Soares again became Prime Minister, holding office until late 1985. His main achievement in office was negotiating Portugal's entry into the [[European Economic Community]]. Soares almost single-handedly turned public opinion around, for Portugal at the time was very wary of integration into the [[EEC]].

==Presidency==
In the [[Portuguese presidential election, 1986]], held in March, Soares was elected President of Portugal, beating [[Diogo Freitas do Amaral]] by little more than 2%. He was reelected in 1991, this time with almost 70% of the vote. For most of Soares' two terms of office, Portugal was governed by the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], led by [[AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva]].

He devised the so-called ''PresidÃªncia Aberta'' (Open Presidency), a series of tours around the country, each addressing a particular issue, such as the [[natural environment|Environment]] or a particular region of Portugal. Although generally well received by the public, some claimed that he was criticizing the government and exceeding his constitutional role. Others stated that the tours were in the style of medieval courts. Yet the name stuck for today's presidential initiatives of the same type.

==Post presidency==
[[Image:MÃ¡rio Soares.jpg|thumb|right|95px|left|MÃ¡rio Soares in 2006]]
*Soares retired in 1996, but in 1998 he headed the Independent World Commission on the Oceans.

*In 1999 he also headed the Socialist ticket in elections to the [[European Parliament]], where he served until the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 elections]]. He ran for President of the Parliament, but lost to [[Nicole Fontaine]].

*In 2000 he was awarded the [[North-South Prize]].

*In March 2005, he launched a petition urging the [[European Union]] to start membership talks with [[Cape Verde]].

*On 30 August 2005, he announced his candidacy to [[Portuguese presidential election, 2006|run for President]] in the election that occurred in 22 January 2006, when he was 81 years old. However, he lost the election to [[AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva]] and was even behind [[Manuel Alegre]], receiving 14% of the vote. ''&quot;The results went against my expectations. I accept this defeat with a feeling of mission accomplished, [...]&quot;'' he said, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4636448.stm conceding defeat]. It was suggested (in RTP1 TV-Programme ''PrÃ³s e Contras'', in March 2008), that one of the reasons for the weak vote could be the Portuguese were reluctant to elect any President for more than 2 terms (only allowed by the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976]] if non-consecutive).

* In the TV-programme [[Os Grandes Portugueses]] (English: The Greatest Portuguese), he was voted 12th, the highest-placed among living people chosen by the public. Dictator [[AntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar]] would eventually win.

* He is also a member of the strongest [[Masonic lodge]] of Portugal.

* He is currently president of the ''[[FundaÃ§Ã£o MÃ¡rio Soares]]'' (MÃ¡rio Soares Foundation).

* He also sits in the board of Directors of the [[FundaÃ§Ã£o Oriente]].

* He is also a Member of the [[Portuguese Council of State]], as a former elected [[President of Portugal]].

After the general elections of Finland, 17 April 2011, MÃ¡rio Soares, presented an opinion according of which ''Finland has changed into a extremely conservative country, where solidarity is unknown.'' Soares reminded the memory of [[Kalevi Sorsa]] comparing his generosity and those dwarfs, who now want to rule Finland, their ethical values and hostility against Portugal with great difference. Accordin to Soares the Finns live in illusion believing that ''speculative markets and credit criminals can destroy nations with nine hundred years independent history''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/mobiili/kl_mobiili/uutinen.jsp?oid=20110471549&amp;ext=nwnd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards==
* 1993 - Grand Cross of the [[Order of Merit of the Polish Republic]]
* 1994 - Grand Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]]
* Grand Master of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]]

In 1998, Soares won the [[International SimÃ³n BolÃ­var Prize]] of [[UNESCO]].

In 2000, Soares received the [[North-South Prize]] of the [[Council of Europe]].

He is an honorary member of the [[Club of Rome]] and a member of [[High Council of Francophonie]].

He is [[Doctor Honoris Causa]] from the [[University of Rennes]] 2 Haute Bretagne, [[Free University of Brussels]] and [[University of Bordeaux]] III2.
