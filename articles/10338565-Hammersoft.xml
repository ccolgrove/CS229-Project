'''KKSN''' is a commercial [[radio station]] licensed to [[Vancouver, Washington]], broadcasting to the [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Clark County, Washington]] area on 910 [[AM Broadcasting|AM]].  KKSN is owned by [[Entercom]] and airs a local music format branded as &quot;94/7 too&quot; (simulcasting [[KNRK|KNRK-HD2]]).

==History==
The 910 AM frequency signed on the air in 1939 as '''KVAN''' and aired a [[country music]] format in the 1950s.
From 1959 to 1976, 910&amp;nbsp;kHz was used by station [[KISN (Portland)|KISN]], which during its tenure had a Top 40 format.  KISN was shut down by the FCC in September 1976 after a political bias scandal.&lt;ref name=&quot;pt-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Portland Tribune]] |title=Time to kiss KISN goodbye, again |url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=117253009218677600 |first=Phil |last=Stanford |date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://members.tripod.com/gsmo/91.html | title = KISN AM 91-wonderful Tribute Page (1959-76) | | accessdate = 2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current station, which came on the air as '''KKSN''' in 1980, has aired numerous formats, including [[classical music|classical]] and [[adult standards]] (as &quot;Sunny 910&quot;), from 1987 to 1998.  From 1998 to 2004, it was [[sports radio]] station '''[[KFXX (AM)|KFXX]]''', which has since moved to 1080&amp;nbsp;kHz.  910 then switched to [[hot talk]] as '''KOTK''' (&quot;Max 910&quot;) then in 2005 to [[oldies]] as '''KKSN''', picking up the oldies format after [[KYCH-FM|KKSN-FM]] 97.1 (&quot;KISN-FM&quot;) flipped to adult hits as &quot;Charlie FM&quot;.

On February 15, 2007 KKSN 910 AM changed their call letters to '''KTRO'''; and on March 28, 2007, [[KTRO-FM]] changed their format to regional Mexican and changed their call letters to [[KRYP]], and the existing talk format continued on KTRO 910 AM.  The station is owned by [[Entercom]] but was programmed by [[Salem Communications]].  The former program lineup ([[Dennis Prager]], [[Hugh Hewitt]], [[Laura Ingraham]], etc.) was similar to that found on other Salem stations throughout the [[United States]].

On January 5, 2009, the station switched to a simulcast of [[KWJJ]], an FM country music station. The [[local marketing agreement|LMA]] with Salem Communications expired.{{When|date=June 2009}}

On May 1, 2009, KTRO switched to [[ESPN Deportes Radio]], a Spanish-language sports talk network.&lt;ref name=&quot;ruf&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=James |last=Day |work=Statesman Journal |title=Area radio stations alter programming; Some of the talk shows on KFXX will be tough to receive for area listeners |url=http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20090504/SPORTS/905040349/1001/NEWS/Area+radio+stations+alter+programming |date=May 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 2010 KTRO changed their call letters back to '''KKSN'''.  The station dropped ESPN Deportes Radio on July 12, 2010 in favor of simulcasting the programming of [[KNRK|KNRK-HD2]], which airs music from local bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;aa-knrkhd2onkksn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Several Changes At KNRK|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/76393/several-changes-at-knrk|accessdate=June 9, 2010|newspaper=All Access|date=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
