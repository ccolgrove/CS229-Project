'''Webster's''' ('''Samuel Webster &amp; Sons Limited'''), was a [[brewery]] founded in 1838 by Samuel Webster which operated at the Fountain Head Brewery in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England until 1996. Its two most famous brands, Webster's ''Green Label'', a [[mild ale|light mild]], and ''Yorkshire Bitter'' continue to be sold, although the [[cask conditioned]] versions were discontinued in 2010. Silvan Brands have owned the company since 2003 when they bought it from [[Scottish &amp; Newcastle]]. The company's [[tied house|tied estate]] concentrated on its Halifax heartland, and then spread throughout [[West Yorkshire]]. The brand spread to other areas of the [[United Kingdom]] following the company's takeover by the national brewer [[Watney Mann]] in 1972, and by the 1980s Webster's beers were available across the country. Perhaps their most famous advertising slogan was 'Drives out the northern thirst'. Webster's was also known for its sponsorship of numerous sporting events throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly [[cricket]] and horse racing.

The brewery was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs due to overcapacity in the brewing industry, but also lower sales as a result of diminished marketing support for the Webster's brand after it was acquired by [[Courage Brewery]] as part of its takeover of the [[Grand Metropolitan]] beer brands. After the brewery's closure, Webster's branded beers were initially brewed at the [[John Smith's Brewery]] in [[Tadcaster]], and were subsequently moved to the Thomas Hardy Brewery at [[Burtonwood]] in 2004. The former brewery site has since been converted into a housing estate, the [[Grade II]] listed Old Maltings building has been converted into an adult learning centre and the former visitor's centre, located in a seventeeth century building, into a pub called Long Can Hall. Some public houses in the Halifax area still retain Webster's branding, although very few still sell Webster's beers.
