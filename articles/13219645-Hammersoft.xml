The [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova Wildcats]] entered the 2007â08 season with much uncertainty, after losing star [[Curtis Sumpter]], guard Mike Nardi, and center Will Sheridan to graduation.  The departure of three experienced starters leaves the Wildcats a young team with no seniors.  Villanova has replenished the ranks with three talented freshmen:  Parade All-American [[Corey Fisher]], [[McDonald's All-American]] [[Corey Stokes]], and Malcolm Grant.  Returning players include [[sophomore]] [[Scottie Reynolds]] and juniors Shane Clark and Dante Cunningham.  The team will be further augmented by Antonio Pena and Andrew Ott, both returning from [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] freshman years.  

The Wildcats are known for their guards, having seven on their roster.  Coach [[Jay Wright (coach)|Jay Wright]] often puts up to four guards on the floor simultaneously, including multiple [[point guard]]s.  Returning sophomore [[Scottie Reynolds]] is joined by fellow-sophomore Reggie Redding, and freshmen [[Corey Fisher]], Malcolm Grant, and [[Corey Stokes]].  

Villanova's frontcourt is anchored by veterans Shane Clark and Dante Cunningham.  Sophomore Cassiem Drummond and freshman Antonio Pena complete the frontcourt.  

The Wildcats' quickness and guard-oriented style of play creates matchup problems for opponents, but can leave them vulnerable to a talented team with a tall frontcourt.  

The 2007â08 schedule includes 18 [[Big East]] contests, a trip to [[Orlando, Florida]] for the [[Old Spice Classic]], a home game against [[LSU Tigers basketball|LSU]] in the Big East/SEC Invitational, four games against [[Philadelphia Big 5|Big Five]] rivals, and home games against [[Stony Brook University|Stony Brook]], [[Bucknell University|Bucknell]], [[University of Hartford|Hartford]], and [[Columbia University|Columbia]].  

Villanova finished the regular season with a record of 19â11 overall and 9â9 in the Big East.

The Wildcats received a #12 seed in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008 NCAA Tournament]] in which they defeated the #5 seed [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson Tigers]] and the #13 seed [[Siena Saints men's basketball#2007â2008|Siena Saints]]. They reached the Sweet Sixteen before they were defeated by #1 seed Kansas 72â57 on March 28, 2008. This was the third time in 4 years that Villanova was eliminated from the tournament by the eventual champion. In 2005, Villanova reached the Sweet 16 before being defeated by eventual tournament champion North Carolina. In 2006, Villanova reached the Elite Eight before being defeated by eventual champion Florida. The team finished with a 22â13 record, and 10â10 record in the Big East.
