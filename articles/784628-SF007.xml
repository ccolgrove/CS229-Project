An '''eyelid''' is a thin fold of skin that covers and protects an [[human eye|eye]]. With the exception of the [[prepuce]] and the [[labia minora]], it has the thinnest skin of the whole body. The [[levator palpebrae superioris muscle]] retracts the eyelid to &quot;open&quot; the eye. This can be either voluntarily or involuntarily.  The human eyelid features a row of [[eyelash]]es which serve to heighten the protection of the eye from dust and foreign debris, as well as from perspiration. &quot;Palpebral&quot; (and &quot;blepharo&quot;) means relating to the eyelids.  Its key function is to regularly spread the tears and other secretions on the eye surface to keep it moist, since the cornea must be continuously moist.  They keep the eyes from drying out when asleep.  Moreover, the blink reflex protects the eye from foreign bodies.

==Anatomy==
===Layers===
The eyelid is made up of several layers; from superficial to deep, these are:  [[skin]], [[Subcutis|subcutaneous tissue]], [[Orbicularis oculi muscle|orbicularis oculi]], [[orbital septum]] &amp; [[Tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal plates]], and palpebral [[conjunctiva]]. The [[meibomian glands]] lie within the eyelid and secrete the lipid part of the [[tears|tearfilm]].

===Skin===
The skin is similar to areas elsewhere, but has more pigment cells.  In diseased persons these may wander and cause a discoloration of the lids.  It contains sweat glands and hairs, the latter becoming eyelashes as the border of the eyelid is met.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot; EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]].  Chicago: EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innervation===
In humans, the sensory nerve supply to the upper eyelids is from the [[infratrochlear]], [[supratrochlear]], [[supraorbital]] and the [[lacrimal nerve]]s from the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the [[trigeminal nerve]] (CN V). The skin of the lower eyelid is supplied by branches of the [[infratrochlear]] at the medial angle, the rest is supplied by branches of the [[infraorbital nerve]] of the maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve.

As with most of the muscles of the orbit, it is innervated by the superior division of the oculomotor nerve (Cranial Nerve III). This is why when one looks upward, the eyelid tends to move up with it. [1] An adjoining smooth muscle, the superior tarsal muscle, is sympathetically innervated and is occasionally considered to be part of the levator palpebrae superioris.

===Blood supply===
In humans, the eyelids are supplied with blood by two arches on each upper and lower lid. The arches are formed by [[anastamoses]] of the [[lateral palpebral arteries]] and [[medial palpebral arteries]], branching off from the [[lacrimal artery]] and [[ophthalmic artery]], respectively.

==Death==
After [[death]], it is common in many cultures to pull the eyelids of the [[deceased]] down to close the eyes. This is a typical part of the [[last offices]].

==Eyelid disorders==
Any condition that affects the eyelid is called eyelid disorder. The most common eyelid disorders, their causes, symptoms and treatments are the following:

* '''Hordeolum''' ([[stye]]) is an infection of the [[sebaceous gland]]s of [[Zeiss]] usually caused by [[Staphylococcus aureus]] [[bacteria]]. It is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms and it looks like a red bump placed underneath the eyelid. The main symptoms of styes include pain, redness of the eyelid and sometimes swollen eyelids. Styes usually disappear within a week without treatment. Otherwise, [[antibiotic]]s may be prescribed and home remedies such as warm water compresses may be used to promote faster healing. Styes are normally harmless and do not cause long lasting damage.

* '''[[Chalazion]]''' is caused by the obstruction of the oil [[glands]] and can occur in both upper and lower eyelids. Chalazia may be mistaken as styes due to the similar symptoms. This condition is however less painful and it tends to be chronic. Chalazia heals within few months if treatment is administered and otherwise it can resorb within two years. Chalazia that do not respond to topical medication is usually treated with surgery as a last resort.

* '''[[Blepharitis]]''' is a common condition that causes inflammation of the eyelids and which is quite difficult to manage because it tends to recur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blepharitis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/blepharitis/blepharitis.asp |title=Facts About Blepharitis |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is mainly caused by staphylococcus infection and scalp [[dandruff]]. Blepharitis symptoms include burning sensation, the feeling that there is something in the eye, excessive tearing, blurred vision, redness of the eye, light sensitivity, red and swollen eyelids, dry eye and sometimes crusting of the eyelashes on awakening. Treatment normally consists in maintaining a good hygiene of the eye and holding warm compresses on the affected eyelid to remove the crusts. Gently scrubbing the eyelid with the warm compress is recommended as it eases the healing process. In more serious cases, antibiotics may be prescribed.

* '''[[Entropion]]''' usually results from aging, but sometimes can be due to a [[congenital defect]], a spastic eyelid muscle, or a scar on the inside of the lid that could be from surgery, injury, or disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyelid&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/eyelid-disorders |title=Eyelid Disorders |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[asymptomatic]] condition that can rarely lead to [[trichiasis]] which requires surgery. It mostly affects the lower lid and it is characterized by the turning inward of the lid, toward globe.

* '''[[Ectropion]]''' is another aging-related eyelid condition that causes chronic eye irritation and scarring. It may also be the result of [[Allergy|allergies]] and its main symptoms are excessive tearing and hardening of the eyelid conjunctiva.

* '''Eyelid [[edema]]''' is a condition in which the eyelids are swollen and contain excessive fluid. It may be serious when it increases the intraocular pressure. Eyelid edema is caused by an allergic reaction that one has to food, drugs, plan allergens, trichinosis or infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edema&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uppereyelid.net/edema.html |title=Upper Eyelid Edema Treatment and Symptoms |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main symptoms are swollen red eyelids, pain, and itching. Treatment may vary depending on what is causing the condition. Whereas infections are fought against with antibiotics, allergic edemas treatments consists in staying away from the [[allergen]]. Chronic bouts of eyelid edema can lead to [[blepharochalasis]].

* '''Eyelid [[tumor]]s''' may also occur. [[Basal cell carcinomas]] are the most frequently encountered kind of cancer affecting the eyelid, making up 85% to 95% of all malignant eyelid tumors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tumors&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyecareamerica.org/eyecare/conditions/eye-tumors/index.cfm |title=Eyelid and Orbital Tumors |accessdate=2010-03-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tumors may be benign or malignant. Usually benign tumors are localized and removed before becoming a cancerous threat and before they become large enough to impair one's vision. Malignant tumors on the other hand tend to spread to surrounding areas and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].

* '''[[Blepharospasm]]''' (eyelid twitching) is an involuntary spasm of the eyelid muscle. The most common factors that make the muscle in the eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eyelid twitch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000756.htm |title=Eyelid twitch |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyelid twitching is not considered a harmful condition and therefore there is no treatment available. Patients are however advised to get more sleep and drink less caffeine.

* '''Eyelid [[dermatitis]]''' is the inflammation of the eyelid skin. It is mostly a result of allergies or it is triggered by contact dermatitis of the eyelid. Symptoms that one may experience are dry and flaky skin on the eyelids and swollen eyelids. The affected eyelid may itch. Treatment consists in proper eye hygiene and avoiding the allergens that trigger the condition. In rare cases, [[topical cream]]s may be used but only under a doctor's supervision.

* '''[[Ptosis]]''' (drooping eyelid) is when the upper eyelid droops or sags due to weakness or paralysis of the levator muscle (responsible for raising the eyelid), or due to damage to nerves controlling the muscle. It can be a manifestation of the normal aging process, a congenital condition or due to an injury or disease.  Risk factors related to ptosis include diabetes, stroke, Horner syndrome, myasthenia gravis, brain tumor or other cancers that can affect nerve or muscle function.

* '''Ablepharia''' (Ablepharon) Congenital absence of or reduction in the size of the eyelids.&lt;ref&gt; Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, Edition 21, Page-6. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Eyelid surgeries==

The eyelid surgeries are called blepharoplasties and are performed either out of medical reasons or to improve one's facial appearance.

Most of the cosmetic eyelid surgeries are aimed to enhance the look of the face and to boost one's self-confidence by restoring a youthful eyelid appearance. They are intended to remove fat and excess skin that may be found on the eyelids after a certain age. Cosmetic eyelid surgeries are mostly used to regain a younger and refreshed look but the costs are quite raised, so not everyone affords them.

Eyelid surgeries are also performed to improve one's peripheral vision or to treat different eyelid related conditions such as [[chalazion]], eyelid tumors, [[Ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]], [[trichiasis]], and other.

Eyelid surgeries are overall safe procedures but they carry certain risks since the area on which the operation is performed is so close to the eye.
