==Background==

Sampaio was born in [[Lisbon]] on 18 September 1939. The Sampaio family lived abroad in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for some years, due to the professional activity of his father Arnaldo de Sampaio (1908â1984), a [[Medical Doctor]]. His mother was Fernanda BensaÃºde Branco (1908 - [[Lisbon]], 15 February 2000). His maternal grandmother Sara Bensliman BensaÃºde, who died in 1976, was a of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jew]] from [[Morocco]] of Portuguese origin, and his maternal grandfather Fernando Branco (1880â1940) was a [[Naval Officer]] of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and later the [[Foreign Minister]] of Portugal; Sampaio himself is [[agnostic]], and does not consider himself a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.shavei.org/communities/bnei_anousim/articles-bnei_anousim/portugal%C2%B4s-president-%C2%B4i-am-proud-of-my-jewish-ancestry%C2%B4/?lang=en PortugalÂ´s President: Â´I am proud of my Jewish ancestryÂ´], Michael Freund, retrieved from the [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/443340731.html?dids=443340731:443340731&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Nov+7%2C+2003&amp;author=MICHAEL+FREUND&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=06&amp;desc=Portugal%27s+president%3A+%27I+am+proud+of+my+Jewish+ancestry%27 Jerusalem Post of the 7th of November, 2003]:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jerusalem Post: I understand that you have Jewish ancestry in your family. What is your personal connection to the Jewish people? Do you consider yourself to be a Jew?.&lt;/blockquote&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jorge Sampaio: My grandmother belonged to a Jewish family that came from Morocco in the beginning of the 19th century. She married a non-Jewish naval officer who later was Foreign Affairs minister. I am naturally very proud of this ancestry and of all those that I call my &quot;favorite Jewish cousins,&quot; one of whom is the president of the Lisbon Jewish Community, as I am proud of the ancestry on my non-Jewish father's side. Personally, I am agnostic, and I do not consider myself a Jew; but I am proud, as I said, of my ancestors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He started his political career as college student of the [[Faculty of Law]] of the [[University of Lisbon]]. Jorge Sampaio was involved in the student contestation against the fascist regime and was leader of the Lisbon students union between 1960 and 1961. Following his graduation in 1961, Jorge Sampaio started a notable career as a lawyer, often involved in the defence of many political prisoners.

His brother is the [[Child and adolescent psychiatry|teenage]]-[[psychiatrist]] and [[writer]] [[Daniel Sampaio]].

He married firstly a [[medical doctor]] named Karin Schmidt Dias, daughter of AntÃ³nio Jorge Dias ([[Porto]], 31 July 1907 - [[Lisbon]], 5 February 1973) and wife [[Germans|German]] Margot Schmidt. The couple had no issue and later divorced. He married secondly Maria JosÃ© Rodrigues Ritta (b. [[Lisbon]], 19 December 1941), daughter of JosÃ© AntÃ³nio Ritta and wife Maria JosÃ© Rodrigues Xavier and sister of Maria Ermelinda and JosÃ© AntÃ³nio, by whom he had two children: Vera Ritta de Sampaio (b. 1977) and AndrÃ© Ritta de Sampaio (b. 1981).

After the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974, Sampaio funded Movimento de Esquerda Socialista (MES) ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] [[acronym]] for Socialist Left Movement) but abandoned the political project soon after. In 1978 he joined PS, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], where he remains to present day. His first election as a deputy for [[Lisbon]] in the Portuguese National Parliament is in 1979. Between this year and 1984, he was a member of the [[European Commission for Human Rights]], where he developed important work on these topics. Between 1986 and 1987 he was president of the parliamentary bench of the Socialist Party. In 1989, he was elected president of this political group, an office he held until 1991. Also in 1989, Jorge Sampaio was elected the 62nd [[Mayor of Lisbon]], charge he took in 1990, and re-elected in 1993, remaining in office until 1995.

==Presidency==
[[Image:Jorge Sampaio (official).jpg|thumb|left|Official portrait of President Sampaio by [[Paula Rego]].]]
In 1995, Jorge Sampaio announced his wish to run for the presidency of the Republic. He won the [[Portuguese presidential election, 1996|election]] of 14 January 1996 in the first round against [[AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva]], the  former prime-minister by then, and became president on 9 March. After a non-controversial first mandate, he was [[Portuguese presidential election, 2001|re-elected]] as President on 14 January 2001.

As President, Sampaio's actions were focused on social and cultural affairs. In the international political scene, he oversaw the return of [[Macau]] to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in December 1999 and he also gave important publicity to the cause of [[East Timor]]'s independence.

It is generally considered that Sampaio's presidency were marked by a firm sense of prudence and moderation, an approach which earned him a remarkably uneventful first term in office.  In 2004, however, his refusal to hold early elections following [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democrat]] [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] [[JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso]]'s resignation met with vigorous protest from all left-wing parties and even led to the stepping down of [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist]] leader [[Ferro Rodrigues|Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues]]. Sampaio made this decision to ensure political stability at a time when the country was facing economic recession, and he appointed [[Pedro Santana Lopes]] as Prime Minister. However, only four months afterwards, on 30 November, Sampaio concluded that the new cabinet was not achieving the desired stability, but quite the opposite, and he therefore dissolved the Parliament, calling new [[Portuguese Parliament election, 2005|elections]] for February 2005.

On 24 February 2005, Sampaio called on [[JosÃ© SÃ³crates]], as the nation's next prime minister, to form a government.

Sampaio's successor was chosen in the [[Portuguese presidential election, 2006|presidential election]] held on 22 January 2006. [[AnÃ­bal Cavaco Silva]], the man he defeated in 1996, succeeded Sampaio on 9 March 2006.

As a former President, Sampaio is a Member of the [[Portuguese Council of State]]. He is also a member of the [[Club of Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid] is an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries. It constitutes the worldÂ´s largest forum of former Heads of State and Government, who have come together to respond to a growing demand for support among leaders in democratic leadership, governance, crisis and post-crisis situations. All lines of work share the common goal of building functional and inclusive societies, where the leadership experience of our Members is most valuable.&lt;/ref&gt; an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former Presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries.

Jorge Sampaio is also known for supporting bullfights. Although the Portuguese law does not allow bullfights ending with the death of the bull in the arena, Jorge Sampaio was able to promote an exception to this law for Barrancos in The Alentejo province.
