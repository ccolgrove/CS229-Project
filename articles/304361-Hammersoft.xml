<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="304361" ns="0" title="Boot disk"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">A '''boot disk''' is a removable digital data storage medium from which a  [[computer]] can load and run ([[booting|boot]]) an [[operating system]] or utility program. The computer must have a built-in program which will load and execute a program from a boot disk meeting certain standards.  

Boot disks are used for:
* Operating system installation
* [[Data recovery]]
* [[Data_remanence#Purging|Data purging]]
* Hardware or software troubleshooting
* Customizing an operating environment
* Software demonstration
* Administrative access in case of lost password is possible with an appropriate boot disk with some operating systems
* Games (e.g. for [[Amiga games|Amiga]] home computers)

While almost all modern computers can boot from a hard drive containing the operating system and other software, they would not normally be called boot disks. [[Floppy disk]]s and [[CD-ROM]]s are the most common forms of media used, but other media, such as magnetic or paper tape drives, [[zip drive]]s, and more recently [[USB flash drive]]s can be used. The computer's [[BIOS]] must support booting from the device in question.

==The process of booting==
The term ''boot'' comes from the idea of lifting oneself by one's own [[bootstrap]]s: the computer contains a tiny program (bootstrap loader) which will load and run a program found on a boot device. This program may itself be a small program designed to load a larger and more capable program, i.e., the full operating system. To enable booting without the requirement either for a [[mass storage]] device or to write to the boot medium, it is usual for the boot program to use some system [[RAM]] as a [[RAM disk]] for temporary [[computer file|file]] storage.

As an example, any computer compatible with the [[IBM PC]] is able with built-in software to load the contents of the first 512 bytes of a floppy  and to execute it if it is a viable program; boot floppies have a very simple loader program in these bytes. The process is vulnerable to abuse; data floppies could have a virus written to their first sector which silently infect the host computer if switched on with the disk in the drive.

==Boot floppies==

Bootable floppies for PCs usually contain [[MS-DOS]] or miniature versions of [[Linux]]. The most commonly available floppy disk can hold only 1.4 [[Megabyte|MB]] of data in its standard format, making it impractical for loading large [[operating system]]s. The use of boot floppies is in decline, due to the availability of other higher-capacity options, such as [[CD-ROM]]s or [[USB flash drives]].

==Booting from a disk==
A modern PC is configured to attempt to boot from various devices in a certain order.  If your computer is not booting from the device you desire, such as the floppy drive, you may have to enter the BIOS setup function by pressing a special key when the computer is first turned on -- Delete, F1, F2, F10 or F12 -- and then changing the boot order.  More recent BIOSes permit the interruption of the final stage of the boot process by pressing a function key (usually F11).  This results in a list of bootable devices being presented, from which a selection may be made.

Modern Apple computers will boot from an appropriate disk if the user presses the C key while the machine is starting.

== Required files ==
Different operating systems use different boot disk contents. All boot discs must be compatible with the computer they are designed for.

===[[MS-DOS]]/[[PC-DOS]]===
*A valid [[boot sector]] on the floppy disk, not in the format of a normal disk [[Computer file|file]].
*[[IO.SYS]] or [[IBMBIO.COM]]
*[[MSDOS.SYS]] or [[IBMDOS.COM]]
*[[COMMAND.COM]]
All files must be for the same version; although MS-DOS 5 and 6 use a file called COMMAND.COM, they are not interchangeable. Complete boot disks can be prepared in one operation by an installed operating system; details vary.

===[[Windows 8]]===

Windows 8 has a feature called [[Windows To Go]], that allows the system to run from a USB flash drive, requiring only the extraction of files into the USB drive and the installation of a bootloader.

===[[FreeDOS]]===
*A valid boot sector on the disk
*COMMAND.COM
*KERNEL.SYS

===[[Linux]]===
*A bootloader such as [[SYSLINUX]] or [[GRUB]]
*[[Linux kernel]]
*Initial ram disk (initrd)
