<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="9873718" ns="0" title="NTBackup"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''NTBackup''' is the built-in [[backup]] application introduced in [[Windows NT]] around 1997 and part of all subsequent versions up to and including [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]]. It uses a proprietary backup format &lt;tt&gt;(BKF)&lt;/tt&gt; (also known as &quot;[[Microsoft Tape Format]]&quot; or MTF) to back up files. Files can be backed up to [[Tape drive|tape]], [[Iomega Zip drive|ZIP drives]], [[floppy disk]]s, and hard drives. It also features integration with [[Task Scheduler]] and has several command line switches for scheduled automated backups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490952.aspx NTBackup command line Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Windows Vista]] and later operating systems, NTBackup was replaced by [[Backup and Restore|Windows Backup and Restore]], which uses the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] (VHD) file format, supports backup to modern media such as DVDs and image-based full system backups.

For server operating systems, Microsoft has replaced NTBackup with Windows Server Backup beginning with [[Windows Server 2008]], which includes the new &lt;code&gt;[[wbadmin]]&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754572.aspx NTBackup replaced in Windows Server 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This new backup application, wbadmin, no longer supports tape drives, which means that users have to install third-party applications to back up to tape on these new operating systems.

For reading/restoring older backups, Microsoft has made available the NTBackup Restore utility for Windows Vista/Windows Server 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7da725e2-8b69-4c65-afa3-2a53107d54a7&amp;DisplayLang=en Windows NT Backup - Restore Utility]&lt;/ref&gt; and for Windows 7/Windows Server 2008 R2 &lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/974674 Description of the Windows NT Backup Restore Utility for Windows 7 and for Windows Server 2008 R2]&lt;/ref&gt; which can only read &lt;tt&gt;BKF&lt;/tt&gt; files.

When used with tape drives, NTBackup uses the [[Microsoft Tape Format]] (MTF),&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178062.aspx Media Sets, Media Families, and Backup Sets: MSDN]&lt;/ref&gt; which is also used by [[BackupAssist]] and [[Backup Exec]] and is compatible with BKF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpns.net/willy/msbackup.htm Win9x &amp; XP &amp; NT MSBackUp File Format and Data Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
NTBackup supports several operating system features including backing up the computer's ''System State''. On computers that are not [[Windows Server domain|domain]]-[[Domain controller|controllers]], this includes the [[Windows Registry]], boot files, files protected by [[Windows File Protection]], Performance counter configuration information, [[Component Object Model#COM.2B|COM+]] class registration database,  IIS metabase, replicated data sets, [[Exchange Server]] data, Cluster service information, and Certificate Services database. On domain controllers, NTBackup can back up [[Active Directory]], including the [[File Replication Service|SYSVOL]] directory share.

NTBackup supports [[Encrypting File System]], [[Hard link|NTFS hard links]] and [[junction point]]s, [[Fork (filesystem)|alternate data streams]], [[disk quota]] information, mounted drive and remote storage information. It saves NTFS permissions, audit entries and ownership settings, respects the [[archive bit]] attribute on files and folders and can create normal, copy, differential, [[incremental backup|incremental]] and daily backups, backup catalogs, as well as [[Automated System Recovery]]. It supports logging and excluding files from the backup per-user or for all users. Hardware compression is supported if the tape drive supports it. Software compression is not supported, even in Backup to files.

NTBackup can use removable media devices that are supported natively by the ''Removable Storage Manager'' ([[RSM]]) component of Windows. However, RSM supports only those tape devices which have RSM-aware [[Windows Driver Model|WDM]] drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216328 Installed Tape Device Is Not Recognized by Removable Storage Manager]&lt;/ref&gt;

NTBackup from Windows XP and newer includes [[Shadow Copy|Volume Shadow Copy]] (VSS) support and thus can back up [[File locking|locked files]]. In the case of Windows XP Home Edition, NTBackup is not installed by default but is available on the Windows XP installation disc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/302894 HOW TO: Install Backup from the CD-ROM in Windows XP Home Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows XP introduced a wizard-style UI for NTBackup in addition to the advanced UI.

An expert system administrator can use the NTBackup scripting language to create a functional backup system. Scripting enables the system administrator to automate and schedule backups of files and ''system state'', control the RSM to follow a media [[backup rotation scheme|rotation strategy]], reprogram the RSM to work with external HDD and NAS as well as tape, send email reminders to prompt users to insert the media and compile backup reports that include logs and remaining capacity. An alternative to scripting is GUI software such as [[BackupAssist]], which automates NTBackup and can perform automatic, scheduled backups of Windows-based servers and PCs using NTBackup.

Third-party plug-ins can be used with the deprecated ''Removable Storage'' component in Microsoft Windows to support modern storage media such as [[External hard disk drive|external hard disk]]s, [[flash memory]], [[optical media]] such as [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-Ray]] and network file systems exposing the pieces of media as virtual tape to NTBackup which is based on ''Removable Storage''.

NTBackup can be used under Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 by enabling the ''Removable Storage Manager'' component in ''Turn Windows features on or off'' control panel and then copying the NTBackup files from a Windows XP machine. NTBackup can no longer be used on [[Windows 7]] or Windows Server 2008 R2 as the ''Removable Storage Manager'' component has been removed in these operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/E/6/5E66B27B-988B-4F50-AF3A-C2FF1E62180F/COR-T586_WH08.pptx Storage Networking Platform Features in Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 (Powerpoint)]&lt;/ref&gt;
