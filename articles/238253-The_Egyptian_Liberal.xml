'''Pornographic films''' are [[motion picture]]s with the purpose of promoting [[sexual arousal]] in the viewer, often featuring depictions of sexual activity. They are sold and rented out on DVD, shown through Internet and special channels and [[pay-per-view]] on cable and satellite, and in [[adult theater]]s.

Pornographic films appeared shortly after the creation of the motion picture in the early 1900s. Pornographic films have much in common with other forms of [[pornography]] and [[erotica]]. Pornography is often referred to as &quot;porn&quot; and a pornographic work as a &quot;porno.&quot; Older names for a pornographic movie include &quot;adult film&quot;, &quot;stag film&quot;, and &quot;blue movie.&quot; In general, &quot;[[softcore]]&quot; refers to pornography that does not depict penetration or &quot;extreme fetish&quot; acts, while &quot;[[hardcore pornography|hardcore]]&quot; refers to pornography that depicts penetration and/or extreme fetish acts.

Throughout its history, the [[movie camera]] has been used for pornography, but for most of that time pornographic movies were typically available only by underground distribution, for projection at home or in private clubs and also night cinemas. Only in the 1970s were pornographic films semi-legitimized; by the 1980s, pornography on [[home video]] achieved distribution unimagined only decades earlier. The rise of the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s similarly changed distribution of pornography, and furthermore complicated legal prosecution of obscenity.

Pornography is a thriving, financially profitable business: according to a 2004 Reuters article, &quot;The multi-billion-dollar industry releases about 11,000 titles on [[DVD]] each year, giving it tremendous power....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizreport.com/news/8560/ | title=Porn Business Driving DVD Technology - BizReport | accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Kennedy Dickson]], while working for [[Thomas Edison]], developed the first practical celluloid film{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and worked on making the [[kinetoscope]], a [[peep show]] machine showing a continuous loop of the film Dickson developed lit by an Edison light source. Dickson left Edison's company to produce the [[mutoscope]], a form of hand-cranked peep-show movie machine. These machines showcased moving images via technique of a revolving drum of [[mutoscope cards|card]] illustrations, taken from an actual piece of film. These were often featured at seaside locations, exhibiting sequences of women undressing or acting as an artist's model. In Britain, these devices became known as &quot;''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the butler saw]]''&quot; machines, taking the name from one of the first and most famous [[softcore]] reels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History| publisher = American Mutoscope &amp; Biograph Co.| date = 2006| url = http://www.biographcompany.com/history_home.html| accessdate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Let's Go to the Movies: The Mechanics of Moving Images| work = Exhibit Archives| publisher = Museum of American Heritage| date = 17 September 2001| url = http://www.moah.org/exhibits/archives/movies/technology_development.html| accessdate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of projecting a moving film onto a [[Projection screen|screen]] in front of an audience was a European innovation. In 1895 and 1896, [[Auguste and Louis LumiÃ¨re]] and [[Robert W. Paul]] gave their first public demonstrations of motion picture [[Movie projector|projector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Pioneers of Early Cinema: 5| work = Information Sheet 5.3.43| publisher = National Museum of Photography, Film and Television| date = 2000| url = http://www.nmsi.ac.uk/NMPFT/insight/info/5.3.43.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pornographic film]] production commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture in 1895. Two of the earliest pioneers were [[EugÃ¨ne Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]]. Kirchner directed the earliest surviving pornographic film for Pirou under the trade name &quot;LÃ©ar&quot;. The 1896 film, ''Le Coucher de la Marie'' showed [[Louise Willy]] performing a [[striptease]]. Pirou's film inspired a genre of risquÃ© French films showing women disrobing and other filmmakers realised profits could be made from such films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Bottomore| first = Stephen| coauthors = Stephen Herbert and Luke McKernan eds. | title = LÃ©ar (Albert Kirchner)| work = Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher = British Film Institute| date = 1996 |url = http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lear.htm| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Bottomore| first = Stephen| coauthors = Stephen Herbert and Luke McKernan eds. |title = EugÃ¨ne Pirou| work = Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher = British Film Institute| date = 1996 |url = http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pirou.htm| accessdate = 2006-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''Black and White and Blue'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by the turn of the century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', &quot;the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is ''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge''&quot; made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a [[tryst]] with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian ''El Satario'' might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that &quot;the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''Am Abend'' (1910) is &quot;a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robertson| first = Patrick| title = Film Facts| publisher = Billboard Books| date = December, 2001| isbn = 0-8230-7943-0| page = 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornographic movies were widespread in the [[silent movie]] era of the 1920s, and were often shown in [[brothel]]s. Soon illegal, stag films, or blue films as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one at the risk of prison.&lt;ref name = history&gt;{{cite video|people = Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast)|date = 2006-03-07|title = Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization|url = http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291|medium  = DVD|publisher  = Koch Vision|location = Port Washington, NY|accessdate = 2006-10-21|isbn = 1-4172-2885-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = time&gt;{{cite web| last = Corliss| first = Richard| title = That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic| work = Time Magazine| publisher = Time inc| date = March 29, 2005| url = http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1043267,00.html| accessdate = 2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war era saw developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8mm]] and [[Super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur [[cinematography]]. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In Britain, the productions of [[Harrison Marks]] were &quot;soft core&quot;, but considered risquÃ© in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. [[Lasse Braun]] was a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, some attitudes towards the depiction of sexuality began to change. European movies like ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) and ''[[Language of Love]]'' (1969) were sexually explicit, but were framed as quasi-documentaries, which made their legal status uncertain.

In 1969, [[Denmark]] became the first country to legalize hardcore pornography, followed by toleration in the [[Netherlands]] also in 1969. This led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold &quot;under the counter&quot; or (sometimes) shown in &quot;members only&quot; cinema clubs.&lt;ref name = history/&gt; buddhiiiiiii

===1970s===
In the 1970s, more permissive legislation permitted the rise of [[adult theater]]s in the [[United States]] and many other countries. There was also a proliferation of coin-operated &quot;movie booths&quot; in [[sex shop]]s that displayed pornographic &quot;loops&quot; (so called because they projected a movie from film arranged in a continuous loop).

Denmark started producing comparatively big-budget theatrical feature film sex comedies such as ''[[Bordellet]]'' (1972), the [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] (1970â1976) and the [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] (1973â1978), starring mainstream actors (a few of whom even performed their own sex scenes) and usually not thought of as &quot;porno films&quot; though all except the early ''Bedside''-films included hardcore pornographic scenes. Several of these films still rank among the most seen films in Danish film history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scope.dk/solgtebilletter.php Top 250 of Danish cinema ticket sales]&lt;/ref&gt; and all remain favourites on [[home video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ekkofilm.dk/?allowbreak=false&amp;id=472 | work=Ekko.dk | title=Sengekant (inkl. en uges skiferie) | language=Danish | accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be ''[[Mona the Virgin Nymph]]'' (also known as ''Mona''), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]''.&lt;ref name = time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mehendale| first = Rachel| title = Is porn a problem?| work = Sex | pages = 17, 22| work = The Daily Texan| date = February 9, 2006| url = http://www.tsp.utexas.edu/FrontPage/TSMweb/advertising%20supplements/Valentines%20Day/valentines.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1971 film ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'' represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, ''[[The Boys in the Band]]''), and to be reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Edmonson| first = Roger| coauthors = Cal Culver, Casey Donovan| title = Boy in the Sand: Casey Donovan, All-American Sex Star| publisher = Alyson Books| date = October 1998| isbn = 1-55583-457-4| page = 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable American hardcore feature films of the 1970s include ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972), ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' (1972), ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973), [[Radley Metzger]]'s ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]'' (1975) and ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' (1978). These were shot on film and distributed in movie theaters. Many predicted that frank depictions of sex onscreen would soon become commonplace, but culture soon shifted to the more conservative side and that fantasy never came true. [[William Rotsler]] expressed this in 1973, &quot;Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled sub-division. Nothing can stop this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Schaefer| first = Eric| title = Dirty Little Secrets: Scholars, Archivists, and Dirty Movies | journal = The Moving Image| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 79â105 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press| date = Fall 2005| accessdate = 2006-10-21| doi = 10.1353/mov.2005.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Britain however, ''Deep Throat'' was not approved in its uncut form until 2000 and not shown publicly until June 2005.&lt;ref name = time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hattenstone| first = Simon| title = After 33 years, Deep Throat, the film that shocked the US, gets its first British showing| work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | date = June 11, 2005| url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1504240,00.html| accessdate = 2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Porn film on 'landmark 100' list| work = BBC News| publisher = BBC | date = October 5, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5410268.stm| accessdate = 2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important court case in the U.S. was ''[[Miller v. California]]'' (1973). The case established that [[obscenity]] was not legally protected, but the case also established the [[Miller test]], a three-pronged test to determine obscenity (which is not legal) as opposed to [[indecency]] (which may or may not be legal).

===1980s: New technology, new legal cases===
With the arrival of the home [[video cassette recorder]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pornographic movie industry experienced massive growth and spawned adult stars like [[Seka]], [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Christy Canyon]], [[Ginger Lynn]], [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]], and [[Traci Lords]] and directors, such as [[Gregory Dark]]. By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced, however those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = time /&gt; One could now not only watch pornography in the comfort and privacy of one's own home, but also find more choices available to satisfy specific fantasies and fetishes.

Similarly, the [[camcorder]] spurred changes in pornography in the 1980s, when people could make their own amateur sex movies, whether for private use, or for wider distribution.

It has been suggested{{By whom|date=March 2011}} that, among other things, Sony [[Betamax]] lost the [[Videotape format war]] to VHS (in becoming the general home video recording/viewing system) because the adult film industry chose [[VHS]] instead of the Sony system.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The year 1987 saw an important legal case in the U.S. when the ''[[de facto]]'' result of [[California v. Freeman]] was the legalization of [[hardcore pornography]]. Ironically, the prosecution of Harold Freeman was initially planned as the first in a series of legal cases that would have effectively outlawed the production of such movies.

===1990s: The Internet age===
[[Image:Holly Sampson - My First Sex Teacher Vol. 18 cover original.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Typical DVD box cover]]
Two technologies became prominent in the 1990s that changed pornographic movies: the [[DVD]] offered better quality picture and sound, and was embraced by pornographers just as enthusiastically as it was embraced by major Hollywood studios and by private consumers. DVD allowed innovations such as &quot;interactive&quot; videos that let the user choose such variables as multiple camera angles, multiple endings and computer-only DVD content.

However, the [[Internet]] arguably changed the distribution of pornography more than any earlier technology: rather than ordering movies from an adult bookstore, or through mail-order, people could watch pornographic movies on their computers. Rather than waiting weeks for an order to arrive from another U.S. state, one could download a pornographic movie within minutes (or, later, within a few seconds).

Internet pornography is distributed by means of various sectors of the [[Internet]], primarily via [[paysite]]s, [[video hosting service]]s, and [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]]. While  pornography had been traded electronically since the 1980s, it was in the invention of the [[World Wide Web]] in 1991 as well as the opening of the Internet to the general public around the same time that led to an explosion in online pornography. Like [[videotape]]s and [[DVD]]s, the Internet has proved popular for distributing pornography  because it allows people to view pornography (essentially) anonymously in the comfort and privacy of their homes. It also allows access to pornography by people whose access is otherwise restricted for legal or social reasons.

[[Viv Thomas]], [[Paul Thomas (porn star)|Paul Thomas]], [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]], [[Antonio Adamo]], and [[Rocco Siffredi]] were prominent directors of the '90s.

In 1998, the [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated film production company [[Zentropa]] became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] pornographic films, starting with ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998).

That same year, Zentropa also produced ''[[Idioterne]]'' (1998), directed by [[Lars von Trier]], which won many international awards and was nominated for a [[Golden Palm]] in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). ''[[Idioterne]]'' started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as [[Catherine Breillat]]'s ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'', which starred pornstar [[Rocco Siffredi]].

In 1999, the [[Denmark|Danish]] TV-channel Kanal KÃ¸benhavn started broadcasting hardcore films at night, uncoded and freely available to any TV-viewer in the [[Copenhagen]] area (as of 2009, this is still the case, courtesy of [[Innocent Pictures]], a company started by [[Zentropa]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanalkobenhavn.dk/6_erotik.html Kanal KÃ¸benhavn]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The adult industry==
The global pornographic film industry is dominated by the United States, with the [[San Fernando Valley]] area of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] being the heart of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/11/21/60minutes/main585049.shtml CBSNews.com Porn In The U.S.A.]&lt;/ref&gt; This being the case, most figures on the size of the industry refer solely to the U.S.

In 1975 the total retail value of all the [[hardcore pornography]] in the U.S. was estimated at $5â10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Amis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4153718,00.html |title=A rough trade |accessdate=2009-04-10 |author=[[Martin Amis]] |date=2001-03-17 |publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1979 Revision of the Federal Criminal Code stated that &quot;in [[Los Angeles]] alone, the porno business does $100&amp;nbsp;million a year in gross retain volume.&quot; According to the 1986 Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, American adult entertainment industry has grown considerably over the past thirty years by continually changing and expanding to appeal to new markets, though the production is considered to be low-profile and clandestine.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fisher. ''American Constitutional Law''. 1995, ISBN 0-07-021223-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The total current income of the country's adult entertainment is often rated at $10â13&amp;nbsp;billion, of which $4â6&amp;nbsp;billion are legal. The figure is often credited to a study by [[Forrester Research]] and was lowered in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Ackman, [http://www.forbes.com/2001/05/25/0524porn.html &quot;How Big Is Porn?&quot;], Forbes.com, 25 May 2001.

''USA Today'' claimed in 2003 that websites such as [http://www.danni.com/ Danni's Hard Drive] and [http://www.cybererotica.com/ Cybererotica.com] generated $2&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue in that year, which was allegedly about 10% of the overall domestic porn market at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Swartz, [http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2004-03-09-onlineporn_x.htm &quot;Online porn often leads high-tech way&quot;], USATODAY.com, 9 March 2004.

''The Online Journalism Review'', published by the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication|Annenberg School of Communication]] at the [[University of Southern California]], weighed in with an analysis that favored ''Forbes''' number.

Arguably the first pornstar to become a household name was [[Linda Lovelace]] from the United States, who starred in the 1972 feature ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]''. [[Casey Donovan (porn star)|Casey Donovan]], star of the first mainstream pornographic hit ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'' in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =40 Years of Gay History: the Early Seventies|publisher =Advocate.com|url =http://www.advocate.com/40/timeline70_74.asp|accessdate =  2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieved name recognition nearly a year before ''Deep Throat'' debuted. The success of ''Deep Throat'', which grossed millions of dollars worldwide, spawned a slew of other films and pornographic film stars such as [[Marilyn Chambers]] (''[[Behind the Green Door]]''), [[Gloria Leonard]] (''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]''), [[Georgina Spelvin]] (''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]''), and [[Bambi Woods]] (''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]''). Other well-known performers from the '70s and early '80s included [[Seka]], [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]], [[Ginger Lynn Allen]], [[Veronica Hart]], [[Nina Hartley]] and [[Amber Lynn]].

Attempts were made in the 1970s to outlaw pornography in the [[United States]] by prosecuting porn stars for [[prostitution]]. The courts in California were where the case was initially made, and stopped short of advancing the case to the [[United States Supreme Court]] for a final decision. It was this decision and acceptance to let stand whereby the California Court made a legal distinction in the case of [[People v. Freeman]] between someone who took part in a sexual relationship for money (prostitution) versus someone who takes on the act of merely ''portraying'' role where a sexual relationship was engaged in on-screen act as part of their acting performance. It is this specific legal distinction between pornography and prostitution in California law that has allowed California to become the porn center of the United States.

The primary focus of heterosexual sex films are the women in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance. Most male performers in heterosexual pornography are generally selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess, namely their ability to do three things: achieve an [[erection]] while on a busy film set, maintain that erection while performing on camera, and then [[ejaculation|ejaculate]] on cue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Jenna|authorlink=Jenna Jameson|coauthors=Neil Strauss|title=How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale|year=2004|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-053909-7|quote=(Y)ou have to be able to get it up at will. You have to keep an erection, go a long time without coming, and then come on command.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most male performers in straight porn are paid less than their female counterparts. [[Ron Jeremy]] has commented on the pay gap between women and men in the sex film industry: &quot;The average guy gets $300 to $400 a scene, or $100 to $200 if he's new. A woman makes $100,000 to $250,000 at the end of the year. &quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.askmen.com/toys/interview/34b_ron_jeremy_interview.html Ron Jeremy: Penetrating society since '78]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Girls can easily make 100K-250K per year, plus stuff on the side like strip shows and appearances. The average guy makes $40,000 a year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2/ronj/ Jeremy spoke in class today: An exclusive interview with porn movie legend, Ron Jeremy]&lt;/ref&gt;
