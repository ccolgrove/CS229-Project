'''Self-immolation''' refers to setting oneself on [[fire]], often as a form of protest or for the purposes of [[martyrdom]] or [[suicide]]. It has centuries-long traditions in some cultures, while in modern times it has become a type of radical political protest. Michael Biggs compiled a list of 533 &quot;self-immolations&quot; reported by Western media from the 1960s to 2002, though in this work his definition does not ''only'' include self-immolation by fire.&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word &quot;immolate&quot; is used in the English language when denoting consumption by fire, whether autonomously or imposed. The Latin-based English word ''immolate,'' which for centuries was rarely used, means sacrifice ones self, without any reference to burning, so more generally self-immolation means suicide without specifying the method.  The word itself comes from the Latin &quot;immolare&quot;, to sprinkle with meal, in reference to the ritual sprinkling of the heads of sacrificial victims with wine and fragments of ''[[mola salsa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/self-immolation |title=self-immolation - Definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Oxford Dictionary'', 7th Edition, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Western media coverage of Buddhist monks immolating themselves in protest of the [[South Vietnam]]ese regime in 1963 that introduced the word &quot;self-immolation&quot; to a wide English-speaking audience and gave it a strong association with fire. The alternative name '''bonzo''' comes from the same era, because the [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] who immolated themselves were often referred to by the term ''bonze'' in English literature prior to the mid-20th century, particularly when describing monks from East Asia and French Indochina. This term is derived via [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[French language|French]] from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''bonsÅ'' for a priest or monk, and has become less common in modern literature.

== History ==
Self-immolation is tolerated by some elements of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], and it has been practiced for many centuries, especially in [[India]], for various reasons, including [[Sati (practice)|Sati]], political protest, devotion, and renouncement. Certain warrior cultures, such as in the [[Charan]]s and [[Rajput]]s, also practiced self-immolation. An article entitled ''History of Religions'', written by Jan Yiin-Hua, investigates the medieval Chinese Buddhist precedents for self-immolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;jan&quot;&gt;[http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/vietnam/figure/003-htQuangduc.htm The Self-Immolation of Thich Quang Duc]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Relying exclusively on authoritative Chinese Buddhist texts and, through the use of these texts, interpreting such acts exclusively in terms of doctrines and beliefs (e.g., self-immolation, much like an extreme renunciant might abstain from food until dying, could be an example of disdain for the body in favor of the life of the mind and wisdom) rather than in terms of their socio-political and historical context, the article allows its readers to interpret these deaths as acts that refer only to a distinct set of beliefs that happen to be foreign to the non-Buddhist.&lt;ref name=&quot;jan&quot;/&gt;}}

During the [[Raskol|Great Schism of the Russian Church]], entire villages of [[Old Believers]] burned themselves to death in an act known as &quot;fire baptism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Loren |last=Coleman |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3B4lTTZE58oC&amp;pg=PA46 |location=New York |publisher=Paraview Pocket-Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |page=46 |isbn=0-7434-8223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scattered instances of self-immolation have also been recorded by the [[Jesuit]] priests of France in the early 17th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} However, their practice of this was not intended to be fatal: they would burn certain parts of their bodies ([[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] such as the forearm or the thigh) to symbolise the pain [[Jesus]] endured while upon the [[crucifix|cross]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A 1973 study by a prison doctor suggested that people who choose self-immolation as a form of suicide are more likely to be in a &quot;disturbed state of consciousness&quot;, such as [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Prins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Offenders, Deviants or Patients?: Explorations in Clinical Criminology|first=Herschel|last=Prins|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2010|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political protest==
{{see also|List of political self-immolations}}
A number of Buddhist monks (including the most famous case of [[ThÃ­ch Quáº£ng Äá»©c]]) immolated themselves in protest of the discriminatory treatment endured by Buddhists under the Roman Catholic administration of President [[NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Diá»m]] in [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] &amp;mdash; even though violence against oneself is prohibited by most interpretations of Buddhist doctrine. The twenty-third chapter of the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' recounts the life story of the [[Bhaisajyaguru|Bodhisattva Medicine King]], which served as the main inspiration for the monks and nuns who self-immolated to protest the Vietnam War. In the Sutra, the Medicine King demonstrates his insight into the [[ÅÅ«nyatÄ|selfless]] nature of his body by ritualistically setting his body aflame, spreading the &quot;light of the Dharma&quot; for twelve hundred years. [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] adds: &quot;The bodhisattva shined his light about him so that everyone could see as he could see, giving them the opportunity to see the deathless nature of the ultimate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NhÃ¡Ìt Háº¡nh.

The widespread coverage of the self-immolations of the Buddhist monks in western media established the practice as a type of a political protest. Self-immolations are often public, dramatic, political, and thus newsworthy. They can be seen as a type of [[altruistic suicide]]s for the collective cause. Unlike [[suicide attack]]s, self-immolations are not intended to inflict physical harm or material damage.&lt;ref name=biggs&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Dying Without Killing: Self-Immolations, 1963â2002 |first=Michael |last=Biggs |title=Making Sense of Suicide Missions |editor=Diego Gambetta |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |chapterurl=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0060/immolation.pdf | isbn=9780199297979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They attract attention and become glorified as [[martyrdom]], because of the perception of great pain, but they do not guarantee death for the burned. While the burning of vital tissue can be very painful during self-immolation, [[shock]] or [[asphyxiation]] quickly make the event painless,&lt;ref name=&quot;Prins&quot;/&gt; as do the onset of [[third-degree burns]] which destroy the [[nerve ending]]s. Suicides by self-immolation have led to numerous [[copycat suicide]]s: researchers have counted almost 100 self-immolations covered by the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' between 1963 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Comprehensive textbook of suicidology |first=Ronald W. |last=Maris |coauthors=Alan Lee Berman, Morton M.

In 1968 the practice spread to the [[Soviet bloc]] with self-immolation of Czech student [[Jan Palach]]. Non-political suicides by fire also became more prevalent. The practice continues with India leading â as many as 1,451 and 1,584 self-immolations have been reported in 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Loren |last=Coleman |title=The Copycat Effect: How the Media and Popular Culture Trigger the Mayhem in Tomorrow's Headlines |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3B4lTTZE58oC&amp;pg=PA66 |location=New York |publisher=Paraview Pocket-Simon and Schuster |year=2004 |page=66 |isbn=0-7434-8223-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly high wave of self-immolations in India has been recorded in 1990 protesting the [[Reservation in India]].&lt;ref name=biggs/&gt; 

A new wave of self-immolation protests is currently ongoing in the [[MENA region|Middle East and North Africa]], with at least 14 recorded incidents. These actions have helped inspire the [[Arab Spring]], including the [[2010â2011 Tunisian revolution]], the main catalyst of which was the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], the [[2011 Algerian protests]] (including many [[2011 Algerian self-immolations|self-immolations in Algeria]]), and the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] and there have also been self-immolation protests in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=205180|title=Self-immolation spreads across Mideast inspiring protest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hogg_5xSMcj4xPppcXbCrFlycHBw?docId=CNG.e943001219a6d9ad02686ab0695962cb.431|title=Second Algerian dies from self-immolation: official}}&lt;/ref&gt;
