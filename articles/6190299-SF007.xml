'''Windows Sound System''' ('''WSS''') was a [[sound card]] specification developed by [[Microsoft]] for use in their [[Windows 3.0#Multimedia Extensions|Windows 3.0 with MPC extensions]].  WSS featured support for up to 16-bit 48&amp;nbsp;kHz digital sampling, better than the contemporary [[Sound Blaster Pro]].  Also, the WSS featured RCA analog audio outputs, an uncommon feature among sound cards of this era.

The WSS 2.0 drivers released in 1993 included a DOS driver, WSSXLAT.EXE, that provided Sound Blaster 16 compatibility for digital sampling, however they did not provide support for FM or wavetable synthesis.

Much like today's [[Intel High Definition Audio]], the actual hardware was standardized as well. WSS was based on [[Crystal Semiconductors]] [[CS4231]] [[codec]] [[integrated circuit|chip]].
