'''Francis Marion University''' (formerly Francis Marion College) is a [[U.S. state|state]]-supported [[liberal arts]] [[university]] located six miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], [[South Carolina]], USA. It is named in honor of [[American Revolutionary War]] hero [[Brigadier General]] [[Francis Marion]]. 

==History==
The university dates back to 1957, when the [[University of South Carolina]] set up a freshman center at the Florence County Library. A few years later, in 1961, USC-Florence was set up on land donated by the Wallace family six miles east of [[Florence, South Carolina]]. In 1966, many in the Florence area pushed to establish a four-year university. Governor [[Robert E. McNair]] signed into law an act creating Francis Marion College, effective July 1, 1970.  The newly created Francis Marion College initially enrolled 907 students from 23 of [[South Carolina]]'s 46 counties in 10 departments.  

In 1992, Francis Marion College achieved university status and subsequently changed its name to ''Francis Marion University''. Today, Francis Marion enrolls over 4,100 students from 32 states and 17 different countries. Francis Marion is one of South Carolina's 13 [[public university|state-assisted universities]]. Since 1999, Francis Marion University has consistently ranked as one of the South's best regional universities, earning it a spot in ''[[US News and World Reports]]'' America's Best Colleges.

==Location==
Located on a {{convert|400|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} tract of land originally included in a [[land grant|grant]] by the [[King of England]] and later made a [[cotton plantation]] by the Wallace Family, Francis Marion University is situated {{convert|6|mi|km}} east of Florence. The [[campus]] includes {{convert|100|acre|ha|0}} of mixed pine-hardwood and bottomland forests accessed by a series of trails. The University is located on U.S. Highways 76 and 301 and is just an hour's drive from [[Myrtle Beach]] and the [[Grand Strand]] and 4 hours from the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. With a metropolitan-area population of 200,000, the city of [[Florence]] is nestled alongside [[Interstate 95 in South Carolina|Interstate 95]], the main north-south corridor from the [[New England]] area to [[Miami]], and at the eastern end of [[Interstate 20]]. The city is served by [[Amtrak]], bus service, and a regional airport.
