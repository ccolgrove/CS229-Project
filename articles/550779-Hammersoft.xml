'''''Xtort''''', sometimes written '''XTOÐ¯T''', is the ninth studio album by [[industrial rock]] group [[KMFDM]].  It was released June 25, 1996 on [[Wax Trax! Records|Wax Trax!]]/[[TVT Records|TVT]]. It was recorded in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], shortly after the death of Wax Trax! co-founder and band friend Jim Nash, from the end of 1995 through early 1996, and featured a variety of guest artists from other industrial bands, but had limited participation from core member [[En Esch]].

The album was highly promoted by TVT Records, who sent out tens of thousands of free copies of the first single, &quot;Power&quot;. The band did their own form of anti-promotion as well, creating a press release that both insulted and hyped the coming set. ''Xtort'' was generally well received by critics, with many calling it superlative, and is the highest charting and best-selling KMFDM album to date. After the original release went out of print, a remastered version was released in 2007. 

==Background==
In late 1995, KMFDM was coming off their &quot;Beat by Beat&quot; and &quot;In Your Face&quot; tours in support of their last album, ''Nihil''.&lt;ref name=&quot;KMFDM History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/history.html  | title=KMFDM History on April 4, 1997 from archive.org | work=KMFDM.net | publisher=KMFDM Enterprises | accessdate=March 15, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19970408173452/http://www.kmfdm.net/history.html |archivedate = April 8, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  KMFDM frontman and founder [[Sascha Konietzko]] had described ''Nihil'' as &quot;the crown&quot;, and said that the band had come as close to mainstream popularity as he wanted.  He stated the band needed to move away from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;hypno&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://my.inil.com/~cwphish/EPOWELL_.HTM | author=Powell, Eric | title=KMFDM | work=Hypno Magazine | date=1995 | accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Konietzko returned to Chicago in order to be with his friend, Jim Nash, co-founder of Wax Trax! Records, who was dying from AIDS.&lt;ref name=&quot;KMFDM History&quot;/&gt; Konietzko referred to the death of Nash that October&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mw4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Jim Nash Dies At 47; Found of Wax Trax! | author=Rosenblum, Trudi Miller | publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc. | work=Billboard Newspaper | date=October 21, 1995 | accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;the end of an era.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KMFDM History&quot;/&gt;

[[En Esch]], one of the long time core members of KMFDM, had almost nothing to do with ''Xtort'', contributing to just two songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;/&gt; With regards to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said &quot;En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving; I had to do it without him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;deathmetal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heavymusic.org/forum/2/9338/deathmetal-drummers-2000ad-free-entertainment-magazine-fwd | title=KMFDM Cant Suck Hard Enough! | author=Christie, Dixon | work=2000AD Magazine | accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that the two were not in communication around the time of the album's release.&lt;ref name=&quot;deathmetal&quot;/&gt;

==Production==
''Xtort'' was pre-produced and tracked in Seattle at Hole in the Wall Studio, and recorded and mixed in Chicago at Chicago Recording Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xtort 2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;musica&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://musica.mustdie.ru/en/band/kmfdm/689/ | title=Xtort Credits | work=Musica News | publisher=Vit Belov | accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konietzko brought in a number of Wax Trax! alumni, such as [[Chris Connelly]] of [[Revolting Cocks]] and [[Bill Rieflin]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], to help with the album's creation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qQkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Wax Trax!/TVT's KMFDM Rides Industrial Revolution with 8th Set | work=Billboard Magazine | author=Borzillo, Carrie | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | date=June 22nd, 1996 | accessdate=March 1st, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with assistance from more than a dozen [[studio musician]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xtort 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite album-notes | title=Xtort | artist=KMFDM | year=2007 | format=CD booklet | publisher=[[Metropolis Records]] | location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konietzko required all the album's contributors to be on call thirteen hours a day during production,&lt;ref name=&quot;RS740&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.waste.org/~alone/kmfdm/rsinterview.html | title=KMFDM make industrial music the old-fashioned way.

Konietzko has stated that the ideas for songs began with individual sounds, which he then modified until he created a looped rhythm.&lt;ref name=&quot;rocknet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://members.fortunecity.com/excessive_force/rocknet_interview.htm | title=RockNet Interview with Sascha | author=RenÃ©, Sheila | date=1996 | accessdate=March 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Craze&quot;, for example, Konietzko called &quot;an homage to Atari Teenage Riot, a band with two guys, one girl, a couple [[Roland TR-909|TR90S]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; drum machines and a bass machine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquarian&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.beermelodies.com/interviews/kmfdm-ready-to-%E2%80%98xtort%E2%80%99-2/ | title=KMFDM Ready to 'Xtort' | author=Fortunato, John | work=[[The Aquarian Weekly]] | publisher=Arts Weekly, Inc. | year=1996 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After creating the base tunes, the songs went to [[GÃ¼nter Schulz]], another long time member, to add guitars.&lt;ref name=&quot;rocknet&quot;/&gt; With the completed songs, Konietzko then allowed guest artists, such as Connelly,&lt;ref name=&quot;deathmetal&quot;/&gt; to pick songs that they wanted to contribute to, and added their vocals or other instrumentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rocknet&quot;/&gt;  For ''Xtort'', Konietzko used Macintosh products to do all the synchronization.&lt;ref name=&quot;rocknet&quot;/&gt;

Connelly contributed to four tracks,&lt;ref name=&quot;Xtort 1996&quot;/&gt; including &quot;Blame&quot;, which also featured the horn section from the Oakland, California based group [[Tower of Power]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquarian&quot;/&gt;  [[Nicole Blackman]], KMFDM's publicist at the time, contributed spoken word vocals to the track &quot;Dogma&quot;, which was adapted from the ten minute live performance she provided while touring with the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquarian&quot;/&gt;  &quot;Power&quot;, meanwhile, was made to fulfill a request by the band's label, [[Wax Trax! Records|Wax Trax!]], for a radio promo song.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquarian&quot;/&gt;  Konietzko said he'd heard that &quot;radio didn't like big female choruses&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquarian&quot;/&gt; so he got voiceover commercial singer Cheryl Wilson to help with the song, which he called &quot;dumb and catchy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aquarian&quot;/&gt;  The hidden track of the album, &quot;Fairy&quot;, is a story narrated by Jr. Blackmail, who had worked with the band previously in the 1980s.  Konietzko said it was inspired by Blackmail's &quot;dirty fantasies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;queenmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.queensizemusic.com/qs/int/kmfdm.htm | title=KMFDM Celebrates 20th Anniversary | author=Saffer, Caroline | date=April 28, 2004 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said it wasn't a serious track, and that &quot;it was more like kids at play&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;queenmusic&quot;/&gt;  For the background sounds, the group did things like roll screws on the floor while Schultz played piano.&lt;ref name=&quot;queenmusic&quot;/&gt;

==Release==
The first track on the album, &quot;[[Power (KMFDM song)|Power]]&quot;, was featured on the &quot;Wax Trax! Summer Swindle&quot;, a cassette sampler included with 45,000 issues of the July 1996 issue of ''Alternative Press''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;/&gt; Another 50,000 copies of the sampler were to be handed out at summer college and beach events and given away at radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;/&gt; 90,000 pre-release posters and information sheets were mailed out to fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Son of a Gun.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The character Son of a Gun from the video of the same name.]][[Nicole Blackman]] wrote the promotional piece for the album's press kit,&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmission&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/news/arch-frame.htm | title=March 16 2007: Transmission 4.206 | date=March 16, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the request of [[Sascha Konietzko]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmission&quot;/&gt; wrote the first half of the promo as an insulting take down of the album rather than as a standard promo. The first letter of each line of the first section of the promo spelled out the phrase &quot;April Fools Day Fucker&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Kit&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/xtort.html | title=Xtort Press Folder | accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included lines such as &quot;It's been 100 years and fifty albums for the German/American rock squad â are they running out of gas or what?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Kit&quot;/&gt; and &quot;KMFDM can't suck hard enough&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Kit&quot;/&gt; a quote from the track &quot;Inane&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xtort 1996&quot;/&gt;  The second half of the promo included phrases such as &quot;''XTORT'' is a supersonic soundtrack&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Kit&quot;/&gt; and &quot;The new album is the sound of a band at the height of their powers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Kit&quot;/&gt;  Carrie Borzillo of ''Billboard Newspaper'' stated that KMFDM was &quot;poised to make a significant commercial breakthrough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;/&gt;  Konietzko stated at the time that there were no plans to tour in support of the album's release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;/&gt;

''Xtort'' was released on June 25, 1996&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard Newspaper&quot;/&gt; on [[Wax Trax!

==Critical reception==
Reviews for ''Xtort'' were generally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it &quot;the heaviest and most danceable disc in [KMFDM's] 12-year career&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293286,00.html|title=Xtort: Music Review:Entertainment Weekly|author=Wiederhorn, Jon|accessdate=August 23, 2009|date=July 12, 1996|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while giving it an A-. Heidi MacDonald of ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'' compared ''Xtort'' to getting hit with a wrecking ball, saying, &quot;When KMFDM does what it does best, it is the best at what it does, namely jack-hammer industrial anthems that hit with stunning precision and power.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9CwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT39&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title= Reviews | author=MacDonald, Heidi | page=40 | work=[[CMJ New Music Monthly]] | publisher= Robert K. Haber | date=September 1996 | accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Flick of ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' said &quot;Power,&quot; the opening track, &quot;finds front man [[Sascha Konietzko]] snarling and growling with palpable force, while Cheryl Wilson softens the edges with splashes of soul-mama vamping during the chorus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pw0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Reviews and Previews: Singles | author=Flick, Larry | page=84 | work=[[Billboard Magazine]] | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | date=May 25, 1996 | accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandy Masuo of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album &quot;the product of a first-rate lineup,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title= Album Reviews: KMFDM Xtort | author=Masuo, Sandy | journal=[[Rolling Stone]] | publisher=Jann S. Wenner | date=July 11, 1996 | page=90 | issue=738/739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the album's diversity, saying, &quot;The 10 tracks on Xtort are grounded in KMFDM's smart synthesis of metallic crunch, swiveling rhythms and sophisticated electronics, but it's the organic elements that give the album a zesty twist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;/&gt; She noted in particular the use of horns and the [[Hammond B3]] organ, and concluded by stating, &quot;In their insidiously arty and intellectually sassy music, KMFDM continue to bring diverse elements together to create a unified whole.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;/&gt;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]] was less enthusiastic, saying, &quot;it would be nice to hear [KMFDM] branch out and start to experiment a little bit more,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r236212|pure_url=yes}} | title=Xtort Review | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas | work=allmusic.com | publisher=Rovi Corporation | accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenting that ''Xtort'' did not sound much different from previous releases, but that &quot;KMFDM sounds as good as they ever have, and several tracks rank among their best.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt;
