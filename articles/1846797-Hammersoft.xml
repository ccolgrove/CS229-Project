'''Jeremiah &quot;Jerry&quot; Ordway''' (born November 28, 1957)&lt;ref name=&quot;CBG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|John Jackson Miller|last=Miller|first= John Jackson| url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays| work=[[Comic Buyer's Guide]]| date=June 10, 2005| accessdate=December 12, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw | archivedate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] writer, [[penciller]], [[inker]] and painter of [[comic book]]s.

He is known for his inking work on a wide variety of [[DC Comics]] titles, including the continuity-redefining classic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' (1985â1986), his long run working on the [[Superman]] titles from 1986â1993, and for writing and painting the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] [[original graphic novel]] ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'' (1994), and writing the on-going monthly series from 1995â1999. He has provided inks for artists such as [[Curt Swan]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Gil Kane]], [[John Buscema]] and [[Steve Ditko]].&lt;ref name=Rough&gt;[http://www.roughhouseink.com/interviews/ordway.htm Jerry Ordway Interview at RoughHouseInk]. Accessed March 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and influences==
Ordway was inspired in his childhood by [[Marvel Comics]], and dreamed of drawing [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. (To date he has only worked on the latter.)

Among the artists he considers influential are [[Curt Swan]], [[Jack Kirby|Kirby]], [[Gil Kane]], [[John Buscema]], [[Steve Ditko]], all of whose pencils he would later ink over. He also cites [[Gene Colan]], [[Wally Wood]], [[Alex Raymond]], [[Hal Foster]] and [[Roy Crane]] as early inspirations. He also names contemporaries such as [[Lee Weeks]], [[John Romita, Jr.|John Romita JR]], [[Ron Garney]], [[Mike Weiringo]] and [[Alan Davis]], and inkers such as [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Dick Giordano]], [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] and [[Klaus Janson]].&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt;

Jerry Ordway attended [[Lynde &amp; Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School|Milwaukee Technical High School]], where he took a three-year commercial art course, before joining a commercial art studio as a [[typographer]] in 1976. He subsequently worked his way &quot;from the ground floor up at the art studio&quot; between 1978 and 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bails&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt;

==Comics career==
Before beginning his professional career as an inker, Jerry Ordway broke into comics as an artist (and publisher) for small-press [[comics fanzine]]s. Ordway discovered Marvel comics in &quot;June of 1967,&quot; and wrote in 1975 (aged 17) that he had &quot;been drawing superheroes [ever] since.&quot; His first published work, a story entitled &quot;The Messenger&quot;, appeared in ''Tim Corrigan's Superhero Comics'' No.&amp;nbsp;4 (April, 1975), and his own self-published fanzine ''Okay Comix'' followed in MayâJune, 1975.&lt;ref name=OKAY&gt;Ordway, Jerry &quot;What? Another 'zine?&quot; in Ordway's ''Okay Comix'' No.&amp;nbsp;1 (MayâJune, 1975), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; ''Okay Comix'' featured stories by Ordway and his friend Dave Koula, and art predominantly by Ordway himself. Ordway's own hero &quot;Proton&quot; headlined the 'zine, which also featured a pin-up of a character &quot;called Acrobat&quot; who was &quot;the first superhero [Ordway] created. His birth was Dec. 1969.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Okay2&quot;&gt;''Okay Comix'' No.&amp;nbsp;1 (MayâJune, 1975), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Spending the late 1970s working as a painter in a commercial art studio in Milwaukee, between 1978 and 1979, he also provided illustrations for a number of fanzines and pro-zines, including ''Omniverse'' and ''[[The Comics Journal]]''. His first professional work was for Western publishing's [[Golden Books]] on young-reader Marvel books, and the ''Superheroes Golden Beginning Stampbook '79''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bails&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt;

===DC Comics===
Having produced comics-related artwork for fanzines and licenced publishers, Ordway attended &quot;a talent search at the 1980 Chicago Comicon,&quot; held by DC Comics. After showing them his &quot;DC related artwork from the Golden Books,&quot; he &quot;walked away with a promise of work.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt; This work began in the summer of 1980 for &quot;DC's anthology comics,&quot; (including ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' and ''[[Mystery in Space]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bails&quot;/&gt;) in which he &quot;inked [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Trevor Von Eeden]], as well as [[Joe Staton]], and [[Dave Cockrum]].&quot; After continuing to work at the art studio for a further six months, inking comics for DC by night, Ordway began &quot;freelancing full time in February 1981.&quot; During the mid-1980s, he &quot;shared a studio with other artists, including [[Mike Machlan|Machlan]], [[Pat Broderick]], and [[Al Vey]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt;

At DC, he would go on to co-create and illustrate titles such as ''[[All Star Squadron]]'' and ''[[Infinity Inc]]'' with writer [[Roy Thomas]]. Ordway inked ''[[DC Comics Presents]] Annual'' No.&amp;nbsp;4 (1985) over artist [[Eduardo Barreto]]'s pencils, he was one of several artists who contributed art for ''[[Batman]] Annual'' No.&amp;nbsp;9 (July 1985), and more notably also inked [[George PÃ©rez]]'s pencils on the epic crossover miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' in 1985. Ordway also inked legendary Superman artist [[Wayne Boring]]'s pencils for a retelling of the definitive [[Superman (Earth-Two)|Golden Age Superman]] origin story written by [[Roy Thomas]] in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' No.&amp;nbsp;1 (April 1986), which he considers a particular favorite.&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt; Ordway was also the penciller and inker for the DC Comics adaptation of the 1989 [[Batman (1989 film)|Batman film]] which was published as a &quot;movie special&quot;.

Particularly highly regarded for his inking, Ordway has however noted that &quot;Inking is a weird job, because as much as you put into it, the page still belongs to the penciler.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt;

===Superman===
{{main|Superman|The Man of Steel (comics)}}
In 1986, along with writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and writer [[Marv Wolfman]], Ordway was one of the architects trusted with revamping [[Superman]], in the wake of the Ordway-inked continuity-redefining maxiseries ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Launching, with a revised origin and new continuity, in Byrne's miniseries, ''[[The Man of Steel (comics)|The Man of Steel]]'', Superman soon returned to featuring in a number of titles. After the titular title ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was cancelled and replaced with ''Man of Steel'', it was swiftly relaunched as ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'', continuing the numbering of the original ''Superman'' comic, with Wolfman as writer and Ordway as primary artist. 

When Wolfman departed the title, John Byrne briefly took over scriptwriting duties before Ordway assumed the mantle of writer-artist and took over the series solely. Switching from ''Adventures of Superman'', Ordway took over as writer-artist on the companion title ''[[Superman (vol. 2)]]'' between 1989 and 1991, before later returning to ''Adventures'' as writer. While writing for the [[Superman]] family of titles, he helped devise the epic &quot;[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]&quot; storyline in 1992. After seven years working on the character, Ordway largely left the Superman titles in 1993, although he would make frequent returns to the character as writer and artist throughout his career. 

In 1988, during the 50th anniversary celebrations for [[Superman]], he inked over [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s pencils for a ''Time'' magazine cover and interior spread celebrating the Man of Steel's anniversary. Ordway has also produced a large number of covers for DC from 1982 onwards, including for issues of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' and the painted cover art to the hardcover reprint collection ''The Greatest Golden Age Stories Ever Told'' (DC Comics, 1990). He also produced the cover art for the [[prestige format]] [[graphic novel]]s, ''Superman: The Earth Stealers'' in 1988 (where he also inked over [[Curt Swan]]'s pencils) and ''Superman For Earth'' (1991), among other work. 

In 1989, he would take time off from his monthly work on Superman and illustrate the comic book movie adaptation to director [[Tim Burton]]'s blockbuster movie, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''.

===Captain Marvel===
{{main|The Power of Shazam!}}
In 1994, Ordway masterminded the return of the original [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] to the [[DC Universe]] with the 96-page hardcover graphic novel ''[[The Power of Shazam!]]'', which he both wrote and painted. The story saw Ordway depict the revamped origins of the former-[[Fawcett Comics]] superhero. An early example of the one-shot [[Original Graphic Novel]], it proved to be a success, and was followed by an on-going monthly series, also titled ''The Power of Shazam!'' (which ran between 1995 and 1999). Ordway wrote and provided painted covers for the entire run of the regular series, as well as illustrating fill-in issues between series-regular artists [[Peter Krause (artist)|Peter Krause]] and [[Mike Manley (artist)|Mike Manley]]. Towards the end of the series run, he again took on the dual role of writer &amp; artist.

==Other work==
===Non-DC work===
During the mid-1980s, Ordway provided covers and occasional artwork to titles from a number of different comics companies. Companies included [[Wendy Pini|Richard and Wendy Pini]]'s [[WaRP Graphics]], [[AC Comics]], [[Charlton Comics]], [[Paragon Publications]] and fan-turned-pro [[Martin Greim|Marty Greim]]. For [[Eclipse Comics]], Ordway provided pencils for a short &quot;Epilogue&quot; story in [[Mark Evanier]]'s ''[[DNAgents]]'' No.&amp;nbsp;18 (Jan 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=39574 ''DNAgents'' #18] at Comics.org. Accessed March 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He also produced ''Munden's Bar'' for [[First Comics]], and provided pencils and inks on an issue of ''[[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bails&quot;/&gt;

For [[Image Comics]], Ordway co-created the character [[WildStar]] (with [[Al Gordon]]) in 1993, and published his creator-owned one-shot ''The Messenger'' in July 2000.&lt;!--Based on his earliest published work, presumably!--&gt; 

Although the vast majority of Ordway's professional work has been produced for DC, between inking ''All-Star Squadron'' and ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' for DC, Ordway inked issues of Marvel's ''[[Fantastic Four]]''. He produced occasional work for Marvel between 1984 and 1988, then returned a decade later to write and illustrate a three-issue arc of ''Avengers'' (vol. 3) #16â18 (1999), as well as penciling the four-issue crossover mini-series ''Maximum Security'' (#1â3 and prologue ''Dangerous Planet'') in 2000â2001.

===Other DC work===
As well as inking most of [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[George PÃ©rez]]'s ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Ordway also inked the second of DC's continuity-redefining event titles in 1994 by inking writer-artist [[Dan Jurgens]]' pencils on ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the original ''Crisis'', DC published [[Geoff Johns]]' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series (Dec 2005 â Jun 2006), for which Ordway provided the artwork for the flashback scenes set on [[Earth-Two]], including a recreation of the cover to ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, which he cites as another favorite piece of his.&lt;ref name=Rough/&gt; In the wake of ''Infinite Crisis'', he inked over [[Dan Jurgens]]' pencils once again in the ''&quot;History of the Multiverse&quot;'' back-up stories in the weekly comic book ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|''Countdown'']]'' (issues No.&amp;nbsp;39 and #38, Chapters 11 and 12) (October 2007).

In 2001, he drew the one-shot ''[[Just Imagine...]] Stan Lee with Jerry Ordway Creating the JLA'' as part of comics legend and Marvel-stalwart [[Stan Lee]]'s foray into the DC Universe, in which the two of them re-imagined DC's [[Justice League of America]]. He inked the last year (May 2002 â May 2003) of the [[Batman family]] title ''[[Azrael (comics)|Azrael: Agent of the Bat]]'' (#88 â #100), and also provided the artwork for a six-issue story arc in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2, issues #189â194), with writer [[Walt Simonson]] in 2003. From 2003-2008, he also provided new covers to ''Superman: The Man of Steel'' series of six trade paperbacks, collecting the early adventures of the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] Superman.    

Recent work includes pencilling three issues of ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' (volume 2) (#11â13, MayâJuly 2008) with writer [[Mark Waid]], and pencils for ''[[Justice Society of America]] Annual'' No.&amp;nbsp;1 (Sept. 2008), alongside some interior artwork for the on-going ''Justice Society of America'' series during late 2008.
