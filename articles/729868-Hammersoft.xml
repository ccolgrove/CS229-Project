'''Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.''' (May 8, 1955 â [[circa|c.]] June 18, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[helicopter]] engineer who lived in [[Saudi Arabia]]. He was a native of both [[Stafford, New Jersey|Stafford]] and [[Eagleswood, New Jersey|Eagleswood]], [[New Jersey]]. In 2004, he was taken hostage by terrorists and his murder was recorded on video tape.

==Kidnapping==
Johnson, who worked for [[Lockheed Martin]] on upgrading Saudi [[AH-64 Apache|AH-64A Apache]] attack helicopters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/world/reach-war-saudi-hostage-kidnappers-american-threaten-kill-him-3-days.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=THE REACH OF WAR: SAUDI HOSTAGE; Kidnappers of American Threaten to Kill Him in 3 Days | first=Neil | last=Macfarquhar | date=June 16, 2004 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was stopped at a fake police checkpoint near Riyadh June 12 and then abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-06-20-saudi-message_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Al-Qaeda site: Police helped in Johnson abduction | date=June 21, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His kidnappers called themselves [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/alqaida-threatens-to-kill-us-hostage-in-saudi-732410.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Al-Qa'ida threatens to kill US hostage in Saudi | first1=Jasper | last1=Mortimer | date=June 16, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, headed by [[Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin]], posted a video of a blindfolded Johnson on an [[Islamism|Islamist]] website on June 15, 2004 and threatened to kill him unless all al-Qaeda prisoners were released from Saudi jails within 72 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=ag1Ch5Bq0RfY&amp;refer=us&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the video was released, American and Saudi Arabian authorities began to deal with the hostage situation. Both the United States and Saudi Arabia asserted that they would not comply with the kidnappers' demands. Those demands included, but were not limited to, releasing all terrorists being held in Saudi custody. The video was released on the same day that [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Crown Prince Abdullah]] promised to step up security and investigations against militant Islamic groups in Saudi Arabia. 

One of Johnson's Saudi colleagues, Abdullah Al-Momin, published a petition message to the kidnappers through Al-Arabia TV. He asked them in the name of Islam to free Johnson as he has nothing to do with the American military, &quot;if they are really Muslims they should release him&quot; Abdullah said.

Johnson's abduction came during increased [[Insurgency in Saudi Arabia|violence against foreigners in Saudi Arabia]]. The previous week, BBC journalists [[Frank Gardner (journalist)|Frank Gardner]] and [[Simon Cumbers]] had been shot, and two other Americans had also been shot in Riyadh.

[[Sultan Al Haseri]], who was later to be listed on [[Saudi Arabia's list of most wanted terrorist suspects]], who was killed in a shootout in July 2005, was later to be described as taking a role in Johnson's kidnapping and murder.&lt;ref name=KhaleejTimes2005-09-05&gt;

==Videotaped killing==
At 17h30 [[UTC]] on June 18, [[Al-Arabiya]] and [[CNN]] reported that Johnson had been [[Decapitation|beheaded]].  This report is based on three photographs of the [[murder]] posted on the [[Internet]].  Saudi officials initially claimed to have discovered Johnson's body near [[Riyadh]] later that day, but on June 19 those claims were withdrawn.  The Saudi government withheld official proclamation of Johnson's death until the body was found.
In the murder video, after making the statements, the next shot is the beheading already in progress.  He is lying on a bed with what appears to be three men holding him down as one militant severs his head. Unlike the [[Nick Berg]] and [[Eugene Armstrong]] videos, there is no screaming.  The video was also similar to that of [[Daniel Pearl]], who was killed in [[Pakistan]] in 2002, and [[Kim Sun-il]], a [[South Korea]]n who was killed in Iraq during the same month not long after Johnson was killed in Saudi Arabia.

HostingAnime, the company which hosts images and video of his murder, have defended showing his beheading.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/r/reynalds/04/reynalds072204.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2004, Saudi security officials found Johnson's head in a refrigerator in a villa in Riyadh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/07/21/saudi.johnson/index.html | work=CNN | title=U.S. hostage's head found in freezer | date=July 21, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was described by his son, Paul Johnson III, as a lover of Saudi Arabian culture who often sent verses of the [[Qur'an]] to his daughter.
