'''Edward Samuel Miliband''' (born 24 December 1969)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dod's Guide to the General Election 2010&quot;, Dods, 2010, p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]], currently the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He has been the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[South Yorkshire]] constituency of [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]] and served in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|the Cabinet]] from 2007 to 2010 under [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]].

Born in London, Miliband graduated from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[London School of Economics]], becoming first a television journalist and then a Labour Party researcher, before rising to become one of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] Gordon Brown's confidants and Chairman of [[HM Treasury]]'s Council of Economic Advisers.

As Prime Minister, Gordon Brown appointed Miliband as [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] on 28 June 2007. He was subsequently promoted to the new post of [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change]], a position he held from 3 October 2008 to 12 May 2010. On 25 September 2010, he was [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|elected Leader of the Labour Party]].

==Background and early life==
Born in London, Miliband is the younger son of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] immigrants. His mother, Marion Kozak, survived the [[Holocaust]] thanks to being [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|protected by Roman Catholic Poles]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mendick and Matthew Day [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/7730052/The-miraculous-escape-of-Marion-Miliband.html &quot;The miraculous escape of Marion Miliband&quot;,] ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ed Miliband leader speech&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11426411 Ed Miliband: Labour leader's 2010 conference speech in full], BBC News, 28 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Ralph Miliband]] was a Belgian-born [[Marxism|Marxist]] who fled with his parents to England during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Beckett [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/feb/28/schools.labour &quot;In the house of the rising sons&quot;,] ''The Guardian'', 28 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ed Miliband leader speech&quot;/&gt; Due to his father's employment as a teacher Miliband spent two spells living in [[Boston]], one year when he was seven and one [[junior high school]] term when he was twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://labour-uncut.co.uk/2010/07/21/the-ed-miliband-interview|title=The Ed Milliband interview|publisher=Labour-Uncut.co.uk|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miliband was educated at Primrose Hill [[Primary School]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and then [[Haverstock School|Haverstock Comprehensive School]] in [[Chalk Farm]], [[North London]]. He completed his [[GCE Advanced Level|A Levels]] and was a violinist whilst at school.&lt;ref name=&quot;education&quot;/&gt; As a teenager, he reviewed films and plays on [[LBC]] Radio's ''Young London'' programme as one of its &quot;Three O'Clock Reviewers&quot;, and worked as an intern to [[Tony Benn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benn|first=Tony|title=The Benn Diaries|publisher=Arrow|year=1995|isbn= 978-0099634119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miliband read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], taking a [[Bachelor of Arts]], followed by the [[London School of Economics]], where he obtained a Masters in Economics.&lt;ref name=&quot;education&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9c342ac-c954-11df-b3d6-00144feab49a.html|title=Miliband declares New Labour dead â Rise to Power, Education|publisher=FT.com|accessdate=18 October 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
===Special Adviser===
After a brief career in television journalism, Miliband became a speechwriter and researcher for [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow]] [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]] [[Harriet Harman]] in 1993, and then for [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] the following year. In [[UK general election, 1997|1997]], following Labour's landslide election victory, Miliband was appointed as one of Gordon Brown's [[Special advisers (UK government)|special advisers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsconfed.org/OurWork/latestnews/Pages/Rt-Hon-Ed-Miliband-MP-elected-Labour-leader.aspx|title=Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP elected Labour leader|publisher=NHS Confederation.org|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1999, Miliband was involved in the process of building Labour's manifesto for the forthcoming [[Scottish Parliament election, 1999|Scottish Parliament elections]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman'', 6 April 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt; Initially doing so in an informal capacity, he was spotted leaving the [[Scottish Labour Party]]'s headquarters on the night that a key policy meeting was held, involving the [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] [[Donald Dewar]] and senior party officials, to consider the party's election strategy and details of Labour's manifesto. As a result, Miliband temporarily resigned from his post as a Special Adviser at the Treasury, to work on the Scottish election campaign full-time.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman'', 8 April 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that part of Miliband's Scottish role was to take charge of Labour's rebuttal operation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scotsman'', 23 April 1999., p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harvard===
On 25 July 2002, it was announced that Miliband would take a 12-month unpaid [[sabbatical]] from the Treasury to be a [[scholar|visiting scholar]] at the Centre for European Studies of [[Harvard University]] for two semesters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard leave&quot;&gt;Fraser Nelson, &quot;Brown confirms adviser's sojourn in Harvard&quot;, ''Scotsman'', 26 July 2002, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his time at Harvard teaching economics,&lt;ref name = &quot;EdsFTProfile&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d9dca9da-c893-11df-8343-00144feab49a.html |title=Profile: Ed Miliband |publisher= [[The Financial Times]] |author= Jim Pickard |date = 25 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stayed there after September 2003 teaching a course titled &quot;What's Left?

===Member of Parliament===
In early 2005, Miliband resigned from the Treasury to stand for election. [[Kevin Hughes (politician)|Kevin Hughes]], then the Labour MP for [[Doncaster North (UK Parliament constituency)|Doncaster North]], announced in February of that year that he would be standing down at the next election due to being diagnosed with [[motor neurone disease]]. Miliband applied for selection to be the Labour candidate in the safe Labour seat and won, beating off a close challenge from [[Michael Dugher]], then a special advisor to [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Geoff Hoon]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yorkshire Post'', 26 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Brown]] visited Doncaster North during the general election campaign to support his former adviser.&lt;ref&gt;''Doncaster Free Press'', 14 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Miliband was elected to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] on [[UK general election, 2005|5 May 2005]], with over 50% of the vote and a majority of 12,656. He made his [[maiden speech]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 23 May, responding to comments made by future [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] [[John Bercow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2005-05-23a.487.0|title=Home Affairs and Communities|publisher=[[Hansard]] via [[TheyWorkForYou]]|date=23 May 2005|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tony Blair]]'s cabinet reshuffle in May 2006, he was made the [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the [[Cabinet Office]], with responsibility for the so-called Third Sector, relating to voluntary and charity organisations, for which a new Office had been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senscot.net/view_art.php?viewid=4760|title=The third sectorâs big tent  |publisher=Senscot.net|date=2 June 2006|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4976414.stm|title=At-a-glance: Tony Blair reshuffle|date=5 May 2006|publisher=BBC News| accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet===
[[File:Richard Lambert and Ed Miliband at the CBI Climate Change Summit 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Miliband with [[Richard Lambert]], director of [[Confederation of British Industry]], at Climate Change Summit, 2008]]
In June 2007, when Brown became Prime Minister, Miliband was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] and appointed [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]] and [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], and promoted to the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6247502.stm |title=Brown unveils huge Cabinet revamp |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 October 2008 | date=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that he and his brother [[David Miliband]] became the first brothers to serve in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] since [[Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (1894â1938)|Edward]] and [[Oliver Stanley]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/oh-brother-siblings-who-share-the-limelight-2091130.html?action=Gallery|title=Oh brother! Siblings who share the limelight|publisher=The Independant|date=27 September 2010|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the task of drafting Labour's manifesto for the [[UK general election, 2010|next general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6899686.stm|title=Work begins on new manifesto|publisher=The BBC|date=15 July 2007|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2008, Miliband was promoted to [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|Secretary of State]] for the newly-created [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parkinson |first=Justin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7648551.stm |title=As it happened: Brown reshuffle |publisher=BBC News |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Cabinet reshuffle. On 16 October, Miliband announced that the British government would legislate to oblige itself to cut greenhouse emissions by 80% by 2050, rather than the 60% cut in carbon dioxide emissions previously announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7673748.stm|title=Tougher climate target unveiled |accessdate=19 October 2008|publisher=BBC News| date=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst [[Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change|Secretary of State]] Miliband attended ''[[The Age of Stupid]]'' UK premiere where he was ambushed by [[Pete Postlethwaite]], who threatened to return his [[OBE]] and vote for any party other than Labour if the [[Kingsnorth power station#Proposed replacement|Kingsnorth coal-fired power station]] was given the go-ahead by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/mar/16/the-age-of-stupid-renewableenergy|title=The night Ed Miliband said 'I'm with Stupid, butâ¦' | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Lucy|last=Siegle|date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later the Government announced a change to its policy on coal â no new coal-fired power station will get government consent unless it can capture and bury 25% of the emissions it produces immediately â and 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a source told ''[[the Guardian]]'', represented âa complete rewrite of UK energy policyâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/24/energy-coal-carbon-capture-environment|title=Ed Miliband promises new era of clean coal â but who will pay? | location=London | work=The Guardian|first1=John|last1=Vidal|first2=Juliette|last2=Jowit|date=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miliband represented the UK at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 Copenhagen Summit]], from which emerged a global commitment to provide an additional [[United States dollar|$]]10&amp;nbsp;billion a year to fight the effects of [[climate change]], with an additional $100&amp;nbsp;billion a year provided by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/20/copenhagen-climate-change-accord | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ed | last=Miliband | title=The road from Copenhagen | date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was not able to achieve a legally-binding agreement. Miliband accused [[People's Republic of China|China]] of deliberately foiling attempts at a binding agreement; China explicitly denied this, accusing British politicians of engaging in a &quot;political scheme&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8425720.stm |title=China rejects UK claims it hindered Copenhagen talks |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=22 December 2009 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2009, Miliband was named by the ''Daily Telegraph'' as one of the &quot;saints&quot; of the [[Disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament|expenses scandal]], for claiming one of the lowest amounts of expenses in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5342811/MPs-expenses-The-saints-Part-i.html?image=8|title=

==Leadership of the Labour Party==
===Leadership election===
Following the [[Conservative â Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement|formation of the coalition government]] on 11 May 2010, [[Gordon Brown]] resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect, with [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader]] [[Harriet Harman]] taking over as Acting Leader. On 14 May 2010, following his brother's announcement of his own candidacy the day earlier, Miliband announced that he would stand as a candidate for the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership of the Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8684063.stm |title=Ed Miliband to take on brother David in leader battle |publisher=BBC News |date=16 May 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched his campaign during a speech given at a [[Fabian Society]] conference at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom |last=Baldwin |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7127230.ece |title=Ed Miliband to stand against his brother in leadership race |work=The Times |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Allegra |last=Stratton |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/26/ed-miliband-partner-justine-thornton |title=Ed Miliband's partner Justine Thornton is shy but steely |work=The Guardian |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs. The other candidates were [[Diane Abbott]], [[Ed Balls]], [[Andy Burnham]] and his elder brother [[David Miliband]].

On 23 May, former Labour Leader [[Neil Kinnock]] announced that he would endorse Miliband's campaign to become the next Leader, saying that he had &quot;the capacity to inspire people&quot; and that he had &quot;strong values and the ability to 'lift' people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/may/23/ed-miliband-neil-kinnock-labour-leadership|title=Ed Miliband wins crucial backing from Neil Kinnock in Labour leadership race|publisher=The Guardian|date=23 May, 2010|accessdate=13 September, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other senior Labour figures who backed Miliband included former Deputy Leaders [[Roy Hattersley]] and [[Margaret Beckett]]. By 9 June, the deadline for entry into the Labour leadership contest, Miliband had been nominated by just over 24% of the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], double the amount required. By September, Miliband had received the support of six [[trade unions]], including both [[Unite the Union|Unite]] and [[UNISON]], 151 of the Constituency Labour Parties, three affiliated socialist societies, and half of the Labour [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labourlist.org/ed-milibands-plp-support---running-totals |title=Ed Miliband's support: 73 MPs, 6 MEPs, 151 CLPs, 6 TUs, 3 SSocs &amp;#124; LabourList.org 2.0.2 |publisher=LabourList.org |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Miliband won the election, the result of which was announced on 25 September 2010, after second, third and fourth preferences votes were counted, with the support of 50.654% of the electoral college, defeating his brother by 1.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11412031 | work=BBC News | title=Ed Miliband is elected leader of the Labour Party | date=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth and final stage of the redistribution of votes after three candidates had been eliminated, Ed Miliband led in the trade unions and affiliated organisations third of the electoral college (19.93% of the total to David's 13.40%), but in both the MPs and MEPs section (15.52% to 17.81%), and Constituency Labour Party section (15.20% to 18.14%), came second. In the final round, Ed Miliband won with a total of 175,519 votes to David's 147,220 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/sep/26/labour-leadership-results-election#results|title=Labour leadership result: get the full data|accessdate=2011-08-29 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Simon|last=Rogers|date=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leader of the Opposition===
[[File:Miliband west midlands conference cropped.jpg|thumb|280px|Miliband speaking in November 2011]]
On becoming Leader of the Labour Party on 25 September 2010, Miliband also became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. At the age of 40, he was the youngest Labour Leader since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics-news/2010/09/26/victorious-ed-miliband-becomes-youngest-labour-leader-since-war-after-knife-edge-vote-86908-22588207/|title=Victorious Ed Miliband becomes youngest Labour leader since war |publisher=The Daily Record|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his first [[Prime Minister's Questions]] as Labour Leader on 13 October 2010, raising questions about the government's announced removal of a non-[[means tested]] [[child benefit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11527750 |title=Ed Miliband to make prime minister's questions debut |work=BBC News |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]], Miliband supported UK military action against [[Colonel Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12799577|title=Ed Miliband supports UK military action against Gaddafi |publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miliband spoke at a large &quot;[[March for the Alternative]]&quot; rally held in London on 26 March 2011 to protest against cuts to public spending, though he was criticised by some for comparing it to the anti-apartheid and American civil rights movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/8408779/Embarrassment-for-Labour-leader-as-riots-start-as-he-speaks-at-cut-rally.html Embarrassment for Labour leader as riots start as he speaks of cuts]  [[Daily Telegraph]] 27 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/colleagues-defend-miliband-rally-speech-2254550.html Colleagues defend Miliband rally speech] [[The Independent|Independent]] 27 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12874631 London cuts march: Government sticking to plan â Cable] [[BBC]] 27 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Miliband's first electoral tests as Labour Leader came in the elections to the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|Scottish Parliament]], [[Welsh Assembly election, 2011|Welsh Assembly]] and [[United Kingdom local elections, 2011|various councils]] across England, excluding [[London]] on 5 May 2011. The results for Labour were described as a &quot;mixed bag&quot;, with the party performing well in Wales â falling just one seat short of an overall majority and forming the next [[Welsh Government]] on its own â and making large gains from the [[Liberal Democrats]] in northern councils, including [[Sheffield]], [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]]. Results were less encouraging in the south of England however, and results in Scotland were described as a &quot;disaster&quot;, with Labour losing nine seats to the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], which went on to gain the Parliament's first ever majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13310842 | work=BBC News | title=Vote 2011: Labour 'on way back', says Miliband | date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miliband commented positively in regard to the results and said that following the poor showings in Scotland &quot;lessons must still be learnt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2011/05/12336/ Is Edâs head already on the chopping block?] Tribune 23 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2011 poll result from [[Ipsos MORI]] found Labour 2 percentage points ahead of the Tories, but Miliband's personal rating was low; he was rated as less popular than [[Iain Duncan Smith]] at a similar stage in his opposition leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2011/06/labour-opens-up-a-gap-on-the-nhs-but-miliband-tracks-ids/#axzz1S4P7jwe4|title=Labour opens up a gap on the NHS, but Miliband tracks IDS|publisher=The Financial Times|date=23 June 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, following the revelation that the [[News of the World]] had [[News of the World phone hacking affair|paid private investigators to hack into the phones]] of [[Milly Dowler]], as well as the families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for [[News International]] chief executive [[Rebekah Brooks]] to resign, urged [[David Cameron]] to establish a public and judicial-led inquiry into the scandal and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in [[BSkyB]]. He also called for the [[Press Complaints Commission]] to be abolished â which would later be echoed by both Cameron and [[Nick Clegg]] â and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor [[Andy Coulson]] to be his [[director of communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14027879|title=Rebekah Brooks must go over Milly 'hacking' - Miliband|publisher=The BBC|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron would later take the rare and unusual step of saying that the government would back Miliband's opposition motion that the BSkyB bid should be dropped, and just an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would drop its bid for BSkyB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14127282|title=Phone hacking: Rupert Murdoch 'could face MPs|publisher=The BBC|date=12 July 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14142307|title=News Corp withdraws bid for BSkyB|publisher=The BBC|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2011 England riots|riots in England]] in August 2011, Miliband called for a public inquiry into the events, and insisted that society had &quot;to avoid simplistic answers&quot;. The call for an inquiry was later rejected by David Cameron, prompting Miliband to say that he would set up his own inquiry in the absence of a government one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/2011/08/13/uk-riots-ed-miliband-launch-full-inquiry-into-riots-or-i-will-115875-23340603|title=UK riots: Ed Miliband - 'launch full inquiry into riots or I will'|publisher=[[The Daily Mirror]]|date=13 August 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a BBC Radio 4 interview shortly after the riots, Miliband spoke of an irresponsibility that not only applied to the people involved in the riots, but &quot;wherever we find it in our society. We've seen in the past few years...MPs' expenses, what happened in the banks&quot;. Miliband also stated Labour didn't do enough to tackle moral problems during their thirteen years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14503023 | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Riots: Miliband blames 'me first' culture | date=12 August 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadow Cabinet appointments===
{{main|Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband}}
The first [[Labour Party (UK) Shadow Cabinet election, 2010|election to the Shadow Cabinet]] that took place under Miliband's leadership was on 7 October 2010. Ending days of speculation, [[David Miliband]] announced that he would not seek election to the Shadow Cabinet on 29 September, the day nominations closed, saying he wanted to avoid &quot;constant comparison&quot; with his brother Ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/sep/29/david-miliband-quits-frontline-politics|title=David Miliband quits frontline politics|publisher=The Guardian|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=15 July 2011|location=London|first=Helene|last=Mulholland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three other defeated candidates for the Labour leadership all stood in the election, though [[Diane Abbott]] failed to win enough votes to gain a place. Following the election, Miliband unveiled his [[Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband|Shadow Cabinet]] on 8 October 2010. Amongst others he appointed [[Alan Johnson]] as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Yvette Cooper]] was chosen as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]], and both defeated Labour leadership candidates [[Ed Balls]] and [[Andy Burnham]] were given senior roles, becoming [[Shadow Home Secretary]] and [[Secretary of State for Education|Shadow Education Secretary]] respectively. Burnham was additionally given responsibility for overseeing Labour's election co-ordination. [[Sadiq Khan]], who managed Miliband's successful leadership campaign, was appointed [[Secretary of State for Justice|Shadow Justice Secretary]] and [[Lord Chancellor|Shadow Lord Chancellor]], and continuing [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader]] [[Harriet Harman]] continued to shadow [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], as well as being made [[Secretary of State for International Development|Shadow International Development Secretary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www2.labour.org.uk/labours-new-shadow-cabinet|title=Labour's New Shadow Cabinet|publisher=[[Labour Party (UK)]]|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Johnson would later resign from his position, stepping down for &quot;personal reasons&quot; on 20 January 2011, necessitating Miliband's first reshuffle, in which he made Balls Shadow Chancellor, Cooper Shadow Home Secretary and [[Douglas Alexander]] Shadow Foreign Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12242397|title=Alan Johnson 'to quit front-line politics' | work=BBC News | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2011, it was reported that Miliband was seeking to change the decades-old rule that Labour's Shadow Cabinet would be elected every two years, instead wanting to adopt a system where he alone had the authority to select its members. Miliband later confirmed the story, claiming that the rule represented &quot;a legacy of Labour's past in opposition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13898192|title=Ed Miliband seeks to change shadow cabinet selection|publisher=The BBC|date=24 June 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July, Labour MPs voted overwhelmingly to back the rule change, paving the way for [[ National Executive Committee|NEC]] and [[Labour Party Conference|Conference]] approval, which was attained in September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;D-H,leave&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15205409|title=Denham and Healey leave in shadow cabinet reshuffle|publisher=The BBC|date=6 October, 2011|accessdate=6 October, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Miliband to be the first Leader of the Labour Party to have the authority to pick his own Shadow Cabinet. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14024077|title=Labour MPs back Miliband on shadow cabinet elections|publisher=The BBC|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2011, [[Shadow_Cabinet_of_Ed_Miliband#2011_reshuffle|Miliband reshuffled his Shadow Cabinet]]. [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], [[John Healey]] and [[Shaun Woodward]] announced that they were stepping down, whilst [[Meg Hillier]], [[Ann McKechin]] and [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal|Baroness Scotland]] also left the Shadow Cabinet. Veteran MPs [[Tom Watson (politician)|Tom Watson]], [[Jon Trickett]], [[Stephen Twigg]] and [[Vernon Coaker]] were promoted to the Shadow Cabinet, as were several of the 2010 intake, including [[Chuka Umunna]], [[Margaret Curran]] and [[Rachel Reeves]], with [[Liz Kendall]] and [[Michael Dugher]] given the right to attend Shadow Cabinet. [[Stewart Wood, Baron Wood of Anfield|Lord Wood]] and [[Emily Thornberry]] were also made Shadow Cabinet attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15212234|title=Ed Miliband promotes fresh faces to Labour top team|publisher=The BBC|date=7 October, 2011|accessdate=8 October, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies and views==
===Self-description of views===
Miliband has described himself as a new type of Labour politician, looking to move beyond the divisiveness of [[Blairism]] and [[Brownism]], and calling for an end to the &quot;factionalism and psychodramas&quot; of Labour's past. He has also repeatedly spoken of the requirement for a &quot;new politics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8025055/Ed-Miliband-Self-confessed-maths-geek-with-a-talent-for-diplomacy.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Melissa | last=Kite | title=Ed Miliband: Self-confessed maths 'geek' with a talent for diplomacy | date=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Labour leadership campaign, he described himself as a [[socialist]], and has spoken out against some of the actions of the [[Blair government|Blair Government]], including criticising its record on civil liberties and stating that he would not have backed the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/features/opinion-former-index/legal-and-constitutional/comment-ed-miliband-is-more-dangerous-than-they-think-$21384250.htm|title=Comment: Ed Miliband is more dangerous than they think|publisher=Politics.co.uk|date=25 September 2010|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made calls for the UK to adopt a &quot;capitalism that works for the people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/68950,news-comment,news-politics,ed-miliband-left-wing-theyre-having-a-laugh|work=The First Post |title=Ed Miliband left-wing?

|date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2011 |publisher=[[The First Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he wasn't in Parliament at the time of the 2003 vote, he remains a strong critic of the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edmiliband.org/speeches/leaders-speech-2010/|work=edmilliband.org |title=Ed Miliband leader's speech 28/09/2010|date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has, however, backed UK military action and intervention in [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|Afghanistan]] and [[2011 intervention in Libya|Libya]] respectively. He also backs [[Gay marriage in the United Kingdom|gay marriage]], supports making the UK's 50p top rate of tax permanent, as well as the institution of a new [[financial transaction tax]], mutualising [[Northern Rock]], putting limits on top salaries, scrapping [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] in favour of a [[graduate tax]], implementing a [[Living wage|living wage policy]] and the [[Identity cards in the United Kingdom|scrapping of the ID cards policy]], and has spoken in favour of a &quot;National Care Service&quot; scheme, in effect nationalising [[elderly care]] in a manner similar to the [[National Health Service|NHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/8025068/Ed-Miliband-his-shadow-cabinet-and-key-policies.html|work= Daily Telegraph|title=Ed Miliband: his shadow cabinet and key policies

===Comments on other politicians===
Miliband has criticised [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Leader]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] for &quot;sacrificing everything on the altar of deficit reduction&quot;, and has accused him of being guilty of practising &quot;old politics&quot;, citing alleged broken promises on areas such as crime, policing and child benefit.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11981011 | work=BBC News | title=Ed Miliband asks Lib Dems to help draw up Labour policy | date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miliband has also been particularly critical of [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat Leader]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]] following the [[Conservative - Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]], accusing him of &quot;betrayal&quot; and of &quot;selling-out&quot; his party's voters. He has also stated that he would demand the resignation of Nick Clegg as a precursor to any future Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11016944 | work=BBC News | title=Ed Miliband 'won't work in coalition with Clegg' | date=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|2011 Alternative Vote referendum]], Miliband refused to share a platform with Clegg, stating that he had become &quot;too toxic&quot; a brand, and that he would harm the &quot;Yes to AV&quot; campaign. He did, however, share platforms during the campaign with former Lib Dem Leaders [[Paddy Ashdown|Lord Ashdown]] and [[Charles Kennedy]], as well as current [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Lib Dem Deputy Leader]] [[Simon Hughes]], the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party Leader]] [[Caroline Lucas]] and [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|Business Secretary]] [[Vince Cable]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/feb/06/ed-miliband-nick-clegg-av | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Patrick | last1=Wintour | first2=Nicholas | last2=Watt | title=Ed Miliband cool on sharing AV campaign platform with Nick Clegg | date=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since becoming Labour Leader, Miliband has made a number of speeches aimed at winning over disaffected Liberal Democrats, identifying a difference between the &quot;[[The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism|Orange Book]]&quot; Lib Dems who were closer to the Conservatives and Lib Dems who were on the centre-left, offering the latter a role in helping Labour's policy review.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;

Miliband has previously spoken positively of his brother [[David Miliband|David]], praising his record as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], and saying that &quot;his door was always open&quot; following David's decision not to stand for the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11432762|title=David Miliband says he won't join brother Ed's team|publisher=The BBC|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to choose the greatest [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], Miliband answered with Labour's post-war Prime Minister and longest-serving Leader, [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8742092.stm|title=As it happened: Newsnight Labour leader hustings|publisher=The BBC|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=15 July 2011|first=Emma|last=Griffiths}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also spoken positively of his two immediate predecessors as Labour Leader, former Prime Ministers [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]], praising their leadership and records in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11426411|title=Ed Miliband: Labour leader's 2010 conference speech in full|publisher=The BBC|date=28 September 2010|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
