==History==
===Origins===
NWS-9 began broadcasting on 5 September 1959. NWS-9 was the first television station broadcasting in Adelaide. NWS-9 studios is located at Tynte Street, North Adelaide. The station was owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]] who also owned [[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] newspaper.

In early [[1980]], [[NBN Television|NBN Limited]] purchased Southern Television Corporation Limited, owners of NWS, for [[Australian dollar|A$]]19 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;annual&quot;&gt;{{cite press release
| title = Annual Report
| publisher = NBN Limited
| year = 1980
| accessdate = 2006-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Hadjoin Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of Parry's Esplanade Limited (later Parry Corporation), purchased 19.88% of NBN Limited for A$6.7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;annual&quot; /&gt;

Following this, Parry then attempted to buy Wasley's stake in NBN, but was blocked by the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]]. It was later revealed that the Lambs had opposed NBN's purchase of the Star newspaper and the attempt to buy 2HD. The company also faced possible suspension from the [[Australian Stock Exchange]] if a decision wasn't made soon. In order to resolve the tension, NBN sold NWS to the Lambs in exchange for the majority stake in [[NBN Television|NBN]] in [[1982]].

===2000s===
On 30 May 2007, [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] announced its sale of NWS-9 to the [[WIN Corporation]] for $105 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''[[Nine News#Adelaide|Nine News Adelaide]]'' is produced from NWS's news studios and presented by [[Kate Collins (journalist)|Kate Collins]] with [[Kym Dillon]] presenting sport. Brenton Ragless is the weather presenter.

In October 2011, it was announced that [[Michael Smyth]] and [[Georgina McGuinness]] would not have their contracts renewed&lt;ref&gt;WIN sacks Nine News Adelaide presenters - ''TV Tonight'' (19/10/11) - http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2011/10/win-sacks-nine-news-adelaide-presenters.html&lt;/ref&gt;. From the end of November, Collins will present by herself and a new weekend presenter is yet to be announced. [[Rob Kelvin]] is the current interim weekend presenter.

Throughout the 1990s, Deanna Williams was the main fill-in presenter and state political reporter.

Following her resignation in March 2002, either Kelvin or Crease would fill in for McGuinness on weekends, but in 2005 the situation arose where all three presenters were unavailable, and then weekend sports presenter [[Mark Bickley]] had to read the news.

Ali Carle from [[Triple M Adelaide]] occasionally presents weather alongside her sport reporting duties.

In late 2008, NWS-9 launched its own local version of the station's flagship current affairs program, ''[[A Current Affair]]'', hosted by Adelaide journalist [[Kate Collins (journalist)|Kate Collins]].

On 26 November 2009, one day after the axing of the local [[A Current Affair#Adelaide|A Current Affair]] was announced, Kelly Nestor announced live on air that her contract as Kelvin's weeknight co-anchor with was not going to be renewed in 2010 and she would finish on 18 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,26405087-2682,00.html?from=public_rss|title=Channel Nine wrong to sack newsreader Kelly Nestor|last=Harvy|first=Ben|coauthors=Helene Sobolewski, Paul Starick|date=27 November 2009|work=The Advertiser|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2010, it was announced that senior reporter [[Michael Smyth]] would be  joining Rob Kelvin at the newsdesk.

On 31 October 2010, [[Rob Kelvin]] announced that he would retire from the newsdesk after 32 years on the air.
