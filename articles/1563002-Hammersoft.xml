Franco's family upbringing was &quot;academic, liberal and largely secular.&quot;&lt;ref name=niadraug&gt;{{Cite news|last=Raphael|first=Amy|title=Acting clever|work=The Guardian |location=UK ||date=January 24, 2009|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/24/james-franco-interview-milk|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in California with his two younger brothers, Tom and [[Dave Franco|Dave]] (&quot;Davy&quot;), the latter of whom is also an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/james-franco/|title=James Franco|last=Van Sant|first=Gus|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|page=1|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talented at mathematics, Franco interned at [[Lockheed Martin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson20100725&quot;&gt;Anderson, Sam. &quot;[http://instapaperstories.tumblr.com/post/972880219/the-james-franco-project-new-york-magazine The James Franco Project]&quot; ''New York'', July 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco was often encouraged by his father to get good grades and did exceptionally well on his [[SAT]]s.&lt;ref name=niadraug/&gt; He graduated from [[Palo Alto High School]] in 1996, where he acted in plays.{{r|anderson20100725}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800352352/bio|title=James Franco Biography|accessdate=August 8, 2008|publisher=Yahoo!}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his high school years, Franco was arrested for underage drinking, graffiti and for being a part of a group that stole designer fragrances from department stores and sold them to classmates.&lt;ref name=&quot;10facts&quot;/&gt; These arrests led to him briefly becoming a [[ward of the state]]. Facing the possibility of [[juvenile hall]], a judge decided to give Franco a second chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;itas&quot;/&gt; &quot;It was teen angst. I was uncomfortable in my own skin. I was shy. I changed my ways just in time to get good grades&quot;, he recalled of his troubles with the law.&lt;ref name=niadraug/&gt;

Although the idea of becoming a [[marine zoologist]] interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared rejection.&lt;ref name=&quot;itas&quot;/&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) as an English major,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Posner|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080805.wpineapple05/BNStory/Entertainment/?page=rss&amp;id=RTGAM.20080805.wpineapple05|title=Top of the food chain|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=August 5, 2008|work=The Globe and Mail |location=Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; but dropped out after his freshman year against his parents' wishes{{r|anderson20100725}} to pursue a career as an actor, since he would have to have waited two years to audition for their acting program.&lt;ref name=&quot;itas&quot;/&gt; Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo&quot;/&gt; Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at [[McDonald's]] to support himself since his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there.&lt;ref name=&quot;10facts&quot;/&gt; While working at the establishment, for his acting classes, he would practice accents on customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;itas&quot;&gt;&quot;James Franco&quot; [[Inside the Actors Studio]] December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that the aspiring actor was doing his best to follow his passion, Carnegie poignantly told Franco to pay him what he could and later on pay him back.&lt;ref name=&quot;itas&quot;/&gt;

== Acting career ==
=== Early work ===
After 15 months of training, he began auditioning in Los Angeles, and started professionally acting in 1997 with guest roles on television shows. His first break came in 1999, after he was cast in a leading role on the short-lived but well-reviewed television series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutfactory.com/browse/31/freaks_and_geeks.aspx|title=Shout! Factory&amp;nbsp;â Freaks And Geeks|accessdate=August 8, 2008|publisher=Shout Factory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, which ran for 18 episodes and was canceled due to low viewership, later became a [[cult hit]] among audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=IFC picks up two Judd Apatow series |work=Hollywood Reporter |author=Guider, Elizabeth |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since described the series as &quot;one of the most fun&quot; work experiences that he has had.&lt;ref name=&quot;upi&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=United Press International | work=Franco to reunite with Freaks pals | url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060923-111422-3997r | accessdate=September 23, 2006|publisher=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another interview, Franco said: &quot;When we were doing ''Freaks and Geeks'', I didnât quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasnât on me&amp;nbsp;... So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/james-franco/4/|title=James Franco|last=Van Sant|first=Gus|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|page=4|accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco made his film debut in a brief role in the 1999 Drew Barrymore-starring ''[[Never Been Kissed]]'' and his first major movie was the romantic teen comedy ''[[Whatever It Takes (film)|Whatever It Takes]]'' (2000), in which he played popular jock Chris. The latter is a modern day remake of the 1897 play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64610,00.html|title=What It Takes Review|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=March 31, 2000|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=A.O.|last=Scott|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E5DA143DF937A15750C0A9669C8B63|title=Whatever It Takes Review|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=March 24, 2000|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was subsequently cast as the [[James Dean|title role]] in director [[Mark Rydell]]'s 2001 TV biographical film ''[[James Dean (film)|James Dean]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdusatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Kelly|last=Carter|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2001-07-27-james-franco.htm|title=James Franco: The next James Dean|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=July 27, 2001|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Lee|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/06/entertainment/et-franco7|title=James Franco plays against type in 'Pineapple Express'|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=August 6, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; To immerse himself in the role, Franco went from being a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, dyed his dark brown hair blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdusatoday&quot;/&gt; To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdusatoday&quot;/&gt; While filming ''James Dean'', the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. &quot;It was a very lonely existence,&quot; he notes. &quot;If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jdusatoday&quot;/&gt; Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote: &quot;Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Tucker|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,255462,00.html|title=James Dean TV Review|accessdate=August 13, 2008|date=August 3, 2001|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Golden Globe Award]] and nominations for an [[Emmy Award]] and a [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild Award]] (SAG).&lt;ref name=&quot;golden globe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/29141|title=HFPA&amp;nbsp;â Awards Search|accessdate=August 8, 2008|publisher=Golden Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=8th Annual SAG Awards Nominee&amp;nbsp;â Screen Actors Guild Awards|accessdate=August 8, 2008|publisher=Screen Actors Guild Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2002 Emmys|accessdate=August 8, 2008|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Franco 2007 Spiderman 3 premiere.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Franco at the ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' premiere, April 2007]]
Franco achieved worldwide fame and attention, in the 2002 superhero film ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'', when he played [[Harry Osborn]], the son of the villainous [[Green Goblin]] ([[Willem Dafoe]]) and best friend of the [[Spider-Man|title character]] ([[Tobey Maguire]]). Originally, Franco was considered for the lead role of [[Spider-Man|Spider-Man/Peter Parker]] in the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-05-03-spider-man.htm#more | title=Mike Clark review |work=USA Today | date=May 3, 2002 | accessdate=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the lead went to Maguire. Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that there are &quot;good moments&quot; between Maguire and Franco in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=review&amp;reviewid=VE1117917507&amp;categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=Spider-Man Review|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|date=April 19, 2002|work=Variety |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spider-Man'' was a commercial and critical success.&lt;ref name=&quot;rt&quot;/&gt; The movie grossed $114&amp;nbsp;million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $822&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=jamesfranco.htm|title=James Franco Movie Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He next starred in ''[[Sonny (film)|Sonny]]'', a 2002 release in which he was directed by fellow actor [[Nicolas Cage]].

Also in 2006, he made a [[cameo appearance]] in the romantic comedy ''[[The Holiday]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;/&gt; 

He again played Harry Osborn in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007). In contrast to the previous two films' positive reviews, ''Spider-Man 3'' was met with a mixed reception by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;rt&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891&amp;nbsp;million, it stands as the most successful [[Spider-Man in film#Box office performance|film in the series]], and Franco's highest grossing film to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;earnings&quot;/&gt; In this same year, Franco made a cameo appearance as himself in the Apatow-directed comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]'', which starred ''Freaks and Geeks'' alumni [[Seth Rogen]], [[Jason Segel]] and [[Martin Starr]].&lt;ref name=&quot;10facts&quot;/&gt; Franco co-starred with [[Sienna Miller]] in the low-budget [[independent films]] ''[[Camille (2007 film)|Camille]]'', a dark fantasy [[dramedy]] about a young newly wed couple and ''[[Interview (2007 film)|Interview]]'', where he appears in a voice only role, both 2007 movies that were ignored by audiences and critics alike. Among his other 2007 projects were ''Good Time Max'', which Franco wrote, directed and starred in. The movie premiered at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and centers around two talented brothers who take very diverse paths in life, one going on to become a doctor whilst the other sibling (Franco) experiences unemployment and uses drugs. The actor chose to cast himself in that role because, &quot;It was really just a process of elimination. I was better suited for this role than the responsible surgeon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-coverage/james-franco-is-good-time_b_47234.html |title=James Franco is Good Time Max |work=Huffington Post |location=USA |publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com Inc |first=Katherine |last=Thomson |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
[[File:Jamesfranco.jpg|thumb|left|Franco being interviewed in 2011|220px]]
He has been described as having &quot;an unusually high metabolism for productivity...a superhuman ability to focus&quot;.{{r|anderson20100725}} Viewed as a [[sex symbol]], Franco was named the Sexiest Man Living in 2009 by [[Salon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Hepola|title=Sexiest Man Living 2009 |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/sexiest_man_living_2009/2009/11/19/james_franco/index.html|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There has often been frequent media coverage of Franco, particularly regarding his interest in going to colleges. In addition to that, Franco has also claimed to have been strongly misquoted by reports in the media&lt;ref name=&quot;playboy&quot;/&gt; and news outlets reporting erroneous information about him.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]]'' [[Public Broadcasting System]] April 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the actor being parodied in an episode of ''SNL''{{'}}s Weekend Update segment, which an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer deemed &quot;clever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/02/06/saturday-night-live-dana-carvey-linkin-park/ |title='Saturday Night Live' recap: Dana Carvey brought his old characters, some old friends, and Justin Bieber |work=Entrainment Weekly |publisher=Time Inc |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 interview, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Iâve been perceived as this guy yelling, 'Hey, look at me. I want attention.' Iâm not going to school to get articles written about me. Iâm just going to school. But the fact that Iâm going to school or that someone takes a picture of me sleeping is like, 'Weâre gonna jump on that and criticize him for his antics.' What antics? I write. I make movies. Iâm going to school. I hosted the Oscars. I take these projects seriously.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;playboy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to questions regarding his sexuality now that he has portrayed three gay characters during his acting career, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. &quot;Or, you know what,&quot; he quipped, &quot;maybe Iâm just gay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Donnelly|title=James Franco's Maybe I'm just gay'- and why we love it|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2011/01/james-franco-gay.html|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] blog|date=January 7, 2011|accessdate=January 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those rumors led to a [[Gawker]] article linking him to a ''[[New York Post]]'' Page Six [[blind item]] about a [[closeted gay]] actor, nicknamed &quot;the Gay Rapist&quot;. Despite the victim of the alleged attack denying that it was Franco, two magazines then contacted Franco's lawyer to alert them that they might run stories suggesting his involvement, but were unable to as at least part of their stories were fabricated.&lt;ref name=&quot;playboy&quot;/&gt; However, Gawker refused to take their article down as they were simply reporting what another outlet published and instead offered him a chance to make a comment about the speculation on its website. He declined, hoping it would die down. The actor later called the episode very offensive because he has friends who have been raped.&lt;ref name=&quot;playboy&quot;/&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 2008, he was named as the new face of [[Gucci]]'s men's fragrance line.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanity f&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Franco a big man in 'Milk' â and on campus|last=Pearlman|first=Cindy|date=November 30, 2008|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his secular upbringing, Franco told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he feels as if he has &quot;missed out on the Jewish experience&quot;, but has been told not to worry about that by his Jewish friends. He said in the same interview that he likes &quot;the idea of religion as a source of community.&quot; When asked if he was a &quot;believer&quot;, he responded &quot;In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question.&quot;&lt;ref name=niadraug/&gt; After meeting on the set of ''Whatever It Takes'', Franco dated co-star [[Marla Sokoloff]] for five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;peoplebio&quot;/&gt; He was in a relationship with actress Ahna O'Reilly for several years since around 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;peoplebio&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=James Franco Biography|last=Dinh|first=Mai|coauthors=Janet Murphy|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-08-03-james-franco_N.htm|title='Pineapple' star Franco digs deep, plays stoner and serious|last=Freydkin|first=Donna|date=August 3, 2008|work=USA Today|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He confirmed their separation in an interview for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's August 2011 issue, saying that his interest in education got between them.&lt;ref name=&quot;playboy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playboy.com/magazine/james-franco-interview/2 |title=Playboy Interview: JAMES FRANCO |first=Stephen |last=Rebello |work=[[Playboy]] |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Dissatisfied with his career's direction,{{r|anderson20100725}} Franco reenrolled at [[UCLA]] in the fall of 2006 as an [[English studies|English]] major with a [[creative writing]] concentration. He received permission to take as many as 62 [[course credit]]s per [[academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] compared to the normal limit of 19,&lt;ref name=&quot;schmelzer20100101&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmelzer|first=Randi|title=Smart Set|url=http://magazine.ucla.edu/features/smart_set/|accessdate=September 6, 2010|newspaper=UCLA Magazine|date=January 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while still continuing to act. He received his undergraduate degree in June 2008 with a [[Academic grading in the United States#Grade point average|GPA]] over 3.5/4.0.{{r|schmelzer20100101}}{{r|anderson20100725}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/08/27/2008-08-27_brad_pitt_explores_other_options.html?page=1|title=Brad Pitt explores other options|last=Black|first=Rosemary|date=August 27, 2008|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|page=2|accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his degree, Franco prepared his departmental honors thesis as a novel under the supervision of [[Mona Simpson (novelist)|Mona Simpson]].{{r|anderson20100725}}&lt;ref name=smartset&gt;{{cite news | first=Randi| last=Schmelzer| url=http://www.magazine.ucla.edu/features/smart_set/| title=Smart Set| work=ucla.edu|work=UCLA Magazine Online|date=January 1, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the university, the actor studied French, the [[Holocaust]], philosophy of science, and American literature among other things. To continue acting, he would study on film sets.&lt;ref name=niadraug/&gt; 

He was selected as the commencement speaker at his alma mater, [[UCLA College of Letters and Science|UCLA]], and was to speak at the ceremony on June 12, 2009. On June 3, however, a press release announced Franco's cancellation due to a scheduling conflict, making it the second cancellation in a row, after commencement speaker [[Bill Clinton]] had canceled the appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailybruin.com/index.php/article/2009/06/franco-cancels-commencement-keynote|title=Franco cancels as commencement keynote|last=Schaefer|first=Samantha|date=June 3, 2009|work=[[Daily Bruin]]|accessdate=June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 26, 2011, Franco and the Harvard Lampoon released a satirical video on prominent comedy website [[Funny or Die]] mocking his last-minute cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/ab25302c8e/james-franco-s-rejected-ucla-commencement-speech/|title=James-Franco's-Rejected-UCLA-Commencement-Speech|date=July 8, 2009|work=[[Funny or Die]]|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been accepted to the [[University of Houston]] for the doctoral programâone of 20 people to be selected out of 400 applicantsâin literature  and [[University of Houston Creative Writing Program|creative writing]] and plans to enroll in fall 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/main/7531811.html|title=Actor James Franco accepted to UH creative writing program|date=April 21, 2011|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having previously shown a desire to teach, in March 2011, it was announced that Franco will teach a fall semester course on modifying poetry into short films to ten to twelve third-year graduate film students at NYU. The course will focus mainly on production, meaning that the students will be in charge of creating their own film based on poetry. At the time of the announcement the actor had yet to put together a syllabus, but has until the summertime to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/29/james-franco-nyu-course/ |first=Keith |last=Staskiewicz |title=James Franco to teach film course at NYU, but no syllabus as of yet |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about his education, Franco said that he loves school and that it keeps him focused as well as grounded. &quot;I go to school because I love being around people who are interested in what Iâm interested in and Iâm having a great experienceâ¦ Iâm studying things that I love so itâs not like itâs a chore&quot;, he told the ''[[Washington Post]]'', according to a ''[[New York Magazine]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/05/james_franco_to_teach_yale_stu.html |title=James Franco to Teach Yale Students |work=New York Magazine |author=Duboff, Josh |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franco has also credited his education for helping him &quot;take acting seriously&quot; when his parents did not see it as a successful post-college career.&lt;ref name=&quot;itas&quot;/&gt; Franco developed an aptitude for artâpainting in particularâduring his high school years while attending the [[California State Summer School for the Arts]] (CSSSA).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo&quot;/&gt; Franco has said painting was the &quot;outlet&quot; he needed in high school, and he &quot;has actually been painting longer than he has been acting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;painting&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Lindzi.com Your Connection to the Stars | work=James Franco | url=http://www.lindzi.com/interviews/james.htm | accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings were displayed publicly for the first time at the [[GlÃ¼ Gallery]] in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ann|last=Oldenburg|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-08-14-celebs-painting_x.htm|title=Celebrities pour passion into artwork|accessdate=August 8, 2008|date=August 14, 2002|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;t.g.article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/feb/20/james-franco-art-oscars-interview |title=The many lives of James Franco |first=Helen |last=Pidd |work=The Guardian |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He enjoys reading on the set of his films. ''Pineapple Express'' producer [[Judd Apatow]] has said of him: &quot;He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]'' on set. We still haven't read ''The Iliad''. It was a very difficult book. With him, it was always [[James Joyce]] or something.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAToday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-08-03-james-franco_N.htm|title='Pineapple' star Franco digs deep, plays stoner and serious|last=Freydkin|first=Donna|work=USA Today|date=August 5, 2008|accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charitable work ==
Franco has said aiding others is &quot;the key to life, the key to happiness&quot; and, &quot;as an actor, you can get wrapped up in yourself and your career...A little secret is one of the greatest ways to break that is to stop thinking about yourself for a second.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-12-08/entertainment/27083812_1_actors-studio-james-lipton-james-franco |title=James Franco credits obsession, UCLA education, giving back for success: 'Inside the Actors Studio' |work=NY Daily News |author=Chen, Joyce |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his ''Spider-Man'' co-star [[Kirsten Dunst]] for advice. At the suggestion of Dunst, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/2011/01/17/20110117james-franco-kirsten-dunst-charity-advice.html |title=James Franco saved by Kirsten Dunst's charity advice |work=[[The Arizona Republic]]  |date=January 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2011, the actor took part in &quot;An Evening with James Franco&quot;, a Washington DC dinner benefit for 826DC, a non-profit foundation created to help neighborhood students reach their goals, as well as provide after-school literature programs and workshops which encourage them to improve their writing skills. Franco became involved with Dave Eggers' [[826 National]] after Eggers asked him to do a conceptual idea for the program, and he directed a documentary for them and has since been a supporter of them. At the event, Franco spoke about how he thought schools needed to be more original with their literature programs. &quot;Writing can do things that video cannot&quot;, he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonlife.com/2011/04/04/charity-spotlight-evening-with-james-franco/ |title=Charity Spotlight: Evening With James Franco |publisher=Washington Life Magazine |date=April 4, 2011 |author=Farazad, Roshan |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April, Franco autographed a T-shirt that will be auctioned-off through the Yoshiki Foundation, with the proceeds being donated for the [[2011 TÅhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japanese tsunami relief]] occurring in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2011/04/13/robert-pattinson-japan-relief/ |first=Jocelyn |last=Vena |title=Robert Pattinson Takes Off Shirt For Japan Relief |publisher=MTV |publisher=Viacom |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, he was honored by [[amfAR]], the foundation for [[AIDS research]], at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. Franco received the Piaget Award of Inspiration for his humanitarian work and contributions to menâs style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/05/31/James_Franco_Honored_by_amfAR/ |title=James Franco Honored by amfAR |work=[[The Advocate]] |publisher=Here Media Inc |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
