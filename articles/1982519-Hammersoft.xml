'''Weather Underground''' is a commercial [[weather]] service that provides real-time [[Weather forecasting|weather information]] via the [[Internet]]. Weather Underground provides weather reports for most major cities across the world on its Web site, as well as local weather reports for newspapers and Web sites.  Most of its [[United States]] information comes from the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), as information from that agency is within the [[public domain]] by federal law.  The Web site is available in many languages, and an [[advertising|ad-free]] version of the site with additional features is available for an annual fee.

== History ==
Based in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], it was founded in 1995 as an offshoot of the [[University of Michigan]]'s Internet weather database. The name is a reference to the 1960s [[militant]] [[Far left|radical]] student group [[Weatherman (organization)|the Weather Underground]], which also originated at the University of Michigan.

Jeff Masters, then a [[PhD]] candidate in [[meteorology]] at the [[University of Michigan]] working under the direction of Professor Perry Samson, wrote a menu-based [[telnet]] interface in 1991 that displayed real-time weather information around the world. By 1992, they claim that the two servers they used were the most popular service on the Internet. In 1993 they initiated a project to bring Internet weather into [[K-12]] classrooms.

In 1995 Weather Underground, Inc. evolved as a commercial entity separate from the university.&lt;ref&gt;Weather Underground, Inc.

In 2005 Weather Underground became the weather provider for the [[Associated Press]]; WU also provides weather reports for some newspapers (including the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]) and the [[Google]] search engine.

In October 2008, Jeff Masters reported that the site was #2 in Internet Weather for 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Master's WunderBlog, 10-27-2008 [http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1139 Heavy Internet Weather] Retrieved on 2008-10-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blogs ==
[[Blog]]s are one of the main features in Weather Underground, allowing users of the site to create blogs about weather, everyday life and anything else. Dr. Jeff Masters started the first blog on April 14, 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Weather Underground, Inc.

Weather Underground also uses observations from members with automated [[personal weather station]]s (PWS).&lt;ref&gt;Weather Underground, Inc. [http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/index.asp Personal Weather Station.] Retrieved on 2008-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The service distributes [[Internet radio]] feeds of [[NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards|NOAA Weather Radio]] stations from across the country, as provided by users.  The [[Associated Press]] uses Weather Underground to provide national weather summaries.&lt;ref&gt;WEATHER UNDERGROUND For The Associated Press.
