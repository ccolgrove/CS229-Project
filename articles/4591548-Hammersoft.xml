The '''Balochistan conflict''' is an ongoing conflict between [[Baloch nationalist]]s and the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]] of [[Pakistan]] over [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], the country's largest province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8444354.stm BBC News- Balochistan reaches boiling point]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, separatists have also clashed with [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] over its respective [[Balochistan (Iran)|Baloch region]], which borders Pakistan. 
Shortly after [[Independence of Pakistan|Pakistan's creation]] in 1947, the [[Pakistan Army|Army of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan]] had to subdue insurgents based in [[Kalat]] who rejected the King of Kalat decision to  accede to Pakistan, reminiscent of the Indian Army's operation in the Principality state of Hyderabad . The movement gained momentum during the 1960s, and amid consistent political disorder, the government ordered a [[Baloch insurgency and Rahimuddin's stabilization|military operation]] into the region in 1973, assisted by Iran, and inflicted heavy casualties on the separatists. The movement was largely quelled after the imposition of [[martial law]] in 1977, after Pakistan experienced an Economic Boom and Baluchistan witnessed significant development . After insurgency groups again mushroomed in the 1990s and 2000s, the [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[war in North-West Pakistan]] exacerbated the conflict, most recently manifested in the killings of non-Baloch settlers in the province by separatists since 2006.

==Area of dispute==
[[Image:Major ethnic groups of Pakistan in 1980.jpg|thumb|230px|Distribution of Balochs is marked in pink.|left]]

Historical Balochistan comprised the [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan region]]. Its western region was the southern part of [[Sistan o Baluchestan]] province, [[Iran]]. In the east was [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Pakistani Balochistan]]. In the northwest the [[Helmand]] province of [[Afghanistan]]. The [[Gulf of Oman]] formed its southern border. Although historical Balochistan is the largest (44% of the country's area) region of Pakistan, it is the least populated (only 5% of the population) and the least developed area.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Assistance Islamic Republic of Pakistan: Balochistan Economic Report http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/PAK/39003-PAK-TAR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
There are four distinct parties involved and affected by this conflict:

* Central government of Pakistan (since 1948)
* Government of Iran (since 2003)
* People of the Iranian region
* Sardars (Tribal chiefs)of Pakistani region

==First conflict 1948 (led by Prince Abdul Karim Khan)==
In April 1948, Baloch nationalists claim that the central government sent the Pakistan army, which allegedly forced Mir Ahmed Yar Khan to give up his state, [[Kalat (princely state)|Kalat]]. Kalat was a landlocked British protectorate that comprised roughly 22%â23% of Balochistan. Mir Ahmed Yar Khan signed an accession agreement ending Kalat's de facto independence. His brother, [[Prince Abdul Karim Khan]], was a powerful governor of a section of Kalat, a position that he was removed from after accession. He decided to initiate an insurgency against Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Soszynski |url=http://www.uq.net.au/~zzhsoszy/ips/k/kalat.html |title=KALAT |publisher=Uq.net.au |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of May 16, 1948 Prince Abdul Karim Khan initiated a separatist movement against the Pakistani government. He conducted guerrilla warfare based in Afghanistan against the Pakistan army.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Bennett Jones, Pakistan: Eye of the storm (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002) p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second conflict 1958â59 (led by Nawab Nowroz Khan)==
Nawab Nowroz Khan took up arms in resistance to the [[One Unit]] policy, which decreased government represenation for tribal leaders. He and his followers started a guerrilla war against Pakistan. Nowroz Khan and his followers were charged with treason and arrested and confined in [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] jail. Five of his family members (sons and nephews) were subsequently hanged under charges of aiding murder of Pakistani troops and treason. Nawab Nowroz Khan later died in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Selig S Harrison, In Afghanistanâs Shadow, pp.27â28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third conflict 1963â69 (led by Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri)==
After the second conflict, the Federal government sent the Army to build new military bases in the key conflict areas of Balochistan in order to resist further chaos. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led  like-minded militants into guerrilla warfare by creating their own insurgent bases spread out over {{convert|45000|mi|km}} of land, from the [[Mengal]] tribal area in the south to the [[Marri]] and [[Bugti]] tribal areas in the north. Their goal was to force Pakistan to share revenue generated from the [[Sui gas fields]] with the tribal leaders. The insurgents bombed railway tracks and ambushed convoys. The Army retaliated by destroying vast areas of the Marri tribe's land. This insurgency ended in 1969 and the Baloch separatists agreed to a ceasefire. [[Yahya Khan]] abolished the &quot;One Unit&quot; policy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=4373 Pakistan: The Worsening Conflict in Balochistan],&quot; [[International Crisis Group]], Asia Report No. 119, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the recognition of Balochistan as the fourth province of West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) in 1970, containing all the Balochistani princely states, the High Commissioners Province and [[Gwadar]], an 800&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coastal area purchased by the Pakistani Government from Oman.

==Fourth conflict 1973â77 (led by Nawab Khair Baksh Marri)==
{{details|Baloch Insurgency and Rahimuddin's Stabilization}}
Citing treason, President Bhutto dismissed the provincial governments of Balochistan and NWFP and imposed martial law in those provinces.&lt;ref&gt;The State of Martial Rule, [[Ayesha Jalal]], Sang-e-Meel 1999 ISBN 969-35-0977-3 page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Dismissal of the provincial governments led to armed insurgency. [[Khair Bakhsh Marri]] formed the [[Balochistan Peopleâs Liberation Front]] (BPLF), which led large numbers of Marri and Mengal tribesmen into guerrilla warfare against the central government.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Abbas, Pakistanâs Drift into Extremism (New Delhi: Pentagon Press, 2005) p.79&lt;/ref&gt; According to some authors, the Pakistani military lost 300 to 400 soldiers during the conflict with the Balochi separatists, while between 7,300 and 9,000 Balochi militants and civilians were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erols&quot;&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat6.htm Eckhardt, SIPRI 1988: 6,000 military + 3,000 civilians = 9,000, Clodfelter: 3,300 govt. losses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fifth conflict 2004 â to date (led by Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti and Mir Balach Marri)==

In 2005, the Baluch political leaders [[Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti]] and [[Mir Balach Marri]] presented a 15-point agenda to the Pakistan government. Their stated demands included greater control of the province's resources and a Moratorium on the construction of military bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;FestersNYTApril2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/world/asia/02pakistan.html In Remote Pakistan Province, a Civil War Festers, NYT, April 2, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2005, Inspector-General of [[Frontier Corps]] Maj Gen Shujaat Zamir Dar and his deputy Brig Salim Nawaz (the current IGFC) were wounded after shots were fired at their helicopter in Balochistan province. The provincial interior secretary later said that &quot;both of them were wounded in the leg but both are in stable condition.&quot; The two men had been visiting [[Kohlu]], about {{convert|220|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Quetta]], when their aircraft came under fire. The helicopter landed safely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4531546.stm &quot;Pakistan general hurt in attack&quot;] ''BBC News'', December 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, [[Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti]], 79 years old, was killed in fighting with the Pakistan Army in which at least 60 Pakistani soldiers and 7 officers were killed. He was charged by Pakistan's government of a series of bomb blasts, killings of the people he professed to protect and the rocket attack on the President Pervez Musharraf.&lt;ref name=&quot;BugtiDeathGall&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/world/asia/28pakistan.html Tribal Leader's Killing Incites Riots, New York Times, August 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, [[Baloch National Movement]] president [[Ghulam Mohammed Baloch]] and two other nationalist leaders (Lala Munir and Sher Muhammad), were seized from a small legal office and were allegedly &quot;handcuffed, blindfolded and hustled into a waiting pickup truck which is in still use of intelligence forces in front of their lawyer and neighboring shopkeepers.&quot;The gunmen were allegedly speaking in Persian (a national language of neighboring Afghanistan and Iran) Five days later on April 8 their bodies, &quot;riddled with bullets&quot; were found in a commercial area.The BLA claims Pakistani forces were behind the killings, though international experts have deemed it odd that the Pakistani forces,, would be careless enough to allow the bodies to be found so easily and 'light Balochistan on fire' (Herald) if they were truly responsible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gall&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/world/asia/12baluchistan.html?ref=world Another Insurgency Gains in Pakistan By CARLOTTA GALL. July 11, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the bodies sparked &quot;rioting and weeks of strikes, demonstrations and civil resistance&quot; in cities and towns around [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7991385.stm Riots as Baloch chiefs found dead] BBC, April 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Turbat killings]]).

On August 12, 2009, [[Khan of Kalat]] [[Suleman Dawood Khan|Mir Suleiman Dawood]] declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally made announcement of a Council for Independent Balochistan. The Council's claimed domain includes &quot;[[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Baloch of Iran]]&quot;, as well as Pakistani Balochistan, but does not include Afghan Baloch regions,and the Council contains &quot;all separatist leaders including Nawabzada Bramdagh Bugti.&quot;  He claims that &quot;the UK had a moral responsibility to raise the issue of Balochistanâs illegal occupation at international level.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/12-Aug-2009/Council-of-Independent-Balochistan-announced |title='Council of Independent Balochistan' announced &amp;#124; Pakistan &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Newspaper &amp;#124; Daily &amp;#124; English &amp;#124; Online |publisher=Nation.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged Foreign Support for Baluch rebels==
Pakistan has repeatedly accused India, and occasionally the U.S., of supporting the Baluch rebels in order to destabilize the country and claiming undeniable evidence.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/225958/balochistan-conflict-pms-talks-with-leaders-unlikely-to-succeed/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;India support&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/no-evidence-that-india-aiding-pak-baloch-rebels/466814/ |title='No evidence that India aiding Pak Baloch rebels' |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has categorically denied the allegations, pointing to a lack of concrete evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;India support&quot;/&gt; Iran asserts that the U.S. provides Jundullah support. Captured Jundullah leader Abdulmalek Rigi confirmed the allegations, though the U.S. government continues to deny providing assistance to Jundullah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rigi&quot;/&gt; Neutral observers[who?] have noted that the Baloch nationalist groups are poorly-trained in  military tactics and strategy, and are currently outgunned by the Pakistani state. The groups are mainly armed with small non-automatic weapons and [[AK-47]]s, which are widely available in Pakistan, and they are not skilled at using [[Improvised Explosive Devices]] (IEDs). The poor state of the force's organization and equipment would seem to indicate that any external support is minimal.   

Baluchi rebels in Pakistan are said to receive significant support from the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jamestown.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=105163&amp;sectionid=351020401 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s the [[CIA]], the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], Pakistani Sunni extremist group [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]] and the [[Mujahedin e-Kalq]] all supported a Baluchi tribal uprising against Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baluch support&quot;/&gt;. Pakistan has also accused India of giving citizenship to a senior Baluch Separatist[who?]. 

[[Selig S. Harrison]] of the [[George Soros]]-funded [[Center for International Policy]] has called for dividing Pakistan and supporting an independent Baluch province as a means of weakening any alliance between Islamabad and Beijing. Relations between the two countries have warmed, with Pakistan granting China access to a naval base at [[Gwadar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/free-baluchistan-4799 &quot;Free Baluchistan&quot;, The National Interest 1 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar views have been promoted by [[Ralph Peters]], a strategic affairs analyst, former [[U.S. Army]] officer, and an expert on the Middle East and the Islamic world.

==The biggest attacks of the terrorist group Jundallah in Iran==
*[[2007 Zahedan bombings]]: 18 people were killed.
*[[2009 Zahedan bombing]]: 20 people were killed.
*[[2009 Pishin bombing]]: 43 people were killed.
*[[July 2010 Zahedan bombings]]: 27 people were killed.
*[[2010 Chabahar suicide bombing]]: 38 people were killed.

Among the deaths in the Pishin bombings were two [[Iranian Revolutionary Guards]] generals: Noor Ali Shooshtari, the deputy commander of the [[Ground Forces of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Revolutionary Guards' ground forces]] and Rajab Ali Mhammadzadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' Sistan and Baluchistan provincial commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8312964.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iranian commanders assassinated |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic Effects and Shortage of Skilled Workers ==
Chief Minister of the Province has said 
&quot;A large number of professors, teachers, engineers, barbers and masons are leaving the province for fear of attacks,This inhuman act will push the Baloch nation at least one century back. The Baloch nation will never forgive whoever is involved in target killings.
He said the government has approved three university campuses, three medical colleges and hospitals for Turbat, Mastung, Naseerabad and Loralai districts but there was shortage of teachers in the area&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/37512/raisani-seeks-mandate-for-talks-with-insurgents/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and Human Rights Issues==
The Government of Pakistan has repeatedly stated its intention to bring industrialization to the province, and continues to claim that progress has been made  and introduced a Economic Package called &quot;Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan&quot;.  This is vehemently challenged by [[Baloch nationalist]] groups, who argue the benefits of these policies have not accrued to the native Baloch residents of the province.  Baloch nationalist groups continue to highlight the extraction of natural resources, especially [[natural gas]], from the province, without discernible economic benefit to the Baloch people.  Nonetheless, the government of Pakistan continues to insist that industrial zones are planned along the new [[Gawadar]]-[[Karachi]] highway. According to the government, this development is envisaged to bring accelerated progress in the future for the Baloch. On the third of May 2004 Three Chinese engineers working on a hydropower project that would enable irrigation for poor Baloch farmers as part of Pakistani government's initiatives to develop Baloch agricultural capacity were killed while another 11 injured in a car bomb attack by BLA. China called back her engineers working on the project in Balochistan. The progress in the hydro-power sector has been slow since then. However, the people of the region have been largely forced to maintain a [[nomad]]ic [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] due to extreme [[poverty]], [[illiteracy]] and inability to respond to changing modern environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/7284|title= Poverty and Oppression|publisher= unpo.org |accessdate=2010-11- 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous people are continuously threatened by war and other means of [[oppression]] which has resulted in loss of thousands of innocent lives for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/feb/02guest1.htm|title=The 5th Baluch War|publisher= rediff.org |accessdate=2010-11- 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5109112.stm|title=Baluchistan: Resource-rich and Volatile|publisher= bbc.com |accessdate=2010-11- 23|date=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4372789.stm|title=Journalists find Baluchistan 'war zone'|publisher= bbc.com |accessdate=2010-11- 23|first=Zaffar|last=Abbas|date=2005-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, according to [[Amnesty International]], Baluch activists, politicians and [[student]] leaders are among those that are being targeted in [[forced disappearance]]s, [[Kidnapping|abduction]]s, [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrests]] and cases of [[torture]] and other ill-treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/pakistan-urged-investigate-murder-and-torture-baloch-activists-2010-10-26|title= Pakistan urged to investigate murder and torture of Baluch activists|publisher= amnesty.org |accessdate=2010-10- 28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The resources of the local inhabitants such as [[natural gas]], [[mineral]]s, [[ocean]]s and others have been used to produce energy for Pakistan and generated. Balochistan gets Rs32.71 per unit on account of gas revenues which includes a royalty of Rs13.90, excise duty of Rs5.09 and gas development surcharge of Rs13.72. Also many private individuals with gas storages on their land also receive payments. Many Balochs argue that such royalties are too low.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.dawn.com/archives/155005&lt;/ref&gt; In response in 2011 Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani announced a further Rs. 120 billion ($2.5 USD)  under Balochistan gas development surcharge and royalty part of the &quot;Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan&quot; package&lt;ref&gt;hhttp://ftpapp.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=158661&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; The royalties often do not trickle down to the common people in Balochistan due to corruption and welath-hoarding of Baloch tribal chiefs. This has hindered the growth of infrastructure. 

;Multiculturalism and immigration
Skill is imported from other regions, due to shortage of skilled workers in the region. The arrival of skilled workers means new industries can develop and boost the local economy however nationalist argue that this creates resentment amongst the local inhabitants. Previously,Sindhi people had been the indigenous people of the city [[Karachi]] in [[Sindh]] but after migration from Balouchistan, Central Asia, Iran, East Asia and particularly [[partition of India|India]], large number of immigrants were settled in [[Karachi]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.findpk.com/cities/html/karachi.html &lt;/ref&gt; thus the local inhabitants (Sindhis) became a minority in the largest city of their province. Nationalists argue against multiculturalism and non-Baloch immigration. [[Karachi|Karachi city]] has been playing a key role as a financial hub for Pakistan and its economy has exploded to become on the major cities in Asia as a [[Port of Karachi|seaport]]. However  the city continues be a home for [[Ethnic violence|ethnic]] and [[Sectarian violence|sectarian]] violence. Balouch nationalist argue that migration leads to such events, and they are opposed to similar situation in Baluchistan.  [[Suleman Dawood Khan|Mir Suleiman Dawood]] claims that the people in Balochistan remain deeply resentful of Pakistan's policies in the region and he,apart from other,rather militant,Baloch nationalist organizations have openly called for India's assistance in Balochistan's separation from Pakistan. On August 12, 2009, [[Khan of Kalat]] [[Suleman Dawood Khan|Mir Suleiman Dawood]] declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally made announcement of a Council for Independent Balochistan. The Council's claimed domain includes &quot;[[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Baloch of Iran]]&quot;, apart fron Pakistani Balochistan,but does not include Afghan Baloch regions,and the Council contains &quot;all separatist leaders including Nawabzada Bramdagh Bugti.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8444354.stm | work=BBC News | title=Balochistan reaches boiling point | date=January 7, 2010 | accessdate=April 26, 2010 | first=Aleem | last=Maqbool}}&lt;/ref&gt;
