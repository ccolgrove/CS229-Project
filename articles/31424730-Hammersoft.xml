==Beginning==
===Solo project (2007)===

Anthem Lights began as a solo project for [[Singing|vocalist]] Chad Graham in the fall of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Release Tuesday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthem Lights Artist Profile - Biography And Discography - NewReleaseTuesday.com|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=3333|publisher=newreleasetuesday.com|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both he and [[singer-songwriter]] Alan Powell were living in [[Los Angeles]], writing music for Graham's solo project.  As the final vocal work was being installed, Powell and Graham came to a realization that the songs being written would be more appropriate performed as a group.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=YouTube - Meet Anthem Lights|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG71TiZFu04|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was then that Powell and Graham decided to alert their contacts at [[Liberty University]] in an effort to recruit members for what was now a [[Musical ensemble|singing group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot; /&gt;  Powell and Graham's contacts came to a consensus that Kyle Kupecky and Caleb Grimm would be the best candidates for the project.  After receiving notifications by [[Email|e-mail]], Graham flew from [[Los Angeles]] to meet with Kupecky and Grimm, who gladly accepted membership.  Powell joined the group at the last minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot; /&gt;

===Yellow Cavalier (2008-2009)===

The original name of the group was Yellow Cavalier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesusfreakhideout.com: Anthem Lights Discography, Yellow Cavalier, Anthem Lights Artist Database|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/artists/AnthemLights.asp|publisher=jesusfreakhideout.com|accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the group formed, this name was chosen.  The group recorded one [[Yellow Cavalier (EP)|self-titled EP]] under this name in 2009.  The [[Extended play|EP]] was released independently on May 26, 2009.  The group changed their name to Anthem Lights before any other projects were released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; /&gt;

==Name change and record deal (2010)==

The group's name changed to Anthem Lights sometime after their [[Yellow Cavalier (EP)|independent release]] as Yellow Cavalier.  Months later, the group signed to [[Reunion Records]].  The exact dates of the name change and record deal are unknown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Vocalist Kyle Kupecky comments about the meaning behind the name:&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube&quot; /&gt;
{{cquote|These songs &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;and&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; this record is our anthem to the world saying, &quot;Listen, we know there's a lot of darkness in this life, but in the end, light is gonna win.&quot;  And we wanna be the light to people and just show them who the light of the world is.}}

==Self-titled releases (2011)==
