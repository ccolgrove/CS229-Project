'''WÃ¼rzburg''' ({{IPA-de|ËvÊÉÌ¯tsbÊÉÌ¯k}}) is a city in the region of [[Franconia]] which lies in the northern tip of [[Bavaria]], Germany. Located at the [[Main (river)|Main]] River, it is the capital of the [[Regierungsbezirk]] [[Lower Franconia]]. The regional dialect is Franconian. 

WÃ¼rzburg is approximately {{convert|120|km}} from either [[Frankfurt am Main]] or [[Nuremberg]] by road. The city of WÃ¼rzburg is included in the [[WÃ¼rzburg (district)|district of WÃ¼rzburg]], but is its administrative seat (Landkreis). Its population is 133,501 as of 31 December 2008.

==History==
[[File:2004-06-27-Germany-Wuerzburg-Lutz Marten-Residenz side view 1.jpg|thumb|left|230px|WÃ¼rzburg Residence]]
By 1000 BC a [[Celts|Celtic]] fortification stood on the site of the present [[Fortress Marienberg]]. It was [[Christianized]] in 686 by Irish missionaries [[Kilian]], [[St. Colman (martyr)|Kolonat]] and [[Saint Totnan|Totnan]]. The city is first mentioned as a [[Franks|Frankish]] settlement called ''Vurteburch'' in 704. The first [[diocese]] was founded by [[Saint Boniface]] in 742. He appointed the first [[Bishopric of WÃ¼rzburg|bishop of WÃ¼rzburg]], [[Burchard of WÃ¼rzburg|Saint Burkhard]]. The bishops eventually created a duchy with its center in the city, which extended in the 12th century to Eastern [[Franconia]]. The city was the seat of several [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] [[diet (assembly)|diet]]s, including the one of 1180, in which [[Henry the Lion]] was banned from the Empire and his [[Kingdom of Bavaria|duchy]] was handed over to [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto of Wittelsbach]].

The first [[Church (building)|church]] on the site of the present [[WÃ¼rzburg Cathedral]] was built as early as 788, and consecrated that same year by [[Charlemagne]]; the current building was constructed from 1040 to 1225 in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style. The [[University of WÃ¼rzburg]] was founded in 1402 and re-founded in 1582.

The citizens of the city revolted several times against the prince-bishop, until definitively defeated in 1400. Later, WÃ¼rzburg was a center of the [[German Peasants' War]]; the castle was besieged unsuccessfully. Notable prince-bishops include [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]] (1573â1617) and members of the [[SchÃ¶nborn]] family, who commissioned a great number of the monuments of today's city. The [[WÃ¼rzburg witch trial]]s, which occurred between 1626 and 1631, are one of the largest peace-time mass trials. 

This mass execution took place during a time known as the &quot;Burning Times,&quot; which was two hundred years of purging the countryside of France and Germany of what was believed to be witches; women who had supposedly made a pact with the devil.  In Wurzburg, under Bishop Philip Adolf an estimated number between six hundred and nine hundred witches were burnt. &lt; Witchcraft in Bavaria: Popular Magik, Religious Zealotry,and Reason of State in Early Modern Europe, Wolfgang Behringer, (Cambridge University Press;1997&gt; &lt; Much info given on this on footnote 38 also&gt;  In 1631, Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]] invaded the town and destroyed the castle. 

In 1720, the foundations of the [[WÃ¼rzburg Residence]] were laid. The city passed to the [[Electorate of Bavaria]] in 1803, but two years later, in the course of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it became the seat of the Electorate of WÃ¼rzburg, the later [[Grand Duchy of WÃ¼rzburg]]. In 1814, the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of WÃ¼rzburg|a new bishopric]] was created seven years later, as the former one had been secularized in 1803.

Massacres of Jews took place in 1147 and 1298 and expulsions throughout the Middle Ages. In the period of Nazi rule, nearly the entire Jewish and gypsy population of the city was wiped out.

=== World War II ===
{{See also|Bombing of WÃ¼rzburg in World War II}}

On 16 March 1945, about 90% of the city full of civilians was destroyed in 17 minutes by 225 British Lancaster bombers during a [[World War II]] air raid. All of the city's churches, cathedrals, and other monuments were heavily damaged or destroyed. The city center, which dated from medieval times, was totally destroyed in a [[firestorm]] in which 5,000 people perished. Over the next 20 years, the buildings of historical importance were painstakingly and accurately replicated. The citizens who rebuilt the city immediately after the end of the war were mostly women â [[TrÃ¼mmerfrauen]] (&quot;rubble women&quot;) â because the men were either dead or taken [[prisoner of war]]. In comparison, WÃ¼rzburg was destroyed more totally than was [[Dresden]] in a firebombing the previous month.

Commencing 3 April 1945, WÃ¼rzburg was attacked by the US [[12th Armored Division (United States)|12th Armored Division]] and US [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] in a series of frontal assaults masked by smokescreens. The battle continued until the final last-ditch German resistance was defeated 5 April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939â1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 65, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, WÃ¼rzburg was host to the U.S. Army's [[U.S. 3d Infantry Division|3rd Infantry Division]], [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st Infantry Division]], U.S. Army Hospital and various other U.S. military units that maintained a presence in Germany. The U.S. units were withdrawn from WÃ¼rzburg in 2008, bringing an end to over 60 years of U.S. military presence in WÃ¼rzburg.

==Main sights==
[[File:Residenz Wuerzburg Vorderan.jpg|thumb|center|900px|Residenz (front view).]]
Notable artists that lived in WÃ¼rzburg include poet [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] (12th and 13th cent.), [[philosopher]] [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Painting|painter]] [[Mathias GrÃ¼newald]]. Two artists who made a lasting impression were sculptor [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] (1460â1531), who was also mayor and participated in the [[German Peasants' War]], and [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1687â1753), [[Baroque]] architect and builder of the WÃ¼rzburg Residence, now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Its interior was decorated by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and his son, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo|Domenico]].

Many of the city's &quot;100 churches&quot; survived intact with styles ranging from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ([[WÃ¼rzburg Cathedral]]), [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] (Marienkapelle), [[Renaissance]] (Neubaukirche), [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] (Stift Haug Kirche) to modern (St Andreas). 

WÃ¼rzburg hosts the Mainfranken Museum, with artifacts from prehistory until modern times, a Museum of the cathedral, galleries for ancient and modern art, and the &quot;Kulturspeicher&quot; from 2002. Notable festivals include the [[Afrika Festival]] in May, the [[Mozart]]fest, in June/July and the Kiliani Volksfest in mid July.
*''[[WÃ¼rzburg Residenz]]'': The vast complex on the eastern edge of the town was commissioned by two prince-bishops, the brothers Johann Philipp Franz and Friedrich Karl von SchÃ¶nborn. Its construction between 1720 and 1744 was supervised by several architects, including Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and Maximilian von Welsch. Although much of it destroyed during WWII, it has been completely rebuilt as it was before the war. However, it is associated mainly with the name of [[Balthasar Neumann]], the creator of its famous Baroque staircase. Its main sights are:
**Hofkirche: The church interior is richly decorated with paintings, sculptures and stucco ornaments. The altars were painted by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].
**Treppenhaus: The largest fresco in the world adorns the vault of the staircase by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. For many years the staircase appeared on a Deutschmark bill.
**Kaisersaal: The centerpiece of the palace, emperor's chamber which testifies the close relationship between WÃ¼rzburg and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].
[[File:Wuerzburg Festung Marienberg.jpg|thumb|Fortress Marienberg]]
*The [[Fortress Marienberg]] is the castle on a hill across the Old Main Bridge, overlooking the whole town area as well as the surrounding hills.
* WÃ¼rzburg's Old Main Bridge (Alte MainbrÃ¼cke) was built 1473â1543 to replace the destroyed Romanesque bridge from 1133. It was adorned from 1730 on in two phases with well-known statues of saints and famous persons. A similar impressive bridge is the [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague.
*Among WÃ¼rzburg's many notable churches are the ''KÃ¤ppele'', a small Baroque/Rococo chapel by Balthasar Neumann on a hill opposite to the fortress and the ''Dom ''([[WÃ¼rzburg Cathedral]]). The Baroque ''SchÃ¶nborn Chapel'', a side-chapel of the cathedral has interior decoration made of (artificial) human bones and skulls. Also in the cathedral are two of [[Tilman Riemenschneider]]'s most famous works, the tomb stones of [[Rudolf von Scherenberg|Rudolf II von Scherenberg]] (1466â1495) and [[Lorenz von Bibra]] (1495â1519). Look for replicas of the statues of Adam and Eve by Riemenschneider at the entrance to the ''Marienkapelle'' (on the market square). The ''NeumÃ¼nster'' is a Romanesque minster church with a Baroque faÃ§ade and dome. Among the Baroque churches in the inner city are ''Stift Haug'', ''St. Michael'', ''St. Stephan'' and ''St. Peter''.
*The ''Julius Spital'' is a Baroque hospital with a courtyard and a church built by the prince bishop [[Julius Echter]]. Its medieval wine cellar, together with those of the WÃ¼rzburg Residence and the ''BÃ¼rgerspital'' are one place to taste the [[German wine#Types of wine|Frankenwein]]. With an area under cultivation of 1.68 square kilometres, the Julius Spital is the second largest winery in Germany.
*The ''Haus zum Falken'' next to the ''Marienkapelle'', with its splendid facade, is an achievement of the WÃ¼rzburg rococo period and accommodates a tourist office.
*The ''Stift Haug'' was built in the years 1670â1691 and was the first Baroque church in Franconia. It is the most important building of the Italian architect Antonio Petrini.
