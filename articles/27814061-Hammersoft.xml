'''Robert S. Poston''' is an [[United States|American]] [[cardiac surgeon]] at [[University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona)|University of Arizona Medical Center]] most noted for his research in [[robot-assisted heart surgery]] and [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery]]. Dr. Postonâs research interest regarding the mechanism of early graft thrombosis was recognized with a five-year RO1 clinical research grant from the [[National Institutes of Health]] in 2007. Consistent with his goal of addressing routine clinical problems with a mechanistic based understanding, he has also been awarded grants from [[Intuitive Surgical]] to study how robotics accelerates patient recovery time, [[Maquet]] to study the impact of endoscopic harvesting techniques on the quality of bypass conduits and Cardiogenesis to study the impact of laser revascularization techniques on bypass graft flow. He has been the first/senior author of 100 papers and abstracts. His research manuscripts are available on [[pubmed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;term=poston,+robert poston, robert - PubMed result]&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of Texas ==
Robert Poston attended [[University of Texas at Austin]] 1986-1989 where he played for the [[Texas Longhorns baseball]] team as a catcher. He graduated [[phi beta kappa]] focusing on [[pre-medical]] studies, subsequently matriculating to [[Johns Hopkins Medical School]].

== Medical Education ==
After graduating with [[Alpha Omega Alpha|honors]] from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1993, Dr. Poston completed a residency in general surgery at the [[University of California-San Francisco]]. He also completed a research fellowship in [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]] at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]], and clinical cardiothoracic residency at the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]].

== University of Maryland ==

Dr. Postonâs first clinical appointment was in July 2002 under his mentor, Dr. Bartley Griffith at the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctsnet.org/home/rposton Robert Poston: CTSNET Member Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; With Dr. Griffithâs guidance, he developed a clinical and research niche in off-pump [[Coronary artery bypass surgery]] and [[Robotic surgery|robotic CABG]], establishing a national reputation in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlive.com/umm/videos/robot-assisted-heart-bypass-with-cardiac-catheterization ORLive, Inc.: Robot - Assisted Heart Bypass with Cardiac Catheterization]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was recruited to become the chief of cardiac surgery at [[Boston University]] in March 2008.

== Boston Medical Center ==

Dr. Poston came to Boston Medical Center as the chief of Cardiac Surgery &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmc.org/findaphysician/PhysicianProfile.php?id=iZulp6CalqCUnA== Find a Physician Search Results | Boston Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt; with a very aggressive plan to establish a program in robotic coronary bypass surgery and a belief that high risk cases and rapid growth in volume should be integral to the early establishment of the program. As a result of a major marketing campaign&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1096187 Botâs a smooth operator - BostonHerald.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by the hospital and Dr. Postonâs personal initiative meeting with individual cardiologists and groups, the program was quickly established and attracted patients not only from his traditional referral groups but from widely throughout New England. The program grew quickly and cardiac surgical volumes significantly increased during Dr. Postonâs first year despite decreasing cardiac surgical volumes across the city. Operating times, length of stay in the intensive care unit and in the hospital, and the need for blood transfusions all improved in comparison to patients undergoing isolated CABG the year prior to his arrival. The cardiac program results as reported to MASS-DAC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massdac.org/reports Public Reports | Mass-DAC]&lt;/ref&gt; the state registry of CABG results, were recognized in 2009 by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons with a three-star rating (highest quality&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sts.org/documents/pdf/Public_Dissemination_of_Quality_Ratings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) for the first time at this institution. Although CABG results had always been satisfactory at Boston University, this award indicated for the first time a level of performance on quality indicators that was in the top 10% of the country.
