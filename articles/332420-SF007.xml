'''Crystal Space''' is a framework for developing [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[software|applications]] written in [[C++]] by [[Jorrit Tyberghein]] and others.  The first public release was on August 26, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071021012040/http://gothapedia.com/manual/root/home/user/development/cs-SVN/trunk-old/docs/history.old Release history of Crystal Space] from the Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;  It is typically used as a [[game engine]] but the framework is more general and can be used for any kind of 3D visualization. It is very portable and runs on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Unix|UNIX]], and [[Mac OS X]].  It is also [[free software]], licensed under [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], and was [[SourceForge.net]]'s Project of the Month for February 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;potm&quot;&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/potm/potm-2003-02.php SourceForge.net Project of the Month, February 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can optionally use [[OpenGL]] (on all platforms), [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] (all SDL platforms), [[X11]] (Unix or Linux) and [[SVGALib]] (Linux). It can also optionally use assembler routines using [[NASM (computer program)|NASM]] and [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]].

== Engine design ==
Crystal Space is programmed in [[object oriented]] C++. It is very modularly built with a number of more or less independent plugins. The [[Client (computing)|client programs]] use the [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], such as the OpenGL 3D renderer, by registering them via Crystal Space's [[Shared Class Facility]] (SCF).

==Features==
Crystal Space has modules for 2D and 3D graphics, sound, collision detection and physics through [[Open Dynamics Engine|ODE]] and [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]].
*Graphics:
**[[OpenGL]] rendering
**Supports [[hardware acceleration]] from all major card vendors
**Allows use of [[shader]]s
**Library of common shaders like [[normal mapping]], [[parallax mapping]] and hardware skinning
**Supports [[software rendering]] with limited features
*Mesh objects:
**Plugin-based mesh system
**Triangle-based meshes with frame and bone animation support
*Collision detection and dynamics:
**[[Open Dynamics Engine|ODE]] and [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]] dynamics
**Simplified collision detection when full dynamic simulation is not needed
