In 2012, UTV will cease broadcasting on the analogue transmitter network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/en/when/ulster.html |title=Information about the Digital TV Switchover in Ulster on Digital UK; accessed 5 January 2008 |publisher=Digitaluk.co.uk |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Meridian Broadcasting]], [[ITV London]] and [[Tyne Tees Television]], UTV will be one of the last [[ITV]] regions to have its analogue signals turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/en/when.html |title=When is the Digital TV Switchover? The different regions and dates on Digital UK; accessed 5 January 2008 |publisher=Digitaluk.co.uk |date=2010-10-13 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTV's analogue broadcasts will cease on 24 October that year.

==History==
[[File:UTVPlayer.png|thumb|right|200px|UTV Player screenshot]]The governing body of the [[ITV|Independent Television]] network, the [[Independent Television Authority]], first advertised the franchise for Northern Ireland in September 1958.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/UTV/history.html |title=Independent TeleWeb: Ulster Television - History |publisher=Users.zetnet.co.uk |date=1958-11-04 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two consortia applied for the franchise; one led by the [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Abercorn|Duke of Abercorn]] and supported by ''[[The Belfast Telegraph]]'' and ''The Northern Whig'' newspapers, the other led by the [[Earl of Antrim]] and supported by ''[[The News Letter]]'' and [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  The ITA eventually persuaded both applicants to merge their bids to obtain the new franchise, on the provision that a greater stake of investment in the station was offered to Catholic sources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

With the ITA request met, the group, under the name Ulster Television Limited, set out their plans for broadcasting; initially, the station would try to provide 20 minutes of locally-sourced programmes per day, and the company arranged with  [[Associated British Corporation|ABC Television]] to sell advertising time and to maintain their studio premises at a former hemstitching warehouse in [[Havelock House, Belfast|Havelock House]] on the [[Ormeau Road]] in Belfast.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;
[[File:UTVhq.jpg|thumb|left|Ulster TV HQ, [[Havelock House, Belfast|Havelock House]] (July 1984)]]
Ulster Television went on air at 4.45pm on Saturday 31 October 1959.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/article927170.ece Belfast Telegraph, &quot;Flashback... Ulster Television's opening night, October 31, 1959&quot;]; dated 24 July 2004. Retrieved 17 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The station's opening was overseen by [[John Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst|Lord Wakehurst]], then [[Governor of Northern Ireland]], and Sir Laurence Olivier introduced the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The station's first night of programming, introduced by duty announcer Adrienne McGuill, featured networked series such as [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]] and [[77 Sunset Strip]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Extract from Brum Henderson &quot;Brum: A Life in Television&quot;, [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/article873937.ece Belfast Telegraph, &quot;Exclusive: My life on the box&quot;]; dated 4 October 2003. Retrieved 17 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; two news bulletins from ITN and the 1949 feature film [[Task Force (film)|Task Force]]. Sir Laurence Olivier delivered the station's first epilogue, an excerpt from [[Joseph Addison]]'s &quot;The Spacious Firmament&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 

The following evening, UTV contributed a play to the [[Armchair Theatre]] series, ''A Shilling for the Evil Day'', produced in association with ABC Television.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Earlier in the day, the station broadcast its first unofficial colour production - a film of images from across Northern Ireland was broadcast entitled ''Ulster Rich and Rare'', produced by Lord Wakehurst.

At launch, Ulster Television employed a staff of 100 people including six presenters: Ivor Mills and [[Anne Gregg]] were chosen as the presenters of local magazine programme ''Roundabout'', Adrienne McGuill, James Greene and Brian Durkin were the first [[continuity announcers]], and former rugby union international Ernest Strathdee was recruited as the station's sports presenter.&lt;ref&gt;Extract from Brum Henderson &quot;Brum: A Life in Television&quot;, from [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/imported/article873937.ece Belfast Telegraph, &quot;Exclusive: My life on the box&quot;]; dated 4 October 2003. Retrieved 17 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Ulster Television's programmes would only be available to viewers served by the [[Black Mountain transmitting station|Black Mountain]] transmitter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tx.mb21.co.uk/info/405/itv/n_ireland.shtml |title=mb21: ITV 405 line TV Transmitters - Northern Ireland |publisher=Tx.mb21.co.uk |date=1963-02-18 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it was reported on the station's first night of programmes that [[Dublin]] residents had called the station to report poor picture reception.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  Coverage of UTV spread to Western areas of Northern Ireland when the [[Strabane transmitting station|Strabane]] transmitter opened in February 1963.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Ulster Television's [[UHF]] [[PAL]] colour service was launched with the opening of the UHF transmitter [[Divis]] in September 1970.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5/&gt; This was followed by two additional transmitters at Limavady (opened in 1975&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;) and [[Brougher Mountain transmitting station|Brougher Mountain]] (in 1978&lt;ref name=autogenerated5/&gt;). The station was the last in the ITV network to begin 24-hour transmission in 1988.

At the company's [[annual general meeting]] in Belfast on 26 May 2006, the registered company name was changed from 'Ulster Television plc' to 'UTV plc'. The company believed that the existing name no longer reflected the full scope of the company's business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utvplc.com/uploads/statements/UTVNoticeofAGM2005.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further change in October 2007, UTV underwent a corporate reorganisation which saw UTV shareholders swap their shares for shares in a new holding company, UTV Media plc, which took over UTV plc's shareholdings in the new media and radio subsidiaries. UTV Ltd. - the original Ulster Television Limited, now a wholly owned subsidiary of UTV Media - has returned to being solely the operating company for the ITV franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200710151201257084F |title=InvestEgate, UTV Media PLC - First Day of Dealings |publisher=Investegate.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Idents==
Since 1959, Ulster Television have used different logos, or [[television ident|idents]] on-screen:
*'''1959''' The station's first on-screen logo was an [[oscilloscope]] pattern made up of seven dots joined together by six lines. The logo animated to a jingle based on the local folk tune ''The Mountains of Mourne''.  According to UTV's website, the original logo was designed as part of a competition, and the winner among over 450 entrants was Mr Roy Irwin of Ballycarry.&lt;ref name=&quot;u.tv: UTV 50 - Idents Gallery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u.tv/Galleries/GalleryPicture.aspx?guid=a23743ca-0a1e-488a-97c5-4591911dc6c0&amp;ImgId=162363 |title=UTV 50 - Idents Gallery |publisher=u.tv |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1970''' With the imminent launch of UHF colour broadcasts, Ulster Television redesigned its first logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;u.tv: UTV 50 - Idents Gallery&quot;/&gt; - the oscilloscope pattern was retained; but the dots were removed, and the lines were encased in a television-screen shape. Monochrome and colour versions of this ident were produced, the colour using a yellow logo and text on a blue background, which were adopted as the station's colour scheme.  UTV's ident at this time did not animate and was not accompanied by a jingle.  The logo type introduced on this ident was retained until 1993.
*'''1980''' To celebrate their 21st anniversary, UTV commissioned a new ident featuring a model the station logo embedded on four faces of a cube, coated in silver with a pole skewering the top and bottom of the cube. This model was then filmed on video with a black cloth background as it revolved on a turntable. When it appeared on screen, it was accompanied by a synthesised jingle, and the words &quot;Ulster Television&quot; wiped on screen in yellow text. The ident made its on-screen debut on 31 October 1980,&lt;ref name=&quot;The TV Room: UTV Idents&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-utv-01-01.html |title=UTV Idents |publisher=The TV Room |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used until c. September 1988.
*'''1987''' In c. September 1987, to coincide with the launch of the stations's new evening magazine programme, ''Six Tonight'', a new ident was used to introduce the programme, featuring a computer animated silver station logo on a blue/green backdrop. After five seconds, the logo faded into the background as the titles of ''Six Tonight'' began. This ident, UTV's first attempt at a CGI ident, was later adapted as a temporary station ident in the last few months of 1988, with a video freeze used as the logo sank into the background.
*'''1988''' The 1980 ident was eventually replaced by a new ident using [[computer animation]], the last to feature the logo first seen in 1970 and the &quot;Ulster Television&quot; name.&lt;ref name=&quot;u.tv: UTV 50 - Idents Gallery&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The TV Room: UTV Idents&quot;/&gt;  The ident began with a panning shot over a grey and white plate, with a light blue background at the back. The Ulster Television logo rises out from the plate, and the lines of the oscilloscope pattern are formed with a wipe. In this ident, the lines of the oscilloscope are yellow, with the rest of the logo (the television screen shape) in blue. When the lines are formed, the logo turns and reveals on screen, as a grey banner flies in underneath bearing the words &quot;Ulster Television&quot; and settles underneath the station logo. This ident was accompanied by a new jingle, and was used until 4 June 1993.

*'''1993''' At 18.00 on 4 June 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-utv-02-01.html |title=UTV Idents |publisher=The TV Room |date=1993-06-04 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTV officially unveiled a new logo. This consisted of an italicised Times Roman capital U forming on screen from different component parts, settling on a blue and yellow plate with &quot;TV&quot; written in italicised red Futura Condensed text. A new jingle was also introduced with a distinct Celtic sound. Since the start of 1993, continuity announcements and trailers referred increasingly to &quot;UTV&quot;, and the station's news service was rebranded as [[UTV Live]]. With the new logo, the use of &quot;Ulster Television&quot; to identify the station was consigned to history.
*'''1996''' UTV introduced a new series of idents in October 1996, which showcased scenic locations in Northern Ireland. These include the [[Giant's Causeway]], a waterfall at Glenarriff, and [[Portaferry]] harbour.  These are supplemented in 1998 with a set of idents featuring people playing the UTV jingle on various musical instruments.  Some of the idents featured UTV personalities.
*'''2000''' On 1 July 2000, the day when programme presentation and commercials shown on the four main UK television channels switched from the [[4:3]] aspect ratio to [[14:9]] on analogue broadcasts and [[16:9]] on digital broadcasts, UTV introduced a new set of idents using footage from the 1996 &quot;landscape&quot; idents, the break filler films used on its short-lived sister channel [[ITV2|TV You]], and a UTV corporate advertisement where a shoal of fish grouped together to form the UTV logo. This collection of idents were the first to be created and transmitted in 16:9 aspect ratio, on [[digital terrestrial]] and [[digital cable]] providers. This was the last set of idents which used the 1993 logo, and they were phased out shortly before Christmas 2000.
*'''2000''' The 1993 logo is replaced with a similar flatter and wider logo.  The &quot;U&quot; is rendered in yellow on a blue oblong, with the &quot;TV&quot; in red on a yellow oblong contained inside the blue oblong.  This remains the present station logo.  Its first use was in UTV's Christmas ident in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-utv-99-23.html |title=UTV Idents |publisher=The TV Room |date=2000-12-11 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-utv-08-01.html |title=UTV Idents |publisher=The TV Room |date=2001-01-06 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new series of idents shot at various locations across Northern Ireland, including the [[Silent Valley Reservoir]] in County Down, Great Victoria Street in Belfast and the ''Hands Across the Divide'' sculpture at the [[Craigavon Bridge]], Derry.  This was complemented by further idents in 2002 featuring people walking towards the camera and touching the screen with their fingers to make the UTV logo appear.
*'''2002''' On 28 October 2002, most of the regional ITV companies adopted a common look with the ITV1 brand replacing the various station logos.  This was marked with a series of idents showing actors, presenters and newsreaders associated with ITV appearing in idents.  At the same time, UTV decided to adopt these idents, but replaced the ITV logo with their own station logo.  The soundtrack used on these idents was identical to those heard on the ITV network versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-utv-10-01.html |title=UTV Idents |publisher=The TV Room |date=2002-10-28 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the nearest that UTV have come to using identical idents to the rest of the ITV network.  Around Christmas 2002, UTV broadcast a similar collection of idents showcasing their own presenting talent, shown in addition to the national idents.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetvroom.com&quot;&gt;[http://thetvroom.com/itv/itv-utv-10-03.html The TV Room: UTV Idents]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By early 2003, the network and local celebrity idents were phased out, and a generic ident showing the UTV logo on an animated blue background was used in all junctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetvroom.com&quot;/&gt; 
*'''2003''' UTV replaces its network-inspired graphics in November 2003 with a series landscape films of Northern Ireland in their idents, in the form of a [[panorama]] shot as the camera revolved around a location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utvtoday.co.uk/idents/0305_1.html UTV Today: 2003-05 Scenery Idents (Old Soundtrack)].

Retrieved 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2006''' To coincide with the introduction of a new identity across ITV plc stations on Monday 16 January 2006, UTV replaced its 2003 idents with a brand new set.&lt;ref name=&quot;utvtoday.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.utvtoday.co.uk/idents/0607_about.html UTV Today: 2006-07 Scenery Idents: About These Idents].

==UTV HD==
'''UTV HD''', a [[simulcast]] of UTV in [[High-definition television|high-definition]], launched on [[Virgin Media]] channel 113 on 5 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a280349/utv-hd-launches-on-virgin-media-ni.html|title=UTV HD launches on Virgin Media NI|publisher=Digital Spy|date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTV are hopeful that the channel will be on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-cup-utv-faces-wrath-of-fans-over-absence-of-high-definition-service-14835151.html|title=World Cup: UTV faces wrath of fans over absence of high definition service|publisher=The Belfast Telegraph|date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not sufficient capacity on the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service in Northern Ireland until the [[Digital television transition|digital switchover]] takes place, which is not due to happen until 2012.

Currently UTV's acquisition and presentation infrastructure is SD only; all HD content is line-fed to UTV in Belfast from [[Technicolor_SA|Technicolor Network Services]]' transmission facility at Chiswick Park, with UTV's presentation and local content being upscaled and switched into the transmission chain for UTV HD using a simple A/B switcher.

In May 2011, however, it is planned to upgrade the presentation infrastructure to become fully HD-capable in readiness for the digital switchover in 2012.

==UTV +1==
On 4 January 2011, [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] announced details for the launch of ITV1+1, together with the possibility that both [[STV (TV network)|STV]] and UTV will launch their own [[Timeshift channel|timeshift]] services, STV +1 and UTV +1 in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeview.co.uk/Resolutions/About-Channels/Channel-changes/ITV1-1-to-launch-on-11-January-2011|title=ITV1 + 1 to launch on 11 January 2011|publisher=Freeview|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTV later confirmed that it would launch UTV +1 at 8pm on 11 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cable.co.uk/news/virgin-media-viewers-get-access-to-itv11-tonight-800335321/|title=Virgin Media viewers get access to ITV1+1 tonight|publisher=Cable.co.uk|date=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel is available to Freeview viewers on channel 33 and [[Virgin Media]] cable customers on channel 114. The channel is not officially available on the [[Freesat]] and [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] satellite services but may be manually tuned in.
