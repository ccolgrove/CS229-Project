<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="68334" ns="0" title="Desktop environment"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">In graphical computing, a '''desktop environment''' ('''DE''') commonly refers to a style of [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) derived from the [[desktop metaphor]] that is seen on most modern [[personal computer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~l0f0954/academic/cpsc610/hw2-3.htm Desktop Metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These GUIs help the user in easily accessing, configuring, and modifying many important and frequently accessed specific [[operating system]] (''OS'') features. The GUI usually does not afford access to all the many features found in an OS. Instead, the traditional [[command-line interface]] (CLI) is still used when full control over the OS is required in such cases.

A desktop environment typically consists of [[icon (computing)|icon]]s, [[Window (computing)|windows]], [[toolbar]]s, [[directory (file systems)|folder]]s, [[computer wallpaper|wallpaper]]s and [[Widget engine|desktop widgets]] (see [[Elements of graphical user interfaces]] and [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/cs6751_97_winter/Topics/dialog-wimp/ WIMP Interfaces&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A GUI might also provide [[drag and drop]] functionality and other features that make the [[desktop metaphor]] more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.

While the term ''desktop environment'' originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to
describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments Window managers and desktop environments - Linux 101&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   This usage has been popularized by the [[Common Desktop Environment]] and the [[KDE|K Desktop Environment]].

== Implementation ==

On a system that offers a desktop environment, a [[window manager]] in conjunction with applications written using a [[widget toolkit]] are generally responsible for most of what the user sees. A [[windowing system]] of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying [[operating system]] and libraries. This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.

Applications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a [[windowing toolkit]], generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to [[GUI widget|widgets]] that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.

== History and common use ==

The first desktop environment was by [[Xerox]] and was sold with the [[Xerox Alto]] in the 1970s. The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer; it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price tag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toastytech.com/guis/alto.html The Xerox Alto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced a desktop environment on an affordable [[personal computer]], which also failed in the market.

On [[personal computer]]s the most popular desktop environments are the one included with the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system followed by the desktop environment of [[Mac OS X]]. When compared with desktop environments for Linux, the ones included with these operating systems are relatively unalterable.

Although, with the exception of [[Macintosh|Macs]], which are shipped with [[Mac OS X]], personal computers using [[Linux]] and other [[Unix-like]] OSs are still much less common,&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8&amp;qpcal=1&amp;qptimeframe=Y&amp;qpsp=2011 Operating System Market Share]&lt;/ref&gt; in recent years there has been a growing market for low cost [[Linux]] PCs that use the [[X Window System]]. These machines support many X11-based desktop environments.

== Desktop environments for the X Window System ==

On systems running the [[X Window System]] (typically [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]]), the desktop environment is much more flexible. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of a [[window manager]] (such as [[Metacity]] or [[KWin]]), a [[file manager]] (such as [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] or [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]]), a set of [[skin (computing)|theme]]s, and programs and libraries for managing the desktop.  All of these individual modules can be exchanged and individually configured to achieve a unique combination, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that requires minimal user input.

Some window managers such as [[IceWM]], [[Fluxbox]] and [[Window Maker]] contain rudimentary desktop environment elements, while others like [[evilwm]] and [[wmii]] do not.

Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. [[KDE]], for example, provides so-called [[KIO]]slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.

Initially, [[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]] was available as a proprietary solution, but was never popular on Linux systems due to cost and licensing restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;!--if you can find a ref for this, great.--&gt; In 1996 the [[KDE]] was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of [[GNOME]]. [[Xfce]] is a smaller project that was also founded in 1997, and focuses on speed and modularity, just like [[LXDE]] which was started in 2006. A [[comparison of X Window System desktop environments]] demonstrates the differences between environments. Today, [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are the dominant solutions, and these are often installed by default on GNU/Linux systems. Each of them offers:

* To programmers, a set of standard APIs, a programming environment, and [[human interface guidelines]].
* To translators, a collaboration infrastructure. KDE and GNOME are available in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://l10n.kde.org KDE Localization]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnome.org/i18n/ GNOME Internationalization]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To artists, a workspace to share their talents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kde-artists.org/ KDE-Artists: Where life imitates art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.gnome.org/ GNOME Art: Artwork and Themes]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To ergonomics specialists, the chance to help simplify the working environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openusability.org/ OpenUsability]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/ GNOME Human Interface Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.kde.org/documentation/design/ui/ KDE User Interface Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To developers of third-party applications, a reference environment for integration. OpenOffice.org is one such application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kde.openoffice.org/ KDE OpenOffice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnome.org/projects/ooo/ GNOME OpenOffice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* To users, a complete desktop environment and a suite of essential applications. These include a file manager, web browser, multimedia player, email client, address book, PDF reader, photo manager, and system preferences application.

In the early 2000s KDE reached maturity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-usability.de/download/linux_usability_report_en.pdf Linux Usability Report v1.01]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--need a citation for GNOME; apparently the ref deals only with KDE--&gt; along with GNOME.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Still active, the Appeal&lt;ref&gt;[http://appeal.kde.org/ The official Appeal site]&lt;/ref&gt; and ToPaZ&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero The official ToPaZ site]&lt;/ref&gt; projects focus on bringing new advances to the next major releases of both KDE and GNOME respectively. Although striving for broadly similar goals, GNOME and KDE do differ in their approach to user ergonomics. KDE encourages applications to integrate and interoperate, is highly customizable, and contains many complex features, all whilst trying to establish sensible defaults. GNOME on the other hand is more prescriptive, and focuses on the finer details of essential tasks and overall simplification. Accordingly, each one attracts a different user and developer community. Technically, there are numerous technologies common to all Linux desktop environments, most obviously the [[X Window System]]. Accordingly, the [[freedesktop.org]] project was established as an informal collaboration zone with the goal being to reduce duplication of effort.

As GNOME and KDE focus on high-performance computers, those users with old slow hardware often use alternative desktop environments specifically created for low-performance systems.  The two most common lightweight desktop environments are [[LXDE]] and [[Xfce]].  Both use [[GTK+]], the same underlying toolkit as GNOME.

== Examples of desktop environments ==

The most common desktop environment on personal computers is [[Microsoft Windows]]' built-in interface. It is titled [[Luna (theme)|Luna]] in [[Windows XP]] and Aero in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]]. Also common is [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]], included with Apple's [[Mac OS X]].

Mainstream desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems using the X Window System include [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]], and [[LXDE]].

A number of other desktop environments also exist, including (but not limited to) [[Common Desktop Environment|CDE]], [[EDE]], [[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]], [[IRIX Interactive Desktop]], Sun's [[Java Desktop System]], [[Jesktop]], [[Mezzo (desktop environment)|Mezzo]], [[Project Looking Glass]], [[ROX Desktop]], [[UDE]], [[Xito]], [[XFast]].&lt;Br&gt;&lt;/Br&gt;Moreover, there exists [[FVWM-Crystal]], which consists of a powerful configuration for the [[FVWM]] window manager, a theme and further adds, altogether forming a &quot;construction kit&quot; for building up a desktop environment.

[[X window manager]]s that are meant to be usable stand-aloneâwithout another desktop environmentâalso include elements reminiscent of those found in typical desktop environments, most prominently [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Other examples include [[OpenBox]], [[Fluxbox]], [[WindowLab]], [[Fvwm]], as well as [[Window Maker]] and [[AfterStep]], which both feature the [[Nextstep|NeXTSTEP]] [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] look and feel.

The [[Amiga]] approach to desktop environment was noteworthy: the original [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] desktop environment in [[AmigaOS]] evolved through time to originate an entire family of descendants and alternative desktop solutions. Some of those descendants are the [http://scalos.noname.fr/ Scalos], the [[Ambient (desktop environment)|Ambient]] desktop of [[MorphOS]] and the [[Wanderer (AROS)|Wanderer]] desktop of the [[AROS]] open source OS. WindowLab also contains features reminiscent of the Amiga UI. Third party [[Directory Opus]] software which was originally just a [[File manager#Navigational file manager|navigational file manager]] program then evolved to became to a complete Amiga desktop replacement called Directory Opus Magellan.

There is the [[Workplace Shell]] that runs on IBM [[OS/2]] or [[eComStation]].

The [[BumpTop]] project is an experimental desktop environment. Its main objective is to replace the 2D paradigm with a &quot;real-world&quot; 3D implementation, where documents can be freely manipulated across a virtual table.
