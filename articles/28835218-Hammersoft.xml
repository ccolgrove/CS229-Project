The '''2010â11 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team''' represented [[Boston College]] in the [[2010â11 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season]]. The team was coached by [[Jerry York]], '67, his seventeenth season behind the bench at Boston College.  The Eagles played their home games at [[Conte Forum|Kelley Rink]] on the campus of Boston College, competing in [[Hockey East]].

Boston College entered the 2010-2011 season as reigning National Champions, having defeated [[Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey|Wisconsin]] in the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2010 Frozen Four]] Championship Game.  The Eagles also began the season as defending Hockey East tournament and Beanpot champions, having alo won both tournaments during the 2009-2010 season.  The Eagles raised their 2010 National Championship banner in the home opener against [[Merrimack Warriors|Merrimack]] on October 29, 2010.  BC skated to a 3-2 victory.

On February 14, 2011, BC defeated [[Northeastern Huskies men's ice hockey|Northeastern]] 7-6 in overtime on a goal by junior forward Jimmy Hayes in the [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot Championship]].  It was the first time the Eagles have won back-to-back Beanpots (having also won in [[2009â10 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season|2010]]) since the team won three-in-a-row from 1963-1965.  Sophomore forward [[Chris Kreider]] was named tournament MVP.

BC clinched the Hockey East regular season crown by sweeping [[New Hampshire Wildcats|New Hampshire]] in the final series of the regular season.  It was the Eagle's record eleventh Hockey East regular season title and the team's first since 2005.  The Eagles also repeated as [[List of Hockey East Men's Ice Hockey Tournament champions|Hockey East Tournament]] champions, defeating [[Merrimack Warriors men's ice hockey|Merrimack]] 5-3 in the [[2011 Hockey East Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|tournament]] championship game.  It was also BC's tenth Hockey Tournament Tournament title, a conference record.  Junior [[Cam Atkinson]] was named tournament MVP.

The Eagles entered the [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2011 NCAA Tournament]] as a number one seed in the West Regional played in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] at the [[Scottrade Center]].  BC failed to defend their 2010 National Championship, losing in the first round to fourth-seeded [[Colorado College Tigers men's ice hockey|Colorado College]] 8-4.
