The '''2005 Oklahoma vs. Texas football game''', played October 8, 2005, was the 100th meeting between the [[University of Oklahoma]] and [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]] in a [[college football]] game.  The annual game between the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] and the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma Sooners]] is called the [[Red River Shootout]].  It is considered by college football coaches to be one of the three greatest rivalry games in college football,&lt;ref name=&quot;coach-rivals&quot;/&gt; and ''[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]]'' says the rivalry includes some of the most unusual traditions in the sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traditions&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gcoach&quot;/&gt;  The game often has conference or national title significance (as this game did) and the series is unusual in that it is played at a neutral site instead of the home teams' stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gcoach&quot;/&gt;

The [[2005 Texas Longhorn football team]] (variously &quot;Texas&quot; or &quot;UT&quot; or the &quot;Horns&quot;) was coached by head football coach [[Mack Brown]] and led on the field by [[quarterback]] [[Vince Young]].  The [[2005 Oklahoma Sooners football team]] (variously &quot;Oklahoma&quot; or &quot;OU&quot;) was coached by [[Bob Stoops]] with [[Rhett Bomar]] at quarterback. This was the fourth game of the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005 season]] for both teams.  Texas came into the game with a 4-0 record and a No.2 ranking.  Oklahoma was 2-2 and unranked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Defeats Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;  Both teams were 1-0 in conference play.  Since the two teams are both in the South Division of the [[Big 12 Conference]], winning this game would be an important step towards winning the Division and possibly the Conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gcoach&quot;/&gt;  For Texas, a loss would likely eliminate hope of them playing in the [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|BCS National Championship Game]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Defeats Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;

Prior to the game, UT was favored by 14 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;pass credit&quot;/&gt;  They took an early 7-point lead and led for the rest of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Defeats Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;  Although the score was close for the first quarter, Texas eventually won the game by 33 points,&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut5.htm | title=Oklahoma vs Texas (Oct 08, 2005) | work=MackBrownTexasFootball | accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; tying the biggest margin of victory for the Longhorns (a 40-7 victory in 1941) in the 100-game history of the rivalry.  For Mack Brown, beating Oklahoma for the first time in five years allowed him to &quot;get the monkey off his back&quot; and shed his reputation as a coach incapable of winning the most important games.&lt;ref name=&quot;pass credit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;road to Rose clear&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TX-CU&quot;/&gt;

The stadium attendance was 75,452 people, and the game was televised over most of the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC coverage&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://espn-att.starwave.com/tvlistings/map/ncf/051008.gif | title=ABC College Football | publisher=ABC | accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas' win kept them near the front of the national championship picture. They ultimately finished the season unbeaten, snaring the [[Big 12 Conference]] and [[NCAA]] championships.  Oklahoma finished the season with eight wins and four losses and ranked No. 22 in the nation.

Oklahoma is the winningest program in what is widely considered the modern era of college football. OU has the most victories and best winning percentage of any team since the end of World War II. The Sooners have earned seven AP National Championships (1950, 1955, 1956, 1974, 1975, 1985, 2000) in that span and are recognized by the NCAA for 16 titles.  They have been ranked first in the AP and BCS polls more than any other team, have been ranked in the top 5 of the AP and BCS polls more than any other team, and have scored more points than any other team in the modern era.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoonerSports No 1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/m-footbl-no1-program-modern-era.html | title=Sooners the No. 1 Program of the Modern Era| date= 2007-11-12 | work=SoonerSports.com |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma|University of Oklahoma Athletic Department]] | accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoonerSports Gameday&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.soonersports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100505aaa.html | title=Sooner Gameday Central - Texas | date=2005-10-01| work=SoonerSports.com |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma|University of Oklahoma Athletic Department]] | accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturally, Oklahoma had high  expectations for the year.  Their pre-season ranking of No.7 in the nation and the fact they had made it to the national championship game [[Oklahoma Sooners football under Bob Stoops#2005|in both 2003 and 2004]] only served to support this assumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;road to Rose clear&quot;/&gt;

The 2005 UT team was attempting to follow on the success of the 2004 season, in which quarterback Vince Young led the team to Mack Brown's first [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) game in the 2005 Rose Bowl and a top-5 finish in the polls.  However, even that successful season was marred by a loss to Oklahoma, the fifth straight loss for the Horns.   With the exception of [[Cedric Benson]], [[Derrick Johnson]], and [[Bo Scaife]], Texas returned most of their key players from 2004â2005, including [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] junior quarterback Vince Young.

Texas was given a pre-season No. 2 ranking (behind defending National Champions [[University of Southern California]]) by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine and was also ranked second in the pre-season [[Associated Press Poll]] and ''[[USA Today]]'' [[Coaches Poll]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Preseason consensus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://preseason.stassen.com/consensus/2005.html#national | title=2005 Preseason Consensus | publisher=Stassen.com | accessdate=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This created anticipation that Texas might play for the national championship if they could win their road game against the [[2005 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State Buckeyes]]&lt;ref name=&quot;play for&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200509100033 | title=(2) Texas - (4) Ohio State | publisher=Yahoo.com | date=September 10, 2005 | accessdate=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if they could snap their five-game losing streak against the Sooners.&lt;ref name=&quot;road to Rose clear&quot;/&gt;

For either team to play in the national title game, that team had to end up [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football rankings|ranked No. 1 or No. 2]] at the end of the regular season.

==First quarter==

Oklahoma won the [[coin flipping|coin toss]] and deferred to the second half.  Texas used 5:52 worth of game clock to score on their first possession (12 plays, 82&amp;nbsp;yards) with a [[touchdown]] by [[Ramonce Taylor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;  It marked the first time Texas had taken a lead in the Red River Rivalry since 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU Game Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soonersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=201725 | title=Oklahoma Sooners - Game Notes | date=October 8, 2005 | accessdate=2007-04-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007170003/http://www.soonersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=201725  |archivedate = 2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OU and UT traded [[Punt (football)|punts]] and then OU's [[Garrett Hartley]] scored a 52-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] to make the score Oklahoma-3, Texas-7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Defeats Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;  This was the longest field goal of Hartley's college career.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU Game Notes&quot;/&gt;  OU kicked off for a [[touchback]] and Texas started on their own 20.

The Sooners ran two [[rushing]] plays to acquire a first down at the fifteen.  A short run-play, a short [[forward pass|pass]] play, and an [[incomplete pass]] followed to set up fourth and four from the 9.  OU elected for field goal making the score 6-7 in favor of the Horns.

==Second quarter==
Texas was not able to score on that drive and they punted the ball to Oklahoma, who began their drive on their 32-yard line.  It was the first of four consecutive combined punts for the two teams and during this time the clock wound down to 6:54 remaining in the first half.  Texas snapped the scoring drought with an eight play, 32-yard drive that culminated in a 38-yard field goal. The Sooners punted on their next possession, giving the ball to UT on their 30-yard line with 0:55 remaining.  Vince Young rushed for eleven yards and a first down, but the next play was called back because of a Longhorn penalty.  Young then completed a pass to Billy Pitman who ran 64&amp;nbsp;yards along the left sideline for a touchdown with 0:17 in the half.  The extra point made the score OU-6, UT-24 and Oklahoma [[Glossary of American football#T|took a knee]] to end the half.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;

==Third quarter==
The Longhorns scored once in the third quarter as Young threw a 27-yard pass to Billy Pittman to increase the Longhorn lead to 25 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;  As stated by the Associated Press, &quot;the rout was on&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Defeats Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;  The Sooners only got within UT territory once, and that drive ended abruptly when [[Michael Huff]] intercepted [[Rhett Bomar]]'s pass at the UT36.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;  This was the first [[interception]] for Bomar in 73 attempts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU Game Notes&quot;/&gt;  As the third quarter ended, UT had just gained a first down at the OU37.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;

==Fourth quarter==
[[File:2005 Red River Shootout cropped.jpg|right|thumb|2005 Red River Shootout - OU bench and Texas flags]]
UT did score a touchdown on that drive to go ahead 38-6.  The kickoff by UT's [[Greg Johnson]] went 54 yards to the OU 11 where [[Lendy Holmes]] caught the ball and made a 21-yard return to the OU 32.  UT committed two penalties on the play: a face mask penalty for 15 yards and a personal foul, also for 15 yards.  This gave the Sooners their best starting field position of the day: 1st and 10, OU ball on the UT 38. From there, OU punched in the touchdown with a five-play series culminating in a 15-yard pass to [[Joe Jon Finley]].  Texas ended their next series by punting.  OU drove to the Texas 23 when Brian Robison sacked Bomar and forced a fumble.  The ball was picked up by UT's [[Rodrique Wright]], who ran 67 yards for a touchdown with 7:41 left in the game.  For the second time in a row, the Sooners combined a kick-off return with a penalty against Texas.  This time, Lendy Holmes fielded the ball at the OU 17 and returned it 29 yards to the OU 46.  The penalty was another personal foul against Texas, which move the ball to the UT 39.  The Texas defense stopped Oklahoma and Garrett Hartley came in to attempt a 41-yard field goal but it went wide right and UT took over at its own 24 with 2:21 remaining and a 45-12 lead.  Texas ran three running plays and then took a knee to [[Running out the clock|run out the clock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;

==Analysis==
Prior to the game, the Longhorns were ranked second by the Associated Press, and the Sooners were unranked for the first time since 1999, which was also Texas's last victory over OU.  Texas was favored by 14 points;&lt;ref name=&quot;pass credit&quot;/&gt; they ended up winning the game by 33 points,&lt;ref name=&quot;OU-box&quot;/&gt; tying the biggest margin of victory for the Longhorns (a 40-7 victory in 1941) in the 100-game history of the rivalry. The game also marked the sixth time the Longhorns have entered the contest ranked second nationally, and they have won all six times.&lt;ref name=&quot;OU game week&quot;/&gt; With the win, Texas started their season 5-0 for the first time since 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;all-time results&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=36&amp;url_subchannel_id=&amp;url_article_id=1349&amp;change_well_id=2 | title=All-Time Results | work=MackBrownTexasFootball | date=December 30, 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
That also happened to be the last time UT had legitimate national title hopes, ending the regular season 11-0 before losing to [[Georgia Bulldogs|Georgia]] in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] [[bowl game|game]]. For Mack Brown, beating Oklahoma for the first time in five years allowed him to &quot;get the monkey off his back&quot; and shed his reputation as a coach incapable of winning the most important games.&lt;ref name=&quot;pass credit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/10/07/Sports/Brown.Ready.To.Pass.Credit.Rather.Than.Take.Blame-1013647.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title=Brown ready to pass credit rather than take blame - Players insist Brown shoulders too much burden for OU losses | author=Veyhl, Jack | work=[[The Daily Texan]] | date=October 7, 2005 | accessdate=2007-01-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930201225/http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2005/10/07/Sports/Brown.Ready.To.Pass.Credit.Rather.Than.Take.Blame-1013647.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;road to Rose clear&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TX-CU&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200510150083 | title=(24) Colorado - (2) Texas | publisher=yahoo.com | date=October 15, 2005 | accessdate=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By breaking the string of five consecutive losses to Oklahoma, Longhorn coach [[Mack Brown]] preserved the Longhorns's [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|National Championship]] hopes.  UT Freshman [[running back]] [[Jamaal Charles]] set a record for rushing yards by a Texas freshman in the series. With his 80-yard scamper, Charles also had the longest touchdown from scrimmage by a Texas running back in the series.  Vince Young completed 14 out of 27 passes for 241&amp;nbsp;yards and also ran for 45&amp;nbsp;yards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas Defeats Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma game statistics&quot;/&gt;

As had occurred the two seasons prior when Oklahoma won the Red River Shootout en-route to a national title game, the road to the 2005 National Championship game went through Dallas.  This time it was Texas who eventually finished the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|season of 2005-2006]] as the only undefeated team, winning both the [[Big 12 Conference]] championship&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas overpowers&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Texas Overpowers Colorado To Win Big 12 football Championship | url=http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/120305aaa.html | publisher=[[Big 12 Conference]] | date=December 3, 2005 | accessdate=2006-12-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061109193349/http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/120305aaa.html  |archivedate = 2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas beats USC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/010506aaa.html | title=Texas Wins National Championship, Beats USC 41-38 - Vince Young scrambles for an 8-yard touchdown on fourth down with 19&amp;nbsp;seconds left to take lead. | publisher=[[Big 12 Conference]] | date=January 4, 2006 | accessdate=2006-12-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061106174905/http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/010506aaa.html  |archivedate = 2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Longhorns' penultimate victory of the season, in the [[Big 12 Football Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]], featured the biggest margin of victory in the history of that contest. Their ultimate victory in the 2006 [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] against the [[University of Southern California]] [[2005 USC Trojans football team|Trojans]] for the national championship, as well as their overall season, have both been cited as standing among the greatest performances in college football history by publications such as ''[[College Football News]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;CCFN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10 greatest&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cfn.scout.com/2/564658.html | title=Tuesday Question - Ten Greatest Bowl Games | date=September 5, 2006 | publisher=College Football News | author=Cirminiello, Richard and Harris, John | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CFB best ever&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Fiutak, Pete | url=http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2006/TQ/Rose_Best.htm | title=Was the 2006 Rose Bowl the best college football game ever? | publisher=College Football News | date=January 10, 2006 | accessdate=2006-10-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060616201851/http://www.collegefootballnews.com/2006/TQ/Rose_Best.htm  |archivedate = 2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;grand&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Bisher| first=Furman| authorlink= Furman Bisher |url=http://www.ajc.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/ajc/sportscolumns/entries/2006/01/06/rose_bowl_a_gra.html | title=BCS enjoys 'grand cresendo' | work=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]| date=2006-01-06 | accessdate=2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scout.com'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Scouts best&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://louisianastate.scout.com/2/596414.html | title=Is the bloom off the Rose? |  author=Defresne, Chris | publisher=Scouts.com | date=December 1, 2006 | accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;YoungNite&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Murphy, Austin | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/preview/siexclusive/2006/pr/subs/siexclusive/01/05/cf.bcs0109/ | title=The Night is Young's | work=[[Sports Illustrated]] | date=January 5, 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Longhorns and the Trojans were together awarded the 2006 [[ESPY Award]] by [[ESPN]] for the &quot;Best Game&quot; in any sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;TexasTrifecta&quot;&gt;Fisher, Gerren LaQuint{{Cite news | url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/07/14/Sports/Texas.Snags.Espy.Trifecta-2131713.shtml?norewrite200607252146&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com | title=Texas snags ESPY trifecta - 2006 Rose Bowl voted Best Game of the year, Vince gets Best Championship Performance | work=[[The Daily Texan]] | date=July 14, 2006 | accessdate=2006-07-25 | author=Fisher, Gerren LaQuint|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928003440/http://www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2006/07/14/Sports/Texas.Snags.Espy.Trifecta-2131713.shtml?norewrite200607252146&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytexanonline.com |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt; The Longhorns finished the season as the only unbeaten team, with 13 wins and zero losses overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Win/Loss&gt;College football team records are conventionally expressed in number of wins/losses. 13-0 means 13 wins and zero losses.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Big12_standings&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/doc_lib/06_records_3_big12.pdf | format = PDF | title=All Time Big-12 Standings | work = MackBrownTexasFootball.com | accessdate=2006-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just prior to the start of [[2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma's 2006 season]], [[Rhett Bomar]] was kicked off the team for accepting improper cash contributions.
