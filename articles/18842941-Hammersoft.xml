The '''Mission Science Division''' is a group of scientists, research fellows and young graduates working at the European Space Agency ([[ESA]]) within the Science, Applications and Future Technologies Department of the Directorate of Earth Observation Programmes. The Division is located at ESA's [[European Space Research and Technology Centre]] in [[Noordwijk]], [[South Holland]], [[The Netherlands]].

__TOC__

==Introduction==

The Mission Science Division (MSD) is part of the Science, Applications and Future Technologies Department, within the Earth Observation Programmes Directorate. The Division is responsible for ensuring the application of scientific and other user community requirements in all phases of the development of Earth Observation missions, from precursor studies through to initial in-orbit satellite operations, and for ensuring coherence throughout with the objectives expressed in the mission requirements documents, including the management of mission-specific advisory structures (where required). 

In support of the preparations for each [[ESA]] Earth Observation mission, the Division initiates and conducts supporting scientific studies (in house and external), and organises, coordinates and executes related Campaigns for the purpose of acquiring airborne, balloon borne, or in-situ data.

==Mission Science Division Management==

The Mission Science Division management team are: &lt;br /&gt;

* M. Drinkwater (Head of Mission Science Division)
* P. Ingmann (Head of Atmospheric Section)
* R. Haagmans (Head of Earth Surfaces and Interior Section)
* M. Davidson (Head of Campaigns Section)

==Research Satellites==

The Mission Science Division currently works on six approved [[ESA]] Earth explorers and a seventh mission to be chosen from three candidate Core Earth explorer mission concepts (future missions), namely:

===Earth Explorer Core missions===
* [[GOCE]] (*GOCE launched successfully on 17 March, 2009).
* [[ADM-Aeolus]]
* [[EarthCARE]]

===Earth Explorer Opportunity missions===
* [http://www.esa.int/livingplanet/cryosat CryoSat-2]   (*CryoSat-2 launched successfully on 8 April, 2010)
* SMOS - [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite]]   (*SMOS launched successfully on 2 November, 2009)
* [http://www.esa.int/livingplanet/swarm Swarm]

===Candidate Future Earth Explorer missions===
The following six candidate Core missions have undergone pre-feasibility studies (Phase 0):
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP1313-1_ASCOPE.pdf A-SCOPE (Advanced Space Carbon and Climate Observation of Planet Earth)]
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP1313-2_BIOMASS.pdf BIOMASS]
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP1313-3_COREH2O.pdf CoReH2O (Cold Regions Hydrology High-resolution Observatory)]
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP1313-4_FLEX.pdf FLEX (FLuorescence EXplorer)]
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP1313-5_PREMIER.pdf PREMIER (PRocess Exploration through Measurements of Infrared and millimetre-wave Emitted Radiation)] 
* [http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/SP1313-6_TRAQ.pdf TRAQ (TRopospheric composition and Air Quality)]
BIOMASS, CoReH2O and PREMIER are currently undergoing feasibility study (Phase A).

The following two candidate Opportunity missions have been selected for feasibility study (Phase A/B1):
* [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEMD9AGMTGG_index_0.html CarbonSat]
* [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEMD9AGMTGG_index_0.html FLEX]

The next Call for proposals for candidate Earth Explorer missions is planned after the next ESA Ministerial Council.

==Operational Satellites==

The Division also currently supports the development of three approved [[GMES]] Sentinel Missions as part of the Space Component of the joint [[EC]]/[[ESA]] Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) initiative

===Approved GMES missions===
* [[Sentinel 1]]
* [[Sentinel 2]]
* [[Sentinel 3]]
* [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEM3ZT4KXMF_LPgmes_0.html Sentinel 4 (on Meteosat Third Generation-S)]
* [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEM3ZT4KXMF_LPgmes_0.html Sentinel 5 precursor]
* [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEM3ZT4KXMF_LPgmes_0.html Sentinel 5 (on MetOp-Second Generation- Metop-SG)]
