'''''Champions League Live''''' is a [[association football|football]] programme currently shown on both [[ITV]] and [[Sky Sports]] in the [[United Kingdom]], broadcasting live [[UEFA Champions League]] football.

Under the current rights agreement, the ITV Network ([[ITV1]], [[STV (TV network)|STV]] and [[UTV]]) shows one live match on a Wednesday, with Sky Sports showing all other matches via its interactive service. On Tuesdays, [[Sky Sports]] show all eight games, including those involving the English clubs. Both channels show the final live. Despite sharing the name, the various programmes are different productions.

==ITV==
On the [[ITV|ITV Network]] &lt;small&gt;([[ITV1]]/[[ITV1 HD]], [[UTV]]/[[UTV#UTV HD|UTV HD]], [[Channel Television]])&lt;/small&gt;, [[Adrian Chiles]] and [[Matt Smith (broadcaster)|Matt Smith]] share presenting duties. Punditry comes from [[Gareth Southgate]] with guests for each individual match. The commentators are [[Clive Tyldesley]] and [[Peter Drury]], with analysts [[Jim Beglin]] and [[Andy Townsend]].

In Northern and Central Scotland, [[STV (TV network)|STV]]/[[STV (TV network)#STV HD|STV HD]] produce and broadcast their own Champions League coverage but only when a Scottish team is playing in the [[ITV]] match - e.g. [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] v [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on Wednesday 24 November 2010. If no Scottish club is involved in the [[ITV]] match, STV will carry ITV's coverage. [[Gerry McCulloch]] is the main presenter when STV are producing their own coverage, under the [[STV Sports Centre]] banner. Pundits are [[David Moyes]] and [[Richard Gough]]. Match commentary comes from [[Derek Rae]] with [[Craig Burley]] acting as an analyst. The programmes are produced in-house by [[STV News at Six|STV News]].

==Sky Sports==
On Sky Sports, there are a large number of commentators and co-commentators due to the interactive coverage showing every match live.  The programme is presented in the [[Sky Sports]] studio, covering all matches shown.  [[Jeff Stelling]] is the presenter, with punditry variously from [[Jamie Redknapp]], [[Gary Neville]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Graeme Souness]] and [[Glenn Hoddle]].
