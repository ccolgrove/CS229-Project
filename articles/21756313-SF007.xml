'''Microsoft Encarta''' was a [[digital]] [[multimedia]] [[encyclopedia]] published by [[Microsoft Corporation]] from 1993 to 2009. {{As of|2008}}, the complete English version, ''Encarta Premium,'' consisted of more than 62,000 articles,&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/learningspace/Products.aspx?prod=encarta Encarta 2009 Information]&lt;/ref&gt; numerous photos and illustrations, music clips, videos, [[interactive]] contents, timelines, maps and atlas, and homework tools,  and was available on the World Wide Web by yearly subscription or by purchase on [[DVD]] or multiple [[CD]]s. Many articles could also be viewed online free of charge, a service supported by advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;For the free service, one should use the URL http://search.msn.com/encarta/results.aspx (MSN Search Encarta) rather than http://encarta.msn.com (MSN Encarta : Online Encyclopedia, Dictionary, Atlas, and Homework). [http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1256962101378386 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Microsoft published similar encyclopedias under the ''Encarta'' trademark in various languages, including German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese. [[Software localization|Localized]] versions may contain contents licensed from available national sources and may contain more or less content than the full English version. For example, the Dutch version had content from the Dutch [[Winkler Prins encyclopedia|''Winkler Prins'']] encyclopedia.

In March 2009, Microsoft announced it was discontinuing the Encarta disc and online versions. The MSN Encarta site in all countries except Japan was closed on October 31, 2009.  Japan's Encarta site was closed on December 31, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncartaDead&quot;&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/guide_page_FAQ/FAQ.html Important Notice: MSN Encarta to be Discontinued] (MSN Encarta).

== History ==
After the successes of [[Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia]] (1989) and [[The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia]] (1992),&lt;ref name=&quot;Kister&quot;&gt;[[Kenneth Kister|Kister]]'s Best Encyclopedias'',1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Microsoft initiated Encarta by purchasing non-exclusive [[copyright|rights]] to the [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]] Encyclopedia, incorporating it into its first edition in 1993. (Funk &amp; Wagnalls continued to publish revised editions for several years independently of Encarta, but then ceased printing in the late 1990s.) Previously having been referred to by the codename &quot;Gandalf,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlehistory.org/include/techpdfs/Jon%20Kertzer%20FINAL.pdf|title=Interview with Jon Kertzer, director of Smithsonian Global Sound, for the Smithsonian Center for Folk  Life and Cultural Heritage.|accessdate=2009-08-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/comp1993.htm|title=Chronology of personal computers|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2006/04/30/Some_Microsoft_codenames.aspx|title=Chris Smith blog post at MSDN.com|accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/microsoft-encarta-dies-after-long-battle-with-wikipedia/?apage=2#comment-250889|title=Patrick, Graphic design intern on Version 1.0 of Encarta|accessdate=2009-08-24 | work=The New York Times | first=Noam | last=Cohen | date=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name Encarta was created for Microsoft by an advertising agency.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School Case Study 'Blown to Bits'.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Microsoft had originally approached [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]], the gold standard of encyclopedias for over a century, in the 1980s, but it declined, believing its print media sales would be hurt; however, the [[Benton Foundation]] was forced to sell [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]] at below book value in 1996 when the print sales could no longer compete with ''Encarta'' and the Microsoft distribution channel which focused on [[software bundling|bundling]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/04/encarta-rip-cont-a-reply-from-tom-corddry/ Tom Corddry]: &quot;Encarta was not given away but sold at retail for about $100, and sold wholesale to PC manufacturers who bundled it with new machines.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; copies with new computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Crisis at EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/greenstein/images/htm/Research/Cases/EncyclopaediaBritannica.pdf|work=[[Kellogg School of Management]]|publisher=[[Northwestern University]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late 1990s, Microsoft bought [[Collier's Encyclopedia]] and New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia from [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] and incorporated them into Encarta. Thus the current Microsoft ''Encarta'' can be considered the successor of the Funk and Wagnalls, Collier, and New Merit Scholar encyclopedias. None of these formerly successful encyclopedias remained in print for long after being merged into Encarta. 

Microsoft introduced several regional versions of Encarta translated into languages other than English. For example, the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version was introduced in 1999 and suspended in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/brasil/encarta/ Bem-vindo Ã  Microsoft Brasil&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version is somewhat smaller than the English one, at 42,000 articles.

In July 2006, Websters Multimedia, a [[Bellevue, Washington]] subsidiary of London-based Websters International Publishers, took over maintenance of Encarta from Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp Websters International Publishers â Who We Are&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The last version is Encarta Premium 2009, released in August 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta2009&quot;/&gt;

{{anchor|Closure}}
Microsoft announced in March 2009 that it would cease to sell [[Microsoft Student]] and all editions of Encarta Premium software products worldwide by June 2009, citing changes in the way people seek information and in the traditional encyclopedia and reference material market as the key reasons behind the termination.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncartaDead&quot;/&gt; Updates for Encarta were offered until October 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncartaDead&quot;/&gt; Additionally, MSN Encarta web sites were discontinued around October 31, 2009, with the exception of Encarta Japan which was discontinued on December 31, 2009. Existing MSN Encarta Premium (part of MSN Premium) subscribers were refunded.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncartaDead&quot;/&gt; Encarta's closing is widely attributed to competition from the much larger online [[encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/162320/what_was_encarta_look_it_up_on_wikipedia.html|title=What Was Encarta?

==Contents and features==
Encarta's standard edition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=001 Microsoft Encarta Product Details]&lt;/ref&gt; included approximately 50,000 articles, with additional images, videos and sounds. The premium editions contain over 62,000 articles and other [[multimedia]] content, such as 25,000 pictures and illustrations, over 300 videos and animations, and an interactive atlas with 1.8 million locations. Its articles are integrated with multimedia content and may have a collection of links to [[websites]] selected by its [[editing|editors]]. Encarta's articles in general are less lengthy and more summarized than the printed version of [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]] or the online [[Wikipedia]]. Like most multimedia encyclopedias, Encarta's articles tend to provide an overview of the subject rather than an exhaustive coverage and can only be viewed one at a time.

A sidebar may display alternative views, [[essay]]s, journals or original materials relevant to the topic. For example, when reading about [[computer]]s, it features annals since [[1967]] of the computer industry. Encarta also supports [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called Encarta Research Organizer was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word document-based report. Later versions included Encarta Researcher which was a browser plugin to organize information from Encarta articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from Encarta is appended with a [[copyright]] [[Standard form contract|boilerplate]] message after the selection. The user interface allows viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactivities.

Encarta 2000 and later have Map Treks which are tours of geographic features and concepts. Microsoft had a separate product known as ''Encarta Africana'' which was an encyclopedia of black history and culture. It was integrated into the standard Encarta Reference suite starting with the 2001 version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx Award-Winning Encarta Africana Included in Suite for the First Time]&lt;/ref&gt; Encarta 2002 and onwards feature ''3D Virtual Tours'' of ancient structures, for example the [[Acropolis]]; 2D panoramic images of world wonders or major cities; and a virtual flight feature which allows users to fly a virtual [[airplane]] over a coarsely generated artificial [[landscape]] area. Version 2002 also introduced the ability to install the entire encyclopedia locally to the hard disk drive to prevent frequent swapping of discs.

Encarta 2003 incorporated literature guides and book summaries, foreign language translation dictionaries, a ''Homework Center'' and ''Chart Maker''. Encarta's ''Visual Browser'', available since the 2004 version, presents a user with a list of related topics making them more discoverable. A collection of 32 [[Discovery Channel]] videos have also since been added. Encarta 2005 introduced another program called ''Encarta Kids'' aimed at children to make learning fun.

Encarta also includes a [[trivia]] game called &quot;MindMaze&quot; (accessible through Ctrl+Z) in which the player explores a castle by answering questions whose answers can be found in the encyclopedia's articles. There is also a ''Geography Quiz'' and several other games and quizzes, some quizzes also in Encarta Kids.

For years, Encarta came in three primary software editions: Basic, Premium, and Reference Library (price and features in that order.) Beginning with Encarta 2006, however, when ''Websters Multimedia'' took over its maintenance, Encarta became a feature of [[Microsoft Student]] as the premier Microsoft educational software program. Although it is possible to purchase only the Encarta encyclopedia separately, Microsoft Student bundles together ''Encarta Premium'' with [[Microsoft Math]] (a [[graphing calculator]] program) and Learning Essentials, which provides templates for [[Microsoft Office]]. In addition, the Reference Library was discontinued, absorbed into a newer, more comprehensive Premium package. Encarta's user interface is shared with Microsoft Student, and has been streamlined to reduce clutter with only a Search box which returns relevant results; however it is no longer possible to simply browse all the encyclopedia articles alphabetically.

===World Atlas===
The dynamic maps are generated with the same engine that powered [[Microsoft MapPoint]] software. The map is a [[virtual globe]] that one can freely rotate and magnify to any location down to major streets for big cities. The globe has multiple surfaces displaying political boundaries, physical landmarks, historical maps and statistical information. One can selectively display statistical values on the globe surface or in a tabular form, different sized cities, various geological or man-made features and [[latitude and longitude|reference lines]] in a map.

The maps contain [[hyperlink]]s to related articles (&quot;Map Trek&quot;) and also supports a &quot;Dynamic Sensor&quot; that provides the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[toponym|place name]], [[population]] and [[time zone|local time]] for any point on the globe. Encarta also generates a visible-light moon atlas with names of major [[list of craters on the Moon|crater]]s and hyperlinks. However, it does not include a [[planetarium]], but instead has a small interactive [[constellation]]-only map.

In addition to database generated maps, many other illustrative maps in Encarta (&quot;Historical Maps&quot;) are drawn by artists. Some more advanced maps are [[interactive]]: for example, the large African map for Africana can display information such as political boundaries or the distribution of African [[flora (plants)|flora]].

===Encarta Dictionary===
When Encarta was released as part of the &quot;Reference Suite&quot; in 1998 (through to 2000), Microsoft bundled &quot;[[Microsoft Bookshelf]]&quot; with the other programs (Encarta Encyclopedia 98 Deluxe Edition, Encarta Desk Atlas, Encarta Virtual Globe 98, Encarta World English Dictionary and Encarta Research Organizer). However, this was redundant.

Bookshelf was discontinued in 2000, and in later Encarta editions (Encarta Suite 2000 and onwards), Bookshelf was replaced with a dedicated Encarta Dictionary, a superset of the printed edition.

There was some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in Bookshelf which many found to be a useful reference, such as ''Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' (replaced with a quotations section in Encarta that links to relevant articles and people) and an [[Internet Directory]] (although now a moot point since many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist).

===Regional versions===
[[Robert McHenry]], while Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'', criticized&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html &quot;The Microsoft Way&quot;], essay by Robert McHenry&lt;/ref&gt; Encarta for differences in factual content between national versions of ''Encarta'', accusing Microsoft of &quot;pandering to local prejudices&quot; instead of presenting subjects objectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/1999/99-07/99-07-05/pag10.htm  Si la historia la escribe Microsoft, quiere decir que hay otra historia] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[Bill Gates]] addressed the nature of writing encyclopedia for different regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm &quot;The facts depend on where you are coming from&quot;], essay by Bill Gates reprinted in [[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Sunday Times]] of South Africa, April 6, 1997, accessed May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[Image:Student07.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Microsoft Student]] with Encarta Premium 2007 running on [[Windows XP]].]]
Before the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a [[multimedia]] [[markup language]], full text search, and extensibility using software objects.  The [[hypertext]] display, [[hyperlinking]] and search software was created by a team of [[CD-ROM]] Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as [[online help|interactive help]], [[document management system]]s and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia. ''Encarta'' was able to use various Microsoft technologies because it was extensible with [[Component-based software engineering|software components]] for displaying unique types of multimedia information.  For example, a snap in map engine is adapted from its [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]] software.  More information on the hypertext and [[search engine]] used by ''Encarta'' may be found in the [[Microsoft Bookshelf]] article.

Unlike [[Microsoft Office]], Encarta disc version only supports [[Microsoft Windows]] with Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]]. Encarta 98 was the last version to be released for the Macintosh. However, people who use other [[operating system]]s could still access ''Encarta'''s website.

Encarta uses database technologies to generate much of its multimedia content. For example, Encarta generates each zoomable map from a global [[geographic information system]] database on demand.

When a user uses the [[cut, copy and paste|copy and paste]] function of Microsoft Windows on Encarta on more than five words, Encarta automatically appends a [[copyright]] [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] message after the paste.

===User editing ===
Early in 2005, the online Encarta started to allow users to suggest changes to existing articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/05/04/08/1658247.shtml Microsoft Encarta Adopting Wikiesque Process], Slashdot.org, April 8, 2005, accessed May 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Articles were not immediately updated.  Instead, user feedback was submitted to ''Encarta's'' editors for review, copyediting, and approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Edit Encarta Encyclopedia--the Easy Way!|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/features/Guides/?Article=EditEncarta|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbkFbQt|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors were not paid for their submissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacy.msn.com/tou/ Encarta Terms of Use], MSN.com, accessed May 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- if this link had anything, it's long gone [http://spaces.msn.com/members/Encarta/ Encarta Spaces] --&gt;

=== Chatbot ===
Encarta's content was accessible using a conversational interface on [[Windows Live Messenger]] via the MSN [[Internet bot|Bot]] &quot;Encarta Instant Answers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;MSN screenname: encarta@conversagent.com and encarta@botmetro.net&lt;/ref&gt; The bot could answer many encyclopedia related questions directly in the IM window. It used short sentences from the Encarta website, and sometimes displays full articles in the [[Internet Explorer]]-based browser on the right.  It also could complete simple mathematical and advanced algebra problems. This service was also available in [[German language|German]],&lt;ref&gt;MSN screenname: de.encarta@botmetro.net&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]],&lt;ref&gt;MSN screenname: es.encarta@botmetro.net&lt;/ref&gt; [[French language|French]]&lt;ref&gt;MSN screenname: fr.encarta@botmetro.net&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].&lt;ref&gt;MSN screenname: jp.encarta@botmetro.net&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Updates ===
Each [[summer]], Microsoft published a new version of Encarta. However, despite the inclusion of news-related and some supplementary articles, Encarta's contents had not been changed substantially in its later years. Besides the yearly update, the installed offline copy could be updated over the Internet for a certain period for free depending on the edition. Some articles (usually about 2000) were updated to reflect important changes or events. When the update period expired, an advertisement prompting to upgrade to the new version was displayed to the user occasionally.
