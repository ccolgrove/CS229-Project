'''Heterophobia''' describes [[reverse discrimination]] based on [[sexual orientation]] and implies an irrational fear of, aversion toward, or discrimination againist [[heterosexual]] people and institutions. [[Neologism|Coined]] as a direct [[analogy]] to [[homophobia]], &quot;heterophobia&quot; is used by some opponents&lt;ref&gt;''Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination of a People. An Investigation Into the Human Sexuality Research of Alfred C. Kinsey, Wardell B. Pomeroy, Clyde E. Martin, and Paul H. Gebhard'' by Judith A. Reisman and Edward W. Eichel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Dictionary of Sexuality'' by Robert T. Francoeur&lt;/ref&gt; to various legal and civil rights for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people, when is used instead of [[heterosexism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3030328.stm BBC news -- Gay rights plans 'heterophobic'&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==

The term ''heterophobia'' was included in the Dictionary of Sexuality published in 1995 by American sexologist [[Robert T. Francoeur]], where it was defined as fear of heterosexuals. However, as of 1998, it didn't appear outside specialist literature, albeit it was already a searchable term on the then-innovative [[World Wide Web]]. 

Websterâs Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary includes the term [[homophobia]], which it traces back to 1958, but doesn't include ''heterophobia'', which Raymond J. Noonan considers to be traceable to the early 1980s. 

The 1990 book ''Kinsey, Sex and Fraud'' by [[Judith A. Reisman]], Edward W. Eichel, J. Gordon Muir, and J. H. Court included a whole chapter on heterophobia, describing it as a new concept and defining it similarly to Francoeur's definition. The term appeared again in 1996 in Raymond J. Noonan's book ''Does Anyone Still Remember When Sex Was Fun?'' where it was equated with the general [[sex negativity]] of the American society and defined a new concept called ''internalized heterophobia''. Noonan in a later book made the claim that homophobia itself was partially empowered by heterophobia and promoted the adoption of a [[systems approach]] by the sexology community in studying the determinants of sexual attitudes. 

In 1998 the book ''Heterophobia: Sexual Harassment and the Future of Feminism'' by [[Daphne Patai]] offered the first comprehensive study of heterophobia outside the sexology community. Patai claimed that heterophobia was linked to what she called Sexual Harassment Industry (SHI) which she described as the attempt to keep women and men separated for selfish and political purposes. Dr Noonan on 6 November 1999 organized a workshop on heterophobia during the joint annual meeting of the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS) and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists ([[AASECT]]) in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;noonan99&quot;&gt;http://home.bway.net/rjnoonan/Conf1999.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State University of New York|SUNY]] lecturer Dr. Ray Noonan, in his 1999 presentation to The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS) and the
American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) Conference&lt;ref name=&quot;noonan99&quot;/&gt; said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term heterophobia is confusing for some people for several reasons. On the one hand, some look at it as just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Moneyâs 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter. Yet heterophobia may be one of the root contributors in the [[etiology]] of homophobia, as Noonan argued in 1998. For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gaysâparticularly where those interests are perceived to clash.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other uses==
The term is used by [[Pierre-AndrÃ© Taguieff]] in his 1987 book ''The Force of Prejudice'' to signify &quot;fear of the different&quot;.

The term is used as the title of a poetry anthology by US slam poet, Ragan Fox.''(heterophobia 2005)''
