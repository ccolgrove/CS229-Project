==Final round==
Eight different players had at least a share of the lead at one point during the final round, included five simultaneously on the back 9. 54 hole leader [[Rory McIlroy]] shot 37 on the front to hold onto the lead, but made triple bogey on 10 and a 4 putt double bogey on 12 to fade with a final round 80. [[Tiger Woods]], who was seven shots back to start the final round, shot 31 on the front nine including an eagle at 8. He eventually tied for the lead, but a three-putt bogey on 12 and a missed 5-foot eagle putt on 15 doomed his chance at a fifth Masters title. Woods has never come from behind in the final round to win any of his 14 major victories. [[Geoff Ogilvy]], also seven shots back to start the day, birdied 12 through 16 to share the lead, but came up short of his second major. [[Choi Kyung-Ju|K. J. Choi]] tied for the lead with a birdie at the 9th hole, but struggled putting on the back nine and finished in a tie for 8th. 2009 champion [[Ãngel Cabrera]] led for much of the back 9, but bogeys at 12 and 16 lead to a solo 7th place finish. 

[[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] stormed up the leader board and after a birdie at 16 he held a two shot lead. [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]] made a 35 foot birdie putt on 17 and another birdie on 18 to post -12, a share of the clubhouse lead with Scott. However the day belonged to [[Charl Schwartzel]], who chipped in for birdie at 1, holed out for eagle on 3 and birdied the last 4 holes to come back and win by two shots. Schwartzel's 66 was the low round of the day. It was Schwartzel's first major win, and he became the third South African to win the Masters along with [[Gary Player]] and [[Trevor Immelman]]. It was also the 50th anniversary of Player's 1961 Masters win (when he became both the first South African and international player to win the Masters.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;
