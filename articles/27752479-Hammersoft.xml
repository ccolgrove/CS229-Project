The summit logo incorporates two images: (a) the sun rising over the sea; and (b) a traditional Korean lantern (''[[cheongsachorong]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes1&quot;/&gt;

Originally, three new [[artificial islands]] built on the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] between the [[Banpo Bridge|Banpo]] and [[Dongjak Bridge|Dongjak bridges]] were going to be used as the main summit venue.&lt;ref name=&quot;koreatimes2&quot;&gt;Kang Shin-who.

January 10, 2010; retrieved 10 Nov 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, delayed construction of the islands led for the main summit venue to relocate to [[COEX Convention &amp; Exhibition Center]].

The [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]] and [[Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency]] provided security for the summit venues and the vicinity.

===Transportation===
Most world leaders and international media arrived via [[Incheon International Airport]] and traveled to the summit venue via motorcades along the highway from the airport.

Transportation around the summit venue was upgraded with electric buses to help media and others around the city.

The South Korean government declined to invite the Netherlands, which had been invited to attend all four previous G20 summits.  A Korean spokesman said that &quot;a certain region had been over-represented&quot; in the past; and for this Asian summit, [[Singapore]] was invited.&lt;ref name=&quot;cho&quot;&gt;Cho Jin-seo [http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/09/301_73469.html Five non-G20 nations invited to Seoul Summit] ''[[Korea Times]]'' (ROK).

==Security==
Security for the G-20 summit presented a unique array of problems. In addition to the security of the main venue, [[COEX Convention &amp; Exhibition Center|COEX]], South Korea was more broadly responsible for providing a safe venue for the delegations who come to the summit. The [[National Police Agency (South Korea)|National Police Agency]] led the security detail for the summit, both at the convention venue and the airport as well. Other police and security agencies involved were:

* [[Presidential Security Service]]
* [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]]
* [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of Korea)|Ministry of National Defense]]
* [[Ministry of Public Administration and Security (South Korea)|National Emergency Management Agency]]

In preparation, anti-terrorism drills were held by members of the South Korean police, military, special forces and private sector as part of the 2010 [[Ulchi-Freedom Guardian]] exercises against simulated hostage situations and chemical, biological and radiological attacks as a preparation for the summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11012416  &quot;South Korea stages anti-terror drill,&quot;] ''BBC News'' (UK). August 18, 2010; retrieved 10 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for accommodating peaceful protesters were paired with plans for mitigating disruptive demonstrations.

The G-20 raised security concerns unrelated to demonstrators protesting the presence of the leaders of 20 economies in Seoul. For example, some analysts projected that anything perceived as a success for South Korea would be simultaneously construed in [[Pyongyang]] as a threat to North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, Donald.

==Criticism, Protests, and Controversies==

The G-20 has long been a target of protests and counter-summits by the [[global justice movement]], [[environmentalists]], [[anti-capitalists]], and other progressive transnational activist networks. For example, G-20 meetings in [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit protests|Toronto]], [[2009 G-20 London summit protests|London]], and [[2009_G-20_Pittsburgh_summit#Protests|Pittsburgh]] all experienced mass protests and countersummit activities, and the Seoul summit was no exception. Activists criticized the G20 for undermining workers' rights, pressuring governments to cut social programs, and contributing to environmentally destructive policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/11/08/2010110800551.html Tens of Thousands Protest G20 Summit in Seoul]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sunday before the summit, an estimated 20-40,000 protesters marched peacefully in opposition to the G20 summit and to the [[US-Korea Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/07/us-korea-protest-idUSTRE6A61CP20101107 | work=Reuters | title=Thousands protest in Seoul before G20 summit | date=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]] (KCTU), together with other labor unions, NGOs, and activists, organized a 'People's Week of Collective Action,' as well as a 'People's Summit' where thousands gathered to discuss alternative proposals on jobs, labour rights, financial regulation, climate change, Free Trade Agreements, [[food sovereignty]], poverty, migration, [[Intellectual Property Rights]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kctu.org/9845 KCTU Calls for international participation in Peopleâs Week of Collective Action protesting G20 Seoul Summit] September, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of the summit, a protest of thousands was marred by police violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demotix.com/news/504574/g20-protests-seoul]&lt;/ref&gt; The protests and countersummit were documented extensively by independent media such as [http://korea.indymedia.org Korea Indymedia], [http://www.demotix.com/news/504574/g20-protests-seoul demotix], and [http://blog.jinbo.net/noG20/ Jinbonet].  

In addition,

* There was an incident where a university instructor vandalized a G-20 promotional poster by drawing a rat. The letter G in English sounds much like the Korean word &quot;ì¥,&quot; which means &quot;mouse&quot; or &quot;rat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201011030454205&amp;code=940301 G20 íë³´ í¬ì¤í°ì âì¥â ê·¸ë ¸ë¤ê³  ëíê°ì¬ì ìì¥ ì ì²­â¦ ê¸°ê°] November 3, 2010 íê²¨ë &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/11/117_75731.html Arrest warrant for drawing rat on G20 promotion poster?]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Despite being located across from COEX, [[Bongeunsa]] was not printed on the official map of the Summit due to the disputes with the [[Jogye]] Buddhist order and [[Lee Myung-bak#Religion|Lee Myung-bak's alleged hostility]] toward Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=60101108174308&amp;section=03 &quot;G20 ìë´ìì ë´ìì¬ ëë½, ë¶êµ ë¬´ìì ì´ë¬´ìì ë­íë&quot;] November 8th 2010 íë ìì&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
Despite public endorsements by attending leaders, most commentators looking back on the summit have argued that only limited progress was made, especially on the headline issue of currency war and addressing trade imbalances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
Leaders were generally unable to agree on key issues, with commentators such as economist [[Eswar Prasad]] noting the absence of the sense of unity that had been present at summits during the worse of the [[financial crisis of 2007â2010|global financial crisis of 2007 -2009]]. IMF managing director [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] said this particular summit was &quot;more of a G20 debate than a G20 conclusion&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;shuns&quot;/&gt;

Relating to the need to [[Balance of payments#Imbalances|rebalance]] the world economy, agreement had been reached to work on indicative guidelines which will set suggested maximum limits for [[current account]] surpluses and deficits, though these are not due to be fleshed out until 2011.
G20 leaders also agreed to endorse the [[Seoul Development Consensus]] , a set of guidelines and principles for working together with less development nations to improve economic growth and reduce poverty. In contrast to the older [[Washington Consensus]] which it supersedes, the Seoul Consensus is less free market orientated, allowing a bigger role for state intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
