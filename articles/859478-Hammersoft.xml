'''Rowan University''' is a [[public university]] in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]], USA with a satellite campus in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. The school was founded in 1923 as '''Glassboro Normal School''' on a twenty-five acre tract of land donated by the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;rowan history&quot; /&gt; The school became '''New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro''' in the 1930s, and later became '''Glassboro State College''' in 1958, gaining a national reputation in the fields of reading and [[special education]]. Starting in the 1970s, it grew into a multi-purpose institution, adding programs in business, communications, engineering and became the first public university in New Jersey with a medical school in 2011.

It was renamed '''Rowan College of New Jersey''' in 1992, after [[Henry Rowan]] and his wife Betty gave $100 million to the school, at the time the largest gift to a public college.&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, Kaitlin. [http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0F4AE72930ABDD06&amp;p_docnum=2&amp;p_queryname=NaN&amp;p_product=NewsBank&amp;p_theme=aggregated4&amp;p_nbid=B48D4FNGMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg &quot;10 years later, Rowan still reaps gift's rewards - Rowan Milestones&quot;], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', July 9, 2002. Accessed August 1, 2007. &quot;Rowan University catapulted onto the national stage a decade ago when industrialist Henry Rowan gave sleepy Glassboro State College $100 million, the largest single sum ever donated to a public institution.... Rowan and his late wife, Betty, gave the money on July 6, 1992, with just one requirement: that a first-rate engineering school be built. In gratitude, Glassboro State changed its name to Rowan College.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It became Rowan University on March 21, 1997, when it won approval for university status from the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Gina. [http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EAEACDF96615254&amp;p_docnum=14&amp;p_queryname=NaN&amp;p_product=NewsBank&amp;p_theme=aggregated4&amp;p_nbid=B48D4FNGMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg &quot;R U READY? / ROWAN CELEBRATES ITS NEW STATUS AS A UNIVERSITY&quot;], ''[[The Press of Atlantic City]]'', April 8, 1997. Accessed August 1, 2007. &quot;For years, Rowan had the makings of a university, but it just recently applied for university status, achieving it with a nod of approval from the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education on March 21.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the early part of the 20th century, there was a shortage of properly trained teachers in the state of New Jersey. It was decided to build a two-year [[Normal school]] in the southern part of the state to counter the trend. Among the candidate towns, Glassboro became the location due in no small part to its easy access to passenger rail as well as its offer to donate {{convert|25|acre|m2}} of land to the state for the purpose of building the Normal school. The 1917 purchase price of the land was raised by the residents of the town ($7,000 at the time, over $116,000 in 2009 dollars) and used to purchase a tract that belonged to the Whitney family, who owned the local [[glassworks]] during the 19th century.

In 1923 the Glassboro Normal School opened, with a class of 236 female students arriving at the train station in front of Bunce Hall. With the evolution of teacher training the school became a four-year program in 1934; in 1937 the school was renamed The New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro and became [[co-educational]] shortly thereafter. 

The college was one of the first in the country to begin programs for teachers for [[reading disabilities]] and [[physical therapy]] in 1935 and 1944, respectively. Glassboro State began to develop a reputation as a leader in [[special education]] and after several years and the return of soldiers from World War II the college was able to expand its enrollment from a wartime low of 170 in 1943 to an expansion of several additional campus buildings and academic programs over the next 15 years and became Glassboro State College in 1958.

===Hollybush Summit===
[[Image:RowanUniversityHollybushMansion.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Hollybush Mansion, site of the Glassboro Summit Conference.]]
The [[Cold War]] [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] between U.S. President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] took place from June 23â25, 1967, in Hollybush Mansion at Glassboro State College. The college was chosen because of its location equidistant between New York City, where Kosygin was making a speech at the U.N., and Washington, D.C.

Then-college president Dr. Thomas E. Robinson was given just 16 hours' notice of the decision&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;[http://www.rowan.edu/president/pastpresidents/robinson.html Dr. Thomas E. Robinson, 1952-1968], Rowan University Office of the President&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the lack of preparation converted his on-campus home into a secure location for the leaders of the world's superpowers.

===After the Summit===
The campus was relatively quiet during the following decade, despite opening the 1970-71 academic year with [[Black Sabbath]]'s first US concert on October 30, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.black-sabbath.com/tourdates/1971.html Black Sabbath Online: Tour Dates 1971]&lt;/ref&gt; Peaceful student protests occurred during the [[Vietnam war]] as they did at other campuses, but never required the college to close the campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chamberlain&quot;&gt;[http://www.rowan.edu/president/pastpresidents/chamberlain.htmlDr. Mark M. Chamberlain, 1969-1984]&lt;/ref&gt;

While not occurring on University grounds, a significant event occurred in 1986 at Glassboro High School, which is just on the outskirts of the campus.  [[Ronald Reagan]] spoke at the Glassboro High School graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/61986e.htm Remarks at the High School Commencement Exercises in Glassboro, New Jersey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time in American history that a sitting President spoke at a high school graduation ceremony.  In the speech, Reagan reflected on the Glassboro Summit Conference and offered an optimistic analysis of the future of the [[Cold War]].  The event brought a high level of media attention.

Riots took place during Spring Weekend 1986, primarily off campus (though dominated by students) around the Beau Rivage townhomes and the Crossings apartment complex. As a result, Glassboro State College was ranked as the #28 [[party school|Party School]] in the nation in the January 1987 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/college/admin/playboy.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Playboy's Party Schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, in the Greek section of that same issue of Playboy, the Epsilon Eta chapter of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] was also named one of the [[Animal House]] Contenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.totse.com/en/ego/literary_genius/party40.html |title=Playboy's Top 40 party schools |work=Totse Official site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the alcohol-fueled Spring Weekend was cancelled by then-President Herman James (a non-alcoholic version continued for several years), Glassboro State College remained known for its hard partying culture.  However in 1988, there began one of the biggest crackdowns in school history.  As result of the drinking death of freshman James Callahan at [[Rutgers University]] in New Brunswick, Herman James decided to make GSC an example for the rest of the State colleges and universities to follow.  He invited the NJ Alcoholic Beverage Control commission (ABC) to the school and began shutting down off-campus parties, and placing undercover agents in the local liquor establishments.  This prompted [[Morton Downey, Jr.]], who was based in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], and very popular at the time, to do an untelevised show focusing on the drinking age and the classic argument that an eighteen year old can go off to war and die for their country, but they cannot legally buy and consume a beer.  Needless to say, he sided with the student opinion on this issue.  The following year, the ABC did not return, and the partying atmosphere that Glassboro State College was known for, returned in earnest and continued into the 1990s and early 2000s.

===University status===
In 1992, president Dr. Herman James oversaw the development of Glassboro State College into what would eventually become Rowan University. This transformation came about because of what was then the largest single gift to a public college or university in history. Industrialist [[Henry Rowan]] and his wife donated $100 million dollars to the college, which later changed its name to Rowan College of New Jersey in his honor. The gift allowed the college to open a College of Engineering and expand its course and curriculum offerings to the point that it became a full-fledged university, achieving the status in 1997. 

On August 12, 1996 22-year old Cindy Nannay was fatally shot outside Bozorth Hall by her estranged boyfriend, who then killed himself.  Nannay was so afraid of Scott Lonabaugh, 27, that when he arrived on the campus to see her, she asked friends to accompany her to the parking lot, the Gloucester County Prosecutor's office said. As her friends looked on, Mr. Lonabaugh shot Ms. Nannay twice with a shotgun and then shot himself in the head, prosecutors said. Both died at the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0DF1731F930A2575BC0A960958260 Murder-Suicide at Rowan], The New York Times, August 13, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Dr. James' resignation as president in 1998, Dr. Donald Farish was chosen to succeed him and began further expansion on the Glassboro campus, opening a new state of the art science building in 2003 and a building to house the College of Education in 2005. In addition, acquisitions during the beginning of Farish's tenure as president led to the development of a tract of land bordering [[US Route 322]] and [[State Route 55]] as the West Campus.

The Presidency of [[Donald J. Farish]] was noted for a continued crackdown on the university's partying culture which declined alongside a rise in [[SAT]] scores and class rank among the incoming freshman classes. The crackdown on the partying culture began in earnest in 2002 with the official banning of [[kegs]] for use by Greek letter organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhitonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=cafa34b5-a397-4b3c-aab0-59c62978c0a6 |title=University bans kegs from Greek life |date=February 28, 2002 |work=The Whit Online |author=Duerr, Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, two Rowan University students were found guilty for serving alcohol to minors that resulted in the death of a 16-year old male at an off campus party, with Rowan promising to follow up with its own penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhitonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=c81d6b55-8a3b-4618-a48a-79e6653c4a16 |title=Students sentenced in underage drinking death |work=The Whit |author=Dunphy, Thomas |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====West Campus====
On March 20, 2006, President Farish announced a joint venture between the university and [[Major League Soccer]] to construct a new athletic complex based around a 20,000 seat [[soccer-specific stadium]] on property owned by the campus at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 322 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 322]] and [[New Jersey Route 55|Route 55]]. The stadium itself was planned to be complete for the start of the 2009 MLS season. 2006 budget problems in New Jersey resulted in cutbacks, including funding for infrastructure upgrades required to handle increased traffic that would have come with an MLS team. The plan fell through and the stadium project was relocated to nearby Chester, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/15418323.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The northern portion of the West Campus expansion currently contains the South Jersey Technology Park as well as room for future expansion; the southern portion of the West Campus expansion will accommodate both academic and athletic facilities. Transportation between the two campuses will be provided with both shuttle service and improved bike paths, as well as improvements to Route 322 itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;presreport&quot;&gt;''Ten Years of Transformation'': The President's Report, 1999-2008; Rowan University Office of the President&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Jersey Technology Park====
Rowan University broke ground for the South Jersey Technology Park (SJTP) on April 10, 2006.  The New Jersey Development Authority (NJEDA) gave Rowan University $5.8 million along with $1.5 million from the New Jersey Commission on Science and Technology, $1 million from Samuel H. Jones, and $1 million from Rowan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjtechpark.org/news/cp022708.html |title=South jersey Technology Park to open July 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |date=February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SJTP is planned to be a 188 acre (0.76 km2) site which will serve as an establishment for science and technology companies as well as academics.  It is planned to have 25 buildings to provide competitively price, Class &quot;A&quot; facilities for budding entrepreneurs, start-up and established companies.  SJTP was incorporated as a non-profit corporation with its own board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjtechpark.org/about/overview.html |title=SJTP Overview |accessdate=2008-12-12 |work=SJTP Official site}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first building, the Samuel H. Jones Innovation Center, has been leased completely out and the revenue will help build a second building. The first floor will be controlled by Rowan and will pay a lease to the Tech Park Corporation and is divided up among the Rohrer College of Business and separate lab space for the College of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/gloucester/index.ssf?/base/news-3/1224659414174230.xml&amp;coll=8&quot; |title=South Jersey Tech Park opening to a full house |accessdate=2008-12-12 |date=October 22, 2008 |author= Beym, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second floor will be occupied by the Educational Information and Resource Center, which formerly owned a building on Delsea Drive in Washington Township.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2009/09/eirc_signs_7-year_lease_with_r.html | title=EIRC signs 7-year lease with Rowan's South Jersey Technology Park|accessdate=2008-09-30|date=September 29, 2009|author=Beym, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tech Park's first incubated business, [[SocialReach]], has successfully graduated into their own offices in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.njbiz.com/article.asp?aID=79275 | title=First business graduates from Rowan incubator | accessdate=2009-09-30|date=September 21, 2009|author=Fitzgerald, Beth}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second planned building will be approximately 66,000 gross square feet divided between research and technology labs and offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;presreport&quot; /&gt;

On October 27, 2007 (during Homecoming festivities) 19-year old sophomore Donald Farrell was robbed and beaten to death by unknown assailants while walking behind the Triad dormitory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20071029_One_punch_killed_Rowan_University_student__prosecutor_says.html &quot;Rowan killing was ârobbery, pure and simpleâ says prosecutor&quot;], ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', October 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A reward of $100,000 has been offered for information leading to the capture, arrest and conviction of the assailants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rowan.edu/today/documents/GET/homicidereward $50,000 Reward in Homicide Investigation], Rowan University publication, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to find Farrell's assailants, television stations in Philadelphia, New Jersey and New York City aired reports on the murder, and [[America's Most Wanted]] twice featured segments on the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amw.com/fugitives/case.cfm?id=50260 America's Most Wanted], accessed February 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Farrell's murder a new campus security initiative was undertaken, starting with a 14-point plan proposed by President Farish. The plan included hiring additional security staff, adding more fully trained police officers, an expansion of the Safe Walk and Ride program, improving lighting in and around campus, installation of CCTV cameras, and changing security and police coverage from an 8-hour to a 12-hour shift.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rowan.edu/today/news/index/PR/1982 Update on Rowan's Security Enhancement Initiatives, ''Rowan Today'', December 17, 2007. Accessed February 2, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooper Medical School===
It was announced on June 26, 2009 that Rowan would be partnering with [[Cooper University Hospital]] to create a new four-year medical school to reside on Broadway in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]. Rowan was chosen by governor [[Jon Corzine]] to house the new medical school primarily because [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] (UMDNJ) was not in a financial position to fund creation of the school, for which Rowan will issue $100 million in bonds.

The new school would require no new funding as $28 million would be diverted from UMDNJ [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]], which will no longer be associated with Cooper University Hospital after the opening of Cooper Medical School. Opening in 2012 with an entering class of 50,&lt;ref name=&quot;Construction milestone for Cooper Medical School in Camden&quot;/&gt; Cooper Medical School of Rowan University will be the only medical school in the state not affiliated with UMDNJ,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooper&quot;&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/wires/ap/news/state/pennsylvania/20090626_ap_njsrowanuniversitycouldgetnewmedicalschool.html NJ's Rowan University could get new medical school]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}, philly.com, accessed 26 Jun 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the first new medical school in New Jersey in at least 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Construction milestone for Cooper Medical School in Camden&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Students have a choice between halls, apartments, or townhouses.  After their first year students are not guaranteed housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowan.edu/studentaffairs/reslife/documents/RL_Handbook.pdf |title=Residential Learning &amp; University Housing Handbook |work=Official Site |accessdate=2008-12-18 |author=Rowan |format=PDF |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are plans to expand the current housing facilities. Plans include removing Mansion Park Apartments and replacing it with an 800-bed freshman housing complex with its own dining facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Housing Sneak Peek&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowan.edu/open/masterplan/downloads/Housing_Sneak_Peek.pdf |title=Rowan University Campus Development|work=Official Site|accessdate=2010-01-18|format=PDF|year=2009|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also proposed are a new building opposite Linden Hall, conversion of Linden to residential use (or demolition and rebuilding) and adding new residence halls around the Bunce circle. Bunce construction would only begin after a new administration building is completed to replace Bole Hall and Bole Annex.  There will be infill buildings added to Edgewood Park Apartments and Triad Apartments.  It has also been outlined that any additional housing after these infill projects will be provided by new development on Rowan Boulevard.&lt;ref name=&quot;master plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowan.edu/open/masterplan/downloads/FinalReport-Dec07-small.pdf |title=Rowan University Master Plan 2000-2010 |work=Official Site |accessdate=2008-12-18 |author=Rowan |format=PDF |year=2007 |month=December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both buildings are 3 stories tall and use suites containing two rooms joined by a bathroom. '''Oak &amp; Laurel Hall''' each house up to 65 students on three floors. They were the first residence halls on campus, and were used for classrooms for some time until they were renovated in 1999 and returned to living spaces. The suites share one or two bathrooms depending on configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowan.edu/studentaffairs/reslife/reshalls/index.html |title=Residential Learning &amp; University Housing |work=Official Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Triad Apartments''' was acquired by the University in 1966 and contains three wings of three floors each. The building's first floor was used as classroom space and the Office of Public Safety until a renovation in the early 2000s converted it into student housing with central air conditioning. It holds 378 students.

The '''Townhouse Complex''' was built in 2005 and has 113 living units that accommodate 464 students in single occupancy rooms. There is a three story parking garage to accommodate its residents.

==Hollybush Mansion==
Hollybush was originally the home of the Whitney family, and it was the first of its kind in South Jersey. It set a certain precedent with its [[Italianate]] architectural style, and its interior decorations attest to this precedent. Two of these significantly unique features of the house are the trompe de l'oeil ceilings in the parlor as well as the Summit Room, and the stained glass archway above the front door. The stone that was used in construction of Hollybush was New Jersey Ironstone, a sedimentary type stone that is found in the low hills and ridges of South Jersey.
