'''Al-Qaeda in Iraq''' (AQI) is a popular name for the [[Iraq]]i division of the international [[Salafist jihadism|Salafi jihadi]] militant organization [[al-Qaeda]]. It is recognized as a part of the greater [[Iraqi insurgency]].

The group was founded in 2003 and first led by the [[Jordan]]ian militant [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], who declared allegiance to [[Osama bin Laden]]'s al-Qaeda network in October 2004. It was initially operating under the name '''''Jama'at al-[[Tawhid]] wal-[[Jihad]]''''' ({{lang-ar|Ø¬ÙØ§Ø¹Ø© Ø§ÙØªÙØ­ÙØ¯ ÙØ§ÙØ¬ÙØ§Ø¯}}, &quot;Group of Monotheism and Jihad&quot;); since 2004 its official name is '''''Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn''''' (QJBR) (&quot;Organization of [[Jihad]]'s Base in the [[Mesopotamia|Country of the Two Rivers]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2005/64344.htm Middle East and North Africa Overview], ''[[Country Reports on Terrorism]]'', [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 28 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign (non-Iraqi) fighters are widely thought to play a key role in its network.&lt;ref name=ChristianScienceMonitor20040514&gt;{{cite news| date=May 14, 2004 | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0514/p03s01-usfp.html | author=Peter Grier, Faye Bowers | publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]] | title=Iraq's bin Laden? Zarqawi's rise | accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As ''Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad'' ==
=== Origins ===

Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, often abbreviated to &quot;JTJ&quot; or shortened to ''Tawhid and Jihad'', ''Tawhid wal-Jihad'' and sometimes ''Tawhid al-Jihad'' (or just ''Al Tawhid'' or ''Tawhid''), was started by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] and a combination of foreigners and local [[Islamism|Islamist]] sympathizers, largely [[Kurds|Kurdish]]. Zarqawi was a [[Jordan]]ian [[Salafism|Salafi]] who had traveled to [[Afghanistan]] to fight in the [[Soviet-Afghan War]], but he arrived after the departure of the Soviet troops and soon returned to his homeland. He eventually returned to Afghanistan, running an Islamic militant training camp near [[Herat]]. Originally, Zarqawi started the network with the intention of overthrowing the kingdom of Jordan, which he considered to be un-Islamic in the [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] sense, and for this purpose developed a large number of contacts and affiliates in several countries. His network may have been involved in the late 1999 [[2000 millennium attack plots|plot to bomb the Millennium celebrations]] in the United States and Jordan. Zarqawi's operatives were also responsible for the assassination of U.S. diplomat [[Laurence Foley]] in Jordan in 2002.&lt;ref name=StateDepartment20041015&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/37130.htm | author=[[Richard Boucher]] | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | date=October 15, 2004 | title=Foreign Terrorist Organization: Designation of Jama'at al-Tawhid wa'al-Jihad and Aliases | accessdate=July 13, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070711131613/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/37130.htm  |archivedate = July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan]], Zarqawi moved westward into Iraq, where he reportedly received medical treatment in [[Baghdad]] for an injured leg. It is believed that he developed extensive ties in Iraq with ''[[Ansar al-Islam]]'' (&quot;Partisans of Islam&quot;), a Kurdish Islamist militant group based in the extreme northeast of the country. Allegedly, Ansar had ties to Iraqi Intelligence; [[Saddam Hussein]]'s motivation would have been to use Ansar as a surrogate force to repress the secular Kurds fighting for independence of [[Kurdistan]].&lt;ref name=TheCanadianInstituteofStrategicStudies&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ciss.ca/Comment_EnemyofMyEnemy.pdf | publisher=The Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies | title=The Enemy of My Enemy: The odd link between Ansar al-Islam, Iraq and Iran | accessdate=July 13, 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2003, Ansar's founder [[Mullah Krekar]] denied any connection with Saddam's regime.&lt;ref name=Bbc20030131&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2713749.stm | publisher=BBC | title=Mullah denies Iraq al-Qaeda link | date= January 31, 2003 | author=Pam O'Toole | accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus of intelligence officials has since concluded that there were no links whatsoever between Zarqawi and Saddam, and that Saddam viewed Ansar al-Islam &quot;as a threat to the regime&quot; and his intelligence officials were spying on the group. The [[Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq]] concluded in 2006, &quot;Postwar information indicates that Saddam Hussein attempted, unsuccessfully, to locate and capture al-Zarqawi and that the regime did not have a relationship with, harbor, or turn a blind eye toward Zarqawi.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq]], Conclusion 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2003 [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S-led invasion of Iraq]], JTJ developed into an expanding militant network including some of the remnants of Ansar al-Islam and a growing number of foreign fighters, with the purpose of resisting the coalition occupation forces and their Iraqi allies. Many foreign fighters arriving in Iraq were inititally not associated with the group, but once in the country they became dependent on Zarqawi's local contacts.&lt;ref name=JamestownFoundation20041216GaryGambill&gt;{{cite web | title=Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi: A biographical sketch | author=Gary Gambill | url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;&amp;issue_id=3179 | publisher=[[Jamestown Foundation]] | date=December 16, 2004 | accessdate=July 13, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930185929/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;&amp;issue_id=3179  |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2004, JTJ joined forces with an obscure Islamist militant group Salafiah al-Mujahidiah.&lt;ref name=Bbc20041008&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3677658.stm | publisher=BBC | date= October 8, 2004 | title=Profile: Tawhid and Jihad group | accessdate=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goals and tactics ===

[[File:Flag of al-Qaeda in Iraq.svg|thumb|The JTJ in their beheading videos displayed a [[jihadist black flag]] with a white or yellow circle below the [[shahada]].]]
The stated goals of JTJ were to force a withdrawal of U.S-led forces from Iraq, to topple the Iraqi [[interim government]], to assassinate collaborators with the [[occupation of Iraq|occupation]], to marginalize the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] population and defeat its militias, and to subsequently establish a pure [[Islamic state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/letter_in_english.pdf Al-Qaeda leaders have proclaimed Iraq a major front in their global terrorist campaign]. ''[[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]]'', July 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

JTJ differed from the other early Iraqi insurgent groups considerably in its tactics. Rather than just using conventional weapons and [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] in ambushes against the U.S. and coalition forces, it has relied heavily on [[suicide bombings]], often using [[car bomb]]s and targeting a wide variety of groups but especially [[Iraqi Security Forces]] and those facilitating the occupation. Groups of workers that have been targeted by JTJ include Iraqi interim officials, Iraqi Shia and Kurdish political and religious figures, the country's Shia Muslim civilians, foreign civilian contractors, and the [[United Nations]] and [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] workers.&lt;ref name=JamestownFoundation20041216GaryGambill/&gt; Zarqawi's militants have been also known to use a wide variety of other tactics, including targeted [[kidnapping]]s, the planting of [[improvised explosive device]]s, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attacks; beginning in late June 2004, the JTJ implemented [[urban guerilla]]-style attacks using [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and [[small arms]]. They also gained a worldwide notoriety for [[beheading]] Iraqi and foreign [[hostage]]s and distributing video recordings of these acts on the [[Internet]].

The group, whose spiritual advisor and deputy leader was the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cleric [[Abu Anas al-Shami]], cited various texts from the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] (traditions) of [[Muhammad]] that they perceived to be in support of their tactics. It quoted the prophet Muhammad, who said to the people of [[Mecca]] when conquering them: ''&quot;By the one in whose hand the soul of Muhammad is in, I came to you with slaughter&quot;'' as narrated in the books of [[Hadith]] (traditions), and quoted Muhammad as saying &quot;Whoever slaughters a non-Muslim [at war with Islam, i.e. those perceived to be 'enemy occupiers'] sincerely for the sake of [[Allah]], Allah will make hellfire prohibited upon him.&quot; Other verses of the Qur'an call Muslims to fight invading non-Muslims and even behead them, such where Allah says in the Qur'an, &quot;When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.&quot;{{cite quran|8|12}}

=== Activities ===

[[File:UN DF-SD-04-02188.JPEG|thumb|UN headquarters in Baghdad after the [[Canal Hotel bombing]], August 22, 2003]]

JTJ claimed credit for a number of attacks targeting Iraqi forces and [[infrastructure]]  (including the October 2004 ambush and massacre of 49 unarmed [[Iraqi National Guard]] recruits) and for a series of attacks on [[humanitarian aid]] agencies such as the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].&lt;ref name=TheKnowledgeBaseIraq2004&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tkb.org/MorePatterns.jsp?countryCd=IZ&amp;year=2004 | title=Iraq: 2004 overview | publisher=The Knowledge Base | accessdate=July 13, 2007}} {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also conducted numerous attacks against [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] personnel throughout 2004 and audacious suicide attacks inside the high-security [[Green Zone]] perimeter in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=StateDepartment20060428&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2005/65275.htm | publisher=[[United States Department of State]] | date=April 28, 2006 | title=Country Reports on Terrorism | accessdate=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zarqawi's men reputedly succeeded in assassinating several leading Iraqi politicians of the early post-Saddam era, and their bomb attack on the United Nations mission's headquarters in Iraq led the UN country team to relocate to Jordan and continue to work remotely.

The group either directly took responsibility or was blamed for many early Iraqi insurgent attacks, including the August 2003 series of high-profile bombings which killed 17 people [[2003 Jordanian embassy bombing in Baghdad|at the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad]];&lt;ref name=JamestownFoundation20041216GaryGambill/&gt; 23 people, including the chief of the United Nations mission to Iraq [[SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello]], [[Canal Hotel bombing|at the UN headquarters in Baghdad]];&lt;ref name=JamestownFoundation20041216GaryGambill/&gt; and at least 86 including [[Ayatollah]] [[Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim]] in the [[Imam Ali Mosque bombing]] in [[Najaf]];&lt;ref name=Newsday20050207&gt;{{cite news | title=Zarqawi kin reportedly bombed shrine in Iraq | author=[[Mohamad Bazzi]] | date=February 7, 2005 | url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/world/ny-wozarq0208,0,4101449.story?coll=ny-worldnews-toputility | publisher=[[Newsday]] | accessdate=2007-07-13}} {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the November truck bombing which killed 27 people, mostly [[Italy|Italian]] paramilitary policemen, [[2003 Nasiriyah bombing|at the Italian base]] in [[Nasiriyah]].&lt;ref name=JamestownFoundation20041216GaryGambill/&gt;

Most of them were beheaded using knives. Al-Zarqawi personally beheaded Berg and Armstrong, but Yuce was shot dead by al-Masri and Gezmen was released after &quot;repenting&quot;.

=== Goals and umbrella organizations ===
{{see also|Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Islamic State of Iraq}}

In a July 2005 letter to imran khan [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], al-Zarqawi outlined a four-stage plan to expand the [[Iraq War]], which included expelling [[Military of the United States|U.S. forces]] from Iraq, establishing an [[Islam]]ic authority ([[caliphate]]), spreading the conflict to Iraq's secular neighbors, and engaging in the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Organizations&quot;/&gt; The affiliated groups were linked to regional attacks outside Iraq consistent with their stated plan, such as the [[2005 Sharm el-Sheikh attacks|Sharm al-Sheikh bombings]] in [[Egypt]] which killed some 88 people, including many foreign tourists.

In January 2006, AQI created an [[umbrella organization]], the [[Mujahideen Shura Council (Iraq)|Mujahideen Shura Council]] (MSC), in an attempt to unify [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] insurgents in Iraq. Its efforts to recruit Iraqi Sunni [[nationalism|nationalists]] and secular groups were undermined by its violent tactics against civilians and its extreme [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]]&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Jim. &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6740683.stm US pits Iraqi Sunnis against al-Qaeda]&quot;, [[BBC News]], 11 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine. Because of these impediments, the attempt was largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threat&quot;&gt;DeYoung, Karen/Pincus, Walter. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/17/AR2007031701373.html Al-Qaeda in Iraq May Not Be Threat Here]&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 18 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

AQI formerly attributed its attacks to the MSC until mid-October 2006, when [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] declared the self-styled [[Islamic State of Iraq]] (ISI), another front which included the Shura Council factions. The AQI now attributes its attacks to the ISI,&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Qaida&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.nps.edu/Library/Research/SubjectGuides/SpecialTopics/TerroristProfile/Current/AlQaidaIraq.html al jehad in Iraq (AQI)]&quot;, [[Dudley Wright Knox|Dudley Knox]] Library, [[Naval Postgraduate School]]&lt;/ref&gt; and claims it is answering to the supreme [[emir]] (leader) of the organization, [[Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi]]. According to a study compiled by U.S. intelligence agencies, the ISI have plans to seize power and turn the country into a Sunni [[Caliphate|Islamic state]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article1782088.ece Al-Qaeda planning militant Islamic state within Iraq]&quot;, ''[[The Times]]'', 16 June 2007 {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strength and activity ===

The group's strength is unknown, with estimates that ranged from just 850 to several thousand full-time fighters in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;myth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-saudi15jul15,0,3132262.story?coll=la-home-center &quot;Saudis' role in Iraq insurgency outlined&quot;], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 15 July 2007 {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] estimated that AQIâs core membership was &quot;more than 1,000.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;myth&quot;/&gt; (These figures do not include the other six&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.2322183712 Iraq: Two leaders linked to al-Qaeda group arrested]&lt;/ref&gt; AQI-led Salafi groups organized in the Islamic State of Iraq.) The group is said to be suffering high manpower losses (including from its many &quot;[[Martyr (shahid)|martyrdom]]&quot; operations), but for a long time this appeared to have little effect on its strength and capabilities, implying a constant flow of volunteers from Iraq and abroad.

In 2007 some observers and scholars suggested that the threat posed by AQI was being exaggerated and a &quot;heavy focus on Al-Qaeda obscures a much more complicated situation on the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]]. &quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/09/africa/ME-GEN-Iraq-Enemy-No.-1.php In motley array of Iraqi foes, why does U.S. spotlight al-Qaida?]&quot;, ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT PE&quot;&gt;[[Clark Hoyt]] &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/opinion/08pubed.html?_r=1&amp;oref=login Seeing Al-Qaeda round every corner]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]], 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to both the July 2007 [[National Intelligence Estimate]] and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] reports, AQI accounted for 15 percent of attacks in Iraq. However, the [[Congressional Research Service]] noted in its September 2007 report that attacks from al-Qaeda are less than two percent of the violence in Iraq and criticized the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]âs statistics, noting that its false reporting of insurgency attacks as AQI attacks has increased since the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]] operations began in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;myth&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0710.tilghman.html The Myth of AQI], ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'', August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/crsiraq0907.pdf CRS Report To Congress: Iraq: Post-Saddam Governance and Security] [[Congressional Research Service]] PDF September 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, the U.S.-sponsored [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] analyzed AQI attacks for that month and concluded the group had taken credit for 43 out of 439 attacks on Iraqi security forces and Shiite militias, and 17 out of 357 attacks on U.S. troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;myth&quot;/&gt;

According to the 2006 U.S. Government report, this group is most clearly associated with foreign [[Jihadi]] [[covert cell|cells]] operating in Iraq and has specifically targeted international forces and Iraqi citizens; most of AQI's operatives were not [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]], but were coming through a series of safe houses, the largest of which was on the Iraq-[[Syria]]n border. AQI's operations are predominately Iraq-based, but the [[United States Department of State]] alleges that the group maintains an extensive [[logistics|logistical]] network throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[Iran]], [[South Asia]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Organizations&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2005/65275.htm Foreign Terrorist Organizations]&quot;, ''[[Country Reports on Terrorism]]'', [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 28 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2008 [[CNN]] special report, al-Qaeda in Iraq was called &quot;a well-oiled organization (...) almost as pedantically bureaucratic as was Saddam Hussein's [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath party]]&quot;, collecting new execution videos long after they stopped publicising them, and having a network of spies even in the U.S. military bases. According to the report, Iraqis (many of them former members of Hussein's secret services) have now effectively run al-Qaeda in Iraq, with &quot;foreign fighters' roles seem mostly relegated to the cannon fodder of suicide attacks&quot;; however, the organization's top leadership was still dominated by non-Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/06/11/al.qaeda.iraq/index.html?iref=topnews Papers give peek inside al Qaeda in Iraq], [[CNN]], June 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, al-Zarqawi's network was the main target of the U.S. [[Second Battle of Fallujah|Operation Phantom Fury]] in [[Fallujah]], but its leadership managed to escape the American siege and subsequent storming of the city. In December, in two of its many sectarian attacks, al-Qaeda bombed a Shi'ite funeral procession in [[Najaf]] and the main bus station in nearby [[Karbala]], [[December 2004 Karbala and Najaf bombings|killing at least 60]] in the holy cities of Shia Islam. The group also reportedly took responsibility for the [[30 September 2004 Baghdad bombing]] which killed 41 people, mostly children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198661,00.html Fast Facts: Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]&quot;, [[Associated Press]]/[[Fox News]], 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, AQI largely focused on executing high-profile and coordinated [[suicide attack]]s, claiming responsibility for numerous attacks which were primarily aimed at Iraqi civilians. The group launched attacks against voters during the [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|Iraqi legislative election]] in January, a [[Battle of Abu Ghraib|combined suicide and conventional attack]] on the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in April, and the coordinated suicide attacks outside the [[Sheraton Ishtar]] and [[Palestine Hotel]] in Baghdad in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organizations&quot;/&gt; In July, al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and execution of [[Ihab Al-Sherif]], Egypt's envoy to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/07/africa/web.0707egypt.php Al-Qaeda claims to have killed Egyptian envoy]&quot;, [[Associated Press]]/''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 7 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caroll, Rory/Borger, Julian.

The attacks blamed on or claimed by al-Qaeda in Iraq continued to increase in 2006 (see also [[Iraq War insurgent attacks|the list of major insurgent attacks in Iraq]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Qaida&quot;/&gt; In one of the incidents, two U.S. soldiers ([[Thomas Lowell Tucker]] and [[Kristian Menchaca]]) were captured, tortured and beheaded by the ISI; in another, [[Abduction of Russian diplomats in Iraq|four Russian embassy officials]] were abducted and subsequently executed. Iraq's al-Qaeda and its umbrella groups were blamed for multiple attacks targeting the country's Shia Muslim population, some of which AQI claimed responsibility for. The U.S. claimed the group was at least one of the forces behind the wave of [[chlorine bombings in Iraq]] which affected hundreds of people (albeit with few fatalities) through the series of crude [[chemical warfare]] attacks between late 2006 and mid-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSPAR44485120070224 U.S. says Iraq chlorine bomb factory was al Qaeda's] ''Reuters'' February 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; During 2006, several key members of the AQI were killed or captured by American and allied forces; this included al-Zarqawi himself, killed on June 7, 2006, his spiritual adviser [[Sheik Abd-Al-Rahman]], and the alleged &quot;number two&quot; deputy leader, [[Hamid Juma Faris Jouri al-Saeedi]].&lt;!-- please clarify who was killed and who was captured --&gt; The group's leadership was then assumed by the man called Abu Hamza al-Muhajir,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5073092.stm Al-Qaeda in Iraq names new head], [[BBC News]], 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who was really the Egyptian militant [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Al Masri&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,2069653,00.html Al-Qaida in Iraq leader believed dead], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 May 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-profile attacks linked to the group continued through early 2007, as the AQI-led Islamic State claimed responsibility for attacks such as the March assassination attempt on Sunni Deputy [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] [[Salam al-Zaubai]], the April [[2007 Iraqi Parliament bombing|Iraqi Parliament bombing]], and the May capture and subsequent execution of [[May 2007 abduction of US soldiers in Iraq|three American soldiers]]. Also in May, ISI leader al-Baghdadi was declared to have been killed in Baghdad, but his death was later denied by the insurgents (later, al-Baghdadi was even declared by the U.S. to be non-existent). There were conflicting reports regarding the fate of al-Masri. From March to August, coalition forces fought the [[Battle of Baqubah]] as part of the largely successful attempts to wrest the [[Diyala Governorate]] from AQI-aligned forces. Through 2007, the majority of the suicide bombings targeting civilians in Iraq were routinely identified by the military and government sources as being the responsibility of al-Qaeda and its associated groups, even when there was no claim of responsibility (as was in the case of the [[2007 Yazidi communities bombings]], which killed some 800 people in the deadliest terrorist attack in Iraq to date).

By late 2007, violent and indiscriminate attacks directed by AQI against Iraqi civilians had severely damaged their image and caused the loss of support among the population, isolating the group. In a major blow to AQI, many former Sunni militants that previously fought along with the group started to work with the American forces (see also [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq#Conflict with the other Sunni militant groups|below]]). The U.S. troop surge supplied the military with more manpower for operations targeting the group, resulting in dozens of high-level AQI members being captured or killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/11/targeting_al_qaeda_in_iraqs_ne.asp Targeting al Qaeda in Iraq's Network], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', 11/13/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda seemed to have lost its foothold in Iraq and appeared to be severely crippled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/14/AR2007101401245.html Al-Qaeda In Iraq Reported Crippled; Many Officials, However, Warn Of Its Resilience], ''Washington Post'', October 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the bounty issued for al-Masri was eventually cut from $5 million down to $100,000 in April 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;nostra&quot;/&gt;

As of 2008, a series of U.S. and Iraqi offensives managed to drive out the AQI-aligned insurgents from their former safe havens such as [[Diyala campaign|Diyala]] and [[Al Anbar]] Governorates and the embattled capital of Baghdad to the area of the northern city of [[Mosul]], the latest of the Iraq War's major battlegrounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;nostra&quot;/&gt; The struggle for control of [[Ninawa Governorate]] (the [[Ninawa campaign]]) was launched in January 2008 by U.S. and Iraqi forces as part of the large-scale [[Operation Phantom Phoenix]] aimed at combating Al-Qaeda activity in and around Mosul, as well as finishing off the network's remnants in central Iraq that escaped [[Operation Phantom Thunder]] in 2007. In 2008, Al-Qaeda bombed the Baghdad's [[1 February 2008 Baghdad bombings|pet market in February]] and [[6 March 2008 Baghdad bombing|a shopping centre in March]], killing at least 98 and 68 people, respectively.

Al-Qaeda in Iraq has long raised money through various activities like kidnapping for [[ransom]], car theft (sometimes killing drivers in the process), and hijacking fuel trucks, that would bring them tens of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;nostra&quot;/&gt; According to an April 2007 statement by their [[Islamic Army in Iraq]] rivals, AQI was demanding ''[[jizya]]'' tax and killing members of wealthy families when not being paid.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIDE&quot;&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/842/op6.htm On whose side is Al-Qaeda?], ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'', April 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to both U.S. and Iraqi sources in May 2008, the Islamic State of Iraq has been  stepping up its [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] campaigns as their strictly militant capabilities were on the wane, with especially lucrative activity said to be coming from oil rackets centered on the industrial city of [[Bayji]]. According to U.S. military intelligence sources, in 2008 the group resembled a &quot;[[Mafia]]-esque criminal gang&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nostra&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/138085 Al Qaeda Nostra], ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inciting sectarian violence through mass terrorism ===

Attacks against civilians often targeted the Iraqi Shia majority in an attempt to incite [[sectarian violence]] and greater chaos in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0320/p09s01-coop.html Al Qaeda's hand in tipping Iraq toward civil war], ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''/''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'',  March 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/15/africa/web.0915iraq.php Another wave of bombings hit Iraq]&quot;, [[Associated Press]]/''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 15 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while claiming responsibility for the Shiite mosque bombings.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/09/16/news/iraq.php 20 die as insurgents in Iraq target Shiites]&quot;, ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''/''[[The New York Times]]'', 17 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The same month, a letter allegedly written by al-Zawahiri (later rejected as a &quot;fake&quot;  by AQI) appeared to question the insurgents' tactic of indiscriminately attacking Shiites in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4339912.stm Al-Qaeda disowns 'fake letter']&quot;, [[CNN]], 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2007 video, al-Zawahiri defended the Islamic State in Iraq, but distanced himself from the crimes against civilians committed by &quot;hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=1.0.1678520501 British 'fleeing' claims al-Qaeda]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. and Iraqi officials accused AQI of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq's majority Shiites and minority Sunni Arabs with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insurgents&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200705/s1911670.htm Al Qaeda leader in Iraq 'killed by insurgents']&quot;, [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 1 May 2007 {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With attacks such as the 2003 [[Imam Ali Mosque]] bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|first al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in [[Samarra]] and the deadly single-day [[23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings|series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed]] in Baghdad's Shiite district of [[Sadr City]], and the [[2007 al-Askari Mosque bombing|second al-Askari bombing]] in 2007, they provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in a plague of [[death squad]]-style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006 and brought Iraq to the brink of violent [[anarchy]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threat&quot;/&gt; In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda killed [[2008 Karbala bombing|at least 42 people]] at the [[Imam Husayn Shrine]] in Karbala in March and [[17 June 2008 Baghdad bombing|at least 51 people]] at a bus stop in Baghdad in June.

=== Operations outside Iraq and other activities ===

On December 3, 2004, AQI attempted to blow up an Iraqi-Jordanian [[border control|border crossing]], but failed to do so (in 2006, a [[Jordan]]ian court sentenced Zarqawi ''[[in absentia]]'' and two of his associates to death for their involvement in the plot).&lt;ref&gt;[http://beta.inquirer.net/common/print.php?index=1&amp;story_id=60417&amp;site_id=38 Zarqawi handed second death penalty in Jordan], ''[Inquirer]'', 19 December 2005 {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; AQI increased its presence outside Iraq by claiming credit for three attacks in 2005. In the most deadly of such attacks, suicide bombs [[2005 Amman bombings|killed 60 people in Amman]], Jordan, on November 9, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/11/09/news/jordan.php Al Qaeda claims responsibility for Amman blasts]&quot;, [[Associated Press]]/''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', 10 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks that narrowly missed the [[USS Kearsarge (LHD-3)|USS ''Kearsarge'']] and the [[USS Ashland (LSD-48)|USS ''Ashland'']] in Jordan, and which also targeted the city of [[Eilat]] in [[Israel]], and also for the firing of several rockets into Israel from [[Lebanon]] in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organizations&quot;/&gt;

As of July 2007, this highly controversial strategy proved to be effective in helping to secure the Sunni districts of Baghdad and the other hotspots of central Iraq and to rout out the al-Qaeda-aligned militants.

=== Transformation and attempted resurgency ===

In early 2009, U.S. forces began pulling out of cities across the country, turning over the task of maintaining security to the Iraqi Army, police, and their paramilitary allies. Experts and many Iraqis worried that in the absence of U.S. soldiers, AQI might resurface and attempt mass-casualty attacks to destabilize the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0113/p01s01-wome.html As US withdraws, will Al Qaeda in Iraq find new openings?], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', January 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There was indeed a spike in the number of suicide attacks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0513/p06s01-wome.html Spike in suicide attacks: Is Al Qaeda in Iraq coming back?], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and through mid and late 2009, al-Qaeda in Iraq rebounded in strength and appeared to be launching a concerted effort to cripple the Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/21/AR2009112102009.html Al-Qaeda in Iraq regaining strength], ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During August and October 2009, AQI asserted responsibility for four bombings targeting five government buildings in Baghdad, including attacks that killed 101 [[19 August 2009 Baghdad bombings|at the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance]] in August and 155 [[25 October 2009 Baghdad bombings|at the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works]] in September; these were the deadliest attacks directed at the new government in more than six years of war. These attacks represent a shift from the group's previous efforts to incite sectarian violence, although [[23 April 2009 Iraqi suicide attacks|a series of suicide attacks]] in April targeted mostly Iranian Shia pilgrims, killing 76, and in June a [[20 June 2009 Taza bombing|mosque bombing in Taza]] killed at least 73 Shi'ites from the [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] ethnic minority.

According to the commander of the U.S. forces in Iraq, General [[Ray Odierno]], AQI &quot;has transformed significantly in the last two years. What once was dominated by foreign individuals has now become more and more dominated by Iraqi citizens.&quot; Odierno's comments reinforce accusations by the government of [[Nuri al-Maliki]] that al-Qaeda and ex-[[Ba'ath Party|Ba'athists]] were working together to undermine improved security and sabotage the planned [[Iraqi parliamentary election, 2010|Iraqi parliamentary elections]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLI176502 Al Qaeda in Iraq becoming less foreign-U.S. general], [[Reuters]], Nov 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2010, Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi were both killed in a joint U.S.-Iraqi raid near [[Tikrit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/world/middleeast/20baghdad.html Top Qaeda Leaders in Iraq Reported Killed in Raid], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, 80% of the group's 42 leaders, including recruiters and fincanciers, have been killed or captured with only eight remaining at large, according to Odierno. He said they are cut off from their leaders in [[Pakistan]], and improved intelligence allowed for the successful mission in April that led to the killing of the two AQI top commanders; in addition, the number of attacks and casualty figures in the first five months of 2010 have been the lowest yet since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/world/middleeast/05military.html Qaeda Leaders in Iraq Neutralized, U.S. Says], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/10243585.stm US says 80% of al-Qaeda leaders in Iraq removed], [[BBC News]], 4 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iliKXlauRMdj1Uijz1Zv-WkJ7RUQ Attacks in Iraq down, Al-Qaeda arrests up: US general], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Iraqi forces reported the death of Al-Nasser Lideen Allah Abu Suleiman, the &quot;military leader&quot; of al-Qaeda in Iraq who also served as the Islamic State of Iraq's &quot;War Minister&quot;, killed in the Al Anbar town of [[HÄ«t]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/25/us-iraq-qaeda-idUSTRE71O2J120110225/ Al Qaeda Iraq &quot;war minister&quot; killed in raid] ''[[Reuters]]'', February 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12581313 Al-Qaeda 'military leader' Abu Suleiman killed in Iraq], ''[[BBC News]]'', February 25th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the Islamic State's leader and &quot;emir of Baghdad&quot; [[Huthaifa al-Batawi]], captured during the crackdown after the [[2010 Baghdad church attack]] in which 68 people died, was killed during an attempted prison break after having killed an Iraqi general and several others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8501190/Al-Qaeda-leader-attempts-Baghdad-jailbreak-leaving-18-dead.html|title=Al-Qaeda leader attempts Baghdad jailbreak leaving 18 dead|date=8 May 2011|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/08/uk-iraq-violence-jail-idUKTRE7470HB20110508|title=Al Qaeda leader and 17 others killed in Iraq jail clash|last=Mohammed|first=Muhanad|date=8 May 2011|work=uk.reuters.com|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is currently led by [[Abu Dua]], who was declared a [[Specially Designated Global Terrorist]] on 4 October 2011 by the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] with an announced reward of $10 million for information leading to his capture or death.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.webcitation.org/62HxbVjBF |title= Terrorist Designation of Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri |publisher= United States Department of State |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
