'''Monrovia''' is a city located in the foothills of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  The population was 36,590 at the 2010 census, down from 36,929 at the 2000 census. Monrovia has been used extensively for filming many TV shows, movies and commercials.

==History==
[[Image:Monrovia-1886.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Monrovia, 1886 (Myrtle Ave., looking north).]]
Monrovia is the fourth oldest general law city in Los Angeles County and the [[Los Angeles Basin|L.A. Basin]] (after [[Los Angeles]], [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]). Incorporated in 1887, Monrovia has grown from a sparse community of orange ranches to a residential community of 37,000.

Around 500 BC, a band of Shoshonean-speaking Indians established settlements in what is now the San Gabriel Valley. These native Americans came to be called the GabrieliÃ±o Indians by early Spanish explorers, and are now referred to as the [[Tongva people|Tongva]]. The Tongva were not farmers; they gathered wild seeds, berries, and plants along rivers and in marshlands. Abundant oaks in the Valley, such as [[Coast live oak|Coast Live Oak]] and [[Interior live oak|Interior Live Oak]] provided a staple of the Tongva diet:  [[acorn]] mush made of boiled acorn flour.
[[Image:Monrovia-1892.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Monrovia, 1892 (Myrtle Ave., looking north).]]
In 1769, when all [[California]] was claimed by the [[Spanish monarchy|King of Spain]], Europeans first visited the San Gabriel Valley, including Monrovia.  An expedition from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] passed through en route to [[Monterey Bay]], commanded by [[Gaspar de PortolÃ |Don Gaspar Portola]]. Accompanying Portola were a [[Franciscan]] Father from [[JunÃ­pero Serra|Father Junipero Serra's]] Franciscan order of Mexico, and [[Juan Crespi]], the expedition's diarist. Much of what is known of early California is known only from Crespi's detailed descriptions.

In 1771, the Franciscans established the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcangel]] in the San Gabriel Valley. The mission was a resting point for early California travelers and gathered most of the native Tongva into an agricultural lifestyle. Following the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1839, the mission lands were nationalized.

In 1841, California Governor [[Juan Alvarado]] gave [[Rancho Azusa de Duarte]] to [[Andres Duarte]], a Mexican soldier, and he gave [[Rancho Santa Anita]] to [[Hugo Reid]], a naturalized Mexican citizen of Scottish birth. Monrovia is made of parts of these two ranchos.

In the mid-19th century, most of Rancho Azusa de Duarte was subdivided and sold by Duarte to settle his debts. Some of those parcels would eventually end up as part of the ranch of [[William N. Monroe]], Monrovia's namesake.
[[Image:Monrovia-1903.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Pacific Electric in Monrovia, 1903.]]
Rancho Santa Anita changed hands several times before the famous multimillionaire, silver baron and rancher, [[Elias Jackson Baldwin|E.J. &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin]] acquired it in 1875. That same year his Los Angeles Investment Company began subdividing and selling parcels from many of his ranchos. In 1883, 240 acres (970,000 mÂ²) of Rancho Santa Anita were sold to Monroe for $30,000. Additional parcels of Rancho Santa Anita were sold to Edward F. Spence, [[John Dustin Bicknell|John D. Bicknell]], James F. Crank, and J.F. Falvey.

The completion of the [[Santa Fe Railroad|Santa Fe]] (which would run through Monrovia) and [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroads to Southern California would bring new people looking for homes and investment opportunities. With this in mind, Monroe, Spence, Bicknell, Crank, and Falvey decided to combine their land under the business name of the Monrovia Land and Water Company in 1886. The combined lots formed the Town of Monrovia Subdivision. The original borders of the Town of Monrovia Subdivision were Canyon Blvd. to the east, Walnut Ave. to the south, Magnolia Ave. to the west, and Lime Ave. to the north. The subdivision was then itself quickly subdivided into 600 {{convert|500|ft|m|sing=on}} by {{convert|160|ft|m|sing=on}} lots and sold. Some lucky buyers of these lots turned around and sold them very quickly. Those who chose to hold on to their property saw its value fall to a fraction of its 1886-1887 value.

The town was incorporated in 1887 under the leadership of prohibitionists who wished to control the arrival of an unwelcome saloon. The first order of business for the newly formed government was to pass a tippler's law, prohibiting the sale of alcohol.

In 1903 the Monrovia News was established. In the same year, the [[Pacific Electric]] was opened providing transportation to and from Los Angeles, making it possible for Monrovian homeowners to work in Los Angeles.
[[Image:Monrovia-May-16-1914.jpg|350px|right|thumb|Monrovia, 1914 (Myrtle Ave., looking north).]]
In 1905 [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]] funds became available and with the help of the Board of Trade (forerunner to the [[Chamber of Commerce]]), and the Monrovia Women's Club, a bond issue was passed to purchase the Granite Bank Building to be used as a City Hall, and to acquire property for a public park.  The Granite Building serves as the city hall, fire and police department facilities in 1961 and the fire department in 1974. In 1956, the old [[Carnegie library]] building was torn down and the present library constructed. The library now boasts a book collection of 95,000 volumes.As of March 2007, the city's residents were asked to vote on a new, upgraded library which is ADA-compliant and has twice as much room for books and computer usage as the current one(the measure passed with at least 70% of the vote.).

A [[Council-manager government|city council-manager]] type government was instituted in 1923.

In 1937, Patrick McDonald opened a simple restaurant on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the old Monrovia Airport called &quot;The Airdrome&quot; (hamburgers were ten cents, and all-you-can-drink orange juice was five cents); the restaurant remained there until 1940, when he and his two sons, [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|Maurice and Richard]], moved the entire building {{convert|40|mi|km}} east to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] to the corner of West 14th Street and 1398 North E Street renaming it &quot;[[McDonald's]]&quot;. In 1955, milkshake machine salesman [[Ray Kroc]] made a franchising deal with the McDonald brothers.  In 1961 Kroc purchased the business rights for $2.7 million.  For years after the [[McDonald's Corporation]] claimed the 1955 Des Plaines, Illinois Mcdonald's to be the first (it was the first location franchised through Ray Kroc), and only recently has recognized [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]].  Some though claim Monrovia to be the &quot;real&quot; birthplace, but that's subjective since McDonald's as it was first franchised in 1953 (in Phoenix, Arizona and Downey, California) came into being following the development of the &quot;[[Speedee|Speedee Service System]]&quot; in 1948.

The [[Upton Sinclair House]], home to activist and author [[Upton Sinclair]], is located in Monrovia and is a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In 1995 Monrovia received the [[All America City]] Award from the [[National Civic League]].

Monrovia operates its own Fire &amp; Police Departments led by Fire Chief Christopher Donovan and Chief of Police Roger W. Johnson

[[Monrovia High School]] gained a creditable rating in its early history. The first school in Monrovia was built in 1887. It was located where Monroe School now stands, and housed the entire elementary and high school student body. A new high school on the property now occupied by Clifton Middle School was erected in 1905, and in 1912 was greatly expanded by the addition of new buildings. In 1928 a high school to serve the communities of Monrovia, [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]] and [[Duarte, California|Duarte]] was built. The same structure now serves only Monrovia students, as the elementary and high school district were unified into one district in 1961. The district now has one high school, one continuation school, two middle schools and five elementary schools, and is part of the [[Citrus Community College District]]. There are also three parochial schools in Monrovia.
