[[File:Michael Keating.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Michael Keating, who plays Reverend Stevens]]
'''Reverend Stevens''', played by [[Michael Keating (actor)|Michael Keating]], is a recurring character who is the vicar in Walford. His first appearance was in the episode originally broadcast on 10 January 2005, being introduced by executive producer [[Kate Harwood]], and he has appeared in at least one episode in every year since.

He first appears to discuss [[Freddie Mitchell (EastEnders)|Freddie Mitchell]]'s [[Infant baptism|christening]] with [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) in 2005. Following this he appears to discuss [[Den Watts|Den]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Chrissie Watts]]' ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|vow renewals]], and performs the [[funeral]]s of Neil and Sue Miller, [[Nana Moon]] ([[Hilda Braid]]), [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (entertainer)|Mike Reid]]).

Reverend Stevens occasionally visits [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) to discuss her faith, including following the death of her friend Pauline and Dot's struggle when she takes on the responsibility of caring for a refugee baby. In December 2008 he returns, after Dot donates a substantial amount of money to have the church roof repaired. He feels it is his need to investigate whether Dot has donated from her own life savings but she does not want to make a fuss. 

In March 2009, he arranges plans for [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) [[wedding]] to [[Archie Mitchell|Archie]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]), and also performs [[Amy Mitchell]]'s christening in April and May 2009. In January 2010 he performs Archie's funeral. Reverend Stevens is also seen in March, performing [[Bradley Branning]]'s ([[Charlie Clements]]) funeral. In September, he meets [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]) and [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]) to talk about a christening for Heather's baby [[George Trott|George]], and is confused about Heather and Minty's relationship. The next week he conducts the christening. In October 2010, [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) arranges for him to visit [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) following the death of her son, [[Billie Jackson]] ([[Devon Anderson]]), but Carol gets angry as Billie was not religious.

In October 2011, he performs a funeral of a local man, but Dot's sister, [[Rose Cotton|Rose]] ([[Polly Perkins (singer)|Polly Perkins]]), who works in the doctor's surgery, fears she mistakenly killed the man by misplacing his test results. Reverend Stevens tells her the patient died of a bee sting, and a relieved Rose then flirts with him, much to the chagrin of Dot. A few days later, Dot reveals Rose's colourful past to Reverend Stevens. However, he is intrigued, and he and Rose share a drink at [[The Queen Victoria]] public house, as he wants to know more about her life. At a church social event, the pair become closer, resulting in Reverend Stevens asking for Dot's blessing to date Rose. He, Dot and Rose later attend a Mayoral banquet, and on their return to Walford, they announce that the Olympic torch for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] will be passing through Walford. When Reverend Stevens visits Rose to invite her out, he finds that she has spend the night with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]).

She also prepares legal papers to put Chrissie's name on the deed to [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. Chrissie persuades Den to eventually sign (as a wedding renewal present) thereby making Chrissie co-owner of the pub. Amanda leaves after the [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|vow-renewal ceremony]], urging Chrissie not to go soft on Den.

A few months later, after Den's death, Chrissie is desperate to get full control of the pub (in order to sell it) and asks Amanda for help. Amanda returns to [[Walford]], at which time Chrissie tells her that Den has run off with another woman and is in hiding again. Amanda wants to track him down, but Chrissie convinces her that it will take a long time to find him, and that she cannot stand to live in The Queen Victoria any longer, as Den's children [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] and [[Dennis Rickman|Dennis]] have returned. Amanda is aware of the way Den placed his &quot;princess&quot;, Sharon, above all others (including Chrissie) and is resentful of her presence. In desperation Chrissie forges Den's signature on papers that give her full control of the pub, getting Amanda, after much hesitancy, to sign as the witness. Amanda then leaves Walford, taking the papers to lodge at court and Chrissie puts the pub up for sale.

'''Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Swann''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Mark Wingett]].

Mike is the ex-husband of [[Rosie Miller]], and father of [[Mickey Miller|Mickey]] and [[Dawn Swann|Dawn]]. Mike deserted his family when Dawn was 6 and Mickey was 3.

Dawn tracked her father down and went to live with him in France years later. She invited Mickey to visit, not telling him about Mike. Mickey took [[Gus Smith|Gus]], [[Juley Smith|Juley]], [[Garry Hobbs|Garry]] and [[Rick 'Minty' Peterson|Minty]] with him. Mike exposed Juley as a conman, as he was one himself. He conned Minty out of his life savings and rode off into the sunset. He felt guilty and returned the money to Mickey, and sent Dawn back to [[Walford]] with Mickey, then drove away on the lookout for his next con.

He returned on Christmas Day 2005, turning up on the Millers' doorstep in [[Albert Square]], following the illness of his mother [[List of EastEnders characters (2005)#Nora Swann|Nora Swann]]. He was then persuaded to stay at the Millers' house by his daughter Dawn after he revealed he was penniless and with nowhere to stay. Keith didn't like that Mike was staying and tried to get him out but didn't succeed.

Mike stayed on the Miller's sofa, where [[Darren Miller|Darren]] had hidden a large sum of cash he found. Mike found the cash and stole it, suggesting to Keith that he buy a new sofa as the old one was in poor condition. The old sofa was then burnt on a bonfire and the family believed the money had been destroyed.

Mike eventually found a job as a manager of [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]]'s club Scarlet. After spending some time with Rosie, he admitted he wanted to get back together with her. Rosie too started to realise her feelings for Mike had returned. Mike told her to leave Keith behind and go with him and take Darren and Demi with her too, but Rosie backed out and Mike left the Square on his own, once again abandoning his son and daughter.

After his mother died, Mike returned, and got Dawn involved in a scam to get Nora's money. Nora had left Â£5,000 to Rosie, but Mike got Dawn to pose as Rosie to get the money from Nora's carer, Kitty. Mike had told Dawn that he was going to start a new life in [[Spain]] for himself and Rosie, but in reality he had only booked a one-way ticket to Spain for himself. Dawn, Rosie and Mickey found out at the last minute and Rosie gave the money to Mike on the condition that he never came back.
