The '''Workers National Democratic Party''' (WDP) ({{lang-ar|Ø­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ¹ÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙÙØ·ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¯ÙÙÙØ±Ø§Ø·Ù}}) also ({{lang-ar|Ø­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙØ¹ÙÙ Ø§ÙÙØ·ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¯ÙÙÙØ±Ø§Ø·Ù}})is a [[workers' party|workers' political party]] in [[Egypt]] formed shortly after the [[Egyptian Revolution 2011|Egyptian Revolution]] of 2011.&lt;ref name=empowering&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party name is sometimes translated in English as '''Democratic Workers Party''', '''Democratic Labour Party''' or '''Labour Democratic Party'''.

==History==
The party was initiated by the [[leftist]] front [[Hashd]] and the [[Revolutionary Socialists (Egypt)|Revolutionary Socialists]] (RS) in response to the country's growing [[Strike action|strike]] movement which [[2008 Egyptian general strike|preceded the revolution]]. WDP spokesperson [[Kamal Khalil]] says &quot;Most leftist attempts to form a party include [[Intelligentsia|intellectual]]s as major players and a number of [[Proletariat|worker]]s as members... This party aims at having workers as the main players and leaders of the party joined by a number of intellectuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Politics==
Although the RS have been instrumental in the formation of the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the WDP does not present itself as a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]]. Party officials claim [[socialist revolution]] &quot;is not feasible in the current political environment&quot;, citing the Egyptian [[proletariat|working class]]' &quot;lack of political experience and the underdevelopment of the [[labour movement]]&quot;. They instead advocate the re-[[nationalization]] of industry and more genuine worker democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a self-proclaimed revolutionary party, the WDP cites revolutionary language and theory. For example, on [[May Day]], 2011 - the first May Day after Mubarak - the party chanted &quot;A workersâ revolution against the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|capitalist government]]&quot; while marching to [[Tahrir Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, [[Hossam el-Hamalawy]], a representative of the party, called for &quot;a complete halt to the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] program.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/5/2/headlines/egypt_celebrates_international_workers_day_for_first_time_since_1952 | title=Egypt Celebrates International Workersâ Day for First Time Since 1952 | publisher=Democracy Now | date=2 May 2011 | accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Ahmed Ezzat]], one of the founders of the WDP has admitted &quot;[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s ''[[What Is to Be Done?|What is to be Done]]'' and ''[[April Theses|April Notes]]'' helped shape our strategy, as did [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theories&quot;. Ezzat has also labeled the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] &quot;[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=breathless/&gt;

On 10 May 2011, the WDP agreed to enter into a &quot;socialist front&quot; with four other Egyptian leftist groups called the [[Coalition of Socialist Forces]]. The new grouping includes the [[Revolutionary Socialists]], the [[Egyptian Communist Party]], [[The Socialist Party of Egypt]] and the [[Popular Democratic Alliance Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demands==
The partyâs most important principles are &quot;the respect of all Egyptiansâ religious beliefs and bringing an end to discrimination on the basis of [[religion]], [[Race (classification of humans)|color]] or [[Gender|sex]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-nationalization of industry is one of the WDP's key demands but unlike under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], where the heads of state-owned factories were appointed by the [[President of Egypt|President]], the WDP calls on workers of these factories to appoint their own managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WDP stands for abolishing [[privatization]] and [[monopoly]] policies, and redirecting development plans to benefit &quot;underserved social classes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is also coordinating with other forces to establish a higher [[minimum wage]] for Egyptian workers, the establishment of [[trade union]]s independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], and to improve working conditions in all workplaces. They are also calling for &quot;combating administrative corruption and reevaluating Egyptâs economic ties to [[Israel]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their slogan is &quot;the workers must be united&quot;.&lt;ref name=empowering/&gt;

==Legality==
Under the current [[Political Parties Law]], the WDP may not acquire official recognition, due to the law banning parties forming on a [[Social class|class]] basis. Also, party leaders are required to raise at least [[Egyptian pound|LE]]1 million to publish the names of at least 5000 founders in two widely-circulated [[Daily newspaper|dailies]]. The WDP sees this as the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] way of discriminating against the [[Poverty|poor]] and labour movement: &quot;This shows that the old mentality is still there and that the government is siding with businessmen rather than workers.&quot; The WDP is expected to defy the legislation and launch their party as soon as they recruit at least 10,000 workers and 10,000 farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
