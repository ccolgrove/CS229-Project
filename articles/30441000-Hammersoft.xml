'''Sandpaper''', also known as '''glasspaper'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chambers 20th Century Dictionary]]|editor=E. M. Kirkpatrick|publisher=W &amp; R Chambers Ltd|location=Edinburgh|year=1983|pages=532|isbn=0550102345}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a heavy [[paper]] with [[abrasive]] material attached to its surface.

Sandpaper is part of the &quot;[[coated abrasive]]s&quot; family of abrasive products. It is used to remove small amounts of material from [[surface]]s, either to make them smoother ([[paint]]ing and [[wood finishing]]), to remove a layer of material (e.g. old paint), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (e.g. as a preparation to [[adhesive|gluing]]).

== History ==
The first recorded instance of sandpaper was in 13th century [[China]] when crushed shells, seeds, and sand were bonded to parchment using natural gum. 

[[Shark]] skin was also used as a sandpaper. The rough scales of the [[living fossil]] [[Coelacanth]] are used by the natives of Comoros as sandpaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Ex2Nr3lLzM0C&amp;pg=PA60&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiled and dried, the [[Equisetum hyemale|rough horsetail]] is used in Japan as a traditional polishing material, finer than sandpaper.

Sandpaper was originally known as ''glass paper'', as it used particles of glass. Glass [[frit]] has sharp-edged particles and cuts well, sand grains are smoothed down and did not work well like sandpaper made from glass. Cheap counterfeit sandpaper has long been passed off as true glass paper; Stalker and Parker cautioned against it in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalker &amp; Parker 1688&quot; &gt;{{cite book  |title=A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing |author=Stalker &amp; Parker|origyear=1688|publisher=Tiranti|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Glass paper was manufactured by [[John Oakey]]'s company in [[London]] by 1833, who had developed new adhesive techniques and processes, enabling mass production. A process for making sandpaper was [[patent]]ed in the United States on June 14, 1834 by [[Isaac Fischer]], Jr., of [[Springfield, Vermont]].

In 1921, [[3M]] invented a sandpaper with a waterproof backing, known as ''Wetordry''. This allowed use with water, which would serve as a lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit. Its first application was automotive paint refinishing.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=NxNlGsE7EVwC&amp;pg=PA234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[Image:SCSandpaper.jpg|thumb|320 grit silicon carbide sandpaper, with close-up view.]]

There are many varieties of sandpaper, with variations in the paper or backing, the material used for the grit, grit size, and the bond.

===Backing===
In addition to paper, backing for sandpaper includes cloth ([[cotton]], [[polyester]], [[rayon]]), [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]], and &quot;fibre&quot;, or rubber. Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while [[mylar]] is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;F,&quot; with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y , T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood, so good quality sand paper is much better than low quality sandpaper. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.

===Material===
Materials used for the abrading particles are:
* [[flint]]: no longer commonly used
* [[garnet]]: commonly used in [[woodworking]]
* [[emery (mineral)|emery]]: commonly used to abrade or polish metal
* [[aluminium oxide]]: perhaps most common in widest variety of grits; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood
* [[silicon carbide]]: available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications
* alumina-zirconia: (an aluminium oxideâ[[zirconium oxide]] alloy), used for machine grinding applications
* [[chromium oxide]]: used in extremely fine micron grit ([[micrometre]] level) papers
* [[ceramic aluminum oxide]]: used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.

Sandpaper may be &quot;[[stearate]]d&quot; where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate &quot;[[soap]]&quot; prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper. 

The harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood. The grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than [[granite]].

Later abrading surfaces include long-life stainless steel sanding discs.

===Bonds===
Different adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. [[Animal glue|Hide glue]] is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. Waterproof or '''wet/dry''' sandpapers use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.

Sandpapers can also be '''open coat''', where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper. The wet and dry sandpaper is best used when wet.

===Shapes===
[[File:3M sanding sponge jeh.jpg|thumb|Sanding sponge]]
Sandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:

* sheet: usually 9 by 11&amp;nbsp;inches, but other sizes may be available
* belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different [[belt sander]]s.
* disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) and &quot;hook-and-loop&quot; (similar to [[velcro]]).
* rolls: known as &quot;shag rolls&quot; by many contractors
* sponge: for tight places

==Grit sizes==
Grit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. Several different standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturers' Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) &quot;P&quot; grade. The FEPA system is the same as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 6344|6344]] standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The &quot;ought&quot; system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as &quot;Coarse&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot; and &quot;Fine&quot;, but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.

===Grit size table===
The following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and &quot;P&quot; designations with the average grit size in micrometres (Âµm).
