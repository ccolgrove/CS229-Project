'''LinuxTag''' ([[German language|German]] for &quot;Linux-[[day]]&quot;) is a [[Free Software]] [[computer expo|expo]] with an emphasis on [[Linux]] (but also [[BSD]]), held every summer in [[Germany]]. It is relatively large, claiming that it is the largest expo of this kind in [[Europe]], drawing visitors from many countries.

The LinuxTag slogan is &quot;Where [[.com|.COM]] meets [[.org|.ORG]]&quot;, as it includes both representatives from commercial companies and from [[nonprofit]]/community projects. The latter are given booths, free of charge, in the .org section, as long as there is room.

LinuxTag has also been a sponsor of several other projects, notably of [[Knoppix]], a [[Linux]] [[Live CD]]. Knoppix is often used to showcase software running on Linux on a [[computer]] configured with a different [[operating system]] (usually [[Microsoft Windows]] or [[Mac OS X]]).

LinuxTag is sponsored by various [[Information technology|IT]]-related companies and, at least in some of its iterations, by the [[German government]].

LinuxTag 2007 faced calls for a boycott because it was officially held under the patronage of the German Interior Minister [[Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble]], a member of the conservative [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] party.&lt;ref&gt;slashdot: http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/19/2149231&amp;from=rss&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first LinuxTag took place at the [[University of Kaiserslautern]] in 1996. The event was held there every year until 2000, when it was moved to [[Stuttgart]] for two years. From 2002-2005 it was held in [[Karlsruhe]], and 2006 in [[Wiesbaden]]. Since 2007, LinuxTag has taken place in [[Berlin]]; in 2011 it will be held from 11 to 14 May.
