&quot;'''Duchess'''&quot; is a song by the [[Great Britain|British]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], appearing as the second track on their 1980's album, ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. It peaked at number 46 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Part of the album's &quot;hidden suite&quot; which also included &quot;[[Behind the Lines (Genesis song)|Behind the Lines]]&quot;, &quot;Guide Vocal&quot;, &quot;[[Turn It on Again]]&quot;, &quot;Duke's Travels&quot; and &quot;Duke's End,&quot; the lyrics tell the story of a rise and fall of a diva from the beginning of her career, to her superstardom, to her decline in public opinion. It is the first Genesis song to use a [[Roland CR-78|drum machine]].

The band made a video for the song. It showed [[Phil Collins]], [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] and [[Mike Rutherford]] playing at various points around the Liverpool Empire theatre and watching the Duchess perform her songs, Collins nodding his head in approval. The drum machine used in the song ([[Roland CR-78]]) is shown at the beginning of the video.
