'''Systems Technology Institute (STI) College''' is the largest network of for-profit [[information technology]]-based colleges in the [[Philippines]]. This [[private school|private]] [[university system|college system]] offers a [[curriculum]] including [[business studies]], [[computer science]], [[education]], [[engineering]] and [[health care]].

STI uses a trimestral [[Academic term|calendar]] as opposed to the typical semestral [[college|collegiate]] [[education]] program mostly used by Philippine universities.

STI has branches all over the Philippines and claims to be the second largest IT-based educational institution in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sti.edu STI Colleges and Education Centers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, STI obtained a majority share in De los Santos College to create the [[DLS-STI College]] of Health Professions. In 2006, they acquired a stake in the De Los Santos Medical Center, now known as De Los Santos - STI Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sti.edu/pr.asp?id=65 |title=STI, De los Santos hospital merge   |accessdate=2008-03-29 |date=[[March 2006|2006-03]] |format= |work= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109121502/http://www.sti.edu/pr.asp?id=65 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
STI was organized in 1983, when entrepreneurs Augusto C. Lagman, Herman T. Gamboa, Benjamin A. Santos and Edgar H. Sarte set up the Systems Technology Institute to train people in programming and IT. At first there were two schools, and now there are more than 100.

Programs include: information and communications technology, engineering, health care, business &amp; management, hospitality and tourism management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sti.edu/programs.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

But started last 2006, the acronym of STI is no longer the meaning as Systems Technology Institute because it is not only the school of Technology and Sciences but with Health, Arts, Managements, Businesses, Hospitality and Culinary school. It is only STI College without meaning but the school for learning students. But still in this present, IT and CS courses is the largest population in this school.
