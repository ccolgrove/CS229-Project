'''Montana Public Radio''' is a network of [[public radio]] stations serving the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]], primarily the western part of the state.  The network is currently owned by the [[University of Montana]], and its studios are located on the university campus in [[Missoula]], with a satellite facility in [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]].  The network is affiliated with [[National Public Radio]]. Programming originates from flagship station [[KUFM (FM)|KUFM]] (89.1 FM) in [[Missoula, Montana]].  

==History==
Montana Public Radio began in 1965 when KUFM in Missoula signed on as a 10-watt [[campus radio]] station.  In 1974, it became a charter member of [[National Public Radio]].  

Starting in the late 1970s, it began building translators across western Montana.  Its first full-power satellite, in Great Falls, signed on in 1984.  In 1999, a signal extension project funded mostly by a federal grant made it possible to sign on new stations in Kalispell and Hamilton and upgrade translators in Butte and Helena to full-power stations.

==Satellites and repeaters==
Montana Public Radio consists of six full-power stations:
