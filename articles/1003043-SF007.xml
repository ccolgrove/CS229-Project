'''Java 3D''' is a [[scene graph]]-based [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[application programming interface]] (API) for the [[Java (software platform)|Java platform]]. It runs atop either [[OpenGL]] or [[Direct3D]]. Since version 1.2, Java 3D has been developed under the [[Java Community Process]].

Compared to other solutions, Java 3D is not only a [[Primitive wrapper class|wrapper]] around these graphics APIs, but an interface that encapsulates the graphics programming using a true [[object-oriented]] approach. Here a scene is constructed using a [[scene graph]] that is a representation of the objects that have to be shown. This scene graph is structured as a tree containing several elements that are necessary to display the objects. Additionally, Java 3D offers extensive [[3D audio effect|spatialized sound]] support.

Java 3D and its documentation are available for download separately. They are not part of the [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK).

== History ==

[[Intel]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Apple Computer|Apple]], and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] all had [[retained mode]] [[scene graph]] APIs under development in 1996. Since they all wanted to make a Java version, they decided to collaborate in making it. That project became Java 3D. Development was underway already in 1997. A public beta version was released in March 1998. The first version was released in December 1998. From mid-2003 through summer 2004, the development of Java 3D was discontinued. In the summer of 2004, Java 3D was released as a [[community source]] project, and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] and volunteers have since been continuing its development.

On January 29, 2008, it was announced that improvements to Java 3D would be put on hold to produce a 3D scene graph for [[JavaFX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since February 28, 2008, the entire Java 3D source code is released under the [[GPL#Version_2|GPL version 2]] license with [[GPL linking exception]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]] (multiple screen projectors)
* [[3D audio effect|3D spatial sound]]
* Programmable shaders, supporting both [[GLSL]] and [[Cg programming language|CG]]
* [[Stencil buffer]]
* Importers for most mainstream formats, like [[.3ds|3DS]], [[Wavefront .obj file|OBJ]], [[VRML]], [[X3D]], [[NWN]], and [[OpenFlight|FLT]]

== Competing technologies ==

Java 3D is not the only high-level API option to render 3D in Java. In part due to the pause in development during 2003 and 2004, several competing Java scene graph technologies emerged:

'''General purpose:'''
* [[AgentFX]]
* [[3DzzD]], software and hardware 3D engine
* [http://www.strata.com Strata Live 3D(tm)]
* [http://standard3d.com Standard3D Stereoscopic Browser Application platform]

'''Gaming:'''
* [[Ardor3D]]
* [[Xith3d|Xith3D]]
* [[jMonkey Engine]]
* Espresso3D

'''Visualization:'''
* [[Aviatrix3D]]
* [[JView]]
* [http://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/jreality/ Jreality].

In addition to those, many other C or C++ scene graph APIs offer Java support through [[Java Native Interface|JNI]].

At a lower level, the [[JOGL]] (JSR 231) OpenGL bindings for Java are a popular alternative to scene graph APIs such as Java 3D. [[Lightweight Java Game Library|LWJGL]] is another such binding.
