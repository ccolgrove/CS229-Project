'''Arachne''' is a full-screen [[Internet suite]] containing a graphical [[web browser]], [[email client]], and dialer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rakitin&quot;&gt;Rakitin, Jason &quot;[http://www.networkworld.com/news/1997/1027browser2.html Review: Alternative Web browsers]&quot; [[Network World]], October 27, 1997 {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It primarily runs on [[DOS]] based operating systems, but includes builds for [[Linux]] as well,&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/sec508/htm/browsers.htm Section 508 Alternative Browsers]&quot; [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]&lt;/ref&gt; but should not be used with [[X server|X]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glennmcc.org/aralinux/ Arachne GPL 1.95;GPL WWW Browser]&lt;/ref&gt; Arachne was originally created by Michal&lt;!-- no typo --&gt; PolÃ¡k (under the label xChaos software, later renamed to Arachne Labs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arachne.cz Arachne Labs]&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language and compiled using [[Borland]] C++ 3.1 compiler, but since been released under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] as '''Arachne GPL'''.

==Background==
Arachne is currently the most advanced graphical web browser available for DOS as it supports many file formats, protocols and standards. It is also capable of displaying between [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] 640Ã200, two colors and [[VESA]] 1024Ã768, high color modes (65536 Colors). Arachne is designed for systems which do not have any [[windowing system]]s installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stutz&quot;&gt;Stutz, Michael &quot;[http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1997/06/4293 Czech Browser Won't Do Windows]&quot; [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], June 6, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Arachne has image support for [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[BMP file format|BMP]] and [[animated GIF]]. It contains a subset of [[HTML]] 4.0 and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] 1.0, including full support for tables and frames.&lt;ref name=&quot;freedos&quot; /&gt; [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[NNTP]] for [[USENET]] forums, [[POP3]], and [[SMTP]] are a few protocols which Arachne can handle. Arachne includes a full-fledged TCP/IP connection suite, which has support for some dial-up and Ethernet connections. However, Arachne currently has no support for [[JavaScript]],&lt;ref name=&quot;net fusion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Rakitin|first=Jason|title=Review: Alternative Web browsers|url=http://www.nwfusion.com/news/1997/1027browser2.html|publisher=Network World Fusion|accessdate=26 July 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011005005015/www.nwfusion.com/news/1997/1027browser2.html|archivedate=5October 2001|date=27 Oktober 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&lt;ref name=&quot;net fusion&quot; /&gt; and [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]. Arachne can also be expanded with the use of addons for such tasks as watching [[DivX]] movies, playing [[MP3]] files, [[IRC]] chat, [[RSS]], and viewing [[PDF]] documents.

The first release of Arachne with a known release date was 1.0 Beta 2 which came out 22 December 1996. The final official version by Arachne Labs was 1.70R3 for DOS (released 22 January 2001) and 1.66 beta for Linux (released 20 July 2000). While there have been several DOS versions&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedos.pri.ee/files/net/arachne/ Arachne file archive] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linux development lay dormant until May 24, 2008 when a (still beta) version, 1.93, for Linux&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.glennmcc.org/aralinux/|title= Arachne v1.93;GPL for Linux|accessdate= 2008-07-02|author= Glenn McCorkle|year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; branch was released.

==Support==
Arachne supports a limited subset of stylesheets and HTML. Known support as of version 1.93, GPL:&lt;ref name=&quot;freedos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedos.org/freedos/news/technote/235.html|title=Arachne HTML support|date=2008-07-10|work=[[FreeDos]]|accessdate=2008-11-26| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61DfwDhIa | archivedate = 2011-08-26| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivatives==
[[File:Embrowser custom.png|thumb|Embrowser]]
xChaos software licensed full source code of Arachne to [[Caldera UK]] in 1997.  People from Caldera UK added Novell's dialer and TCP/IP stack, animated GIFs, printing on a multitude of printers, JavaScript (beta), completely changed the design of the browser (customizable), implemented their own support for frames, and succeeded in compiling it as a 32-bit protected mode extended DOS application (utilizing [[DPMI]] using [[DJGPP]], GNU compiler for DOS),&lt;ref name=&quot;ArachneFAQ&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050302181238/http://home.arachne.cz/arachne-faq.html#3 Is Arachne the same program as Caldera Webspyder?]&quot; Arachne Frequently Asked Questions &lt;/ref&gt; while Arachne is a 16-bit application at the moment. This program was sold as '''DR-WebSpyder'''; the name was to associate it with [[DR-DOS]], which Caldera owned at the time. Later, when [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] had transferred DR-DOS to its branch company [[Caldera Thin Clients]], which became [[Lineo]], the browser was renamed '''Lineo EmBrowser'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartcomputing.com/Editorial/article.asp%3Farticle%3Darticles/archive/l0602/37l02/37l02.asp%26guid%3D www.smartcomputing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
