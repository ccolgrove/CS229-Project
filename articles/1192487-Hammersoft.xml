<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="1192487" ns="0" title="Dioceses of the Episcopal Church"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">[[Episcopal Church (United States)|The Episcopal Church]] is governed by a General Convention and consists of 100 [[diocese]]s in the [[United States]] proper, plus ten dioceses in other countries or outlying U.S. territories and the [[Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe]], which is similar to a diocese.

Each is led by a [[bishop]]. A diocese includes all the [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]] within its borders, which usually correspond to a [[U.S. state|state]] or a portion of a state. Some dioceses includes portions of more than one state. For example the [[Episcopal Diocese of Washington|Diocese of Washington]] includes [[Washington, D.C.]] and part of [[Maryland]].

The naming convention for the domestic dioceses, for the most part, is after the state in which they are located or a portion of that state (for example, [[Episcopal Diocese of Northern Michigan|Northern Michigan]] or [[Episcopal Diocese of West Texas|West Texas]]). 

Usually (though not always), in a state where there is more than one diocese, the area where the Episcopal Church (or [[Church of England]] before the [[American Revolution]]) started in that state is the diocese that bears the name of that state. For example, the Church of England's first outpost in what is now [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], hence the [[Episcopal Diocese of Georgia|Diocese of Georgia]] is based in Savannah. 

There are, however, many dioceses named for their see city or another city in the diocese. A few are named for a river, island, valley or other geographical feature. The list below includes the [[Episcopal see|see]] city in parentheses if different from the name of the diocese or unclear from its name. 

The see city usually has a [[cathedral]], often the oldest parish in that city, but some dioceses do not have a cathedral. The dioceses of Iowa and Minnesota each have two cathedrals. Occasionally the diocesan offices and the cathedral are in separate cities.

The dioceses are grouped into nine [[Ecclesiastical province|province]]s, the first eight of which, for the most part, correspond to regions of the [[United States|U.S.]] Province IX is composed of dioceses in [[Latin America]]. Province II and Province VIII also include dioceses outside of the U.S.
