The '''Copa del Rey  1911''' was the 9th staging of the [[Copa del Rey]]. 

The competition started on April 9, 1911 and concluded on April 15, 1911 with the Final, held at the [[Estadio Jolaseta]] in [[Getxo]], in which [[Athletic Bilbao]] lifted the trophy for the 5th time ever with a 3â1 victory over [[RCD Espanyol|CD EspaÃ±ol]].
This Tournament should had been 13 teams, but 3 teams withdrew, and another 3 teams withdrew during the competition.

==Controversies==
[[Deportivo de La CoruÃ±a|RC Deportivo de la CoruÃ±a]] and Academia de Ingenieros withdrew the competition before it started. They were against fielding foreign players in the teams. During the tournament, there were more protests and withdrew threats of some teams. After the first round match between [[Athletic de Bilbao]] and [[Real Club Fortuna de Vigo|Fortuna Vigo]], Real Sociedad de FÃºtbol contested the match, claiming illegal lineup of two English players in Athletic de Bilbao. The Football Federation rejected the claim and Real Sociedad withdrew immediately. The rest of teams supported Real Sociedad and threatened to withdrew. Finally, Athletic decided not to lineup those players in their matches, but refused to replay the match against Fortuna.
