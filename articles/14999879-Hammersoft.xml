The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Indianapolis Colts]] [[Indianapolis Colts seasons|season]]''' was the 56th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and the 25th in Indianapolis.  It was the first season since [[2002 Indianapolis Colts season|2002]] that the Colts did not win the [[AFC South]] title.  However, after a 3â4 start on the season [[Peyton Manning]] led the Colts to a nine-game winning streak, a 12â4 record, and a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] berth in the playoffs.  The Colts' season came to an end in [[Qualcomm Stadium|San Diego]] when they were upset in their wild-card round playoff game against the [[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]].

The 2008 season was the Colts' inaugural season playing at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] after playing at the [[RCA Dome]] for 24 seasons. This marks [[Tony Dungy]]'s 7th season as [[head coach]], and [[Peyton Manning]]'s 11th season as the starting quarterback.  As a result of his play over the final two months of the regular season, Manning was awarded his third [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award.

When the Colts won their seventh straight game in Week 15, they became the only team in the history of the NFL to have seven consecutive wins in five consecutive seasons.  With their regular season record of 12â4, they became the only team in NFL history to have twelve wins in six consecutive seasons.

Coming off their home win over the Lions, the Colts flew to [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]] for a Week 16 AFC South rematch with the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on Thursday night.  Indianapolis trailed early in the first quarter as Jaguars [[David Garrard]] completed a 28-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Dennis Northcutt]].  In the second quarter, the Colts' deficit increased to 14 points as Garrard scored on a 2-yard touchdown run.  Indianapolis responded with quarterback [[Peyton Manning]]'s 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Reggie Wayne]]. The Colts had an opportunity to cut the Jacksonville lead to 4, but [[Adam Vinatieri]] missed a 30-yard field goal. The scoreless Colts possession left 1:03 on the clock, enough time to enable Jacksonville to close out the half with a 44-yard field goal from kicker [[Josh Scobee]].

The Colts would hack at the Jaguars' lead in the third quarter with Manning's 10-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Dominic Rhodes]], yet Jacksonville answered with running back [[Montell Owens]] to take a 24â14 lead. In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis took the lead on the following scores: Manning's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Dallas Clark]], kicker Adam Vinatieri's 45-yard field goal, and defensive back [[Keiwan Ratliff]]'s 35-yard interception return for a touchdown.  The Jaguars would get a late-game drive into Colts' territory, yet defensive end [[Dwight Freeney]] delivered the game-winning sack, preserving Indianapolis' slim lead.

With the win, not only did the Colts improve to 11â4, but they also clinched the AFC's No.&amp;nbsp;5 seed.  They also gave head coach [[Tony Dungy]] his 10th-straight playoff appearance (an NFL record).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2008/12/19/colts-lock-up-no-5-seed-in-afc/ |title= Dungy sets NFL record as Colts secure spot | publisher = NFL.com |accessdate=2008-12-19 |date=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
