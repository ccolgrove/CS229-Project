It was originally developed as '''NaviPress''' by the company [[NaviSoft]] before being bought by AOL. It was discontinued in 2000. However, the last version (2.0) can still be found on some websites. The HTML code used is very outdated and may not display more recent websites.  It does not support [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and this limits its support on many websites where the new PNG format has been adopted.

It actively pushed AOL's [[PrimeHost]] service.
