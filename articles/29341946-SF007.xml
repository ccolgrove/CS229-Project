Hacking{{dubious|date=September 2011}} has expanded from applying strictly to computers to consumer electronics in general.  Hacking provides users with the ability to customize and modify their devices.  The most notable case of the hacking of consumer electronics is the jailbreaking of Apple iOS devices, although many other electronics such as videogame consoles{{cn|date=September 2011}} are regularly hacked as well.

==Devices Meant for Hacking==
Some devicesâmost commonly open sourceâare built for homebrew purposes, and encourage hacking as an integral part of their existence.

*[[Pandora (console)]]
*[[Chumby]]
*[[Android Dev Phone 1]]

==Legality==
[[iOS jailbreaking]] was often considered illegal in the United States until a recent ruling by the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] declaring that jailbreaking an iPhone or other mobile device would no longer violate copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=German |first=Kent |url=http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20011824-85.html |title=On Call: Go ahead and jailbreak, it's legal now &amp;#124; Dialed In&amp;nbsp;â CNET Blogs |publisher=Cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, simultaneously, there is ongoing prosecution against hackers of videogame consoles under [[anti-circumvention]] violations of the [[DMCA]]. A main complication in many cases is the profiting from selling jailbroken or rooted equipment as a value-added service. At least some accused deny these charges and claim only to be making back-ups of legally purchased games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/games/famed-xbox-hacker-wants-to-testify-in-xbox-360-modders-dmca-trial-20101022/ |title=Famed Xbox hacker wants to testify in Xbox 360 modder's DMCA trial&amp;nbsp;â Video Games Reviews, Cheats |publisher=Geek.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/game-console-jailbreaking-arrest/ |title=Student Arrested for Jailbreaking Game Consoles&amp;nbsp;â Update &amp;#124; Threat Level |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] encryption system, which encrypts data running between cable boxes, [[Blu-ray]] players, and other similar devices and displays was cracked, and a copy of the master key needed to decrypt HDCP protected streams was posted on the internet.  [[Intel]], which created and now licenses HDCP technology has stated that HDCP protection is sufficient to keep most users from circumventing it, but indicated that it may threaten legal action against more determined users under the [[DMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/09/intel-confirms-the-hdcp-key-is-real-can-now-be-broken-at-will.ars |title=Intel confirms HDCP key is real, can now be broken at will |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of the hacking of its new interactive game controller the [[Kinect]], Microsoft initially condemned and threatened legal action against those who hacked it, but soon after it reversed this position and instead stated that it had intentionally left the device open, and would in fact not prosecute those who modified it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy |first=David |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2373107,00.asp |title=Microsoft: We Left Kinect's USB Port Unprotected on Purpose |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2010-11-20 |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
