Issue number one consisted of 100 pages (including covers) and in its North American edition had a cover price of US$15.99 and [[Canadian Dollar|Cdn$]]17.99.&lt;ref name=&quot;UUIssueOne&quot;&gt;Linux New Media AG: ''Ubuntu User Issue 1'' May 2009. ISSN 2040-8080&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue also includes an Ubuntu [[live CD]] in the form of a [[DVD]] that new users can use to try out Ubuntu or to install it.&lt;ref name=&quot;UUHome&quot; /&gt;

==Reception==
In announcing the launch of the magazine, the company said:

{{cquote|Ubuntu User is the first print magazine for users of the popular Ubuntu computer operating system. The power, style, and simplicity of Ubuntu is winning followers around the world. Ubuntu User offers reviews, community news, HowTo articles, and troubleshooting tips for readers who are excited about Ubuntu and want to learn more about the Ubuntu environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;UUHome&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ubuntu-user.com/|title = Ubuntu User home page|accessdate = 2009-06-06|last = Linux New Media AG |authorlink = |year = 2009|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[DistroWatch]] questioned the wisdom of launching a new paper magazine at this point in history:

{{cquote|In a time where more and more information is moving out of the paper world and into the online realm, one publisher is bucking the trend by releasing a physical magazine...With so much high quality information available online, would you pay for a monthly paper magazine about your favourite distribution?&lt;ref name=&quot;DistroWatch&quot; /&gt; }}

Linux reviewer Ken Hess gave the first issue a very positive reception, saying:

{{cquote|I'm hoping for a long and happy life for Ubuntu User magazine and I think it's something we've needed for some time now...So, just when you thought print media was but a faint memory, these folks launch a new print mag just for us Ubuntuers. I applaud them for it. Thanks Linux New Media, I give Ubuntu User two thumbs up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess07Jul09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry4501.html#|title = Ubuntu User, You Have Some Big Issues. |accessdate = 2009-07-08|last = Hess|first = Ken|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = July}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
