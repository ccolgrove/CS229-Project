'''GIMP''' ('''GNU Image Manipulation Program''') is a free software [[raster graphics editor]]. It is primarily employed as an image retouching and editing tool&lt;ref name=&quot;what-is-gimp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional|last=Peck|first=Akkana|coauthors=Inc NetLibrary|year=2006|publisher=Physica-Verlag |isbn=1430201355|page=1|accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is freely available in versions tailored for most popular operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux.

In addition to detailed image retouching and free-form drawing, GIMP can accomplish essential image editing tasks such as resizing, editing, and cropping photos, photomontages combining multiple images, and converting between different image formats. GIMP can also be used to create animated images in many formats such as GIF and MPEG through the Animation Plugin.

GIMP's product vision is that GIMP is a free software high-end graphics application for the editing and creation of original images, icons, graphical elements of web pages and art for user interface elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GIMP UI Redesign|url=http://gui.gimp.org/index.php/GIMP_UI_Redesign|date=17 May 2008|work=GIMP UI redesign|publisher=GIMP UI team|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|GIMP release history}}
[[File:Gimp-2.6.0.png|thumb|left|300px|GIMP 2.6 manipulating an image |300px]]
GIMP originally stood for the ''General Image Manipulation Program''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIMP0.54-README&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/historical/gimp-0.54.1.fixed.tar.gz|title=readme|accessdate=2008-03-23|author=Spencer Kimball &amp; Peter Mattis|date=1996-02-11|format=tarred and gzipped text, see README}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIMP's original creators, [[Spencer Kimball]] and [[Peter Mattis]], began developing GIMP in 1995 as a semester-long project at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The first public release of GIMP (0.54) was made in January 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;gimp-prehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=GIMP - Prehistory - before GIMP 0.54|url=http://gimp.org/about/prehistory.html|date=1995-07-29|work=GIMP history|publisher=Peter Mattis|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ancient-history&quot;&gt;[http://gimp.org/about/ancient_history.html GIMP - ancient history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 GIMP became a part of the [[GNU Project]], and the acronym GIMP was changed to the ''GNU'' Image Manipulation Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#Gimp GIMP - Documentation]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently GIMP is maintained and enhanced by a group of volunteers under the auspices of the [[GNOME| GNOME Project]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=GNOME: The Free Software Desktop Project |url=http://www.gnome.org/ |date=2005-2009 |work=gnome.org |publisher=The GNOME Project |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gnome-hosting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

GIMP was originally created for [[UNIX]] systems; GNU/Linux, SGI [[IRIX]] and [[HP-UX]] were supported in the first release.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIMP0.54-README&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;why-win32&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/why.html |title=why port to windows}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first release GIMP was rapidly adopted and a community emerged consisting of users who created tutorials, artwork and shared techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;gimp-community&quot;&gt;
{{cite book |title=Grokking the GIMP |last=Bunks |first=Carey |year=2000 |publisher=New Riders |isbn=0735709246 |page=14|url=http://gimp-savvy.com/BOOK/index.html |accessdate=8 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Since the initial release, GIMP has been ported to many operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]; the original port to the Windows 32-bit platform was started by Finnish programmer Tor Lillqvist (tml) in 1997 and was supported in the GIMP 1.1 release.&lt;ref name=&quot;why-win32&quot; /&gt;

GIMP has used three graphical user interface (GUI) [[List of toolkits|toolkits]] since its inception; GIMP originally used [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] on the first public release (0.54). Eventually, Peter Mattis became disenchanted with Motif and developed his own GUI toolkit named the GIMP toolkit ([[GTK+|GTK]]); GTK had successfully replaced Motif in the 0.60 release of GIMP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancient-history&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19990417052141/http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-01/lw-01-gimp.html LinuxWorld&amp;nbsp;â Where did Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis go?]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally GTK was re-written to be [[object oriented]] and was renamed GTK+; this was first visible in GIMP 0.99. &lt;!-- section summarized from gimp release history --&gt;

==User interface==
[[File:Gimp 2.4.3.png|thumb|GIMP, version 2.4.3. GIMP is [[Free software|freely distributed software]].]]

GIMP uses multiple [[Window (computing)|windows]] to contain all of GIMPS' functionality, including opening each image in a separate window. By default tools and tool settings and other dialogues are on the right. GIMPs dialogues are re-arrangeable and by default less commonly used dialogues are not shown.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIMP-Windows&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The standard windows of GIMP |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-concepts-main-windows.html |work=GIMP User Manual |publisher=The GIMP Documentation Team |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This windowing format has been criticised and users have been vocal about GIMPS' interface,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://blogs.gnome.org/bolsh/2006/09/18/the-gimp-usability/ |title=The GIMP usability |accessdate = 2007-07-29 |author=Dave Neary |date=18 September 2006
|work=Safe as Milk blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; this has led the maintainers of GIMP to oversee the formation of a usability team and the redesign of GIMPs UI to provide a Single Window mode to be released in GIMP 2.8.

In order to construct its interface GIMP uses the [[GTK+|GIMP tool kit]] (GTK+). GTK+ was designed to replace [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]], a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] toolkit upon which GIMP depended. Originally GTK+ was a part of the GIMP source tree, but has since been made into a standalone library. While originally being designed to run on [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, GIMP and GTK+ have been ported to Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], and other operating systems.

===GIMP usability team===
GIMP contributors signed up to join the [[OpenUsability]] project.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=Ellen Reitmayr |title=2007 Success Stories |url=http://www.openusability.org/index.php/2008/01/2007-success-stories/ |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=openusability.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then a dedicated usability team has been established to guide the future of the GIMP interface. A user interface brainstorming group was created for GIMP,&lt;ref name=&quot;usability-team&quot;&gt;
{{cite web |author=GIMP usability team |title=GIMP UI Redesign |url=http://gui.gimp.org/index.php/GIMP_UI_Redesign#team |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=GIMP usability team |title=GIMP UI brainstorm |url=http://gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com/ |publisher=gimp-brainstorm.blogspot.com |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where users of GIMP can send in their suggestions as to how they think the GIMP user interface could be improved.

===Single window===
GIMP 2.8 is planned to be released capable of single-window and multiple window modes, with single window mode being default.&lt;ref&gt;http://gui.gimp.org/index.php/Single-window_mode_specification&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=Peter Sikking |coauthors=river-valley.tv |title=GIMP: a new simple interface for a complex application |url=http://river-valley.tv/gimp-a-new-simple-interface-for-a-complex-application/ |year=2008 |work=Libre Graphics Meetings recordings |publisher=river-valley.tv |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are presently over a dozen other types of dialog used by GIMP at different times, and users typically open them when needed and close them afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;GIMP-Windows&quot;/&gt;

==Media attention==
As a popular application, GIMP is regularly reviewed. The reviews often examine the fitness of GIMP for use in professional environments; as such GIMP is often cited as a replacement for [[Adobe Photoshop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-2.6&quot;&gt;
{{cite web |title=GIMP 2.6 released, one step closer to taking on Photoshop |url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/10/gimp-2-6-released-one-step-closer-to-taking-on-photoshop.ars |date=1 October 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |author=Ryan Paul |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Even though comparisons to Photoshop are of regular occurrence, the maintainers of GIMP state that GIMP does not aim to replicate Photoshop.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=GIMP Developers Conference 2006 |url=http://developer.gimp.org/gimpcon/2006/index.html#vision |year=2006 |publisher=the GIMP project |accessdate=2 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

GIMP 2.6 has been reviewed twice by [[Ars Technica]]. In the first review, Ryan Paul noted that GIMP provides &quot;Photoshop-like capabilities and offers a broad feature set that has made it popular with amateur artists and open source fans. Although GIMP is generally not regarded as a sufficient replacement for high-end commercial tools, it is beginning to gain some acceptance in the pro market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-2.6&quot; /&gt; While previously it had been recognized that GIMP had extensive capabilities, few reviewers have cited GIMP as a tool used in professional environments.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Dave Girard also reviewed GIMP 2.6, specifically with the aim of testing GIMP's fitness for professional tasks. He noted at the beginning that GIMP was a high-end tool, but the review conclusion noted that although many of GIMP's tools were of high quality, he felt that it lacked in some areas such as [[non-destructive editing]], tools such as a saturation brush.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
{{See|Comparison of raster graphics editors}}
[[File:Gimp brushes.png|thumb |Brushes dialogue in [[GNOME]]]]
Tools used to perform [[image editing]] can be accessed via the toolbox, through menus and dialogue windows. They include filters and brushes, as well as transformation, selection, [[Layers (digital image editing)|layer]] and masking tools.

; ''Color''
: GIMP has several ways of selecting colors including palettes, color choosers and using an eyedropper tool to select a color on the canvas. The built-in color choosers include [[RGB color model|RGB]]/[[HSV color space|HSV]] selector or scales, water-color selector, [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] selector and a color-wheel selector. Colors can also be selected using hexadecimal color codes as used in HTML color selection. GIMP has native support for indexed color and [[RGB]] color spaces; other color spaces are supported using decomposition where each channel of the new color space becomes a black and white image. CMYK, [[Lab color space|LAB]] and [[HSL and HSV|HSV]] ([[hue]], [[colorfulness|saturation]], [[Value (colorimetry)|value]]) are supported this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yoshinori Yamakawa|title=Separate+ |url=http://cue.yellowmagic.info/softwares/separate.html |date=6 January 2007 |publisher=cue.yellowmagic.info |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The GIMP documentation team |title=Decompose |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/plug-in-decompose-registered.html|work=GIMP user manual |publisher=docs.gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color blending can be achieved using the blend tool, by applying a [[Image gradient|gradient]] to the surface of an image and using GIMP's color modes. Gradients are also integrated into tools such as the brush tool, when the user paints this way the output color slowly changes. There are a number of default gradients included with GIMP; a user can also create custom gradients with tools provided.
; ''Selections and paths''
: In GIMP, tools for creation of [[selection (user interface)|selection]]s include a rectangular and circular selection tool, free select tool, and fuzzy select tool (also known as magic wand). More advanced selection tools include the select by color tool for selecting contiguous regions of color and the scissors select tool which creates selections semi-automatically between areas of highly contrasting colors. GIMP also supports a quick mask mode where a user can use a brush to paint the area of a selection.  Visibly this looks like a red colored overlay being added or removed. The foreground select tool is an implementation of [[Simple Interactive Object Extraction]] (SIOX) a method used to perform the extraction of foreground elements, such as a person or a tree in focus. The Paths Tool allows a user to create vectors (also known as [[BÃ©zier curve]]s). Paths can be used to create complex selections around natural curves, paths can also be named, saved, and painted (or &quot;stroked&quot;) with brushes, patterns, or various line styles.
; ''[[Image editing]]''
: There are many tools that can be used for editing images in GIMP. The more common tools include a paint brush, pencil, airbrush, eraser and ink tools used to create new or blended pixels. Tools such as the bucket fill and blend tools are used to change large regions of space in an image and can be used to help blend images. GIMP also has a selection of smart tools, which are tools that use a more complex algorithm to enable a user to do things that otherwise would be time consuming or impossible; these smart tools include the clone tool that copies pixels using a brush, the healing brush which copies pixels from an area and corrects the tone and color where it is being used. The perspective clone tool works in a similar way to the clone tool previously mentioned but also allows a user to correct for distance changes. The blur and sharpen tool is a brush that blurs and sharpens. Finally, the dodge and burn tool is a brush that makes target pixels lighter (dodges) or darker (burns).&lt;br /&gt;A list of GIMP transform tools include the align tool, move, crop, rotate, scale, shear, perspective and flit tools.
[[File:Layers Channels Paths.gif|thumb |Animation showing three docked and tabbed dialogs: layers, channels, and paths.]]

; ''[[Layers (digital image editing)|Layers]], layer masks and channels''
: An image being edited in GIMP can consist of many [[Layers (digital image editing)|layers]] sitting in a stack. The GIMP users' manual suggests that &quot;A good way to visualize a GIMP image is as a stack of transparencies,&quot; where in GIMP terminology, each transparency is a layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Introduction to layers |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-image-combining.html#gimp-concepts-layers |work=GIMP user manual |publisher=docs.gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each layer in an image is made up of several channels. In an [[RGB]] image there are normally 3 or 4 channels, each consisting of a red, green and blue channel. Color sublayers look like slightly different gray images, but when put together they make a complete image. The fourth channel that may be part of a layer is the [[alpha channel]] (or layer mask), this channel measures opacity where a whole or part of an image can be completely visible, partially visible or invisible.

:Text layers can be created using the text tool, allowing a user to write on an image. Text layers can be transformed in several ways, such as converting them to a path or selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Paths and Text |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/ch07s05s05.html |work=GIMP manual |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=GIMP documentation team |title=Text and Fonts |url=http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-concepts-text.html |work=GIMP manual |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gimp-architecture.png|right|thumb|GIMP architecture]]
; ''Automation, scripts and plug-ins''
: GIMP has approximately 150 standard effects and filters, including Drop Shadow, Blur, Motion Blur and Noise.&lt;br /&gt;GIMP operations can be automated with [[scripting language]]s. The Script-Fu is a [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] based [[extension language]] implemented using [[TinyScheme]]. GIMP can also be scripted in [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (Python-fu), or [[Tcl]]. New features can be added to GIMP not only by changing program code (GIMP core), but also by creating plug-ins. These are external programs that are executed and controlled by the main GIMP program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.84.7715 Earl Oliver, Jaime Ruiz, Steven She, and Jun Wang, The Software Architecture of the GIMP, December 2006. ]&lt;/ref&gt; MathMap is an example of a plug-in written in C.

[[File:Generated_Flames_-_Gimp.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Rendering_(computer_graphics)|rendered]] flame using the flame plug-in]]

: GIMP has support for several methods of sharpening and blurring images including the blur and sharpen tool. The [[Unsharp masking#Digital unsharp masking|unsharp mask]] tool is used to sharpen an image selectively&amp;nbsp;â it only sharpens areas of an image that are sufficiently detailed. The Unsharp Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sharpening - Unsharp Mask |url=http://www.scantips.com/simple6.html |publisher=www.scantips.com |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unsharp Mask |url=http://manual.gimp.org/en/plug-in-unsharp-mask.html |date=2002, 2003&lt;!--, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 --&gt;|work=GIMP manual |publisher=manual.gimp.org |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.

; ''GEGL''
: The ''[[GEGL|Generic Graphics Library]]'' (''GEGL'') was first introduced as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release, GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit-depth color operations; because of this less information is lost when performing color operations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=GIMP development team |title=GIMP 2.6 Release Notes |url=http://gimp.org/release-notes/gimp-2.6.html |publisher=gimp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; When fully integrated, GEGL will allow GIMP to have a higher color bit depth and also a better non-destructive work-flow.

; ''File formats''
: GIMP supports importing and exporting with a large number of different [[file format]]s,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=File formats supported by the GIMP |url=http://www.gimphelp.org/formats.shtml |year=2007 |publisher=gimphelp.org |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIMP's native format [[XCF (file format)|XCF]] is designed to store all information GIMP can contain about an image; XCF is named after the e''X''perimental ''C''omputing ''F''acility where GIMP was authored.

 !File formats

 |-
 !Import and export
 |GIMP has import and export support for image formats such as [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], along with the file formats of several other applications such as [[Autodesk]] flic animations, [[Corel Paint Shop Pro]] images, and Adobe Photoshop documents. Other formats with read/write support include [[PostScript]] documents, [[X Window system|X]] bitmap image and Zsoft [[PCX]]. GIMP can also read and write path information from [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] files and read/write [[ICO (icon image file format)|ICO]] Windows icon files.

 |-
 !Import only
 |GIMP can import Adobe [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents and the [[raw image format]]s used by many [[digital camera]]s, but cannot save to these formats. An open source plug-in, [[UFRaw]], adds full raw compatibility, and has been noted for being quicker than Adobe in updating for new camera models, several times.

 |-
 !Export only
 |GIMP can export to [[Multiple-image Network Graphics|MNG]] layered image files (GNU/Linux version only) and [[HTML]] (as a table with colored cells), [[C (programming language)|C]] source code files (as an array) and [[ASCII art|ASCII Art]] (using a plug-in to represent images with characters and punctuation making up images), though it cannot read these formats.

==Derived applications==
[[File:gimp 2.2.8 Mac.png|thumb|300px|GIMP 2.2.8 running under [[X11.app|X11]] on [[Mac OS X]]]]
Several variations and derived graphic applications exist today. These applications can exist because GIMP is released under the [[GNU General Public License]], GPL, which specifically allows anybody to take the [[source code]] and use it as they see fit, so long as they follow the rules laid out in the license. GIMP is available on many popular operating systems; even so, some variants of GIMP exist for OS-specific modifications.

The GIMP website only offers source code downloads; executable versions of GIMP are made available by other sources.

; ''[[CinePaint]]''
: Formerly &quot;Film Gimp&quot;, this is a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of GIMP version 1.0.4, used for frame-by-frame retouching of feature film. The present version supports up to 32-bit IEEE-floating point [[color depth]] per channel. CinePaint supports color management and [[high dynamic range imaging|HDR]]. CinePaint is used primarily within the [[film industry]] due mainly to its support of high-fidelity image formats.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The current release supports [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X.

: has a similar aim to GIMPshop, but has been made using a more recent version of GIMP.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=zenith |title=GimPhoto - free Photoshop alternative for photo and image editor |url=http://www.gimphoto.com/ |publisher=gimphoto.com |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; GimPhoto is targeted toward photographers who have previously used Adobe Photoshop. It is available for both Microsoft Windows and GNU/Linux.
; ''[[GIMPshop]]''
: is a derivative of GIMP that re-arranges the user interface to mimic [[Adobe Photoshop]]. This is achieved by modifying menus and user interface items. GIMPshop is released on Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]].  The project is stagnant and has not been updated since 2006.
; ''[[Instrumented GIMP|Instrumented GIMP (ingimp)]]''
: was created at the [[University of Waterloo]] to track and report user interaction with the program to generate statistics about how GIMP is used.
; ''osx-gimp''
: provides a [[Macintosh|Mac]] [[PowerPC]]-native beta build of GIMP 2.2.14. It uses GTK+ built for Quartz. It is mostly functional, but support is limited for the Quartz back-end of GTK+.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
; ''[[Seashore (software)|Seashore]]''
: is a program derived from GIMP running in native Mac OS X. The program is currently in beta and includes a subset of the tools and features in GIMP.

===Extensions===
; ''GIMP Animation Package'' (''GAP'')
: is an advanced plug-in for GIMP for creating animations, extending GIMP's normal capabilities. GAP can save animations in several formats including [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] and AVI.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=Jakub Steiner |title=Advanced Animations Tutorial |url=http://www.gimp.org/tutorials/Advanced_Animations/ |work=GIMP user manual |publisher=the GIMP documentation team |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The animation function relies on GIMP's layering capability. Animations are created by placing each image on its own layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), then placing and rotating the layers within time constraints. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, timing, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.
; ''GIMP Paint Studio'' (''GPS'')
: is a collection of brushes and accompanying tool presets for GIMP aimed at artists and graphic designers. It speeds up repetitive tasks and allows tool settings to be saved between sessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gps-google-code&quot;&gt;
{{cite web |author=christophe|title=GIMP + GPS (gimp paint studio) |url=http://code.google.com/p/gps-gimp-paint-studio/ |publisher=code.google.com |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mascot==
[[File:GIMPLogo.png|thumb|Wilber, the [[mascot]] of GIMP]]
The official [[mascot]] of GIMP, &quot;Wilber&quot;, was created by Tuomas Kuosmanen (''tigert'') at some point before 25 September 1997; since then Wilber has received additional accessories from other GIMP developers.&lt;ref name=&quot;gimp-linking&quot;&gt;
[http://www.gimp.org/about/linking.html GIMP - linking to us]. For Wilber kit see &lt;code&gt;/docs/Wilber_Construction_Kit.xcf.gz&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Accessories for Wilber can be found in the ''Wilber construction kit'', included with the GIMP source code.&lt;ref name=&quot;gimp-linking&quot; /&gt;

Wilber is also used as a free software cultural reference outside of GIMP, for example Wilber can be played as a racing car driver in ''[[SuperTuxKart]]'' along with other free software cultural icons&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac.softpedia.com/progChangelog/SuperTuxKart-Changelog-24037.html SuperTuxKart changelog, see 0.6]&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as in [[WarMUX]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wormux.org/phpboost/gallery/gallery-4+avatars.php Gallery of WarMUX characters, which features Wilbur]&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to being referenced  in other software projects, Wilber has been shown on the side of the [[BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France]] as part of [[Project Blinkenlights]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://web.archive.org/web/20070929112000/http://blinkenlights.de/images/arcade/live/live-arcade-wilber-quai-large.jpg Wilber] on the [[BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
GIMP is primarily developed by volunteers.  The GIMP project has a development branch, unstable branches and stable branches. New features are added to the development branch of GIMP, when the developers decide that there are enough new features they begin the process of creating a release. The process starts off by creating an unstable branch from the development branch; this unstable branch will be stabilized and will receive bug-fixes until it is ready to replace the existing stable branch. GIMP has adopted a scheme also used by many other [[free and open source software|FOSS]] projects: the second number in a version (for example, the &quot;6&quot; in 2.6.11) denotes whether a GIMP release is stable or unstable.  An odd number means an unstable version and an even number means a stable version. The final number represents the number of bug-fix releases after a stable or unstable branch is released. {{As of|2010|10}}, the current stable version of GIMP is 2.6.11.

Each year GIMP applies for several positions in the [[Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC),&lt;ref name=&quot;gimp-gsoc&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2009 there have been 9 GSoC projects that have been listed as successful,&lt;ref name=&quot;gimp-gsoc&quot; /&gt; although not all successful projects have been merged into GIMP yet. The healing brush and perspective clone tools and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] bindings were created as part of the 2006 GSoC and can be used in the current version of GIMP, although there were three other projects that were completed and are not yet available in a stable version of GIMP; those projects being Vector Layers, and a [[JPEG 2000]] plug-in. Several projects were completed in 2008, but none are yet a part of a stable release of GIMP.

===Libre Graphics Meetings===
{{Main|Libre Graphics Meeting}}
The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is a yearly event where developers of GIMP and other projects meet up to discuss issues related to free and open source graphics software. The GIMP developers take the opportunity to hold [[Birds of a Feather (computing)|birds of a feather]] (BOF) sessions at this event.

===Distribution===
GIMP is released under the [[GNU General Public License]] (version two or later) as [[free software]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |title=GNU General Public License
 |url=http://www.gimp.org/about/COPYING
 |date=June 1991
 |work=license
 |publisher=Free Software Foundation
 |accessdate=2009-06-29
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The current version of GIMP works with numerous operating systems, including [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]] and Microsoft Windows. Many GNU/Linux distributions include GIMP as a part of their desktop operating systems, including [[Debian]]  and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]. Due to file size constraints, [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] no longer includes GIMP by default as of Ubuntu 10.04, but it remains available for installation via the package manager.

A port of GIMP to Microsoft Windows was started by Tor Lillqvist in 1997. The GIMP website links to binary installers compiled by Jernej SimonÄiÄ for the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GIMP - Windows installers |url=http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/ |publisher=The gimp-win project |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MacPorts]] is listed as the recommended provider of recent Mac builds of GIMP.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=GIMP for Mac OS X |url=http://www.gimp.org/macintosh/ GIMP download/Macintosh |date=2001-2009 |publisher=GIMP Project |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; MacPorts also provides builds of other [[free and open source software]] applications and provides tools to make doing so simpler.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=The MacPorts Project -- Home |url=http://www.macports.org/ |date=2002â2009 |publisher=MacPorts |accessdate=2 July 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; GTK+ was originally designed to run on an X11 server.  Because Mac OS X can optionally use an X11 server, porting GIMP to Mac OS X is simpler compared to creating a Windows port.

There is no stable 64-bit Windows distribution version of GIMP available as of March 2011, although there have been experimental 64-bit versions like GIMP 2.6.10 for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GIMP 2.6.10 for Win64 |url=http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/stable.html |date=2011-03-06 |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
