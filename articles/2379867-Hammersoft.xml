&quot;'''Sign o' the Times'''&quot; (also stylized as &quot;'''Sign ââ®â the Times'''&quot;) is the lead single off [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s 1987 [[Sign o' the Times (album)|album of the same name]]. The song is a holdover from both the ''[[Dream Factory (album)|Dream Factory]]'' and ''[[Crystal Ball (unreleased album)|Crystal Ball]]'' projects, promoted to the title track of the 1987 release. Prince performs the entire track except for some backing vocals by then-girlfriend [[Susannah Melvoin]]. &quot;Sign o' the Times&quot; was written on a Sunday, when Prince usually wrote his most introspective songs. The song proved popular upon release, topping the [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&amp;B]] chart, and reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked &quot;Sign o' the Times&quot; #299 on their list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

==Composition and arrangement==
The song was constructed by Prince almost entirely on the [[Fairlight synthesizer|Fairlight]] sampling synthesizer, which provides the primary keyboard riff and sampled electronic bass sounds heard on the track. Unlike some artists, Prince did not program new sounds for this song. He simply used the stock sounds the Fairlight offered, including the famed &quot;orchestra hit&quot;  towards the end of the composition. The single marked a shift from those pulled from the ''[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]'' and ''[[Around the World in a Day]]'' albums, with a spare, electronic-based arrangement, simple drum machine hits and minimal stacked synth patterns, as well as a bluesy, funk-rock guitar part (cut from the single edit of the song). The record was noticeably bluesier and more downcast (both melodically and lyrically) than any of Prince's previous singles, addressing various socio-political problems including AIDS, gang violence, natural disasters, poverty, drug abuse, the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] and impending nuclear holocaust.

==Artwork==
* The [[Single (music)|single]]'s cover features new band member [[Cat Glover]] posing with a large heart covering her face, and on the back of the cover, posing with Prince's guitar.

==B-side==
The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] was the funk-oriented &quot;La, La, La, He, He, Hee&quot;. The song was written as a rejoinder to [[Sheena Easton]]. The track features vocal samples morphed into drumbeats not dissimilar to that of a dog barking. The lyrics refer to a dog's affair with a cat with playful sexuality. Part of the refrain was used briefly in the song &quot;I Wanna Melt with U&quot;, from the ''[[Love Symbol Album|Love Symbol]]'' album.
