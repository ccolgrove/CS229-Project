'''''Chuck E. Cheese's''''' (formerly '''Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre''' and '''Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza''') is a chain of [[Family Entertainment Center|family entertainment center]]s. Chuck E. Cheese's is the main brand of CEC Entertainment, Inc., ({{nyse|CEC}}) with its headquarters in [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;investor&quot;/&gt;

The concept is a sit-down [[pizza]] restaurant, complemented by [[arcade game]]s, [[amusement ride]]s, an [[audio-Animatronics|animatronic]] show, and other diversions, such as climbing equipment, tubes, and slides â all mainly directed at younger children.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;/&gt; The brand is represented by Chuck E. Cheese, an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[mouse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entertainment|url=http://www.chuckecheese.com/the-experience/entertainment.php|work=Chuck E. Cheese's Official Site|publisher=CEC Entertainment, Inc|format=PHP|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded as Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre by [[Nolan Bushnell]] in 1977, officially being labeled as the first family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;/&gt; Pizza Time Theatre and [[Showbiz Pizza Place]] merged in 1984, bringing both concepts under the wing of Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 1991/2, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. unified the two brands into Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;cu&quot;/&gt; In 1994, Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza underwent a redesign, changing to Chuck E. Cheese's by 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. was renamed to CEC Entertainment, Inc.', removing any mention of Showbiz Pizza Place, Inc., the company that CEC Entertainment, Inc. started as.&lt;ref name=&quot;investor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 2007, the company celebrated its 30th anniversary,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; and as of May 2009, it operates 542 restaurants.&lt;ref name=&quot;investor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;financial&quot;/&gt;

==Corporate history==
Chuck E. Cheese's, originally referred to as Chuck E. Cheeseâs Pizza Time Theatre, was founded by [[Atari]] founder [[Nolan Bushnell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;/&gt; Bushnellâs experience in the amusement park industry, as well as his fondness of [[The Walt Disney Company]], was influential in the conceptualization of the Pizza Time Theatre concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pizza Time's Vaudeville Theatre|newspaper=Western Foodservice|date=1979-03|format=PDF|url=http://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/cec/ptt_79foodservice.pdf|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first location opened in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California in 1977, and was labeled as the first family restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;/&gt; In November 1978, Bushnell left Atari to purchase the Pizza Time Theatre concept from Atari's then-corporate parent, [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

===Franchising===
As the restaurant became increasingly successful, he began to franchise, resulting in a co-development agreement between Bushnell and [[Robert L. Brock|Robert Brock]] of Topeka Inn Management in 1979. The agreement handed Brock exclusive franchising rights for opening Pizza Time Theatres in sixteen states across the southern and midwestern [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; while also forming a company subdivision, &quot;Pizza Show Biz&quot;, to develop the Pizza Time Theatres.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt;

===Showbiz Pizza Place Inc.===
In November 1979, Brock met Aaron Fechter of [[Creative Engineering, Inc.]] Concerned that Fechterâs animatronics would be too strong a competition for Bushnellâs work, Brock requested that Bushnell release him from the co-development agreement, citing misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; In December 1979, Brock and Fechter formed âShowbiz Pizza Place Incâ, severing Brock's business relationship with Bushnell.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

[[File:Chuckepizza.jpg|thumb|right|A Chuck E. Cheese's facility under the now defunct title of &quot;Chuck E Cheese's Pizza&quot;.]]
Upon the opening of Showbiz Pizza Place, Bushnell sued Brock and Topeka Inn Management over breach of contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; Brock immediately issued a counter-suit against Bushnell, citing misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; The court case began in March 1980, eventually settling out of court; with Showbiz agreeing to pay Pizza Time Theatre a portion of its profits over the following decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; During this period, Topeka Inn Management also changes its name to Brock Hotel Corporation and moved its headquarters to [[Irving, Texas|Irving]], Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; Both restaurants experienced increased success as the video game industry became more robust;&lt;ref name=&quot;brock&quot;/&gt; and to maintain competition, both franchises continually modified and diversified their animatronic shows.

===Merger===
In 1981, Pizza Time Theatre went public; however, the evolving video game industry resulted in significant losses for Pizza Time Theatre; losing $15 million in 1983, and by 1984, Bushnellâs debts were insurmountable, resulting in the filing of [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] for Pizza Time Theatre Inc. Showbiz then bought the floundering company, recreating itself as Showbiz Pizza Time Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; 

===Restructuring===
After the merger, both restaurants continued operating under the different titles, while major financial restructuring had begun,&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; eventually becoming publicly traded in 1989, with sales increasing by 8.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;investor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; During this period, Creative Engineering began to sever ties with Showbiz Pizza Time (they officially left the company in September 1990), eventually resulting in the unification of its mixed characters. By 1992, all restaurants assumed the name of Chuck E. Cheeseâs Pizza.&lt;ref name=&quot;cu&quot;/&gt; However, the name was changed to Chuck E. Cheese's in 1994 during a redesigning of the concept.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; In 1998, the company renamed itself '''CEC Entertainment, Inc.''',&lt;ref name=&quot;investor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; and in 1999, bought out competitor ''[[Discovery Zone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Products==
===Menu items===
While its primary focus is [[pizza]], Chuck E. Cheese's also offers [[sandwiches]], [[hot dogs]], wings, side dishes and desserts. Some stores are also used as &quot;test&quot; locations which feature new Chuck E. Cheese foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutritional Information|url=http://www.chuckecheese.com/menu/nutritional-information.pdf|work=Chuck E.

===Arcade===
From the time of the company's formation to today, one of the main draws for the stores is the [[Video arcade|arcade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;investor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fsm&quot;/&gt; The arcade games primarily consist of either [[redemption game]]s or [[Arcade game|video arcade games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Games &amp; Rides|url=http://www.chuckecheese.com/the-experience/games-rides.php|work=Chuck E. Cheese's Official Site|publisher=CEC Entertainment, Inc|format=PHP|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Currency====
The brass [[Token coin|tokens]] issued by the company for use in their arcades exist in numerous varieties and are collected by [[exonumia]] enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Chuck E. Cheese Tokens| work = Forrest's Token Page
  | url = http://users.pullman.com/fjstevens/tokens/cec/CEC.html
  | accessdate = 2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is currently testing a card access method for use with their arcade/skill games; where locations will no longer use tokens, and instead use a refillable card to access credits (tokens) and points (tickets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is currently in the testing phase in Irving, Texas, along with nine other locations in the United States.

===Animatronic figures===
Along with the arcade, the other main draw for the stores is its animatronic show. From the time of the company's formation through the mid-1990s, the company's animated characters were a main draw for the stores. More recently, less attention has been placed on animatronics. There are several different styles of animatronic shows in use within the company, depending on when the store opened, whether it was renovated, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When the first location opened in 1977, the animatronic characters were featured in framed portraits (no longer used) hanging on the walls of the main dining area. The show had Crusty the cat (first character to face retirement), Pasqually the singing chef, Jasper T. Jowls and the star of the show, Chuck E. Cheese. In 1978, Crusty was retired and soon replaced with Mr. Munch (the purple pizza eater).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Beginning in 1998, the company's show installed into new stores, referred to as &quot;Studio C&quot;, consists of a single animated Chuck E. Cheese character alongside large television monitors, lighting effects, and interactive elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
