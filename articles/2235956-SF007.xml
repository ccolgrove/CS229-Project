'''Xming''' is an [[porting|implementation]] of the [[X Window System]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems, including [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows Vista]] &lt;ref name=&quot;linuxcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/118106|title=Use Linux over Windows with Xming|publisher=Linux.com|author=Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier|date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;novell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tip/18137.html|title=Xming - A X Server for Windows|publisher=Novell|author=David Mair|date=2006-11-22|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Xming provides the X Window System display server, a set of traditional sample X applications and tools, and a set of fonts. It features support of several languages and has [[Mesa 3D]], [[OpenGL]], and [[GLX]] [[3D Computer Graphics|3D graphics extensions]]&lt;ref name=&quot;linuxcom&quot; /&gt; capabilities.

The Xming X server is based on the [[X.Org Server]]. It is cross-compiled on [[Linux]] with the [[MinGW]] compiler suite and the Pthreads-Win32 multi-threading library. XMing runs natively on Windows and does not need any third-party emulation software.

Xming may be used with implementations of [[Secure Shell]] (SSH) to securely forward X11 sessions from other computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;novell&quot; /&gt; It supports [[PuTTY]] and ''ssh.exe'', and comes with a version of PuTTY's plink.exe. The Xming project also offers a portable version of PuTTY.

The software has been recommended by authors of books on free software when a free X server is needed,&lt;ref&gt;Van Vugt 2009:273&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrido 2007:366&lt;/ref&gt; and described as simple&lt;ref&gt;Iskander 2007:41&lt;/ref&gt; and easier to install though less configurable than other popular free choices like [[Cygwin/X]].&lt;ref&gt;Peckar 2008:182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==

Xming was previously distributed with a series of [[software license]]s which included statements construed by reviewers as indicating that distribution was permitted under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License (GPL)]], but which set further restrictions. The [[Free Software Foundation]] stated to one such reviewer that such distribution was a violation of the terms of the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blue-gnu.biz/content/fsf_confirms_xming_restrictions_not_allowed|title=FSF Confirms Xming Restrictions Not Allowed|publisher=Blue-gnu.biz|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2011-01-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430161402/http://blue-gnu.biz/content/fsf_confirms_xming_restrictions_not_allowed|archivedate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xming license was later altered to remove the reference to the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blue-gnu.biz/content/blue_gnu_wrong_about_xming_xming_no_longer_gpl |title=Blue GNU Wrong About Xming - Xming No Longer GPL|publisher=Blue-gnu.biz |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2010-08-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071222033943/http://blue-gnu.biz/content/blue_gnu_wrong_about_xming_xming_no_longer_gpl|archivedate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
