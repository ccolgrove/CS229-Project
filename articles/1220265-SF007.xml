'''MacWeb''' was an early [[Mac OS]]-only [[web browser]] for [[68k]] and [[PowerPC]] [[Apple Macintosh]] computers, developed by [[TradeWave]] (formerly EINet) between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=December|first1=John|year=1994|last2=Randall|first2=Neil|page=234ff.|title=World Wide Web Unleashed|publisher=Sams Publishing|accessdate=23 January 2011|ISBN=0672306174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacWeb's major attraction was its ability to run well on low-end hardware footprints as well as fast (but simple) page display. This compactness led to MacWeb's inclusion on many &quot;Internet starter kit&quot; [[floppy disk]]s that were popular at the time. TradeWave also developed a similar [[Microsoft Windows]] browser named [[WinWeb]]. However, they were eclipsed by more full-featured competitors such as [[Netscape Navigator]], and development was eventually abandoned.

==Versions==
The first public release was 0.98-alpha on May 31, 1994, and the final official release was version 2.0 in 1996. An unofficial &quot;2.0c&quot; patch was released by Antoine HÃ©bert in 1998 to correct a problem on old machines not supporting color [[QuickDraw]].

Although Morgan (1995) states that MacWeb was the second web browser released for the Macintosh, this is not quite true. The [[MacWWW]] browser became available in 1992 and the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser was released for the Mac in 1993.

==Features==
MacWeb contained many useful features:
*support for [[HTML forms]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot; /&gt;
*[[Bookmark (World Wide Web)|bookmarks]] with import tool for Mosaic's bookmarks&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot; /&gt;
*a [[HTML]] viewer&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot; /&gt;

==System requirements==
MacWeb has the following system requirements:
&lt;!--* '''[[Processor]]:''' [[Intel 80386|80386]](386SX) at 16Mhz or better--&gt;
* '''[[Operating System]]:''' [[Mac OS]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot; /&gt;
* '''[[RAM]]:''' less than 700 [[Kilobytes|KB]] RAM&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwunleashed&quot; /&gt;
* '''[[Hard disk drive|HDD]]:''' 680 KB
