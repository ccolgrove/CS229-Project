The 1941 Longhorns were the first [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorn]] football team to reach #1 in the [[AP Poll]]. They were crowned [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|National Champions]] by four different rating systems: Clyde Berryman, James Howell, Loren Maxwell, and the Williamson System.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/texas/all_national_champs.php&lt;/ref&gt; None of these rating system's however were deemed major rating systems by the NCAA. Therefore, the 1941 National Championship is not officially recognized by the NCAA or the [[The University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].
