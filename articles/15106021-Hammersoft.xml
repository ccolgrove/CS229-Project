'''The 2006''' edition to the Meineke Car Care Bowl featured the [[United States Naval Academy|Navy Midshipmen]], and the [[Boston College|Boston College Eagles]]. The game was played on Saturday, December 30, 2006 at 1:00 PM EST.

Boston College got on the board first following a 2 yard touchdown run by quarterback [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]]. The extra point failed, and Boston College led 6-0. Navy quarterback, [[Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada]], known as a running quarterback, surprised BC by throwing a 31 yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Tyree Barnes]], to put Navy on top 7-6. 

In the second quarter, Navy used its powerful option running attack, and [[Zerbin Singleton]] plowed 5 yards for a touchdown to increase Navy's lead to 14-6. Running back [[Brian Toal]] answered for Boston College with a 1 yard touchdown run to make it 14-13. Kaheaku-Enhada once again threw a touchdown pass, this one covering 24 yards to [[Jason Tomlinson]] to increase Navy's lead to 21-13. With no time left in the half, kicker [[Steve Aponavicius]] drilled a 26 yard field goal, to cut the lead to 21-16.

In the third quarter, Navy was poised to score a touchdown, but BC's defense held strong, and forced a field goal. [[Matthew Harmon]] connected on the 22 yard field goal to extend Navy's lead to 24-16. With 7:36 left in the fourth quarter, Matt Ryan found tight end [[Ryan Purvis]] for a 25 yard touchdown pass. The 2 point conversion attempt failed, and Navy still led 24-22.

Navy had the ball, with 1:43 left in the game, and Boston College had no time outs left. On the next play, [[Reggie Campbell]] fumbled an option pitch, that was recovered by BC's [[Jolonn Dunbar]] at the Navy 40 yard line. Matt Ryan threw a 16 yard pass to Ryan Purvis to get BC into field goal range. Steve Aponavicius drilled a 37 yard field goal as time expired to give Boston College the 25-24 win. The win extended BC's streak of consecutive bowl wins to 7.
