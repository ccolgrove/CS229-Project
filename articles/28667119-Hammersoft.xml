The '''Gay Nigger Association of America''' (often referred to as the '''GNAA''') is an anti-[[blogging]] [[Internet trolling]] organization that takes their name from the 1992 Danish movie ''[[Gayniggers from Outer Space]]''. They have trolled several prominent websites and Internet commentators, including members of the [[blogosphere]], [[Slashdot]], [[Wikipedia]], and [[CNN]]. They have also released software products and leaked information about operating systems. In addition, they maintain a wiki-based site dedicated to Internet commentary in a style parodying Slashdot posts and offer a [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]]-based software repository containing various GNAA coding projects.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | title = FreeNode, allarme sicurezza | date = 2006-06-28 | url = http://punto-informatico.it/1544690/PI/News/freenode-allarme-sicurezza.aspx | work = PuntoInformatico | accessdate = 2011-08-26 | language = Italian | quote = Qualcuno ipotizza che la GNAA, un gruppo di buontemponi nato su Slashdot e dedito allo spamming, abbia firmato questo assalto.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the GNAA also founded [[Goatse Security]], a [[grey hat]] information security group. Members of Goatse Security released information in June 2010 about a vulnerability located on [[AT&amp;T]]'s website that notably affected the privacy of people who pre-ordered the [[iPad]]. After the information was released, the then-president of the GNAA, [[weev]], and GNAA member &quot;JacksonBrown&quot; were arrested.

==Origins and purpose==
The group claims to have been founded in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt; Little is known about the group's structure. New media researcher [[Andrew Lih]] has claimed that it is unclear whether there was initially a clearly defined group of GNAA members, or if founding members of the GNAA were online troublemakers united under the name in order to disrupt websites.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobodies&quot; /&gt;

The group's name has been controversial, having been described as causing &quot;immediate alarm in anyone with a semblance of good taste&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;nobodies&quot; /&gt; and as being &quot;spectacularly offensive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman&quot; /&gt; However, the group claims that it promotes neither racism nor homophobia. GNAA members deny allegations of actual racism, implying that these statements are made only to elicit angry responses and to subvert or otherwise challenge long-standing social [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], and note that the name of the organization came from the 1992 Danish satirical [[blaxploitation]] film ''Gayniggers from Outer Space''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLS&quot; /&gt;

==Trolling==
The GNAA uses several methods of trolling. One method involves flooding weblogs with a massive amount of repeated words and phrases, referred to as &quot;crapflooding&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GLS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scotsman&quot; /&gt; They have also produced shock sites containing [[malware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GLS&quot; /&gt; One such site, &quot;Last Measure&quot;, contained malware that opened up pop-up windows containing shocking pictures.&lt;ref name=&quot;porndotcom&quot; /&gt; On Wikipedia, members of the group created a page about themselves, while adhering to every rule of Wikipedia in order to use the system against itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;nobodies&quot; /&gt;

They have also attacked several [[Internet Relay Chat]] channels using [[Internet Relay Chat flood|IRC flooding]]. GNAA used an old but obscure method to force users of the [[Freenode]] network to execute disruptive commands after visiting websites containing malware.&lt;ref name=&quot;ffbug&quot; /&gt; They also have used bugs in [[Firefox]] to crapflood IRC channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;netwerk&quot; /&gt; They have also performed [[proof of concept]] demonstrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obamabug&quot; /&gt; These actions have occasionally interrupted the normal operation of popular websites such as Slashdot, even forcing some websites (such as [[4chan]]) to shut down temporarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;4chan&quot; /&gt;

In [[July 2004]], two GNAA members submitted leaked [[screenshot]]s of the forthcoming [[operating system]] [[Mac OS X v10.4]] to the popular [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] news website [[MacRumors]], which read &quot;With [[Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]] just days away, the first Tiger information and screenshots appears to have been leaked.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | title = Wie typisch | date = 06/28/2004 | url = http://www.macnews.de/software/wie-typisch-39507 | work = macnews.de | accessdate = 2011-08-26 | quote = Die Screenshots stammten allesamt aus einer Quelle: Einer merkwÃ¼rdigen Anti-Slashdot-Organisation namens GNAA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sources, Apple will reportedly provide developers with a Mac OS X 10.4 preview copy at WWDC on Monday. The screenshots provided reportedly come from this upcoming developer preview.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;macrumors-tiger&quot; /&gt; Later, when accusations were raised that the images were fabricated, the GNAA released a press release which claimed that the screenshots were genuine and stated that they had &quot;trolled&quot; the Apple community.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnaatiger&quot; /&gt;

In [[June 2005]], the GNAA claimed to have created a [[Mac OS X]] Tiger release for [[Intel x86]] processors which caught media attention from various sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;macdailynews&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wild&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmac&quot; /&gt; The next day, the supposed leak and was mentioned on the [[G4 (television)|G4]] show ''[[Attack of the Show!|Attack of the Show]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aots&quot; /&gt; The DVD image released via [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] merely booted an image of [[Goatse|hello.jpg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rubygoldmine&quot; /&gt; instead of the leaked operating system as many were led to believe.&lt;ref name=&quot;bandwagon&quot; /&gt;

On February 3, 2007, the GNAA successfully convinced CNN reporter [[Paula Zahn]] that &quot;one in three Americans&quot; believe the [[September 11, 2001]] terror attacks were carried out by Israeli agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN3&quot; /&gt; CNN subsequently ran a story, erroneously reporting this, including screenshots of the GNAA-owned website &quot;jewsdidwtc.com.&quot; The story involved a round-table discussion regarding antisemitism and an interview with the father of a Jewish 9/11 victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2&quot; /&gt; The GNAA-owned website included claims that &quot;over 4,000&quot; Jews were absent from work at the World Trade Center on 9/11.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2&quot; /&gt;

==Goatse Security==
[[File:Goatse Security Logo.png|thumb|Goatse Security logo]]
{{Main|Goatse Security}}
Several members of the GNAA with expertise in grey-hat&lt;ref name=&quot;ipadsec&quot; /&gt; security research began releasing information about security vulnerabilities under the name &quot;Goatse Security.&quot; They chose a new name to publish their work under because they were worried that their work would not get noticed if published by the &quot;Gay Nigger Association of America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytech&quot; /&gt;

In June 2010, Goatse Security attracted mainstream media attention for their disclosure of 114,000 [[email address]]es&lt;ref name=&quot;npripad&quot; /&gt; registered to Apple iPad devices for early adopters of Apple's 3G iPad service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sapo&quot; /&gt; The data was aggregated from AT&amp;T's own servers by feeding a publicly available script with [[HTTP request]]s containing randomly generated [[ICC-ID]]s, which would then return the associated email address. The [[FBI]] soon investigated the incident. This investigation led to the arrest of then-GNAA President,&lt;ref name=&quot;courtcase&quot; /&gt; Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer, on unrelated [[Drug possession|drug charges]]&lt;ref name=&quot;assassination&quot; /&gt; resulting from an FBI search of his house.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytech&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnetdrugs&quot; /&gt;

The comment on my blog was a minor instance of their more extensive disruptive practices (like &quot;crapflooding&quot; a site with a massive amount of text or data with no meaning or relevance: for example, a word, phrase, or group of letters repeated over and over, or producing hoax or shock sites and inserting links or code that redirect viewers to the site). }}
