'''''We Change the World, Vol. 1''''' is an album by [[Melinda Caroll]], released in 1997. It is the first in a series of albums for Girl Scouts called 'Girl Scouts Greatest Hits'. It chronicles the very best and favorite of Girl Scout songs, many recorded for the very first time.

With over 70 minutes of music, this collection offers eighteen songs for every Girl Scout, featuring &quot;We Change the World&quot;, &quot;Kum Ba Yah&quot;, &quot;On My Honor&quot;, and &quot;Peace of the River&quot;. The album closes with the recording debut of the new song, &quot;Juliette&quot;, which honors Juliette Gordon Low, founder of Girl Scouts of the USA.
