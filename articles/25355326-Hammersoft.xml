The '''[[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]]â[[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]] rivalry''' is primarily a football rivalry between two [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] schools.  

The rivalry began in 1993 with a 48-34 Boston College win in Chestnut Hill when the two teams began [[Big East]] conference round-robin play.  When the two schools moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] the ACC transplanted the rivalry by making the two schools cross-divisional rivals that would play every year. The teams played twice in one season in both 2007 and 2008, as Boston College won the ''Atlantic'' division of the ACC in each of those years and Virginia Tech accordingly won the ''Coastal'' division.  Although the Eagles had defeated the Hokies in both the regular seasons of 2007 and 2008, Virginia Tech would exact its revenge by winning both the [[2007 ACC Championship Game]] and the [[2008 ACC Championship Game]] contested between the two schools.

Off of the gridiron the Eagles and Hokies are permanent partners in terms of men's basketball scheduling.  This means that under current ACC basketball scheduling rules the two teams will play each other home and away every season.
