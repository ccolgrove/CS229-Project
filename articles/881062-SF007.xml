'''m0n0wall''' is an embedded [[firewall (networking)|firewall]] distribution of [[FreeBSD]], one of the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[operating system]] descendants. It provides a small image which can be put on [[flash memory|Compact Flash]] cards as well as on [[CDROM]]s and [[hard disk]]s.  It runs on a number of embedded platforms and generic PCs.  The PC version can be run with just a [[Live CD]] and a [[floppy disk]] to store configuration data, or on a single Compact Flash card (with an [[AT Attachment|IDE]] adapter). This eliminates the need for a hard drive, which reduces noise and heat levels.

== Features ==

m0n0wall provides for a [[Internet|web]]-based configuration and uses [[PHP]] exclusively for the [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] and [[booting|bootup]] configuration. Additionally, it adopts a single [[XML]] file for configuration parameters.

Some functions of m0n0wall are:

*Stateful packet filter [[firewall (networking)|firewall]]
*[[IPsec]] and [[Point-to-point tunneling protocol|PPTP]] [[Virtual private network|VPN]]s
*Inbound and Outbound [[Network Address Translation]]
*[[Captive portal]]
*[[Traffic shaping|Traffic shaper]]
*Inbound and Outbound port filtering
*Support for [[802.1q]] compatible VLANs
*Multiple IP addresses on LAN and WAN ports
*IPS
*Replacement for commercial [[router (computing)|router]]

==Inclusion in commercial products==
m0n0wall is used in some commercial hardware platforms, including [[Netgate]] and [[Logic Supply]].

== Derivatives ==
* [http://code.google.com/p/m0n0wall-mod/ m0n0wall mod]: Original m0n0wall with additional features (DHCP+PPTP, DHCP+PPPoE, static+PPPoE, L2TP, WAN eth interface).
* [[AskoziaPBX]]: an embedded telephone system.
* [[FreeNAS]]: [[Network-attached storage]] distro using FreeBSD 7.2 and the m0n0wall web [[GUI]].
* [[pfSense]]: Builds off of m0n0wall but focused towards full PC installations rather than the embedded hardware focus of m0n0wall.
