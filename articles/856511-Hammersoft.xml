The '''University of Richmond''' is a selective, [[Private school|private]], [[nonsectarian]], [[liberal arts]] [[university]] located on the border of the city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County]], [[Virginia]]. The University of Richmond ('''UR''' or '''U of R''') is a primarily undergraduate, residential university with approximately 4,000  undergraduate and graduate students in five schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the [[E. Claiborne Robins School of Business]], the [[Jepson School of Leadership Studies]], the [[University of Richmond School of Law]] and the [[University of Richmond School of Continuing Studies|School of Continuing Studies]].

==History==
Founded by Virginia [[Baptists]] in 1830 as a [[seminary]] for men, with instruction begun by the Rev. Edward Baptist, an 1813 graduate of [[Hampden-Sydney College]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brinkley|first=John|title=On This Hill: A narrative history of Hampden-Sydney College, 1774-1994.|year=1994|location=Hampden-Sydney|isbn=1-886356-06-8|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school was incorporated ten years later as '''Richmond College'''.  During the [[American Civil War]], Richmond College was used as a hospital for [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] troops and later as a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[barracks]]. By the end of the war, the college was bankrupt and unable to continue functioning.  In 1866, James Thomas donated $5,000 to reopen the college.  The T.C. Williams School of Law opened in 1870.  

In 1894, the college elected Dr. [[Frederic W. Boatwright]] president.  President Boatwright would serve for 51 years.  He is most remembered for his decision to move the college in 1914 from its original location in what is now the [[Fan district]] to its current location in the [[The West End (Richmond, Virginia)|Westhampton]] area of Richmond.  The university's main library, [[Boatwright Memorial Library]], is named in Boatwright's honor.

[[File:Richmond-Rummell View.jpg|thumb|left|250px|&quot;Richmond College&quot; in 1915, shortly after the transition to Richmond's West End. Rummell, Richard (1848-1924). &lt;ref name=&quot;http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/college-view-of-day-richmond-college.html&quot;&gt;[http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/college-view-of-day-richmond-college.html &quot;Arader Galleries Iconic College Views&quot;],  ''Rummell, Richard'', Littig &amp; Co. 1915&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In conjunction with the move, a new college for women, Westhampton College, opened on the new campus. In 1949, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business opened, followed by the School of Continuing Studies in 1962. In 1969, E. Claiborne Robins, a [[trustee]] and [[alumnus]], donated $50 million to the university, the largest gift made to an institution of higher education at the time. Today, the university's endowment totals approximately $1.6 billion and ranked 33rd among North American university endowments for fiscal year 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;NACUBO&quot;/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Richmond was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;richmond-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://urhistory.richmond.edu/milestones/navy.html |title=V-12 Program |publisher=[[Richmond, Virginia]]: University of Richmond |last= |first= |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a donation of $20 million by Robert S. Jepson, Jr. facilitated the opening of the Jepson School of Leadership Studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jepson&quot;&gt;[http://oncampus.richmond.edu/news/ricmat/volume5/507c.html Robert Jepson is slated to speak at commencement]&lt;/ref&gt; The school, which opened in 1992, was the first of its kind in the U.S.

In 1990, the missions of Richmond and Westhampton Colleges were combined to form the School of Arts and Sciences.

On October 15, 1992, candidates [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Ross Perot]] came to campus for the first-ever &quot;town hall&quot; televised presidential debate, viewed by 200 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.richmond.edu/fall2004/features/feature1a.html Image vs. Substance (Remembering 1992: A historyâand campusâaltering debate)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward L. Ayers]], former dean of the [[University of Virginia College of Arts &amp; Sciences|College of Arts &amp; Sciences]] at the [[University of Virginia]], is the current president of the University of Richmond.  Dr. Ayers was named the ninth president of the University of Richmond on November 10, 2006.  He took office on July 1, 2007.

== Schools ==
=== School of Arts &amp; Sciences ===
All Richmond undergraduate students begin their course work in the School of Arts &amp; Sciences (A&amp;S), which offers 38 majors and 10 concentrations in the arts, sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  After one full year of study, students may decide to pursue majors in the other undergraduate schools, though 70 percent of students choose to remain in A&amp;S.

Opportunities abound in the School of Art &amp; Sciences, as students have the chance to study abroad and pursue internships or research while gaining an education that will prepare them for a variety of careers or graduate programs.

=== Robins School of Business ===
{{main|E. Claiborne Robins School of Business}}
The Robins School of Business was established in 1949 and offers undergraduate, graduate and executive education programs. It is named after alumnus E. Claiborne Robins.

Ranked 12th nationally overall and tied for first in academic quality by ''BusinessWeek'',&lt;ref name=&quot;BW_undergrad&quot;&gt;[http://oncampus.richmond.edu/news/feb09/businessweek.html Robins School of Business jumps to No. 12 among Americaâs top undergraduate programs in 2009 BusinessWeek rankings]&lt;/ref&gt; the Robins School is the only fully accredited, top-ranked undergraduate business school that also is part of a top-ranked liberal arts university.  In the 2009 ''BusinessWeek'' review of part-time MBA programs, the Robins school ranked 3rd in the mid-Atlantic region and 17th nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;BW_MBA&quot;&gt;[http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/11/1105_best_part_time_business_schools/4.htm The Best Part-Time Business Schools: University of Richmond (Robins) â BusinessWeek]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jepson School of Leadership Studies ===
{{main|Jepson School of Leadership Studies}}
The Jepson School of [[Leadership Studies]] was founded to address a perceived need in the modern world for the academic study of leadership. The school blends a curriculum of economics, history, literature, philosophy, politics, psychology and religion so that students can learn conceptual tools that support the exercise of leadership in varied settings.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RobinsSchool.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A view of the Robins School of Business from the T.C. Williams School of Law]] --&gt;

=== T.C. Williams School of Law ===
{{main|University of Richmond School of Law}}
Chartered in 1840, Richmond College was only 30 years old when it added a Law Department. The initial years were very successful for the new Law Department but during the difficult financial times that followed the Civil War, legal education was intermittent at Richmond College until 1890. In that year, the family of the late T.C. Williams, Sr., endowed a Professorship of Law, thus assuring the continuous teaching of law at Richmond College. The Law School was granted membership in the Association of American Law Schools in 1930 and now enrolls approximately 500 full-time students and has 4,300 active alumni.

=== School of Continuing Studies ===
The School of Continuing Studies offers degree and certificate programs, enrichment opportunities, professional training, and college course work for part-time and non-traditional students of all ages. A variety of evening programs with credit and non-credit courses make it possible for those with busy schedules to further their education or explore new interests.

==Undergraduate Academics==
[[Image:BoatwrightTower.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Boatwright Memorial Library bell tower]]

All students must complete general education requirements as part of the liberal arts curriculum.  These requirements include the Core Course, a two-semester course heavily focused on international writings and philosophy that first-year students must complete. Other general education requirements include expository writing, wellness, foreign language, and one class each in six fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.richmond.edu/majors/general.html University of Richmond: General Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

Richmond offers more than 100 majors, minors, and concentrations in three undergraduate schools â the School of Arts and Sciences, the  Robins School of Business, and the Jepson School of Leadership Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.richmond.edu/majors/list.html University of Richmond: Majors, Minors and Concentrations]&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Continuing Studies, primarily an evening school focused on part-time adult students, offers additional degree programs in selected areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scs.richmond.edu/evening/ School of Continuing Studies: Evening School]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admissions===
The University of Richmond admitted 32 percent of applicants for the class of 2015, making one of the more selective schools in The United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.richmond.edu/profile/index.html University of Richmond: First Year Student Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; The 788-member class of 2015 has a middle 50 percent range SAT I scores of 1930-2140&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissions.richmond.edu/profile/scores.html University of Richmond: First Year Student Profile: Test Scores]&lt;/ref&gt;  In its &quot;America's Best Colleges 2012&quot; issue, ''U.S. News and World Report'' ranked Richmond 27th among national liberal arts colleges &lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/liberal-arts-search/page+2 US News and World Report: Best Colleges 2011: Liberal Arts Colleges]&lt;/ref&gt; ''U.S. News and World Report'' also ranked Richmond third among &quot;up-and-coming&quot; liberal arts colleges,&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/libarts-uc-rank U.S. News and World Report: Best Colleges 2011: Up-and-Coming Colleges Offer Top Colleges New Competition (Page 2)]&lt;/ref&gt; and as the 9th best value among national liberal arts colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/liberal-arts-best-values US News and World Report: Best Colleges 2010: Best Values: Liberal Arts Colleges]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' ranked the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business as the 12th best undergraduate program in the nation in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;BW_undergrad&quot; /&gt;

The University of Richmond's name leads some to believe that it is a public institution drawing students primarily from within Virginia. However, only about 15 percent of UR's undergraduate students are from Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geographic Distribution&quot;&gt;[http://admissions.richmond.edu/images/profiles/Profile_map2008.swf University of Richmond: First Year Student Profile, Geographic Distribution]&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Richmond primarily draws students from the [[New England]] and [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the United States, but also draws students from across the country and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geographic Distribution&quot; /&gt;  Peer universities with which Richmond typically competes for students include the [[University of Virginia]], [[The College of William and Mary]], [[Boston College]], [[Wake Forest University]], [[Vanderbilt University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Duke University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Princeton University]], [[Villanova University]], [[Brown University]], and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oir.richmond.edu/Peers.html University of Richmond â Institutional Effectiveness â Peer Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial aid ===
Richmond administers a generous [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]] program, with 68 percent of all students receiving some form of financial assistance.  Richmond offers a [[Need-blind admission|need-blind]] admissions policy and meets 100 percent of admitted students' demonstrated need.  Richmond also offers 50 merit-based, full tuition scholarships to students in each entering class (approximately 1 out of every 15 students).  Richmond also caps student loan debt depending on the year of the student.  A senior has the highest cap at $7,500 per year, whereas a freshman cannot take a loan more than $5,500.  Recently, to encourage enrollment from Virginia residents, admitted students from Virginia with family incomes of $40,000 or less will receive full-tuition/room and board financial aid packages without loans.

===Student research===

The University of Richmond offers numerous research opportunities for students. In addition to research-based courses, independent studies, and practicums in most disciplines, many special opportunities exist for students to participate in close research collaborations with faculty. Student research occurs in all academic areas, including the arts, sciences, social sciences, and other fields.  Notably, the University recently received a $1.5 million grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] for its mathematics program to sponsor student research commencing May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oncampus.richmond.edu/news/sept06/NSF.html National Science Foundation Awards $1.49 Million Grant to University of Richmond Math Department]&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Richmond is listed in ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'s'' &quot;America's Best Colleges 2008&quot; issue as one of 35 (out of 2,500) âschools with outstanding examples of academic programs that are believed to lead to student successâ in the area of âundergraduate research/creative projects.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankacadprogs_brief.php USNews.com: America's Best Colleges 2008: Academic Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/acadprogs04_brief.php USNews.com: America's Best Colleges 2008: Undergraduate research / creative projects]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Richmond Research Institute]] provides information on undergraduate research opportunities as well as numerous examples of student research videos, publications, posters, and abstracts.

== Campus ==
{{See also|Gottwald Center for the Sciences}}
The University of Richmond's campus consists of {{convert|350|acre|km2}} in a suburban setting on the western edge of the city.  The university has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus â red brick buildings in a [[collegiate gothic]] style set around shared open lawns.  Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the original administration building and library for Richmond College, were designed by [[Ralph Adams Cram]] in 1910. Cram, a noted institutional architect, also designed buildings for [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and [[Williams College|Williams]], among other universities.  [[Warren Manning|Warren H. Manning]], a former apprentice to [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], designed the original landscape plan.  The overall effect of the gothic architecture set amid a landscape of pines, rolling hills, and Westhampton Lake, is intimate and tranquil. In 2000, the campus was recognized by [[The Princeton Review]] as the most beautiful in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richmondspiders.com/school-bio/rich-school-bio.html University of Richmond Quick Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CommonsLake.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Looking out over Westhampton Lake from Tyler Haynes Commons]]
The University of Richmond campus was used to film portions of the pilot of ''[[Commander in Chief (television)|Commander in Chief]]'', and lead character [[Mackenzie Allen]], (played by [[Geena Davis]]) served as [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of a fictionalized University of Richmond prior to her election as [[Vice President of the United States]]. Much of the movie ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry_Wolf]]'' was filmed on the Westhampton side of campus, with several dormitories, including South Court, North Court, and Keller Hall, serving as locations. Several episodes of the television show ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' were also filmed on campus, referring to Richmond only as a nameless &quot;beautiful Ivy League campus.&quot; The filming itself took place in Stern Quad and inside the Jepson Alumni Center.

The University of Richmond also owns the former [[Reynolds Metals Company International Headquarters|Reynolds Metals Executive Office Building]], purchased from [[Alcoa]] in 2001.  Located a few miles from campus, the {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building was designed by architect [[Gordon Bunshaft]] and opened in 1958.  The building, which incorporates nearly 1.4 million pounds of [[aluminum]], is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It currently serves as the headquarters of [[Altria Group]] and its subsidiary, [[Philip Morris USA]], which are leasing it from the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oncampus.richmond.edu/news/mar03/PhilipMorris.html Philip Morris USA Headquarters to Relocate from New York to University of Richmond's Alcoa-Reynolds Building]&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2001, the university also finalized the purchase of {{convert|115|acre|km2}} of land in eastern [[Goochland County, Virginia|Goochland County]], a few miles from the main campus.  The land is currently used for biology research, but future uses could include intramural athletic fields.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goochland&quot;&gt;[http://oncampus.richmond.edu/news/ricmat/volume3/RM022101.pdf University purchases land in Goochland, ''Richmond Matters'': February 21, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Richmond campus is also home to the [[Governor's Schools (Virginia)#Summer Residential Governor's Schools|Virginia Governor's School for Visual and Performing Arts and Humanities]] during the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Governor's Schools&quot;&gt;[http://govschool.richmond.edu/ Governor's School for Humanities and Visual &amp; Performing Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University won its [[2008 Richmond Spiders football team|first NCAA national championship]] in any sport on December 19, 2008 when the Spiders football team defeated the [[Montana Grizzlies]], 24â7, in the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]].  Richmond was ranked 23rd in men's basketball at one point during the 2009â10 season. During it's 2010 season the Richmond Men's Cross Country team placed 24th at the NCAA Division 1 Cross Country Championships. The 2010-2011 [[Richmond Spiders men's basketball]] team defeated Morehead State earning the team a spot in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] Sweet Sixteen.
