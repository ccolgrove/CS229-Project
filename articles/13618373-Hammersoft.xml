'''Annan Academy''' is a secondary school in [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan]], in [[Dumfries and Galloway]], formerly [[Dumfriesshire]], Scotland. The present school is the result of an amalgamation in 1921 of the original Annan Academy and Greenknowe Public School, although its history goes back to the 17th century. 

Behind the buildings are the school's sports playing fields which additionally play host to local fairs and other outdoor functions such as the annual national [[pipe band]] competition. Adjacent to the school's main car- and coach park, which is situated at the front of the buildings, lies the Annan public swimming baths and associated car park. 

==Rector &amp; Management Team==

The Rector is Mr Frank Davis he is assisted by his Depute's Mr D Muir, MR M Downie, Mr B Asher &amp; Mrs S Speight

==History==
The original Annan Academy, founded in 1802, was housed in a building in the town's Port St until 1820, when the council built new school premises in Ednam St. From there it moved to further new buildings in Greenknowe in 1840, but these were later replaced by larger ones with a distinctive bell-tower in 1895, which are still in use today and house the school's library, the original building was built by George McIldowie. The latter red [[sandstone]] buildings were joined during an expansion in the 1960s by several new buildings of contemporary style and construction, enabling it to accept more pupils from a wider catchment area.

==Houses==
There are four &quot;[[House system|houses]]&quot;: ''Bruce'', ''Douglas'', ''Kinmount'', and ''Solway''; whose colours are blue, green, red and yellow respectively. Prefects from the fifth and sixth year are elected by both pupils and staff.
