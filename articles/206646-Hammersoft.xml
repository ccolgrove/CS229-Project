'''Zachary Phillip Wylde''' (born January 14, 1967), best known by the stage name '''Zakk Wylde''', is an American musician, songwriter, and occasional actor who is best known as the former [[guitarist]] for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and founder of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Black Label Society]]. He was the lead guitarist and vocalist in [[Pride and Glory (band)|Pride &amp; Glory]], who released one self-titled album in 1994 before disbanding. As a solo artist he released ''[[Book of Shadows (album)|Book of Shadows]]'' in 1996.

==Early life==
Wylde was born in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], [[New Jersey]].

==Music career==
Growing up, Wylde played locally with his first band, &quot;Stone Henge&quot;, then later with local Jersey band Zyris. Years later, he landed the role as lead guitarist and co-writer for Ozzy Osbourne. He sent Ozzy a demo tape in 1987 and was hired to replace [[Jake E. Lee]]. Lee had replaced the deceased [[Randy Rhoads]], Ozzy's principal guitarist in the post-[[Black Sabbath]] period, beginning in late 1979. Rhoads remains Wylde's foremost guitar-playing and stagecraft influence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Wylde gravitated toward a particular Les Paul guitar, which has become known as &quot;The Grail&quot;; his infamous bullseye-painted Gibson Les Paul custom. Wylde lost the guitar after it fell from the back of a truck transporting equipment as he was travelling between gigs in Texas. Rewards were offered to anyone that had information about the guitar. Wylde and 'The Grail' were reunited years later when a fan bought it at a Dallas pawn shop and saw the initials &quot;Z.W.&quot; carved into the humbucker pickups backs. He contacted Wylde's former webmaster Randy Canis to arrange its return to Wylde. He was eventually able to barter for it, in exchange for two other Les Pauls.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Osbourne has maintained a flexible attitude with regard to his backing band, leaving his band members free to leave as they wish, but Wylde has remained largely faithful to Osbourne. Wylde was replaced in Osbourne's band by Joe Holmes from 1995 until his return in 2001.

On January 17, 2006, Zakk Wylde was recognized at the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame located at 7425 Sunset Boulevard, featuring his handprints and signature, in recognition of his successful career as a musician and his contribution to the music industry. The event was open to the public and many rock celebrities were present, including Ozzy Osbourne.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After auditions in 2005/2006, Ozzy Osbourne announced Wylde as the official guitarist for his upcoming album, [[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Black Rain]], which was released in 2007. On stage with Osbourne, Wylde has been credited for lending a high level of energy and passion to performances.

Black Label Society's album, Shot To Hell, was released on September 11, 2006 in the UK, and September 12, 2006 in the U.S. through Roadrunner records, with production by Michael Beinhorn (Soundgarden, Ozzy Osbourne, Red Hot Chili Peppers). Black Label Society headlined the second stage at the 2006 Ozzfest, with Wylde playing double duty with Ozzy on certain dates. Ozzy Osbourne's album, Black Rain, was released in May 2007.

Black Label Society released 'The Song Remains Not the Same' on May 10, 2011
on E1.

As reported by Alternative Press, Zakk Wylde will be contributing a guitar solo to Black Veil Brides' upcoming cover of Kiss' &quot;Unholy,&quot; slated to appear on the band's upcoming Rebels EP due out December 2011.

==Personal life==
Wylde lives with his wife, Barbaranne, and his three children: Hayley Rae, Hendrix, and Jesseâwho is godson to [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. Wylde was a close friend of [[Dimebag Darrell|Darrell &quot;Dimebag&quot; Abbott]] before the latter was murdered in 2004. As of 2011, he is also in partnership with [[Blair's Sauces and Snacks]] to produce &quot;Berserker&quot; Hot Sauce and several variations thereof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extremefood.com/shop/home.php?cat=7 Blair's Sauces and Snacks: The Official Home of Blair's Death Sauce and Extreme Food: Hot Sauces: Zakk Wylde&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health problems===
Wylde's health has come under scrutiny for several years. Wylde was asked by [[Sharon Osbourne]] to attend rehab, but left very early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=32924|title=ZAKK WYLDE Denies He Spat Booze In JAMES HETFIELD's Face|publisher=BlabberMouth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Wylde was hospitalized due to blood clots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/zakk-wylde-hospitalized-for-blood-clots-cancels-tour-217850 Zakk Wylde hospitalized for blood clots, cancels tour | MusicRadar.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was forced to cancel his tour with [[Mudvayne]] and [[Static-X]] due to an [[embolism]]. He has been sober ever since.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

==Equipment==
He is known for his use of [[Gibson Les Paul Custom]] model guitars with a &quot;bulls-eye&quot; graphic on them, a design he used to deliberately differentiate himself visually from [[Randy Rhoads]] - who was also frequently identified by his white Les Paul Custom. Interestingly, one of Wylde's favorite stage guitars of late is a replica of Rhoads' [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]]. The &quot;bulls-eye&quot; paint job was originally supposed to look like the spiral from the movie ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', but when it came back incorrect from the [[luthier]], he liked the result and stuck with it. He was sometimes criticized by viewers and media for taking the idea of the &quot;bulls-eye&quot; from [[Eddie Ojeda]] from [[Twisted Sister]], however, both Eddie and Zakk deny it and suppose it rather to be coincidence.

Wylde's signature Les Pauls include a red flame-maple bulls-eye model, a black and antique-white bulls-eye model, an orange &quot;buzz-saw&quot; model, the pattern on which was inspired by a design on a [[Zippo]] lighter,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guitarchina.com/news/newspic/20050201_091635_93490.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;camo&quot; bulls-eye model with [[mother of pearl]] [[fretboard|neck]] [[inlay (guitar)|inlays]] and a green camouflage paint scheme. His original bulls-eye Les Paul was purchased from one of the owners of Metaltronics Amplification. Metaltronics was building a one-off live rig for Wylde that was designed around one of the owner's guitars, a creamy white Les Paul Custom with EMG pickups, which would later become known as &quot;The Grail&quot;. Zakk also has a custom Dean Splittail with a mud splatter bulls-eye graphic, as well as a signature Splittail shaped Gibson model called the &quot;ZV&quot;. Another Dean in his collection is a Dime series Razorback with custom Bulls-eye graphics ordered for him specially by [[Dimebag Darrell]] shortly before his death; since receiving the guitar, he has only ever used it on stage to play &quot;In This River,&quot; Zakk's personal tribute to Dimebag.

Practice: Zakk uses Marshall MG Series practice combos ranging in wattage levels from 10-30W during tour/private use especially in hotels and buses. Zakk also has an extensive relationship with Marshall Amplification due to his love for their amplifiers, both solid state and valve powered. 
Live: Zakk exclusively uses Marshall JCM 800's with twin 4 X 12 Cabinets loaded with EVM12L 300W Black Label Speakers.

His usual signal path consists of his guitar &gt; (on stage pedal board) Dunlop Wylde [[Wah-wah pedal|Wah]] &gt; Dunlop [[Rotovibe]] &gt; [[MXR Phase 90|MXR EVH Phase 90]] (*Soon to be replaced by the new MXR Wylde Phase) &gt; MXR Wylde [[Distortion (music)|Overdrive]] &gt; MXR Carbon Copy Delay [[Delay effect| Delay]] &gt; (to a back stage pedal board) &gt;  MXR EVH Flanger &gt; MXR Black Label [[Chorus effect|Chorus]] &gt; split signals, one to each distorted amp into the High Gain input.
