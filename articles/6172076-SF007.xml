== Propagation ==

Rogue security software mainly relies on [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] ([[fraud]]) in order to defeat the security built into modern [[operating system]] and [[web browser|browser software]] and install itself onto victims' computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft-1&quot; /&gt;  A website may, for example, display a fictitious warning dialog stating that someone's machine is infected with a [[computer virus]], and encourage them through [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] to install or purchase [[scareware]] in the belief that they are purchasing genuine [[antivirus software]].

Most have a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] component, which users are misled into installing.  The Trojan may be disguised as:
* A browser [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] or extension (typically toolbar)
* An image, screensaver or [[File archiver|archive file]] attached to an [[e-mail]] message
* Multimedia codec required to play a certain [[video clip]]
* Software shared on [[peer-to-peer]] networks&lt;ref name=&quot;symantec-2&quot;&gt;{{citation|first = Nishant|last = Doshi|date = 2009-01-19|accessdate = 2009-05-02|publisher = [[Symantec]]|title = Misleading Applications â Show Me The Money!|url = https://forums2.symantec.com/t5/blogs/blogprintpage/blog-id/security_risks/article-id/53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A free online malware scanning service&lt;ref name=&quot;symantec-3&quot;&gt;{{citation|first = Nishant|last = Doshi|date = 2009-01-21|accessdate = 2009-05-02|publisher = [[Symantec]]|title = Misleading Applications â Show Me The Money! (Part 2)|url = https://forums2.symantec.com/t5/blogs/blogprintpage/blog-id/security_risks/article-id/54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rogue security software, however, propagate onto users' computers as [[drive-by download]]s which exploit [[vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] in web browsers, pdf viewers, or email clients to install themselves without any manual interaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;symantec-2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blog_adobe&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/2009/12/new_adobe_reader_and_acrobat_v.html |title=News Adobe Raeder and Acrobat Vulnerability |publisher=blogs.adobe.com |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, malware distributors have been utilizing [[search engine optimization|SEO poisoning]] techniques by pushing infected URLs to the top of search engine results about recent news events. People looking for articles on such events on a search engine may encounter results that, upon being clicked, are instead redirected through a series of sites&lt;ref name=&quot;fsecure&quot;&gt;

== Operation ==

Once installed, the rogue security software may then attempt to entice the user into purchasing a service or additional software by:
* Alerting the user with the fake or simulated detection of malware or [[pornography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ftc-1&quot;&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt121.shtm|title = &quot;Free Security Scan&quot; Could Cost Time and Money|publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]|date = 2008-12-10|accessdate = 2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Displaying an animation simulating a system crash and reboot.&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft-1&quot; /&gt;
* Selectively disabling parts of the system to prevent the user from uninstalling them.  Some may also prevent anti-malware programs from running, disable automatic [[system software]] updates and block access to websites of anti-malware vendors.
* Installing actual malware onto the computer, then alerting the user after &quot;detecting&quot; them.  This method is less common as the malware is likely to be detected by legitimate [[Malware#Anti-malware programs|anti-malware programs]].
* Altering system registries and security settings, then &quot;alerting&quot; the user.

Developers of rogue security software may also entice people into purchasing their product by claiming to give a portion of their sales to a charitable cause. The rogue Green antivirus, for example, claims to donate $2 to an environmental care program for each sale made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cantalktech.com/2009/05/16/remove-green-antivirus-2009/ CanTalkTech - Fake Green AV disguises as security software with a cause]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rogue security software overlaps in function with [[scareware]] by also:
* Presenting offers to fix urgent performance problems or perform essential housekeeping on the computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftc-1&quot; /&gt;
* Scaring the user by presenting authentic-looking pop-up warnings and security alerts, which may mimic actual system notices.&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft-3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech.yahoo.com/blog/null/107193 |title=SAP at a crossroads after losing $1.3B verdict |publisher=[[Yahoo! News]] |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are intended to use the trust that the user has in vendors of legitimate security software.&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft-1&quot; /&gt;

Sanction by the FTC and the increasing effectiveness of anti-malware tools since 2006 have made it difficult for [[spyware]] and [[adware]] distribution networksâalready complex to begin with&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Testimony of Ari Schwartz on &quot;Spyware&quot;|publisher = [[Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation]]|date = 2005-05-11|url = http://www.cdt.org/testimony/20050511schwartzspyware.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;âto operate profitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Zango goes titsup: End of desktop adware market|publisher = [[The Register]]|date = 2009-04-11|accessdate = 2009-05-05|url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/21/zango|first = John|last = Leyden}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malware vendors have turned instead to the simpler, more profitable [[business model]] of rogue security software, which is targeted directly at users of [[Personal computer|desktop computers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;symantec-1&quot;&gt;{{citation|url = https://forums2.symantec.com/t5/blogs/blogprintpage/blog-id/grab_bag/article-id/5|title =  Deceptonomics: A Glance at The Misleading Application Business Model|first = Dave|last = Cole|date = 2006-07-03|publisher = [[Symantec]]|accessdate = 2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogue security software is often distributed through highly lucrative [[affiliate network]]s, in which affiliates supplied with Trojan kits for the software are paid a fee for every successful installation, and a commission from any resulting purchases.  The affiliates then become responsible for setting up infection vectors and distribution infrastructure for the software.&lt;ref name=&quot;symantec-4&quot;&gt;{{citation|first = Nishant|last = Doshi|date = 2009-01-27|accessdate = 2009-05-02|publisher = [[Symantec]]|title = Misleading Applications â Show Me The Money! (Part 3)|url = https://forums2.symantec.com/t5/blogs/blogprintpage/blog-id/security_risks/article-id/55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation by security researchers into the Antivirus XP 2008 rogue security software found just such an affiliate network, in which members were grossing commissions upwards of $[[US dollar|USD]]150,000 over 10 days, from tens of thousands of successful installations.&lt;ref name=&quot;secureworks&quot;&gt;{{citation|title = Rogue Antivirus Dissected - Part 2|first = Joe|last = Stewart|date = 2008-10-22|publisher = SecureWorks|url = http://www.secureworks.com/research/threats/rogue-antivirus-part-2/?threat=rogue-antivirus-part-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law enforcement ==

In December 2006, the Washington [[Attorney General]] announced that it had reached settlement in a suit against Secure Computer LLC, the [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]-based vendor of the Spyware Cleaner rogue security software, under the Computer Spyware Act passed by the [[Washington State Legislature]] in 2005.  Secure Computer, under [[consent decree]], agreed to pay more than $75,000 in restitution to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date = 2006-12-04|title = Attorney General McKenna Announces $1 Million Settlement in Washingtonâs First Spyware Suit|url = http://www.atg.wa.gov/pressrelease.aspx?&amp;id=5926|publisher = Washington State Office of the Attorney General|accessdate = 2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland|US District Court for Maryland]]âat the request of the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]âissued a [[Injunction|restraining order]] against Innovative Marketing Inc, a [[Kiev]]-based firm producing and marketing the rogue security software products [[WinFixer]], [[WinAntivirus]], [[DriveCleaner]], [[ErrorSafe]], and [[XP Antivirus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0723137/081203innovativemrktgtro.pdf|publisher = [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]]|date = 2008-12-03|title = Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order RDB08CV3233|accessdate = 2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company and its US-based web host, ByteHosting Internet Hosting Services LLC, had their assets frozen, were barred from using [[Domain name system|domain names]] associated with those products and any further advertisement or false representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Court Halts Bogus Computer Scans|publisher = [[Federal Trade Commission]]|accessdate = 2009-05-02|date = 2008-12-10|url = http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/12/winsoftware.shtm|first = Betsy|last = Lordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement has also exerted pressure on banks to shut down merchant gateways involved in processing rogue security software purchases.  In some cases, the high volume of [[credit card]] [[chargeback]]s generated by such purchases has also prompted processors to take action against rogue security software vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = Rogue Antivirus Distribution Network Dismantled|url = http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/03/sunlight_disinfects_rogue_anti.html|first = Brian|last = Krebs|date = 2009-03-20|newspaper = [[Washington Post]]|accessdate = 2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
