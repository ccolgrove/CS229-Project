'''FreeNAS''' is a free [[network-attached storage]] server, supporting: [[CIFS]] ([[Samba (software)|Samba]]), [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], [[rsync]], [[Apple Filing Protocol|AFP]] protocols, [[internet SCSI|iSCSI]], [[Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology|S.M.A.R.T.]],  local user authentication, and software [[RAID]] (0,1,5), with a web-based configuration interface. FreeNAS takes less than 64 MB once installed on [[CompactFlash]], [[hard drive]] or [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] [[USB flash drive|flash drive]]. FreeNAS is currently distributed as an [[ISO image]] and in [[Source code|source]] form. Through version 7.x, it was possible to run FreeNAS from a [[Live CD]], with the configuration files stored on an MS-DOS-formatted floppy disk or USB thumb drive. There is also a [[VMware]] disk image available (Last updated in 2006)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/168 FreeNAS on the VMWare Application Marketplace]&lt;/ref&gt;. With the release of 8.x, Live CD isn't currently supported.  FreeNas 8.x needs to be installed on a Compact Flash, USB, or dedicated hard drive.  Using the dedicated hard drive will use that drive just for the operating system, and files cannot be stored on it.

The minimal [[FreeBSD]] 7.2 distribution, web interface, [[PHP]] scripts, and documentation are based on [[m0n0wall]]. FreeNAS is released under the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]. It was reported December 2009 that [[FreeBSD]] based development would be halted and put into 'maintenance-only mode' with [[Debian Linux]] as the new development target [[OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This decision was reverted shortly afterwards, when [[iXsystems]] offered to sponsor the further development of FreeNAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
