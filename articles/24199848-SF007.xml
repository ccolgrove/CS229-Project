==History==
Ashampoo was founded in 1999 by Rolf Hilchner (CEO of Ashampoo). The company's name was formed during a discussion about their first product, an [[uninstaller]] [[utility software]], when Rolf Hilchner mentioned that ''&quot;it cleans your Windows like a shampoo&quot;.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashampoo.com/en/usd/pre/715/Ashampoo-Celebrates-10-years-of-Software-Innovation&lt;/ref&gt; Their first published product was ''AudioCD MP3 Studio 2000''.  They have since published software for [[office productivity software|office productivity]], [[security software|security]], [[optical disc authoring software|optical disc authoring]],  [[system utility]], multimedia, and [[CAD software|CAD]].

In 2007 they began producing several German [[web portal]]s starting with ''airshampoo.de''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashampoo.com/en/usd/pre/385/airshampoo-de-praesentiert-das-Lande-Gutscheinheft-2007-fuer-Piloten&lt;/ref&gt;, and in 2008, ''netcar.de'', ''enimal.com'', and others.
