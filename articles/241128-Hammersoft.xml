'''Michigan State University''' ('''MSU''') is a [[public university|public]] research university in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], USA. Founded in 1855, it was the pioneer [[land-grant institution]] and served as a model for future land-grant colleges in the United States under the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]].

MSU pioneered the studies of [[packaging]], [[Hospitality management studies|hospitality business]], [[telecommunication]] and [[music therapy]].{{Citation needed (lead)|date=February 2011}} Today its [[study abroad|study-abroad]] program is the largest of any single-campus university in the country, offering more than 200 programs in more than 60 countries on all continents including [[Antarctica]]. 

It is considered to be one of America's [[Public Ivy]] universities, which recognizes top public research universities in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;publicivy&quot;&gt;Greene, Howard and Greene, Matthew. ''The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2001). ISBN 0-06-093459-X.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the introduction of the [[Morrill Act]], the college became [[coeducation]]al and expanded its curriculum beyond [[agriculture]]. Today, MSU is the [[List of largest United States university campuses by enrollment|ninth-largest university]] in the United States, with 47,800 students and 2,954 [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members. The school's [[nuclear physics]], [[engineering]], [[political science]], [[business]], [[journalism]], [[education]], [[law]] and [[osteopathic medicine]] programs are among the nation's best.

MSU's [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] sports teams are called the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]. They compete in the [[Big Ten Conference]] in all sports except ice hockey, in which the team is part of the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]]. MSU's [[American football|football]] [[Michigan State Spartans football|team]] won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1954, 1956 and 1988 and boasts six national championships.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/msu/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/133-170-spartan-history.pdf]&quot;.

MSU men's [[ice hockey]] won [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|national titles]] in 1966, 1986 and 2007. Cross country has historically been Michigan State's most successful sport, especially during a four-decade period spanning roughly 1930â1970 during which the Spartans won eight NCAA championships and numerous other conference and national titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frimodig, L. 1971&quot;&gt;Frimodig, L., &amp; Stabley, F.

=== Agriculture school ===

The [[Michigan Constitution]] of 1850 called for the creation of an &quot;agricultural school&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[s:Michigan Constitution of 1850|Michigan Constitution of 1850]]&quot;. Wikisource. Article 13, Section 11. Retrieved March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan [[List of Governors of Michigan|Governor]] [[Kinsley S. Bingham]] signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/articlepg1.htm Milestones of MSU's Sesquicentennial]&quot;. MSU University Archives and Historical Collection. Retrieved March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Classes began on May 13, 1857, with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students. The first president, [[Joseph R. Williams]], designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced [[science]], [[liberal arts]], and practical training. The curriculum excluded [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] studies, since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily [[manual labour|manual labor]], which kept costs down for both the students and the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Darling, Birt. | title=City in the Forest; The Story of Lansing | location=New York | publisher=Stratford House | year=1950|page=121 | lccn=50008202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as [[elitism|elitist]]. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.

=== Land Grant pioneer ===
In 1860, [[Joseph R. Williams]] became acting [[lieutenant governor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;josephrwilliams&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm Joseph R. Williams Biographical Information]&quot;. MSU University Archives and Historical Collection Accessed March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This gave the College a four-year curriculum and the power to grant [[master's degree]]s. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot;/&gt; The College changed its name to State Agricultural College, and its first class graduated in the same year. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had just begun, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony.  The first alumni enlisted to the [[Union Army]]. The following year, [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the First [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model. Williams had died the previous year.

=== Co-ed college ===

[[Image:Cowles House 10 2007 BR.jpg|thumb|left|The Alice B Cowles House is the official home of the university president and is the oldest existing building on campus.]]
The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled either boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a &quot;Women Course&quot; that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the old Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first [[African American]] student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President Jonathan L. Snyder invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African-American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated in that same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Whitney. | title=East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited (Images of America) | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2002 | isbn=0-7385-2045-4 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later the college officially changed its name to Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.).

=== Big Ten university ===

During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough that it changed its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (M.S.C.). In 1941 the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, [[John A. Hannah]], became president of the College. He began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans to receive an education. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heineman, Kenneth J. | title=Campus Wars: The Peace Movement at American State Universities in the Vietnam Era | location=New York | publisher=New York University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-8147-3512-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State UniversityâOakland, now [[Oakland University]], with [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the [[University of Chicago]] resigned from the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. Hannah lobbied hard to take its place, gaining admission in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Big 10 Now â Spartans Admitted|accessdate=2010-06-12|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=1949-05-21, p. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuhn, Madison. | title=Michigan State: The First Hundred Years, 1855â1955 | location=East Lansing | publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=1955 | isbn=0-87013-222-9 | page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years after that, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees. The State of Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/ |title=Michigan.gov |publisher=Michigan.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the University to drop the words &quot;Agriculture and Applied Science&quot; from its name. Since 1964 the institution has gone by the name of Michigan State University.

Since the end of the Hannah era, Michigan State has shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, current president [[Lou Anna Simon]] called for MSU, one of the [[Public Ivy|public ivy institutions]], to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by the year 2012. Her plans include creating a new [[residential college]] and increasing grants awarded from the [[National Institutes of Health]] past the [[United States dollar|$]]100 million mark.

In 2007, Michigan State University established an education center in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. MSU Dubai was the first American university with a presence in [[Dubai International Academic City]], with classes beginning in August 2008. The University offered six undergraduate programs: Business Administration; Child and Youth Development; Construction Project Management; Early Childhood Education; Media Management and Research; Computer Engineering, which later was changed to Electrical and Computer Engineering; and a Master's Degree in Human Resources &amp; Labor Relations. The University attracted over 100 students from all over the Middle East and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;About Michigan State University Dubai â http://dubai.msu.edu/quick-facts/about-msu-dubai/news/msu-dubai-challenges-middle-east-students-dream-big-committing-new-&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2009-2010 academic year MSU Dubai intended to seek licensure through the Commission for Academic Accreditation of the U.A.E. with the goal of full program accreditation prior to the graduation of its first class in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://dubai.msu.edu/quick-facts/about-msu-dubai&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of activity, MSU shut down all undergraduate programs in Dubai due to financial reasons. The Dubai campus remains as a research site, a Study Abroad center, and for its dozen graduate students.

=== Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center ===
The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4-star hotel and a business friendly conference center. It is located on the northwest corner of Michigan State Universityâs campus, across from the [[Brody Complex]], on Harrison Road just south of Michigan Avenue. The hotel has 160 rooms and suites which can accommodate anyone staying in East Lansing for a business conference, sporting event or an on-campus visit, but it originally served as a dormitory for MSU students. Besides a lodging facility, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center serves as a âlearning laboratory for the 300-400 students each year that are enrolled in The School of Hospitality Business and other majors.â The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center strives to facilitate education by hosting conferences and seminars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kelloggcenter.com/about/history.html |title=Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
[[Image:MSU Computer Center.jpg|thumb|The Computer Center once housed the early research computer [[MISTIC]]]]
The university spent nearly [[United States dollar|$]]405 million in 2008â09 on research,&lt;ref name=&quot;msufacts&quot;/&gt; capping a long history of academic research. In 1877, botany professor [[William J. Beal]] performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid [[maize|corn]], which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor [[G. Malcolm Trout]] invented the process for the [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] of milk in the 1930s. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed [[cisplatin]], a leading cancer fighting drug.
&lt;br&gt;
Today Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]]-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prl.msu.edu/ |title=Michigan State University &amp;#124; College of Natural Science &amp;#124; Plant Research Laboratory |publisher=Prl.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[particle accelerator]] called the [[National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory]]. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as the site for the [[Facility for Rare Isotope Beams]] (FRIB). The $550 million facility will attract top researchers from around the world to conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.

=== Endowment ===
MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) [[financial endowment|endowment]] started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate [[R.E. Olds]] helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rodriguez, Michael | title=R.E. Olds and Industrial Lansing | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=0-7385-3272-X | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools, with barely over $100 million in endowment funds. That changed dramatically in the first decade of the 21st century, when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of [[fiscal year]] 2004â2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school.&lt;ref&gt;Seguin, Rick. &quot;[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html Endowment surges in growth, rankings]&quot;.
