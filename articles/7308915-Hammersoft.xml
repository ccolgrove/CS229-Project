'''Vodafone Iceland''' is an Icelandic [[telecommunications]] company and is part of the Icelandic IT company [[Teymi]].

Vodafone Iceland offers mobile, fixed-line, and ADSL/ internet services to individuals and companies. Its telecommunications branch is a franchise of the [[Vodafone]] network, formerly known as Og Vodafone and from 5 October 2006 as Vodafone Iceland [http://vodafone.is/og-vodafone-verour-vodafone/]. Vodafone Iceland is the first partner network to hold the Vodafone brand. The company is registered in Iceland under the name Fjarskipti ehf.
