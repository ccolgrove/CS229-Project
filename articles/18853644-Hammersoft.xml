The third season of ''[[America's Best Dance Crew]]'' premiered on January 15, 2009. It was hosted by [[Mario Lopez]] and featured [[Layla Kayleigh]] as the backstage correspondent. The judges included rapper [[Lil Mama]], former [['N Sync|*NSYNC]] singer [[JC Chasez]], and hip-hop choreographer [[Shane Sparks]]. Chasez, one of the three judges, said &quot;we'll be taking a bit more time between seasons, which will give people ample time to get their crews together, practice and prepare.&quot; This was the first season without a special casting episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bloggingbestdancecrew.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-information-about-on-season-3.html |title=Straight Information about ABDC Season 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 5, 2009, [[Quest Crew]] was declared the winner of Season 3 and received the $100,000 ([[United States dollar|USD]]) prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/08/americas-best-1.html |title='America's Best Dance Crew' SoReal Cru vs. Super Cr3w |accessdate=2008-08-08 |date=2008-08-08 |work=LA Times |publisher=Jevon Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crews ==
Like [[America's Best Dance Crew (Season 1)|season 1]], nine crews were selected in this season of ''America's Best Dance Crew'', as opposed to last season's ten crews. The nine crews were not divided into the usual four regions (East, West, Midwest, and South), but each crew's banner still listed where each crew was from.&lt;ref&gt;http://remotecontrol.mtv.com/2009/01/15/video-fanny-paks-phil-collins-chats-up-shane-sparks-and-kid-rainen/&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the first season that showcased a crew from the [[Caribbean]].
Team Millennia, who was eliminated during the season 2 casting special, returned this season as one of the nine official dance crews.&lt;ref&gt;http://remotecontrol.mtv.com/2009/01/08/abdc-season-3-find-out-which-crews-made-the-final-cut/&lt;/ref&gt;
This season also has a heavy cross-over with ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (US)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''. Quest Crew's Ryan Conferido was a season 1 finalist, Hok and D-Trix (Dominic) were season 3 finalists. Also, [[clogging|clogger]] Brandon Norris of Dynamic Edition was heavily featured during the season 3 try-outs of ''SYTYCD'' and performed at the season finale. Judge [[Shane Sparks]] has also judged and choreographed for numerous seasons of ''SYTYCD''. Also included are the [[Beat Freaks]], which consist of a group of professional dancers, namely Rino Nakasone, formerly of the [[Gwen Stefani]]'s [[Harajuku Girls]], and Teresa Espinosa, formerly one of [[Britney Spears]]' dancers.

===Week 7: Hip Hop Decathlon and Last Chance Challenge===
*Aired on February 26, 2009

This week on ABDC, the crews competed against each other in two challenges: the Hip-Hop Decathlon and the Last Chance Challenge. After the mid-show elimination, then the top two crews performed to their Last Chance Challenge.

====Challenge #1: Hip-Hop Decathlon====

The three remaining crews had to demonstrate their versatility by creating a routine that incorporated five different hip-hop dance styles. Although the crews performed only five styles, MTV chose to refer to the challenge as a decathlon. All crews were given the same five styles and songs, and they received help from five guest ABDC alumni from the previous two seasons. Each alumnus/alumna was assigned to one of the dance styles the crews will be responsible for. The setting in the video that the crews were supposed to watch to learn the styles was in [[Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory]].
