The '''Irish general election of 1965''' was held on 7 April 1965. The newly elected [[members of the 18th DÃ¡il]] assembled at [[Leinster House]] on 21 April when the new [[Taoiseach]] and [[Government of Ireland|government]] were appointed.

The general election took place in [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|42 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[DÃ¡il Ãireann]].

==Campaign==
The general election of 1965 was caused by the ruling [[Fianna FÃ¡il]] party's failure to gain a seat in a [[by-election]]. The success of [[Eileen Desmond]] of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] in [[Cork Mid (DÃ¡il Ãireann constituency)|Cork Mid]] in holding a seat previously held by her husband [[Dan Desmond]], led to an unacceptable mathematical situation with regard to the government's majority.  The Taoiseach, [[SeÃ¡n Lemass]] immediately dissolved the DÃ¡il and the campaign began in earnest.

Fianna FÃ¡il ran its campaign on its record in government. Over the last number of years the economy had seen a huge improvement and the party played up on its record in government. The party also played up heavily on the personality of the party leader with the slogan &quot;Let Lemass Lead On&quot;. [[Fine Gael]] put forward a comprehensive manifesto, which included the establishment of a government department concerned with economic planning.  However, the older, conservative members of the party did not warm to the new turn the party was taking.
==Television &amp; Radio==

This was the first Irish General Election to be covered on television by state broadcaster [[RTÃ]], which had formed on 31 December, 1961. ''Election Newsroom'' was broadcast live on [[RTÃ One|TelefÃ­s Ãireann]] from their Donnybrook studios in Dublin. Presented by John O'Donoghue with analysis provided by John Healy (Irish Times), John O'Sullivan (The Cork Examiner), [[Garret Fitzgerald]] and Professor Basil Chubb. Cameras were present in four count centres Bolton Street (Dublin), Wexford, Cork and Monaghan. The GPO provided direct links as results were announced.  [[RTÃ Radio 1|RaidiÃ³ Ãireann]] provided special coverage from 3pm on the day of the count due to the coverage on TelefÃ­s Ãireann. It was a new approach to election coverage on the states radio service, which began broadcasting in 1926 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t08b.html|title=RTÃ COVERAGE OF GENERAL ELECTIONS - 1965 GENERAL ELECTION|publisher=RTÃ Libraries and Archives|language=Enlish|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
