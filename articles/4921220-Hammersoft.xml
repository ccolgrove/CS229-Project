'''Pago Pago International Airport''' {{Airport codes|PPG|NSTU|PPG}}, also referred to as '''Tafuna Airport''' (or Tafuna International Airport), '''Tafuna Airfield''', '''Tafuna Airbase''' or '''Pago Pago International''' with airport designation '''PPG''' is a public [[airport]] located seven (7) miles (11.3&amp;nbsp;km) southwest of the [[central business district]] of [[Pago Pago, American Samoa|Pago Pago]], in the village and plains of [[Tafuna]] on the island of [[Tutuila]] in [[American Samoa]], an [[unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; were located at the edge of today's runway 8/26 and at what is today the Tafuna Industrial Park area.

=== Leone Airfield ===
In conjunction with the airstrip at Tafuna, an emergency Bomber airstrip was also constructed in the village of [[Leone, American Samoa|Leone]], known then as '''Leone Airfield''' in early 1943. It was situated on what is today Leone High School and Midkiff Elementary School on the western edge of Tutuila Island.  Leone Airfield was {{convert|6,000|ft|0}} x {{convert|500|ft|0}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Docks pg 212&quot;/&gt; and was completed on September 30, 1943.  It had a short life during the war. The airfield was abandoned in early 1945 due to turbulent air currents and lack of use. Only two aircraft were recorded to have landed and took off from the airfield. A visual outline of Leone Airfield can be seen from the air today with a straight clearance road starting from the WVUV-AM radio tower to Midkiff Elementary School.

=== Pago Pago International Airport ===
==== Pre-Jet Service ====
Pago Pago International Airport and the original Tafuna Airfield military facilities were first used for commercial trans pacific air service in November 1946 when [[Pan American Airways]] resumed service from Honolulu to Australia and New Zealand.  Pan American utilized Douglas [[DC-4]], and eventually upgraded to [[DC-7]]C aircraft in the 1956 (when Pago Pago International Airport was upgraded as a commercial airport) for its [[Honolulu]] / [[Canton Island]] / Pago Pago / [[Nadi International Airport|Nadi]] / [[Auckland]] &amp; [[Sydney]] route. This service was conducted using the outbased DC-7C aircraft Clipper ''Seven Seas'' N743PA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

It was also used for inter island air service between [[Faleolo International Airport|Faleolo]], Western Samoa and Pago Pago in 1959 by newly formed, Apia-based [[Polynesian Airlines]] and short-lived, Pago Pago-based [[Samoan Airways]] using ex-military Douglas C-47B-45-DK ([[DC-3]]D) type aircraft.

[[Tasman Empire Airways Limited]] or [[TEAL]], the predecessor to what is now [[Air New Zealand]] offered [[DC-6]] (eventually using [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]] aircraft in 1960) flights from [[Nadi]] to Pago Pago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==== The Jet Age ====
Pago Pago International Airport went through major re-construction in 1963 under the U.S. President Kennedy administration.  The WW II military-era runway designated 14/32 was converted to a taxiway and ramp area, and a new runway was constructed and designated 5/23 with a paved length of {{convert|9,000|ft|0}} and width of {{convert|150|ft|0}}.

&lt;br /&gt;
New terminal buildings and tarmac ramp areas were also constructed. Runway designation 9/27 which was the primary runway for commercial air service in the 1950s and early 1960s was deactivated after the newer, longer runway 5/23 was open for aircraft flights.  Pago Pago International Airport was opened to jet service in 1964 to stimulate tourism and a new local economy.

==== Trans Pacific Jet Service and height of Commercial Aviation ====
South Pacific jet service between Sydney (Australia), Auckland (New Zealand), Honolulu (Hawaii) and Papeete (Tahiti) were first offered by [[Pan American World Airways]] in 1964 using [[Boeing 707]] aircraft.  [[Air New Zealand]], which was already flying the Auckland / Nadi / Pago Pago / [[Papeete]] route using Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft shifted to [[DC-8]] aircraft in November 1965.  In 1970 [[American Airlines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; began flying the Honolulu / Pago Pago / Sydney route using Boeing 707 aircraft.  [[UTA French Airlines]] began [[DC-10]] service in 1975 between [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]] and Papeete, Tahiti via Pago Pago.  [[Continental Airlines]] also began DC-10 service from Honolulu to Sydney and Auckland via Pago Pago in 1979.

Pago Pago International Airport went through its peak in aviation between 1975 and 1985.  During this period Pan American (using [[Boeing 747]]'s), Air New Zealand (using DC-8's), UTA French Airlines (using DC-10's),  Continental Airlines (using DC-10's), [[Hawaiian Airlines]] (using a DC-8), [[South Pacific Island Airways]] (using Boeing 707's), [[Samoa Air]] (using a Boeing 707), [[Arrow Air]] (using a DC-8), [[Air Nauru]] ([[Boeing 737]] &amp; [[Boeing 727|727]]), and [[Air Pacific]] (using a [[BAC One-Eleven|BAC-11]]) were all prying the South Pacific via Pago Pago.  One could travel between Pago Pago and Honolulu for an airfare of US$99 one-way.

==== Cargo Commercial Aviation ====
Towards the end of its peak commercial passenger aviation period, Pago Pago International Airport also became an ideal refueling stopover for cargo carriers due to the low cost of fuel and landing fees at the time.  Cargo carriers such as [[Kalitta Air]], [[Evergreen International Airlines]], and [[Polar Air Cargo]] would provide at least daily Boeing 747 cargo flights to Pago Pago from the US and from Asia Pacific between 1990 and 2006.

==== Downturn in Airport usage and Travel ====
The airport was a vital link to the Samoan Islands until the runway at [[Faleolo International Airport]] in Independent [[Samoa]] was improved and lengthened to handle larger than [[Boeing 737]] type aircraft in 1984.  With a population that is 3 1/2 times greater than American Samoa plus greater emphasis that was put on tourism growth, international airline traffic particularly from Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific island countries began to shift from Pago Pago to Faleolo airport.  Airlines with flights from the US to Australia and New Zealand also started utilizing aircraft that did not require a refueling stopover in Pago Pago.  By the late 1980s and due to heavy competition and economics, only one passenger air carrier (Hawaiian Airlines) remained to service the Pago Pago trans pacific route.

==== Runway and Facility Expansion ====
Runway 9/27 was the primary commercial runway for aircraft in the 1950s and early 1960s.  The runway was deactivated after runway 5/23 was constructed and activated in 1964.  In the mid-1970s, runway 9/27 was rehabilitated, repaved and reactivated as runway 8/26 with {{convert|3,800|ft|0}} (length) by {{convert|100|ft|0}} (width) to function as a secondary runway and taxiway.  Runway 8/26 is widely used today by air taxi operators flying to Apia (Fagali'i and Faleolo), Ofu or Tau.

The Departure and Arrival terminal also went through a major expansion in the mid-1970s where buildings and space was doubled in size to handle more passengers.

To facilitate aircraft with large payload requirements and long distance flights, runway 5/23 was expanded in early 2001 from an original runway length of {{convert|9,000|ft|0}} to the current {{convert|10,000|ft|0}}.

[[File:N592HA.JPG|thumb|250px|Hawaiian Airlines operates 767-300 aircraft between Honolulu and Pago Pago]]

Hawaiian Airlines is the only major airline serving Pago Pago International Airport.  In 2004, with assistance from the American Samoa Government to promote and bring additional air carriers to Pago Pago, [[Aloha Airlines]] gave it a run by operating a Honolulu / Pago Pago / Rarotonga route.  However, the airline lasted 11 months and eventually pulled out of Pago Pago and other South Pacific routes it serviced due to financial issues.

Weekly Cargo flight from Honolulu, Hawaii is provided by [[Asia Pacific Airlines (United States)|Asia Pacific Airlines]]

Pago Pago International Airport is a frequent stopover for United States military aircraft flying in the South Pacific and is the only airport in the area with [[TACAN]] capabilities. 

Daily inter island flights between the Samoas are offered by [[Inter Island Airways]] and [[Polynesian Airlines]].

Due to American Samoa's distance from Hawaii and the US mainland, it is doubtful that any new major US airline will service this market in the future and compete directly with Hawaiian Airlines.  The economics and cost may not make sense.  However, the American Samoa Government is looking into legal means to overcome current US [[Cabotage]] rules that forbid foreign carriers from entering and servicing the Pago Pago / Honolulu or Pago Pago / Los Angeles route. Additionally, the government has recently{{when|date=April 2011}} requested [[Southwest Airlines]] to consider extending their forthcoming Honolulu route with the [[Boeing 737-800]] to include service to American Samoa at an undetermined future date.

== Status and Expansion ==
A new US$12+ million [[Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting]] (ARFF) Fire Crash station was completed in 2005.

A US$18+ million Hot Fire/Crash Training facility was constructed and completed in 2008 and was to be used to train ARFF personnel, and other Fire Crash personnel from various airports in the South Pacific.

In 2010, Pago Pago International airport underwent US$1+ million terminal remodeling and modernization with funding from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].  The Departure terminal, immigration, and [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) security and lounge areas were completely renovated and expanded to handled more passenger capacity and flow. 

Taxi Way Alpha (&quot;A&quot;) is currently undergoing resurfacing and is expected to be completed by mid-2011.

A new [[Control tower]] is in the planning and approval stage.  Future plans also call for construction of a [[Jet bridge]] to facilitate loading/unloading of passengers from large aircraft without endear the weather elements.
