A '''cherry picker''' (also known as a '''boom lift''', '''man lift''', '''basket crane''' or '''hydraladder'''), is a type of [[aerial work platform]] that consists of a platform or bucket at the end of a [[hydraulic]] lifting system.

== Design ==

It is often mounted on the back of a large vehicle such as a [[truck]] (in which case it may also be called a '''bucket truck'''), it can also be mounted on a flat back pick up van known as a '''Self Drive''', or sometimes on a stand-alone trailer or self-moving platform. The bucket is designed for a person to stand in and work from. Often a duplicate set of controls that are used to manipulate the position of the bucket will be available to the person in the bucket, allowing the operator to position himself. The lifting arms of some cherry pickers are capable of telescoping to adjust the reach of the device, usually with automatic safety controls to prevent tipping over.  Articulated boom lifts are more appropriate than stick booms when operating in tight spaces or when clearing nearby obstacles is necessary.

== Uses ==
Cherry pickers were originally designed for use in [[orchard]]s (though not just [[cherry]] orchards) where they are still used frequently.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.safetyline.wa.gov.au/pagebin/mechhazd0013.htm Reaching new heights in construction and horticulture]'', ''Safetyline Magazine'' (extract), [[Government of Western Australia]], Volume No. 20 (November 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; It lets the [[fruit picker]] pick fruit high in a tree with relative ease. Similar devices, also known as 'cherry pickers', are used to service [[telephone]], [[cable television]], and [[electrical]] equipment on [[utility pole]]s.  [[Christmas light]] displays and [[banner]]s can also be affixed with a cherry picker.

Some [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]] have a cherry picker, known as a snorkel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnwspaamfaa.com/Terminology4.htm fire Apparatus Terminology 4]&lt;/ref&gt; instead of a ladder. Some [[window cleaner]]s also use them. Cherry pickers are also used in [[mining]], [[construction]], exterior [[painting]], and sometimes by [[arborist]]s to work safely in otherwise unclimbable trees.

Cherry pickers have also been used in forms of entertainment. For example, [[Michael Jackson]] would generally begin live performances of his song &quot;[[Beat It]]&quot; on a moving cherry picker, with fans blowing, and has also somewhat daringly hung out of it while holding onto the bars with his hands and feet, for an added effect. In the film and television industry, cherry pickers are known as &quot;condors&quot; and are often used to suspend large lights above sets when not on a soundstage.
