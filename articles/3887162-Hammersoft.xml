==Content==
[[Jimmy Allen (musician)|Jimmy Allen]] was at the time just out of a relationship, and he wrote this, inspired from the anger that his girlfriend gave him. He wrote it before the band hit it big and before they were signed. His girlfriend later apologized to him since she told him to get a job and stop with his musical career. This song gives upbeat music to lyrics about his break-up. The chord progression is similar to the main chord progression in [[Suicidal Tendencies]]' &quot;I Saw Your Mommy&quot; which has led to accusations that Puddle of Mudd &quot;plagiarized&quot; the song.

In the album's insert is a photocopy of each song's original hand written lyrics. It shows the original name of the song: &quot;She Fucking Hates Me&quot;. The title was changed to make it more radio and TV friendly, however the line is heard in its original form in the unedited version of the song.
