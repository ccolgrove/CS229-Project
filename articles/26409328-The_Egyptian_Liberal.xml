| ShortSummary = During a memorial service for the 97 people killed in the bus crash, Francine and Stan have a clash over how to raise Steve in retrospect to Hayley running away. Francine wishes to be more lenient, but Stan is convinced that they need to be firm with him. They decide to have a BMX race to determine how to raise Steve. Stan falls down and severely injures himself at the start of the race, making Francine the winner. However, Stan creates a clone of Steve (after being inspired by Duper's clone after the real Duper died in a bus crash last episode), setting up a new contest with Francine to determine who has better parenting skills. Francine raises the original Steve very passively, but Stan raises Steve's clone, Steve-A-Rino very strict and manly. However, Steve-A-Rino later becomes a [[sociopath]] due to Stan's strict training and attempts to kill the original Steve in hopes of replacing him, forcing Stan and Francine to find the real Steve and stop his murderous clone before it's too late. In the end, Steve is found and Steve-a-rino is shot. Meanwhile, Roger selfishly decides to go after Haley and Jeff to steal the money they tricked Stan into giving them for his own idiotic ideas. When they refuse to give him the money, Roger begins making an annoying noise; they flee via helicopter to a private boat, only to find he is the captain. They flee again. Finally confronting them at the Great Wall of China, the dumbass finds that Haley and Jeff have being using their money get the hell away from him, making his victory a rather hollow one as there was only a few hundred left.
