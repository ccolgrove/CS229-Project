The [[Apple II series|Apple II]] was introduced on April 16, 1977 at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because it came with character cell based color graphics and an [[open architecture|open]] [[computer architecture|architecture]]. While early models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface, the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple II History Chapter 4 | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | author=Steven Weyhrich| date=April 21, 2002 | accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first &quot;[[killer application|killer app]]&quot; of the business worldâthe [[VisiCalc]] [[spreadsheet]] program.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemvc&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line. The company introduced the ill-fated [[Apple III]] in May 1980 in an attempt to compete with [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]] in the business and corporate computing market.&lt;ref&gt;Coventry, Joshua.

Jobs and several Apple employees including [[Jef Raskin]] visited [[Xerox PARC]] in December 1979 to see the [[Xerox Alto]]. Xerox granted Apple engineers three days of access to the PARC facilities in return for the option to buy 100,000 shares (800,000 split-adjusted shares) of Apple at the pre-IPO price of $10 a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2000/foth000918.htm|title=Fool.com: How Xerox Forfeited the PC War|work=The Motley Fool|author=Landley, Rob|date=September 18, 2000|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface ([[GUI]]), and development of a GUI began for the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/|title=Apple at 30&amp;nbsp;â 1976 to 1986 | work=World of Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Jobs began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978 but in 1982 he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting, and took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A turf war broke out between Lisa's &quot;corporate shirts&quot; and Jobs' &quot;pirates&quot; over which product would ship first and save Apple. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be offered at a reasonable price, and [[PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package. The Mac was particularly powerful in this market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm|title=When was desktop publishing invented?|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Timeline of Apple II family|Timeline of Macintosh models}}
[[File:Macintosh portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]] was Apple's first &quot;portable&quot; Macintosh computer, released in 1989.]]
Having learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky [[Macintosh Portable]] in 1989, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991. The Macintosh Portable was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed {{convert|7.5|kg}} with a 12-hour battery life. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001.

The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.

Following the success of the [[Macintosh LC]], Apple introduced the [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, a low-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]] offering, and the ill-fated [[Performa]] line that was sold in several confusing configurations and software bundles to avoid competing with the various consumer outlets such as [[Sears]], [[Price Club]], and [[Wal-Mart]], who were the primary dealers for these models. The result was disastrous for Apple as consumers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Macintosh Performa|url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html|publisher=Vectronics Apple World|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time Apple experimented with a number of other failed consumer targeted products including [[QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, all of this proved too-little-too-late for Apple as their market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Apple saw the [[Apple II series]] as too expensive to produce, while taking away sales from the low end Macintosh.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11|title=Apple II History Chap 11|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]] with a single [[expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot; /&gt; Apple stopped selling the [[Apple IIe]] in 1993.

Microsoft continued to gain market share with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while Apple was delivering a richly engineered, but expensive, experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/3EC02E78-FD4D-4CDF-92A0-9C4CBDFAB3D2.html|title=1990â1995: Why the World Went Windows|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response.

=== 1994â1997: Attempts at reinvention ===

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[Palm Pilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]
By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. Apple had also begun to experiment in providing a Mac-only online portal which they called [[eWorld]], developed in collaboration with [[America Online]] and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as [[CompuServe]]. The Macintosh platform was itself becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking, and several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors like [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform, or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html|title=1990â1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with IBM and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]]. The goal was to create a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple's software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind, thus countering Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use IBM's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs became the interim CEO and began restructuring the company's product line.

At the 1997 [[Macworld Expo]], Steve Jobs announced that Apple would join Microsoft to release new versions of [[Microsoft Office]] for the Macintosh, and that Microsoft made a $150 million investment in non-voting Apple stock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/ca/press/1997/08/AppleMicrosoft.html Microsoft and Apple Affirm Commitment to Build Next Generation Software for Macintosh], ''Apple Inc.'', August 6, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998â2005: Return to profitability ===

On August 15, 1998, Apple introduced a new all-in-one computer reminiscent of the [[Macintosh 128K]]: the [[iMac]].

The new version was visually different from its predecessor in that it eliminated the flat silver back, and large antenna square for a curved glossy black or white back. Following complaints from many people, the headphone jack was changed from a recessed jack to a flush jack to be compatible with more styles of headphones. The software capabilities changed as well, with the release of the new iPhone came the release of Apple's App Store; the store provided applications for download that were compatible with the iPhone. On April 24, 2009, the App Store surpassed one billion downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/04/24appstore.html |title=Apple's Revolutionary App Store Downloads Top One Billion in Just Nine Months |publisher=Apple.com |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2009, at Apple's annual worldwide developers conference, the [[iPhone 3GS]] was announced, providing an incremental update to the device including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control. On June 7, 2010, at WWDC 2010, the [[iPhone 4]] was announced, which Apple says is its &quot;'biggest leap we've taken&quot; since the original iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/07/apple.wwdc.preview/index.html|title=Apple unveils iPhone 4, 'biggest leap we've taken' since first model|work=CNN|author=Brandon Griggs, John D.

The phone includes an all-new design, 960x640 display, Apple's A4 processor used in the [[iPad]], a [[gyroscope]] for enhanced gaming, 5MP camera with LED flash, front-facing [[VGA]] camera and [[FaceTime]] video calling. Shortly after the release of the iPhone 4, it was realized by consumers that the new iPhone had reception issues. This is due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phones cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The current fix for this issue was a &quot;[[IPhone 4 Bumper|Bumper Case]]&quot; for the phone distributed for free to all iPhone 4 owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook [[Nokia]] to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume.&lt;ref name=ftover&gt;{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Andrew|title=Apple overtakes Nokia in smartphone stakes|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4d7fd1e2-b38e-11e0-b56c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1SlYjA4IS|accessdate=July 21, 2011|newspaper=Financial Times|date=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first iPhone model to feature the [[Apple A5]] chip, as well as the first offered on the [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] network (joining [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] and [[Verizon Wireless]] as the United States carriers offering iPhone models). On October 19, 2011, Apple announced an agreement with [[C Spire Wireless]] to sell the iPhone 4S with that carrier in the near future, marking the first time the iPhone was officially supported on a regional carrier's network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2394938,00.asp#fbid=fz8D_P_4GCf|title=Regional Carrier C Spire to Sell iPhone 4S|publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]], (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, includes outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and plays video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title=Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007 a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 15, 2008 a software update was released, which allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, alongside the release of the new line of iPod devices for the year, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache]] media downloaded. Apple with the Apple TV has added another device to its portfolio that runs on its A4 processor along with the iPad and the iPhone. The memory included in the device is the half of the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the [[iPad]], [[iPhone 3GS]], [[iPod touch]] 3G, and [[iPod touch]] 4G.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99.

=== Software ===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[Mac OS X]], the latest version being [[Mac OS X Lion]] (version 10.7). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its Mac OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iDVD]], [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]], iTunes, [[GarageBand]], and [[iWeb]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both Mac OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[Mac OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; [[WebObjects]], [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] Web [[application server]]; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Studio]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro|Logic]], a comprehensive music toolkit and [[Shake (software)|Shake]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[MobileMe]] (formerly [[.Mac]]) that bundles personal [[web page]]s, [[email]], [[social networking service|Groups]], [[iDisk]], [[backup (backup software)|backup]], [[iSync]], and Learning Center online tutorials. MobileMe is a subscription-based internet suite that capitalizes on the ability to store personal data on an online server and thereby keep all web-connected devices in sync.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/|title=Apple.com&amp;nbsp;â MobileMe&amp;nbsp;â Features|accessdate=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced at MacWorld Expo 2009, [[iWork.com]] allows iWork users to upload documents for sharing and collaboration.

== Culture ==
=== Corporate ===

Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of what a [[corporate culture]] should look like in organizational hierarchy (flat versus tall, casual versus formal attire, etc.). Other highly successful firms with similar cultural aspects from the same period include [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Microsoft]]. Originally, the company stood in opposition to staid competitors like [[IBM]] by default, thanks to the influence of its founders; Steve Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple was a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the [[1984 (television commercial)|&quot;1984&quot; TV ad]], this trait had become a key way the company attempted to differentiate itself from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of chief executives, each with his own idea of what Apple should be, some of its original character has arguably been lost, but Apple still has a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably draws talented people into its employ, especially after Jobs' return. To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program, awarding individuals who made extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to a few individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

Numerous employees of Apple have cited that projects without Jobs' involvement often take longer than projects with his involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another presents the image of Jobs &quot;wandering the hall with a [[flame thrower]] in hand, asking random people 'do you work on [[MobileMe]]?'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianworkingatapple&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jan/02/apple-macworld-lookback|title=Enjoying the show, avoiding the flamethrower: life inside Apple|first=Chuq|last=von Rospach|date=January 2, 2009|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having best-in-class employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]] who was Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011, was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet he had no control the inventory in his stores (which is done company wide by then-COO and now CEO [[Tim Cook]] who has a background in supply-chain management). This is the opposite of [[General Electric]]'s corporate culture which has created well-rounded managers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of [[Tim Cook]] who joined the company in 1998 and ascended to his present position as CEO, Apple has developed an extremely efficient and effective supply chain which has been ranked as the world's best for the past four years (2007-2010). The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enables it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories; Apple's profit margins have been 40 percent compared with 10-20 percent for most other hardware companies in 2011. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational edge is âNobody wants to buy sour milkâ.

While this brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product, Apple appears not to have gone out of its way to create it. At one time, [[Apple evangelist]]s were actively engaged by the company, but this was after the phenomenon was already firmly established. Apple evangelist [[Guy Kawasaki]] has called the brand fanaticism &quot;something that was stumbled upon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huba, Jackie; McConnell, Ben. [http://www.creatingcustomerevangelists.com/resources/evangelists/guy_kawasaki.asp The father of evangelism marketing].&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has, however, supported the continuing existence of a network of [[Macintosh User Group|Mac User Groups]] in most major and many minor centers of population where Mac computers are available.

Mac users would meet at the European [[Apple Expo]] and the San Francisco [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo]] trade shows where Apple traditionally introduced new products each year to the industry and public until Apple pulled out of both events. While the conferences continue, Apple does not have official representation there. Mac developers, in turn, continue to gather at the annual Apple [[Worldwide Developers Conference]].

[[Apple Store]] openings can draw crowds of thousands, with some waiting in line as much as a day before the opening or flying in from other countries for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/12/61513 |title=Apple Store: Chain of Devotion |work=Wired |author=Kahney, Leander |date=December 10, 2003 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York City [[Fifth Avenue]] &quot;Cube&quot; store had a line as long as half a mile; a few Mac fans took the opportunity of the setting to propose marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifoapplestore.com/stores/fifth_avenue/index.html |title=ifo Apple Store â Fifth Avenue Grand Opening |publisher=Ifoapplestore.com |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ginza]] opening in Tokyo was estimated in the thousands with a line exceeding eight city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple in Osaka: another huge opening|url=http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|publisher=JapanConsuming|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528200249/http://www.japanconsuming.com/news/040828.html|archivedate=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Sculley told ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in 1997: &quot;People talk about technology, but Apple was a marketing company.

Research in 2002 by [[Nielsen Online|NetRatings]] indicate that the average Apple consumer was usually more affluent and better educated than other PC company consumers. The research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average Apple Inc. products are more expensive than other PC products.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Fried (writer)|Fried, Ian]].

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since adopted [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and other industry standards in its computers and was in some cases a leader in the adoption of standards such as USB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-spec7.html |title=Standards and specs: The ins and outs of USB |publisher=IBM |date=April 26, 2005 |author=Seebach, Peter |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that has seen widespread industry adoption after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html|title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the first Apple Store opened, Apple has sold third party accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/may/20retail.html |title=Apple Marks Second Anniversary of Retail Stores |publisher=Apple.com |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows, for instance, [[Nikon]] and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] to sell their Mac-compatible digital cameras and camcorders inside the store.

Books from [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], who publishes the [[For Dummies]] series of instructional books, are a notable exception, however. The publisher's line of books were banned from Apple Stores in 2005 because Steve Jobs disagreed with their decision to publish an unauthorized Jobs biography, ''[[iCon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, Katie: [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/30/technology/30apple.html Steve Jobs's Review of His Biography: Ban It], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Apple campus has six buildings that total {{convert|850000|ft2|m2}} and was built in 1993 by Sobrato Development Cos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/10/03/story4.html | first=Sharon | last=Simonson | title=Apple gobbles up Cupertino office space | date=October 2, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future plans====
In 2006, Apple announced its intention to build a second campus on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} assembled from various contiguous plots (east of N Wolfe Road between Pruneridge Avenue and Vallco Parkway). Later aquisitions increased this to 175 acres. The new campus, also in Cupertino, will be about {{convert|1|mi}} east of the current campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Bay Area: Apple Inc. | work = traveldk.com | publisher = Dorling Kindersley Limited | url = http://traveldk.com/san-francisco/bay-area/member/apple-inc | accessdate =May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new campus building will be designed by [[Norman Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Appleâs New Headquarters Will Be Designed by Norman Foster Read more: Apple's New Headquarters to be Designed by Norman Foster | work=Inhabitat | url= http://inhabitat.com/apples-new-headquarters-will-be-designed-by-norman-foster/ | accessdate =June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2011, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs. The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building (with a cafÃ© for 3,000 sitting people integrated) surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure). There will be additional buildings such as an auditorium, R&amp;D facilities, a fitness center and a dedicated generating plant as primary source of electricity (powered by natural gas and other more environmentally sound means).

Since the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] to the more modern '[[Get a Mac]]' adverts, Apple has been recognized in the past for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products, though its [[Apple Inc. advertising#Criticism|advertising has been criticized]] for the claims of some more recent campaigns, particularly 2005 Power Mac ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devproconnections.com/article/apple/bbb-tells-apple-to-halt-misleading-ads.aspx|title=BBB Tells Apple to Halt Misleading Ads}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3797261.stm|title=Apple Power Mac ads 'misleading' | work=BBC News | date=June 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|title=UK watchdog clears Apple ads}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and iPhone ads in Britain.

==== Name ====
According to Steve Jobs, Apple was so named because Jobs was coming back from an apple farm, and he was on a [[fruitarian]] diet. He thought the name was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Comparison of Apple Inc. logos}}
Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree.

Almost immediately, though, this was replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. While Jobs liked the logo, he insisted it be in color to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple logo was designed with a bite so that it wouldn't be recognized as another fruit. The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics  in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising|work= The Independent |publisher=www.independent.co.uk |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | location=London | date=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html|title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff | date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Leavitt|2007|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, with the roll-out of the new iMac, Apple discontinued the rainbow theme and began to use monochromatic themes, nearly identical in shape to its previous rainbow incarnation, on various products, packaging and advertising. An [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 2001â2003, and a Glass-themed version has been used since 2003.

Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were [[The Beatles|Beatles]] fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Moses | first = Asher || title = Who was Steve Jobs the man? | publisher = theage.com.au | url = http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/who-was-steve-jobs-the-man-20111007-1lcrx.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tearful memories for Apple co-founder | publisher = theage.com.au | url = http://media.theage.com.au/news/world-news/tearful-memories-for-apple-cofounder-2675550.html | accessdate =October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Apple Inc. had trademark issues with [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]], a multimedia company started by The Beatles in 1967, involving their name and logo. This resulted in a [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer|series of lawsuits]] and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with their most recent law suit in 2007.

It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC vinyl plastic and brominated flame retardants. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot; /&gt;

In the first edition, released in August 2006, Apple scored 2.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/how-the-companies-line-up/Previous-editions/how-the-companies-line-1/|title=How the companies line up|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category &quot;Striding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |date= |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon&quot;, adding that Apple at the time was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] rates Apple highest amongst producers of notebook computers, and fairly well compared to producers of desktop computers and [[LCD displays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macobserver.com/article/2007/01/08.6.shtml EPA Gives Apple Silver Rating on Environment] The Mac Observer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;redgreenpeace&quot;&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/1/6/6507 EPA information should make GreenPeace red-faced over Apple targeting], [[Ars Technica]].

In June 2007, Apple upgraded the [[MacBook Pro]], replacing [[cold cathode]] fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit [[LCD]] displays with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-free [[LED]] backlit LCD displays and [[arsenic]]-free glass,&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-environmental-news&quot;/&gt; and has since done this for all notebooks. Apple has also phased out BFRs and PVCs from various internal components.&lt;ref name=&quot;agreenapple&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;green_notebooks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/mac/green-notebooks/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â Mac&amp;nbsp;â Green Notebooks|year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/graphics.html|title=Apple: MacBook Pro Graphics|accessdate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple offers information about the emissions, materials, and electrical usage of each product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple â Environment â Reports|url=http://www.apple.com/environment/reports/|publisher=Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, BFRs and had an efficient power adapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-environmental-news&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/environment/progress/|title=Apple â Environment â Environmental Progress|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Apple upgraded the iMac and MacBook, replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlit LCD displays with mercury-free LED backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/imac/environment.html|title=iMac and the Environment |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means all Apple computers have mercury free LED backlit displays, arsenic-free glass and are without PVC cables. All Apple computers also have EPEAT Gold status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-environmental-news&quot; /&gt;
In october 2011 chinese authorities have ordered
an Apple supplier to close part of its

In 2006, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' reported that [[sweatshop]] conditions existed in some factories in China, where the contract manufacturers, [[Foxconn]] and [[Inventec]], operate the factories that produce the iPod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html |title=The Stark Reality of iPod's Chinese Factories |publisher=Mail Online |date=August 18, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that one complex of factories that assembles the iPod (among other items), for instance, had over 200,000 workers that lived and worked in the factory, with employees regularly working more than 60 hours per week. The article also reported that workers made around $100 per month and were required to live on the premises and pay for rent and food from the company, which generally amounted to a little over half of workers' earnings.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpsweatshop&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html |title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported |publisher=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Kahney |first=Leander |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 |title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge |publisher=Wired |date=June 13, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |unused_data=DUPLICATE DATA: last=Jason |last=Dean |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog |title=The Forbidden City of Terry Gou |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 11, 2007 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Joel|title=Where the Workers Who Made Your iPhone Sleep at Night|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/foxconn-photo-gallery/?pid=731&amp;viewall=true|publisher=Wired|accessdate=November 13, 2010|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the allegations, Apple launched an investigation and worked with their [[manufacture]]rs to ensure that conditions were acceptable to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Morphy |first=Ericka |url=http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/61454.html |title=Apple, IT and the Specter of Sweatshop Labor |publisher=Mac New World |date=January 31, 2008 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding [[worker's rights]], slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply.
