Many of Serkis' most prominent roles, including those in ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''King Kong'' and ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'', have involved him being the subject of [[motion capture]] to animate and voice a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] character.

==Early life==
Serkis, one of five children, was born and brought up in [[Ruislip Manor]] in west London. His mother, Lylie (nÃ©e Weech), was English and taught disabled children; his father, Clement Serkis, was an [[Iraq]]i-born gynaecologist of [[Armenian people|Armenian]] descent.&lt;ref name=timesonline&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article5324256.ece Andy Serkis comes out from behind Gollum and King Kong by Times Online]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oneringref&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=xoanon|first=|coauthors=|title=Andy Serkis Talks LOTR|pages=|publisher=TheOneRing.net|date=1 February 2001|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2001/02/02/27644-andy-serkis-talks-lotr-2/|accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hpa&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|coauthors=|title=Andy Serkis: Beastie boy|pages=|publisher=The Telegraph|date=16 March 2008|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3671900/Andy-Serkis-Beastie-boy.html|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family's original surname had been &quot;Sarkisian&quot;.&lt;ref name=rer&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nepales|first=Ruben V.|coauthors=|title=Only in Hollywood Andy Serkis: From Gollum, King Kong to Einstein|pages=|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=6 July 2007|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h1U1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3049,2317161&amp;dq=another-passion-for-the-actor&amp;hl=en|accessdate=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serkis was educated at [[St Benedict's School]], [[Ealing]], and then started studying visual arts at [[Lancaster University]], choosing theatre as a second subject so he could design posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Larkin |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2022980/How-Andy-Serkis-brought-rebellious-chimp-life-Rise-Planet-Apes.html#ixzz1UECF8lq7 |title=Rise of the Planet of the Apes: How Andy Serkis brought a rebellious chimp to life &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serkis was a member of [[The County College]], and part of the student radio station [[Bailrigg FM]].

As part of the first year of his visual arts course at Lancaster University, Serkis had to choose a secondary subject as part of a broad-range based arts foundation. He chose to study theatre and joined the Nuffield Studio, getting involved designing and producing plays. Having agreed to act in a couple of productions, towards the end of his first year he played the lead role in [[Barrie Keeffe]]'s play ''[[Gotcha]],'' as a rebellious teenager holding a teacher hostage. As a result he changed his major subject in the subsequent two years to acting, constructing his modular Independent Studies Degree around acting, set design studying [[Stanislavski]] and [[Brecht]], and minor modules in art and visual graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=var authorId = &quot;&quot; by Ken P. |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/383/383888p1.html |title=An Interview with Andy Serkis - Movies Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.movies.ign.com |date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In his third year at college, Serkis joined the backstage team at the local Dukes Playhouse to earn his [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] card. On graduation, although advised to take a one year post-graduate acting course, he joined Dukes as an actor, and under director Jonathan Petherbridge who used workshops based upon the methods of [[Augusto Boal]], spent 18 months acting in a broad range of productions from [[Brecht]] through [[Shakespeare]] to modern British playwrights.&lt;ref name=UKMoviesP2/&gt;

After 18 months, and having gained his Equity card, Serkis joined a series of touring companies, including productions of: ''[[Bouncers]]'' opposite [[Hull Truck]]; Florizel in ''[[The Winter's Tale]];'' and the fool in ''[[King Lear]]'' with [[Max Stafford-Clark]].&lt;ref name=UKMoviesP2&gt;{{cite web|author=var authorId = &quot;&quot; by Ken P. |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/383/383888p2.html |title=An Interview with Andy Serkis - Movies Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.movies.ign.com |date=1964-04-20 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s he settled in London, and took roles in ''Dogboy,'' the [[Royal Court Theatre]]'s production of ''Mojo,'' Bill Sykes in ''[[Oliver Twist]],'' and [[Wilson Milam]]'s 1997 production of ''[[Hurlyburly]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], opposite [[Rupert Graves]] and [[David Tennant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=var authorId = &quot;&quot; by Ken P. |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/383/383888p3.html |title=An Interview with Andy Serkis - Movies Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.movies.ign.com |date=1964-04-20 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many British actors, Serkis made the move to television through the [[BBC]], appearing in the joint BBC/[[HBO]] production of ''[[Einstein and Eddington]].'' Serkis played [[Albert Einstein]], following the development of his theory of relativity, while David Tennant played British scientist Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Arthur Eddington]]. Serkis joined director [[Mike Leigh]]'s ensemble for two film productions, and appeared in the 1999 romantic comedy ''[[Loop (film)|Loop]]'' alongside [[Susannah York]].

Serkis's most critically acclaimed roles have been [[Gollum|SmÃ©agol/Gollum]], in [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' movie trilogy]] (2001â03), the title character in the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 version]] of ''[[King Kong]]'', in which he provided both the voice and movements for the [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]] character as well as the ship's cook, and as 1970s new wave star [[Ian Dury]] in ''[[Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll (film)|Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll]]'' (2010). &lt;!-- His performance as Gollum is ranked number 10 on [[Premiere Magazine|''Premiere'']]'s &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time&quot;. CITATION NEEDED --&gt;

His work on ''The Lord of the Rings'' started a debate on the legitimacy of CGI-assisted acting. Some critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Poole 12:01AM GMT 10 Feb 2003 Comments |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3589692/Can-Gollum-get-the-precious-Oscar-nod.html |title=Can Gollum get the precious Oscar nod? |publisher=Telegraph |date=2003-02-10 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; felt Serkis should have been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], since his voice, body language, and facial expressions were used. There is the argument that his CGI actions were partially, or in some cases fully, animated without his movements, but the same is true for actors in a traditional movie with CGI (uncredited, Serkis also voices the [[Witch King of Angmar]], as well as several [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orc]] characters).

Serkis worked with game developers [[Ninja Theory]] on the 2007 release ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'', providing the motion capture and voice for King Bohan (the game's main villain), as well as acting as Dramatic Director for the game. He has played 30 roles in film and television productions. One of his earliest feature film appearances was alongside [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] in ''[[The Jolly Boys' Last Stand]]''.

[[Image:Andy Serkis - King Kong.jpg|right|thumb|Serkis in his [[Motion capture|mocap]] suit for [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'']]]]
Serkis was cast as [[serial killer]] [[Ian Brady]] in the [[BAFTA]]-nominated ''[[Longford (film)|Longford]]'', co-starring [[Samantha Morton]] as [[Myra Hindley]] and [[Jim Broadbent]] as [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]]. The film was attacked by relatives of Brady's and Hindley's victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/print55625 Sunday Herald] {{Dead link|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mother of Keith Bennett, whose body has never been found, publicly criticized Serkis for requesting a meeting with Brady in preparation for the role. Serkis only portrayed Brady in two scenes in the film â both while he was in prison and meeting with Longford, urging him not to support Hindley as she is a manipulative woman who will &quot;destroy&quot; him.

In 2006, Serkis appeared in the role of Mr Grin in the film rendition of [[Anthony Horowitz]]'s [[Alex Rider]] novel ''[[Stormbreaker (film)|Stormbreaker]]''. In 2006, he was in the film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' as Mr. Alley, assistant to [[Nikola Tesla]], and as the voice of Spike, one of the henchrats in the [[Aardman Animations]] film ''[[Flushed Away]]''. In 2006 Serkis appeared in [[Jim Threapleton]]'s improvised feature film, ''[[Extraordinary Rendition (2007 film, UK)|Extraordinary Rendition]]'', which premiered in 2007.

Serkis appeared in ''[[Sugarhouse (film)|Sugarhouse]]'', a low-budget independently made film, playing local crime lord Hoodwink, who terrorises an east London housing estate. For the role, Serkis shaved his head and had sessions lasting 20 hours each to have temporary tattoos stencilled onto his body. The film premiered at the 2007 Edinburgh Festival and released in the UK on 24 August 2007.

In 2007, Serkis provided the voice over for ''[[Monkey Business (TV series)|Monkey Business]]'', [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] broadcast for three weeks from 13â31 August 2007. This series is about [[Monkey World]], the popular [[ape]] and [[monkey]] [[sanctuary]] and [[zoo]] near [[Wool, Dorset]]. Serkis will reunite with Peter Jackson as a cast member in Jackson's and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Tintin (2009 film)|Tintin]]'' trilogy, based on ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn]]''. Filming began in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jay A.

In 2010, Serkis was cast as William Burke for the [[John Landis]] film ''[[Burke and Hare (film)|Burke and Hare]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Submitted by DavidFullam on Thu, 01/21/2010â12:57&amp;nbsp;pm. |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35442/new-burke-and-hare-casting-news |title=New Burke and Hare Casting News |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite [[Simon Pegg]]. 

In 2010, Serkis features in the TV series ''The Accused'', in &quot;Liam's Story&quot;, written by [[Danny Brocklehurst]] and Jimmy McGovern. He plays &quot;Caesar&quot; in the 20th Century Fox science-fiction film ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20743 |title=Andy Serkis Grabs a Banana and Becomes King of 'Planet of the Apes' |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, it was confirmed that Serkis would reprise the role of [[Gollum]] in the two-part ''[[The Hobbit (2012 film)|The Hobbit]]'' films which will be released in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/jan/11/the-hobbit-ian-mckellen-andy-serkis|title=Sir Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis sign up for The Hobbit|date=11 January 2011|work=Guardian|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
