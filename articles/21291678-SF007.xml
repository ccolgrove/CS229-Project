'''Windows 3.1x''' is a series of [[16-bit application|16-bit]] [[operating system]]s produced by [[Microsoft]] for use on [[personal computer]]s. The series began with Windows 3.1, which was first sold during March 1992 as a successor to [[Windows 3.0]]. Further editions were released between 1992 and 1994 until the series was superseded by [[Windows 95]].

&lt;/div&gt;

===Base version===
''Windows 3.1'' (originally codenamed ''[[Janus (mythology)|Janus]]'',{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} of which two betas were published), released on April 6, 1992, includes a [[TrueType]] [[typeface|font]] system (and a set of highly legible fonts), which effectively made Windows a viable [[desktop publishing]] platform for the first time. Similar functionality was available for [[Windows 3.0]] through the [[Adobe Type Manager]] (ATM) font system from [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]].

Windows 3.1 was designed to have [[backward compatibility]] with older Windows platforms. As with [[Windows 3.0]], version 3.1 had [[File Manager (Windows)|File Manager]] and [[Program Manager]], but unlike all previous versions, Windows 3.1 and later support [[32-bit disk access]], cannot run in [[real mode]], and included [[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]] instead of [[Reversi]] (though Reversi was included in some copies).

Windows 3.1 Multimedia PC Version (Beta only, released Nov 1992 â codenamed Bombay) Included a media viewer, and the ability to play video files. It was targeted to the new multi-media PC and included sound and video integration with CD-ROM support.

===Versions with special font support===
A special version named ''Windows 3.1 for Central and Eastern Europe'' was released that allowed the use of Cyrillic and had fonts with diacritical marks characteristic of Central and Eastern European languages. Microsoft introduced its own [[code page|codepage]] ([[Windows-1250]]) and supported its use in violation of many countries' ISO standards (''e.g.'', the official [[Polish language|Polish]] codepage is [[ISO-8859-2]], which was ignored by Microsoft but is supported by contemporary [[Internet Explorer]] versions). Similarly, Microsoft also released ''Windows 3.1J'' with support for the [[Japanese language]], which shipped 1.46 million copies in its first year on the market (1993) in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Virginia Kouyoumdjian|title= DOS/V, Windows, Prices, and the Future...|url=http://www.japaninc.com/cpj/magazine/issues/1994/aug94/08trend.html|publisher=Computing Japan|date=August 1994|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Windows 3.11===
On December 31, 1993, Microsoft released an update for Windows 3.1 known as Windows 3.11. Thus, ''Windows 3.11'' is not a standalone version of Windows, but rather a software update from Windows 3.1, much like modern Windows [[service pack]]s. For those who did not own Windows 3.1, full disk sets of Windows 3.11 were available at the time.{{fact|date=June 2011}}

===Modular Windows===
''[[Microsoft Modular Windows|Modular Windows]]'' is a special version of ''Windows 3.1'', designed to run on the [[Tandy Video Information System]].

==Windows 3.2==
In 1993, Microsoft released a [[Simplified Chinese character|Simplified Chinese]] version of Windows for the [[China|Chinese]] market. The updated system identified itself as ''Windows 3.2''. Thus, Windows 3.2 is the Chinese version of Windows 3.11. The update was limited to this language version, as it fixed only issues related to the complex writing system of the [[Chinese language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Windows Simplified Chinese 3.2 Upgrade Is Available|url= http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;129451|publisher=Microsoft|date=30 October 2003|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Windows 3.2 was generally sold by computer manufacturers with a ten-disk version of [[MS-DOS]] that also had Simplified Chinese characters in basic output and some translated utilities.

==Windows for Workgroups==
[[Image:Windows for Workgroups.png|thumb|right|Network capabilities of Windows for Workgroups 3.11]]

Windows for Workgroups is an extension that allowed users to share their resources and to request those of others without a centralized authentication server. It used the [[Server Message Block|SMB]] protocol over [[NetBIOS]].

===Windows for Workgroups 3.1===
''Windows for Workgroups 3.1'' (originally codenamed ''Winball'' and later ''Sparta''), released in October 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows for Workgroups Version History|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/126746| publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, features native networking support. Windows for Workgroups 3.1 is an extended version of Windows 3.1 that comes with [[Server message block|SMB]] file sharing support via the [[NetBIOS]] based [[NetBIOS Frames protocol|NBF]] and/or [[IPX]] network transport protocols, includes the [[Hearts (Windows)|Hearts]] card game, and introduced VSHARE.386, the [[Vxd|Virtual Device Driver]] version of the [[SHARE.EXE]] [[Terminate and Stay Resident]] program.

===Windows for Workgroups 3.11===
''Windows for Workgroups 3.11'' (originally codenamed ''Snowball'') was released on August 11, 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 3.1|url=http://www.guidebookgallery.org/guis/windows/win31| publisher=GUIdebook|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and shipped in November 1993&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows history|url=http://members.fortunecity.com/pcmuseum/windows.htm|publisher=PC Museum|date=17 June 2002|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It supported [[32-bit file access]], full 32-bit network redirectors, and the VCACHE.386 file cache, shared between them. The standard execution mode of the Windows kernel was discontinued in Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

A [[Winsock]] package was required to support [[TCP/IP]] [[computer network|networking]] in Windows 3.x. Usually third-party packages were used, but in August 1994, Microsoft released an add-on package (codenamed ''Wolverine'') that provided TCP/IP support in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Wolverine was a 32-bit stack (accessible from 16-bit Windows application via WinSock [[thunk]]s), which gave it superior performance to most of the third-party TCP/IP Windows stacks available. However, it was only compatible with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and lacked support for dial-up. The Wolverine stack was an early version of the TCP/IP stack that would later ship with Windows 95, and provided an early testbed for the 16-to-32-bit compatibility layer that was crucial to Windows 95's success.

==Add-ons==
===Video for Windows===
{{Main|Video for Windows}}

Video for Windows was first introduced in November 1992 as a reaction to [[Apple Computer]]'s [[QuickTime]] technology which added digital video to the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform. Costing around $200&lt;ref name='Issue 80'&gt;{{cite book|last=Future Publishing|first=|authorlink=| coauthors=|title=PC Plus|publisher=|date=May 1993|location=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the software included editing and encoding programs for use with video input boards. A runtime version for viewing videos only was also made available. Originally released as a free add-on to Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11, it then became an integral component of [[Windows 95]] and later.
Like QuickTime there were three components in Video for Windows. The technology introduced a file format designed to store digital video, [[Audio Video Interleave]] (AVI). The technology provided an [[application programming interface]] that allowed [[software developer]]s working on the Windows platform to add the ability to play or manipulate [[digital video]] to their own applications. Lastly, it included a suite of software for playing and manipulating digital video.

===Windows for Pen Computing===
{{Main|Windows for Pen Computing}}

Windows for Pen Computing was a series of [[Microsoft]]-produced add-ons for [[Microsoft Windows]] versions in the mid-1990s with additional tools for [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s. Windows for Pen Computing (also known as ''Pen Windows'' and ''W4PC'') was developed as Microsoft's [[Pen computing]] response to the [[PenPoint OS]] by [[GO Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio00.html#EllerM98|title=[[Barbarians Led by Bill Gates]]|author=[[Marlin Eller]] and Jennifer Edstrom|publisher=Owl Books|year=1998|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Windows for Pen Computing was rendered obsolete by the [[Tablet computer|Tablet PC]] support for [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] in 2002.

===Win32s===
{{Main|Win32s}}

Windows 3.1x was given limited compatibility with the then-new 32-bit [[Windows API]] used by [[Windows NT]] by another add-on package, [[Win32s]]. There was  rumor that Microsoft did not want to increment any mainstream Windows 3.1x version to something like &quot;Windows 3.2&quot; because it could be confused with the [[Win32]] API or otherwise distract consumers from upgrading to a &quot;real 32-bit OS&quot; like the then-upcoming Windows 95 was, though [[Windows NT 3.1]] and [[Windows NT 3.5|3.5]] were both 32-bit operating systems that looked similar in appearance. For testing of the new Win32s functions the game [[FreeCell]] was included.

==Applications==
Windows 3.1x introduced new possibilities for applications, especially multimedia applications. During this era, Microsoft developed a new range of software that was implemented on this operating environment, called [[Microsoft Home]], [[Microsoft Bob]] being one of the programs.

===Program Manager===
{{Main|Program Manager}}

Program Manager was included in all versions of Windows from [[Windows 3.0|version 3.0]] until Windows XP Service Pack 1. A non-operable icon library named progman.exe is included in Windows XP Service Pack 2, and the file was removed entirely from [[Windows Vista]].

If Program Manager is started under Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later, it does not appear to run, but when a .grp file created for Windows 3.1 is processed, it converts the .grp file contents to a Start Menu folder.

===Internet Explorer===
Microsoft released versions of [[Internet Explorer]] from [[Internet Explorer 2|2.0]] up to the first release of [[Internet Explorer 5|version 5.0]] for Windows 3.1.

==Promotion and reception==
Microsoft began a television advertising campaign for the first time on March 1, 1992. The advertisements, developed by [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], were designed to introduce a broader audience to Windows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft History 1992|url=http://library.microsoft.com/msinfo/mshist/1992.htm|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=4 September 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961017232356/http://library.microsoft.com/msinfo/mshist/1992.htm|archivedate=October 17, 1996}} Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;. Windows 3.1 was shipped worldwide on April 6, 1992, and reached three million sales two months later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gill Dunsford|title=Feature: Brand Microsoft| url=http://www.salespromo.co.uk/article/90|publisher=Sales Promotion|date=23 February 2007| accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The year of Windows 3.1's release was successful for Microsoft, which was named the &quot;Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S.&quot; by [[Forbes Magazine]], while Windows became the most widely-used [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]-based operating environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft History 1993|url=http://library.microsoft.com/msinfo/mshist/1993.htm|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=4 September 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19961017232408/http://library.microsoft.com/msinfo/mshist/1993.htm|archivedate=October 17, 1996}} Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Controversy==
===DR-DOS compatibility===
{{Main|AARD code}}

The installer to the beta release used code that checked whether it was running on Microsoft-licensed DOS or another DOS operating system (such as [[DR-DOS]]). The code ran several functional tests that succeeded on MS-DOS and [[IBM PC DOS]], but resulted in a technical support message on competing operating systems. If the system was not MS-DOS, the installer would fail. Digital Research, who owned DR-DOS, released a patch within weeks to allow the installer to continue. Microsoft disabled, but did not remove, this warning message for the final release of Windows 3.1. When [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] bought DR-DOS from [[Novell]], they brought a lawsuit against Microsoft over the AARD code, which was later settled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft emails focus on DR-DOS threat|author=Dan Goodin|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-225129.html|publisher=CNET News|date= 28 April 1999|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caldera vs Microsoft - the settlement|author=Graham Lea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/600488.stm|publisher=BBC News| date=13 January 2000|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Legacy==
Windows 3.x was superseded by the release of [[Windows 95]] in August 1995.

Windows 3.1 found a niche market as an [[embedded operating system]] after becoming obsolete in the PC world. Up until November 2008, both [[Virgin Atlantic]] and [[Qantas]] employed it for some of the onboard entertainment systems on long-distance jets. It also sees continued use as an embedded OS in retail cash tills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The end of an era - Windows 3.x|author=Mark Ward|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7707016.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=5 November 2008| accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On July 9, 2008, it was announced that Windows for Workgroups 3.11 for the embedded devices channel would no longer be made available for [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] distribution as of November 1, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Coyne|title=It's the End for 3.11!!|url= http://blogs.msdn.com/jcoyne/archive/2008/07/09/it-s-the-end-for-3-11.aspx|publisher=Microsoft| date=9 July 2008|accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
