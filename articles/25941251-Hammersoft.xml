'''Elections''' for the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] were held in the state of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], on Saturday 17 November 1973. The result was a win for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] coalition under Sir [[Robert Askin]], which had been in office since 1965.

== Issues ==
The Legislative Assembly had been enlarged by three members to 99 adding the seats of [[Electoral district of Woronora|Woronora]], [[Electoral district of Penrith|Penrith]] and [[Electoral district of Ku-ring-gai|Ku-ring-gai]].

The election was held just eleven months after the Liberal/Country coalition lost the federal election after 23 years in power. Askin called an early election to take advantage of the increasing economic issues which had been attributed to the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] Labor government.

Leader of the Legislative Council [[Neville Wran]], who would become Premier at the next election moved from the unelected Legislative Council to the Legislative Assembly after the late retirement of [[Clarrie Earl]] in the seat of [[Electoral district of Bass Hill|Bass Hill]].
