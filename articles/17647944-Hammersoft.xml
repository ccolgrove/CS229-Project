==Early life==
Roderick David Stewart was born at 507 Archway Road, [[Highgate, London|Highgate, North London]], the youngest of the five children of Robert Stewart and Elsie Gilbart.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-53&quot;&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father was Scottish and had been a [[wikt:Master builder|master builder]] in [[Leith]], [[Edinburgh]], while Elsie was English and had grown up in [[Upper Holloway]] in North London.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-2-3&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 2â3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Married in 1928,&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-2-3&quot;/&gt; the couple had two sons and two daughters while living in Scotland, then they moved to Highgate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-53&quot;/&gt; Stewart came after an eight-year gap following his youngest sibling; he was born at home during World War II, half an hour after a German [[V-2 missile]] warhead fell on the local Highgate police station.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-2-3&quot;/&gt;

The family was neither affluent, nor poor and by all accounts Stewart was a spoiled child as the youngest;&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-2-3&quot;/&gt; Stewart has called his childhood &quot;fantastically happy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-2-3&quot;/&gt;  He had an undistinguished record at Highgate Primary School and failed the [[eleven plus exam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-7&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then attended the [[Fortismere School|William Grimshaw Secondary Modern School]] in [[Hornsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Dafydd | last=Rees |coauthors=Crampton, Luke | title=Q Encyclopedia of Rock Stars |year=1996 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |isbn=0-7513-0393-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father retired from the building trade at age 65, then opened a [[newsagent]]'s shop on the [[Archway Road]] when Stewart was in his early teens; the family lived over the shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-53&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-2-3&quot;/&gt;  Stewart's main hobby was [[railway modelling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-9-10&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 9â10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stewart family was mostly focused on [[Association football|football]];&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-54&quot;/&gt; Robert had played on a local amateur side and managed some as well, and one of Stewart's earliest memories were the pictures of Scottish players such as [[George Young (footballer)|George Young]] and [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] that his brothers had on the wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-4-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-374&quot;/&gt;  Rod was the most talented footballer in the Stewart family and was a strong supporter of [[Arsenal F.C.]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-4-5&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 4â5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-2004-int&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rodstewart/articles/story/6055929/football_and_fancy_free | title=Football and Fancy Free | last=Crandall | first=Bill | magazine=Rolling Stone | date=19 May 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining natural athleticism with near-reckless aggression, he became captain of the school football team and played for Middlesex Schoolboys as [[centre-half]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-4-5&quot;/&gt;

The family were also great fans of the singer [[Al Jolson]] and would sing and play his hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-54&quot;&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-timegoes&quot;/&gt; Stewart collected his records and saw his films, read books about him, and was influenced by his performing style and attitude towards his audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-54&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-374&quot;&gt;Moritz (ed.), ''Current Year Biography 1979'', p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-4&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  His introduction to rock and roll was hearing [[Little Richard]]'s 1956 hit &quot;[[The Girl Can't Help It (song)|The Girl Can't Help It]]&quot; and seeing [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]] in concert.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-timegoes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Austin |last=Scaggs |authorlink=Austin Scaggs |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/rodstewart/articles/story/5936449/as_time_goes_by |title=As Time Goes By: Rod Stewart |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=7 October 2003 |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father bought him a guitar in January 1959; the first song he learned was the folk tune &quot;It Takes a Worried Man to Sing a Worried Song&quot; and the first record he bought was [[Eddie Cochran]]'s &quot;[[C'mon Everybody]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-9-10&quot;/&gt;  In 1960, he joined a [[skiffle]] group with schoolfriends called the Kool Kats, playing [[Lonnie Donegan]] and [[Chas McDevitt]] hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-9-10&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 4â5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart left school at age 15&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 10â11.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked briefly as a [[screen printing|silk screen printer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-5&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Spurred on by his father, his ambition was to become a professional [[association football|footballer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-2004-int&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt; In 1961 he joined on as an apprentice with [[Brentford F.C.]],&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo95&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.willbirch.com/Rod%20Stewart%20-%20The%20Graveyard%20Shift.htm | title=Rod Stewart â The Graveyard Shift | author=Birch, Will | magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |date = May 1995| accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC04&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3964169.stm | title=Enduring career of Rod the Mod | publisher=BBC News | date= 29 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10421,00.html | title=Brentford FC: History | publisher=[[Brentford F.C.]] | accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he disliked the early morning travel to [[London#West London|West London]] and the daily assignment to clean the [[first team]]'s [[Football boot|boots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt;  His playing effectiveness at [[centre-half]] was hindered by his slight build â {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} but only {{convert|9|st}} â and he pushed himself so much that he sometimes vomited at the side of the [[Association football pitch|pitch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt;  After up to two months of play in pre-season fixtures,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The precise extent of Stewart's involvement with Brentford F.C. is unclear. The 2005 Ewbank and Hildred biography states he was there for two months including pre-season fixtures. The 1981 Nelson and Bangs biography gives an undated Stewart quote saying he was there for three weeks, paid Â£8 per seven-day week, but never played in any form. In the 2004 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Stewart says he went three or four times a week and did play. The 1995 Will Birch ''Mojo'' article quotes Brentford Deputy President Eric White as saying, &quot;He trained with us for a week or two, and he may even have kicked a ball around with the juniors, but there is no record of Rod Stewart ever having signed to Brentford.  Unfortunately, nobody at the club remembers his time here.&quot; All accounts agree that Stewart was not pleased by having to clean the first team's boots.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart left the team, to the great disappointment of his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt;  Stewart later reflected that: &quot;I had the skill but not the enthusiasm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt;  Regarding possible career options, Stewart concluded, &quot;Well, a musician's life is a lot easier and I can also get drunk and make music, and I can't do that and play football. I plumped for music ... They're the only two things I can do actually: play football and sing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-54&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-10-11&quot;/&gt;

==Music career==
===1961â63: Early efforts===
Stewart worked in the family shop and as a newspaper delivery boy,&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-12-13&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 12â13.&lt;/ref&gt; then as a grave digger at [[Highgate Cemetery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/04/27/20-worst-pre-rock-star-jobs-no-7/ | title=20 Worst Pre-Rock Star Jobs: No. 7 | publisher=[[Spinner.com]] | year=2007 | accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly to face a childhood fear of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-12-13&quot;/&gt;  He worked in a [[North Finchley]] [[funeral parlour]]&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-12-13&quot;/&gt; and as a fence erector and sign writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-5&quot;/&gt; In 1961 he went to [[Denmark Street]] with [[The Moontrekkers|The Raiders]] and got a singing audition with well-known record producer [[Joe Meek]], but Meek stopped the session with a rude sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-14-16&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 14â16, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--TBD alt story has it in church hall --&gt;  Stewart began listening to British and American topical folk artists such as [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Alex Campbell (singer)|Alex Campbell]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliot]], and especially [[Derroll Adams]] and the [[Bob Dylan (album)|debut album]] of [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-14-16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;&gt;Moritz (ed.), ''Current Year Biography 1979'', p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;  He became attracted to [[beatnik]] attitudes and [[left-wing politics]], living for a while in a beatnik houseboat at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-14-16&quot;/&gt; Stewart was an active supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] at this time, joining the annual [[Aldermaston Marches]] in 1961 through 1963 and being arrested on three occasions when he took part in sit-ins at [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Whitehall]] for the cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-14-16&quot;/&gt; His commitment was not total, however, as he also used the marches as a way to meet and bed girls.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-14-16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962 he had his first serious relationship, with London art student Suzannah Boffey (and a friend of future model and actress [[Chrissie Shrimpton]]); he moved to a [[bed-sit]] in [[Muswell Hill]] to be near her.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-17-19&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 17â19.&lt;/ref&gt;  She became pregnant, but neither Rod nor his family wanted him to enter marriage; the baby girl was given for adoption and Rod's and Suzannah's relationship ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-17-19&quot;/&gt;

In 1962, Stewart began hanging around folk singer [[Wizz Jones]], [[busking]] at [[Leicester Square]] and other London spots.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-24-28&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 24â28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart took up playing the then-fashionable [[harmonica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-58&quot;/&gt;  On several trips over the next 18 months Jones and Stewart took their act to [[Brighton]] and then to Paris, sleeping under bridges over the [[River Seine]], and then finally to [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-24-28&quot;/&gt;  Finally this resulted in Stewart being rounded up and deported from Spain for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] during 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC04&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-24-28&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Pareles | first=Jon | authorlink=Jon Pareles | coauthors=Romanowski, Patricia | title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll | publisher=[[Rolling Stone Press]]/[[Summit Books]] |year= 1983 |isbn=0671434578 | page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1962, Stewart joined [[The Ray Davies Quartet]], later known as the successful British band [[The Kinks]], as their lead singer.  He had known three of their members at William Grimshaw School&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;/&gt; and at the time, [[Ray Davies]] was uncomfortable with the lead vocalist role.&lt;ref name=&quot;allday&quot;&gt;Hinman, ''The Kinks - All Day and All of the Night'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He performed with the group on at least one occasion, but was soon dropped due to complaints about his voice from then-drummer John Start's mother as well as musical differences with the band and (as [[Pete Quaife]] later recalled) Davies' fear that Stewart would take over.&lt;ref name=&quot;allday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Laugh? We Nearly Died' | author= | magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] | date=March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Stewart adopted the [[Mod (subculture)|Mod lifestyle and look]], and began fashioning the spiky rooster hairstyle that would become his trademark.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-21-23&quot;/&gt; (It originated from large amounts of his sisters' [[hair lacquer]], [[backcombing]], and his hands holding it in place to protect it from the winds of the [[Highgate Underground station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-21-23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, ''Rock 'n' Roll London'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;)  Disillusioned by rock and roll, he saw [[Otis Redding]] perform in concert and began listening to [[Sam Cooke]] records; he became fascinated by [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-21-23&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 21â23.&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to London, Stewart joined a rhythm and blues group, the Dimensions, in October 1963 as a [[harmonica]] player and part-time vocalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-7&quot;/&gt; It was his first professional job as a musician, although Stewart was still living at home and working in his brother's painting and picture frame shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-29-32&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 29â32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-intv-70&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title=The Rolling Stone Interviews: 1967-1980 | first=Peter | last=Herbst | authorlink=Peter Herbst | edition=reissued | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]] | year=1989 | isbn=0312034865 | pages=118â126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A somewhat more established singer from Birmingham, Jimmy Powell, then hired the group a few weeks later, and it became known as [[Jimmy Powell (singer)|Jimmy Powell &amp; the Five Dimensions]], with Stewart being relegated to harmonica player.&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-7&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group performed weekly at the famed Studio 51 club on Great Newport Street in London, where [[The Rolling Stones]] often headlined;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-7&quot;/&gt; this was Stewart's entrÃ©e into the thriving London R &amp; B scene,&lt;ref name=&quot;rshist-377&quot;/&gt; and his harmonica playing improved in part from watching [[Mick Jagger]] on stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-58&quot;&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations soon broke down between Powell and Stewart over roles within the group&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-29-32&quot;/&gt; and Stewart departed.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Contrary to legend, during this time Stewart likely did ''not'' play harmonica on [[Millie (singer)|Millie Small]]'s 1964 hit &quot;[[My Boy Lollipop]]&quot;. That was probably Peter Hogman of the Dimensions, although Powell has also claimed credit. See Ewbank and Hildred, p. 33, and the Birch ''Mojo'' article.  While Powell did record and release a single during this period, Stewart did not appear on it.  See Gray, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1964â67: Long John Baldry, Steampacket, and &quot;Rod the Mod&quot; ===
On or around 5 January 1964,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Per the Birch ''Mojo'' article. Some sources give the date of the StewartâBaldry rail station meeting as 7 January, but that may be confusing it with the date of Cyril Davies' death. Other sources give no specific date.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was drunk and waiting on the [[Twickenham railway station]] platform, playing &quot;[[Smokestack Lightnin']]&quot; on his harmonica after having seen a rhythm and blues show by [[Cyril Davies]] and the [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]] at [[Eel Pie Island Hotel|Eel Pie Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mojo95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-33-39&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', pp. 33â39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, ''Rock 'n' Roll London'', pp. 65â66.&lt;/ref&gt;  All Stars singer [[Long John Baldry]] discovered him and invited him to sit in with the group (which passed into his hands and was renamed the Hoochie Coochie Men when Davies died of leukaemia on 7 January); when Baldry discovered Stewart was a singer as well, he offered him a job for Â£35 a week, after securing the approval of Stewart's mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-33-39&quot;/&gt;  Quitting his day job at age nineteen, Stewart gradually overcame his shyness and nerves and became a visible enough part of the act that he was sometimes added to the billing as &quot;Rod the Mod&quot; Stewart,&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-58&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-33-39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-8&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the nickname coming from his [[dandy]]ish style of grooming and dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;/&gt;  Baldry touted Stewart's abilities to ''[[Melody Maker]]'' magazine and the group enjoyed a weekly residence at London's fabled [[Marquee Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-8&quot;/&gt;  In June 1964, Stewart made his recording dÃ©but (without label credit) on &quot;[[Up Above My Head]]&quot;, the B-side to a Baldry and Hoochie Coochie Men single.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-9&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

While still with Baldry, Stewart embarked on a simultaneous solo career.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-59&quot;&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made some demo recordings,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;The demo recordings with  were later released in 1976, against Stewart's wishes. See Gray p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; was scouted by [[Decca Records]] at the Marquee Club and signed to a solo contract in August 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-10&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 10â12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared on several regional television shows around the country and recorded his first single in September 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-10&quot;/&gt;  Turning down Decca's recommended material as too commercial, Stewart insisted that the experienced session musicians he was given, including [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], learn a couple of [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|Sonny Boy Williamson]] songs he had just heard.&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, ''The Rod Stewart Story'', as quoted extensively in Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 60â61.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting single, &quot;[[Good Morning Little Schoolgirl]]&quot;, was recorded released in October 1964; despite Stewart performing it on the popular television show ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'', it failed to enter the charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-10&quot;/&gt;  Also in  October  Stewart left the Hoochie Coochie Men after having a row with Baldry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-10&quot;/&gt;

Stewart played some dates on his own in late 1964 and early 1965, sometimes backed by the [[Southampton]] R &amp; B outfit [[The Soul Agents]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hoochie Coochie Men broke up, Baldry and Stewart patched up their differences (and indeed became lifelong friends),&lt;ref name=&quot;eh-41&quot;&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and legendary impresario [[Giorgio Gomelsky]] put together [[Steampacket]], which featured Baldry, Stewart, [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]], [[Micky Waller]], [[Vic Briggs]], and [[Rick Brown (English musician)|Rick Brown]]; their first appearance was in support of The Rolling Stones in July 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-14&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was conceived as a white soul revue, analogous to [[The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue]], with multiple vocalists and styles ranging from jazz to R &amp; B to blues.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Steampacket toured with the Stones and [[The Walker Brothers]] that summer, ending in the [[London Palladium]];&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt; seeing the audience react to the Stones gave Stewart his first exposure to crowd hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;Pidgeon, ''Rod Stewart and the Changing Faces'', as quoted in Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart, who had been included in the group upon Baldry's insistence, ended up with most of the male vocal parts.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt;  Steampacket was unable to enter the studio to record any material due to its members all belonging to different labels and managers,&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20741|pure_url=yes}} | title=The Steampacket: Biography | publisher=Allmusic | first=Richie | last=Unterberger | authorlink=Richie Unterberger | accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Gomelsky did record one of their Marquee Club rehearsals.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;These later surfaced in 1971 as part of Gomelsky's ''Rock Generation'' releases on [[BYG Records]]; the poorly recorded material has been repackaged as ''Rod Stewart and Steampacket'' many times since.  See Nelson and Bangs, p. 61, and the Allmusic entry for Steampacket.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart's &quot;Rod the Mod&quot; image gained wider visibility in November 1965, when he was the subject of a 30-minute [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion, London]] television documentary titled &quot;An Easter with Rod&quot; that portrayed the Mod scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC04&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 15â17.&lt;/ref&gt;  His parallel solo career attempts continued on [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia label]] with the November 1965 release of &quot;The Day Will Come&quot;, a more heavily arranged pop attempt, and the April 1966 release of his take on [[Sam Cooke]]'s &quot;[[Shake (Sam Cooke song)|Shake]]&quot;, with the [[Brian Auger Trinity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;/&gt;  Both failed commercially and neither gained positive notices.&lt;ref&gt;Ewbank and Hildred, ''Rod Stewart: The New Biography'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart had spent the better part of two years listening mostly to Cooke; he later said, &quot;I didn't sound like anybody at all ... but I knew I sounded a bit like Sam Cooke, so I listened to Sam Cooke.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-intv-70&quot;/&gt;  This recording solidified that singer's position as Stewart's idol and most enduring influence; he called it a &quot;crossing of the water.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-intv-70&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt;

Stewart departed from Steampacket in March 1966,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;/&gt; with Stewart saying he had been sacked and Auger saying he had quit.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt;  Stewart then joined a somewhat similar outfit, [[Shotgun Express]], in May 1966 as co-lead vocalist with [[Beryl Marsden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;/&gt; Amongst the other members were [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] (who would go on to form [[Fleetwood Mac]]), and [[Peter Bardens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;/&gt; Shotgun Express released one unsuccessful single in October 1966, the orchestra-heavy &quot;I Could Feel The Whole World Turn Round&quot;, before disbanding.&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;/&gt;  Stewart later disparaged Shotgun Express as a poor imitation of Steampacket, and said &quot;I was still getting this terrible feeling of doing other people's music. I think you can only start finding yourself when you write your own material.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-15-17&quot;/&gt; By now, Stewart had bounced around without achieving much success, with little to distinguish himself among other aspiring London singers other than the emerging rasp in his voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;rshist-377&quot;/&gt;

===1967â69: Jeff Beck Group===
Guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] recruited Stewart for his new post-[[Yardbirds]] venture,&lt;ref name=&quot;carson-71&quot;&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 71â72.&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 1967, Stewart joined the [[Jeff Beck Group]] as vocalist and sometime songwriter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', pp. 18â21.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would become the big break of his early career.&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;/&gt;  There he first played with [[Ronnie Wood]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nb-61&quot;/&gt; whom he had first met in a London pub in 1964;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-10&quot;/&gt; the two soon became fast friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;carson-71&quot;/&gt; During its first year, the group experienced frequent changes of drummers and conflicts involving manager [[Mickie Most]] wanting to reduce Stewart's role; they toured the UK, and released a couple of singles that featured Stewart on their B-sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carson-78&quot;&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 75, 78, 83â86.&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart's sputtering solo career also continued, with the March 1968 release of non-hit &quot;Little Miss Understood&quot; on [[Immediate Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;  The Jeff Beck Group toured [[Western Europe]] in spring 1968, recorded, and were nearly destitute; then assistant manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] booked them on a six-week tour of the United States starting in June 1968 with the [[Fillmore East]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt061568&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carson-81&quot;&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', pp. 81â82.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first-time-in-America Stewart suffered terrible stage fright during the opening show and hid behind the amplifier banks while singing; only a quick shot of [[brandy]] brought him out front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;  Nevertheless, the show and the tour were a big success,&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carson-81&quot;/&gt; with [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] of ''The New York Times'' calling the group exciting and praising &quot;the interaction of Mr. Beck's wild and visionary guitar against the hoarse and insistent shouting of Rod Stewart,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt061568&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40711FD38541B7B93C7A8178DD85F4C8685F9 | title=Jeff Beck Group Cheered in Debut | first=Robert | last=Shelton | authorlink=Robert Shelton (critic) | newspaper=The New York Times | date=15 June 1968 | page=38 | format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Musical Express]]'' reporting that the group was receiving standing ovations and pulling receipts equal to those of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Doors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;

In August 1968, their first album ''[[Truth (Jeff Beck album)|Truth]]'' was released; by October it had risen to number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|US albums chart]] but failed to chart in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;  The radical, groundbreaking, landmark album featured Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rshist-377&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;carson-78&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-truth&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1564|pure_url=yes}} | title=Truth: Review | first=Bruce | last=Eder | authorlink=Bruce Eder | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs,&lt;ref name=&quot;amg-truth&quot;/&gt; and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-intv-70&quot;/&gt; The group toured America again at the end of the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, ''Jeff Beck'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; (something that would continue throughout Beck's career).  In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-intv-70&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-22&quot;&gt;Gray, ''Rod Stewart: The Visual Documentary'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart later recalled: &quot;It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked him in the eye â I always looked at his shirt or something like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;  The group's second album, ''[[Beck-Ola]]'', was released in June 1969 in the US and September 1969 in the UK, bracketing the time the group was dissolving; it also made number 15 in the US albums chart and placed to number 39 in the [[UK albums chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cby-375&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1566|pure_url=yes}} | title=Beck-Ola: Review | first=William | last=Ruhlmann | authorlink=William Ruhlmann | publisher=Allmusic | accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with the group, Stewart initially felt overmatched by Beck's presence, and his style was still developing; but later Stewart felt the two developed a strong musical, if not personal, rapport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Rolling Stone Record Guide'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;   Much of Stewart's sense of phrasing was developed during his time with the Jeff Beck Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs-intv-70&quot;/&gt;  Beck sought to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] with [[Carmine Appice]] and [[Tim Bogert]] (of the similarly just-breaking-up [[Vanilla Fudge]]) joining him and Stewart, but Stewart had other plans.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 74, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1969â71: Solo Career establishment===
[[Image:Rod stewart 05111976 12 400.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stewart performing in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], 5 November 1976.]]
[[Mercury Records]] [[A&amp;R]] man [[Lou Reizner]] had seen Stewart perform with Beck, and in October 1968 signed him to a solo contract;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-18-21&quot;/&gt; but contractual complexities delayed Stewart's recording for him until July 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson and Bangs, ''Rod Stewart'', pp. 96â97, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, in May 1969, guitarist and singer [[Steve Marriott]] left English band [[The Small Faces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-22&quot;/&gt;  Ron Wood was announced as the replacement guitarist in  June  and in October 1969 Stewart followed his friend and was announced as their new singer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-22&quot;/&gt;  The two joined existing members [[Ronnie Lane]], [[Ian McLagan]], and [[Kenney Jones]], who soon decided to call the new line-up [[Faces (band)|Faces]].

''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'' became Stewart's first solo album in 1969 (it was known as ''The Rod Stewart Album'' in the US). It established the template for his solo sound: a heartfelt mixture of [[folk music|folk]], rock, and [[country blues]], inclusive of a British working-class sensibility, with both original material (&quot;Cindy's Lament&quot; and the title song) and cover versions ([[Ewan MacColl]]'s &quot;[[Dirty Old Town]]&quot; and [[Mike d'Abo]]'s &quot;[[Handbags and Gladrags]]&quot;).

Faces released their debut album ''[[First Step (Faces album)|First Step]]'' in early 1970 with a rock and roll style similar to the Rolling Stones. While the album did better in the UK than in the US, the Faces quickly earned a strong live following. Stewart released his second album, ''[[Gasoline Alley (album)|Gasoline Alley]]'' that autumn ([[Elkie Brooks]] later achieved a hit with a version of the title track in 1983). Rod's approach was similar to his first album, as exemplified by the title track; and [[mandolin]] was introduced into the sound. He then launched a solo tour. Stewart sang guest vocals for the Australian group [[Python Lee Jackson]] on &quot;In a Broken Dream&quot;, recorded in April 1969 but not released until 1970. His payment was a set of seat covers for his car. It was re-released in 1972 to become a worldwide hit.

===1971â74: ''Every Picture Tells a Story''===
Stewart's 1971 solo album ''[[Every Picture Tells a Story]]'' made him a household name when the B-side of his minor hit &quot;[[Reason to Believe]]&quot;, &quot;[[Maggie May]]&quot;, (co-written with Martin Quittenton) started receiving radio play. The album and the single hit number one in both the US and the UK simultaneously, a chart first, in September. A loss of innocence tale set off by a striking mandolin part (by Ray Jackson of [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]]), &quot;Maggie May&quot; was also named in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s ''500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll'', which is one of three songs by him to appear on that list. The rest of the album was equally strong, with &quot;Mandolin Wind&quot; again showcasing that instrument; &quot;[[(I Know) I'm Losing You]]&quot; adding hard-edged [[soul music|soul]] to the mix; and &quot;[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]&quot;, a cover of a [[Bob Dylan]] song. But the ultimate manifestation of the early Stewart solo style was the Stewart-Wood-penned &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot; itself: powered by Mick Waller's drumming, [[Pete Sears]]'s piano, and Wood's guitar work in a largely acoustic arrangement; it is a fast, rocking, headlong romp relating the [[picaresque]] adventures of the singer.

The second Faces album, ''[[Long Player (album)|Long Player]]'', was released in early 1971 and enjoyed greater chart success than ''First Step''. The Faces also got their only US Top 40 hit with &quot;Stay With Me&quot; from their third album ''[[A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse]]'' released in late 1971. This album reached the Top 10 on both sides of the Atlantic on the back of the success of ''Every Picture Tells A Story''. Throughout this period there was a marked dichotomy between Stewart's solo and group work, the former being meticulously crafted while the latter tended towards the boozy and sloppy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] from [[The Sex Pistols]] regarded The Faces very highly and named them as a main influence on the British [[punk rock]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/The%20Sex%20Pistols_%20Steve%20Jones_/ The Sex Pistolsâ Steve Jones: 'I lost everything, hit bottom, and had to work my way back up.']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faces toured extensively in 1972 with growing tension in the band over Stewart's solo career enjoying more success than the band's. Stewart released ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Rod Stewart album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'' in the same year. Repeating the ''Every Picture'' formula for the most part, it reached number two on the US album charts and number one in the UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;RockHall&quot;/&gt; and enjoyed further good notices from reviewers. &quot;You Wear It Well&quot; was a hit single that reached number 13 in the US and went to number one in the UK, while &quot;Twisting the Night Away&quot; made explicit Stewart's debt to [[Sam Cooke]]. For the body of his early solo work Stewart earned tremendous critical praise. ''Rolling Stone'''s 1980 ''Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'' includes this in its Stewart entry:&lt;ref name=&quot;rshist-377&quot;&gt;Marcus, &quot;Rod Stewart&quot;, in ''Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll'', p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely.  Once the most compassionate presence in music, he has become a bilious self-parody â and sells more records than ever [...] a writer who offered profound lyricism and fabulous self-deprecating humour, teller of tall tales and honest heartbreaker, he had an unmatched eye for the tiny details around which lives turn, shatter, and reform [...] and a voice to make those details indelible. [... His solo albums] were defined by two special qualities: warmth, which was redemptive, and modesty, which was liberating. If ever any rocker chose the role of everyman and lived up to it, it was Rod Stewart.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Faces released their final album ''[[Ooh La La (Faces album)|Ooh La La]],'' which reached number one in the UK and number 21 in the US in 1973. The band toured Australasia, Japan, Europe and the UK in 1974&lt;ref name=&quot;nzentgrafwoodworks&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last =Zentgraf |first=Nico |title=Woodworks 1957-1975 |url=http://www.nzentgraf.de/books/tcw/works1.htm|accessdate=14 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to support the album and the single &quot;Pool Hall Richard&quot;.

===1974â75: ''Smiler'' and Faces tour===
In late 1974 Stewart released his ''[[Smiler (album)|Smiler]]'' album. In Britain, it reached number one, and the single &quot;Farewell&quot; number seven, but only number 13 on the ''Billboard'' pop album charts and the single &quot;Mine for Me&quot; only number 91 on the ''Billboard'' pop singles charts. It was his last original album for Mercury Records. After the release of the double album compilation ''The Best of Rod Stewart'' he switched to [[Warner Bros. Records]] and remained with them throughout the vast majority of his career.

In 1975 the Faces toured the US twice (with Ronnie Wood joining [[The Rolling Stones]]' US tour in between)&lt;ref name=&quot;nzentgrafwoodworks&quot;/&gt; before Stewart announced the Faces' break-up at the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;tioos-chronicle75&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last =McPherson |first=Ian |title=The Rolling Stones Chronicle: 1975 |url= http://www.timeisonourside.com/chron1975.html |accessdate=14 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1975â77: ''Atlantic Crossing'' and further releases===
In 1975, Rod Stewart moved to Los Angeles, due in part to his love affair with [[Britt Ekland]], and as a protest against the [[Inland Revenue|UK tax authorities]] who were taking approximately 83% of his income. He released the ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'' album for his new record company, using producer [[Tom Dowd]] and a different sound based on the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]]. ''Atlantic Crossing'' marked both a return to form and a return to the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' album charts. The first single, a cover of the [[Sutherland Brothers]] song &quot;[[Sailing (Rod Stewart song)|Sailing]]&quot;, was a number one hit in the UK, but it only reached the Top 60 of the US charts. The single returned to the UK Top 10 a year later when used as the theme music for a BBC documentary [[Sailor (TV series)|series]] about ''[[HMS Ark Royal (R09)|HMS Ark Royal]]'', and having been a hit twice over became, and remains, Stewart's biggest-selling single in the UK. His [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] cover &quot;[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)|This Old Heart Of Mine]]&quot; was also a Top 100 hit in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  Additionally in 1976 Stewart covered [[The Beatles]]' song &quot;[[Get Back]]&quot; for the ephemeral musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-this-and-world-war-ii-r230229/review All This and World War II] Allmusic. Retrieved 4 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1976, Stewart topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eight weeks and the Australian [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] chart with the ballad &quot;[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)|Tonight's the Night]]&quot;, with an accompanying music video featuring Ekland.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt; It came from the ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' album, which went to number two on the ''Billboard'' album charts and was Stewart's first album to go platinum. By explicitly marking the album as having a &quot;fast side&quot; and a &quot;slow side&quot;, Stewart continued the trend started by ''Atlantic Crossing''. &quot;[[The First Cut Is the Deepest]]&quot;, a cover of a [[Cat Stevens]] song, went number one in the UK in 1977, and top 30 in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;RockHall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  &quot;[[The Killing of Georgie]] (Part 1 and 2)&quot;, about the murder of a gay man, was also a Top 40 hit for Stewart during 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;

===1977-81: ''Blondes Have More Fun''===
''[[Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free]]'' featured Rod's own band, the original Rod Stewart Group that featured Carmine Appice, Phil Chen, Jim Cregan, Billy Peek, Gary Grainger and John Jarvis, from 1977 continued Stewart's run of chart success, again reaching number two. &quot;[[You're In My Heart]]&quot; was the hit single, reaching number four in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  The rocker &quot;[[Hot Legs]]&quot; achieved a lot of radio airplay as did the confessional &quot;[[I Was Only Joking]]&quot;. In appearance, Stewart's look had evolved to include a [[glam rock|glam]] element, including make-up and spandex clothes. Stewart scored another UK number one and US number one single with &quot;[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]&quot;, which was a crossover hit reaching number five on the ''Billboard'' black charts due to its [[disco]] sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt; This was the lead single from 1978's ''[[Blondes Have More Fun|Blondes Have More Fun...or do they?]],'' which went to number one on the ''Billboard'' album charts and sold 4&amp;nbsp;million albums. It was to be Stewart's last number one album for 25 years.

A focal point of criticisms about this period was his biggest-selling 1978 [[disco]] hit &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot;, which was atypical of his earlier output, and disparaged by critics.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t4062480|pure_url=yes}} Mason, Stewart, &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot;] from Allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Stewart, while admitting his accompanying look had become &quot;tarty&quot;, has defended the lyrics by pointing out that the song is a [[third-person narrative]] slice-of-life portrayal, not unlike those in his earlier work, and that it is not about him. However, the song's refrain was identical to Brazilian [[Jorge Ben Jor]]'s earlier &quot;Taj Mahal&quot; and a lawsuit ensued. Stewart donated his royalties from the song to [[UNICEF]], and he performed it with his band at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1979.

Rod moved a bit to a more [[New Wave music|New Wave]] direction in 1980 by releasing the album ''Foolish Behaviour''. The album produced one hit single, &quot;Passion&quot;, which proved particularly popular in South Africa (reaching no. 1 on the Springbok Top 20 Charts and Radio 5 Charts in early 1981). It also reached No. 5 on the US ''Billboard'' Charts. Later in 1981, Stewart added further elements of New Wave and [[synth pop]] to his sound for the ''[[Tonight I'm Yours]]'' album. The title song reached #20 in the U.S., while &quot;[[Young Turks (song)|Young Turks]]&quot; reached the Top 5 with the album going platinum.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  In August 1981, MTV was launched in the US with several of Stewart's videos in heavy rotation. On 18 December 1981, Stewart played the Los Angeles Forum, along with [[Kim Carnes]] and [[Tina Turner]]. This show was broadcast around the world to a television audience of 35&amp;nbsp;million.

===1982â2001: ''Body Wishes'', and continued success===
[[File:Rod-Stewart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Stewart performing in Dublin Ireland, in 1981]]
Stewart's career then went into a relative slump, and his albums between ''[[Tonight I'm Yours]]'' (1981) and ''[[Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)|Out of Order]]'' (1988) received harsh criticism from many critics.  He was also criticised for breaking the widely observed cultural boycott of [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] by performing at the [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] resort complex in the [[bantustan]]  of Bophuthatswana as part of his [[Body Wishes]] (1983) and [[Camouflage]] (1984) tours. He only had four Top 10 singles between 1982 and 1988, &quot;Young Turks&quot; (#5,1982), &quot;Some Guys Have All the Luck&quot; (#10, 1984), &quot;Infatuation&quot; (#6, 1984) and &quot;Love Touch&quot; (#6, 1986), although &quot;[[Baby Jane (song)|Baby Jane]]&quot; became his sixth and final UK number one in 1983. It reached #14 in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  The corresponding ''[[Camouflage (Rod Stewart album)|Camouflage]]'' album went gold in the UK, and the single &quot;Infatuation&quot; (which featured his old friend Jeff Beck on the guitar) received considerable play on MTV. The second single &quot;[[Some Guys Have All The Luck]]&quot; reached #15 in the UK and #10 in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  A reunion with Jeff Beck produced a successful take on [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s &quot;[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]]&quot;, but an attempt to tour together fell apart after a few dates.

In January 1985, he performed at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in [[Rio de Janeiro]] before an estimated audience of over 100,000. In 1988, he returned with ''[[Out of Order (Rod Stewart album)|Out Of Order]]'', produced by [[Duran Duran]]'s [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]] and by [[Bernard Edwards]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. &quot;Lost in You&quot;, &quot;[[Forever Young (Rod Stewart song)|Forever Young]]&quot;, &quot;Crazy About Her&quot;, and &quot;My Heart Can't Tell You No&quot; from that album were all top 15 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and mainstream rock charts, with the latter even reaching the Top Five. &quot;Forever Young&quot; was an unconscious revision of Bob Dylan's song of the same name; the artists reached an agreement about sharing royalties. The song reached #12 in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/artist/rod-stewart/chart-history/5760#/artist/rod-stewart/chart-history/5760 Rod Stewart Album &amp; Song Chart History] Billboard. 23 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1988, Stewart performed &quot;Forever Young&quot; at the [[1988 MTV Video Music Awards]] at the [[Universal Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/performers.jhtml 1988 MTV Video Music Awards] MTV.com.

There were 80,000 people at his show at Corregidora Stadium, [[QuerÃ©taro]], MÃ©xico (9 April), and 50,000 at Jalisco Stadium, [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]] (12 April). In [[Buenos Aires]], the audience at the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River Plate Stadium]], which seats 70,000+, was at over 90,000, with several thousand outside the stadium. Firehoses were sprayed on the crowd to avoid heat prostration.

Stewart's version of the [[Tom Waits]] song &quot;[[Downtown Train]]&quot; went to number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt; This song was taken from a four-CD compilation set called ''[[Storyteller - The Complete Anthology: 1964â1990]]''. The ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'' album continued his comeback with &quot;[[Rhythm of My Heart]]&quot; reaching #5 on ''Billboard'', and &quot;[[The Motown Song]]&quot; reaching the top 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;BillboardChart&quot;/&gt;  Also in 1990 he recorded &quot;[[It Takes Two (song)|It Takes Two]]&quot; with [[Tina Turner]], which reached number five on the UK charts.

Stewart was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994, presented by [[Jeff Beck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RockHall&quot;&gt;[http://rockhall.com/inductees/rod-stewart/timeline/ Rod Stewart: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum] 23 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December on the same year he played in front on 4.2&amp;nbsp;million people on [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana beach in Rio]], and made it into the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for staging the largest outdoor concert in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;RockHall&quot;/&gt;

By the early 1990s, Stewart had mostly abandoned creating his own material, saying that he was not a natural songwriter and that the tepid response to his recent efforts was not rewarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc122306&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6193284.stm | publisher=BBC News | author=Young, Kevin | title=Stewart goes beneath the covers | date=23 December 2006 | accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1995, Stewart released ''[[A Spanner in the Works]]'' containing a single written by [[Tom Petty]] &quot;Leave Virginia Alone,&quot; which reached the Top 10 of the adult contemporary charts. The latter half of the 1990s was not so commercially successful, though the 1996 album ''[[If We Fall in Love Tonight]]'' managed to ship gold and hit #19 on the Billboard album chart, thanks in large part to an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show.

''[[When We Were the New Boys]]'', his final album on the [[Warner Bros.]] label released in 1998, contained versions of songs by [[Britpop]] acts such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Primal Scream]], and reached number two on the UK album charts. In 2000, Stewart decided to leave Warner Bros. and moved to [[Atlantic Records]], another division of [[Warner Music Group]]. In 2001, he released ''[[Human (Rod Stewart album)|Human]]'', his only album for Atlantic. ''Human'' only just reached the Top 50 in 2001 with the single &quot;I Can't Deny It&quot; going Top 40 in the UK and Top 20 in the adult contemporary.

Stewart then signed to [[Clive Davis]]' new [[J Records]] label.  ''[[The Very Best of Rod Stewart|The Story So Far: The Very Best Of Rod Stewart]]'', a greatest hits album compiled from his time at Warner Bros., went to the Top 10 in the UK and reached number one in places like Belgium and France in 2001.

By 2002, Stewart had sold over 100&amp;nbsp;million records during his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;total-sales&quot;/&gt;  Stewart then concentrated on singing 1930s and 1940s pop standards from the &quot;[[Great American Songbook]]&quot;, written by songwriters such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], with great popular success. These albums have been released on [[Clive Davis]]'s [[J Records]] label and have seen Stewart enjoy album sales equal to the 1970s.

The first album from the songbook series, ''[[It Had to Be You: the Great American Songbook]]'', reached number four on the US album chart, number eight in the UK and number ten in Canada when released in late 2002. The track &quot;[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)|These Foolish Things]]&quot; (which is actually a British, not American, song) reached number 13 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Billboard adult contemporary charts]] and number two in Taiwan. &quot;[[They Can't Take That Away From Me]]&quot; went Top 20 on the world Internet charts and Top 30 on the adult contemporary charts.

''[[Five Guys Walk into a Bar...]]'', a Faces box set compilation, went into the shops. Stewart has also mentioned working with Wood on an album to be entitled ''You Strum, I'll Sing''. In late 2004, ''[[Stardust: the Great American Songbook 3]]'', the third album in Stewart's songbook series, was released. It was his first US number one album in 25 years, selling over 200,000 albums in its first week. It also debuted at number one in Canada, number three in the UK and Top 10 in Australia. His version of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s &quot;[[What a Wonderful World]]&quot;, featuring [[Stevie Wonder]], made the Top 20 of the world adult charts. He also recorded a duet with [[Dolly Parton]] for the album - &quot;[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]&quot;. Stewart won his first ever [[Grammy Award]] for this album.

The year 2005 saw the release of the fourth songbook album, ''[[Thanks for the Memory: The Great American Songbook 4]]''; it included duets with [[Diana Ross]] and [[Elton John]]. Within weeks of its release, the CD made it to number two on the Top 200 list. In late 2006, Stewart made his return to rock music and his new approach to country music with the release of ''[[Still the Same... Great Rock Classics of Our Time]]'', a new album featuring rock and southern rock milestones from the last four decades, including a cover of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s &quot;[[Have You Ever Seen the Rain?]]&quot;, which was released as the first single. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts with 184,000 copies in its first week. The number one debut was helped by a concert in New York City that was on [[MSN Music]] and an appearance on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. He performed tracks from his new album Live from the Nokia Theater on 9 October. Control Room broadcast the event Live on MSN and in 117 movie theatres across the country via National CineMedia.
