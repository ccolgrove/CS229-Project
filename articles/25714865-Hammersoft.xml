'''Nancy Mudge''' ['''Cato'''] (born October 3, 1929) is a former [[second base]]woman who played from {{baseball year|1950}} through {{baseball year|1954}} in the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]]. Listed at 5' 2&quot;, 120 lb., Mudge batted and threw right handed. She was nicknamed â³Smudgieâ³.

Born in [[Bridgeport, New York]], Nancy Mudge played during five seasons in the AAGPBL, three of them with the [[Kalamazoo Lassies]]. Mudge was a solid, smooth-fielding at second base that paced the league in [[fielding percentage]] between 1953 and 1954. A light hitter, she had the ability to get on base, by any means, way above than the pure ability to get the [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. She reached [[first base]] by [[base on balls|walks]], by a [[Bunt (baseball)#Bunting for a base hit|bunt single]] or [[hit by pitch|being hit]] by the pitcher, though she was a .183 career hitter but posted a solid .311 [[on-base percentage]]. A smart and aggressive baserunner, she knew when to take the extra base. An AAGPBL [[scout (sport)|scout]] tried to sign Mudge after seeing her playing [[field hockey]] in [[Indiana]], thinking that she had athletic abilities, endurance and fitness necessary to play baseball. Mudge refused, because she wanted to graduate college first. However, she later had a tryout with the [[Fort Wayne Daisies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/index.cfm/profiles/cato-nancy-mudge/215 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League official website â Nancy Mudge entry]&lt;/ref&gt;


==AAGPBL career==
In 1950, between her junior and senior years in college, Mudge was given a contract to play with the [[Chicago Colleens]], and was sent to the [[Springfield Sallies]] during the midseason. She hit a combined .308 [[batting average|average]] with 24 [[runs batted in]] in their first 40 games. Unfortunately, she tore a cartilage in her knee that required surgery and rehabilitation for the rest of the summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thediamondangle.com/archive/feb05/mudge.html The Diamond Angle Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/players/index.cfm?do=player.details&amp;playerid=215 AAGPBL Player Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from college, Mudge returned to baseball action and was assigned to the Kalamazoo Lassies in 1951. She played for them two and a half years before joining the [[Battle Creek Belles]] during the 1952 midseason. After that, she spent 1953 with the relocated [[Muskegon Belles]], when the franchise moved for a while to see if that city would support a girls baseball team, but the experiment failed and Mudge returned to Kalamazoo in 1954. 

In 1954 Mudge hit .232 in 98 games, including career-numbers in runs scored (74) and hits (82), while [[run batted in|driving in]] 22 runs. She also made the league's [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League All-Star Team|All-Star Team]], forming part of a Lassies All-Star slick infield that included [[June Peppas]] at [[first base]], [[Dorothy Schroeder]] at [[shortstop]], and [[Fern Shollenberger]] at [[third base]]. Meanwhile, the called ''Home Run Twins'', [[Chris Ballingall]] (17) and [[Carol Habben]] (15), powered the offense with 32 [[home run]]s; Peppas and Schroeder enjoyed big numbers, and Kalamazoo advanced to the Championship Series. As a result, the Lassies defeated the Daisies in a best-of-five games  series, during what turned out to be the AAGPBL final season.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of women and baseball'' â Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland &amp; Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English. ISBN 0786421002&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mudge returned home after the league disbanded. She married and changed her name to Nancy Mudge Cato. She is currently living in [[Elk River, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.star-collector.net/sports/sportspageaagpbl.htm#M AAGPBLâ Stars-Collector.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mudge was one of 25 players who made the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League clubs hailed from New York City and State, including [[Muriel Bevis]], [[Gloria Cordes]], [[Millie Deegan|Mildred Deegan]], [[Betty Trezza]] and [[Margaret Wigiser]].

Since 1980, June Peppas and a group of friends began assembling a list of names and addresses of former All-American Girls Professional Baseball League players. Her work turned into a newsletter and resulted in the leagueâs first-ever reunion in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years later and a significant number of former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1998. For many years, Nancy Mudge Cato has been an active participant in the events organized by the association.  

The AAGPBL folded in 1954, but there is now a permanent display at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] at  [[Cooperstown, New York]] since November 5, {{baseball year|1988}} that honors those who were part of this unique experience. June and Nancy, along with the rest of the league's girls, is now enshrined in the Hall. 

The AAGPBL Players Association helped to bring the league story to the public eye. The association was largely responsible for the opening of the aforementioned exhibition. Of the approximately 560 women who had played in the league, most had lost touch with the others; at least not until the first reunion held in Chicago.  

In July 1988, the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR) held their annual National Convention in [[Minneapolis]] with 340 people in attendance. [[Andy MacPhail]] was the keynote speaker, and [[Minor league baseball]] home run legend [[Joe Hauser]] was a special guest, while Nancy was part of a players panel along Hauser, [[Julio BÃ©cquer]] and [[Howie Schultz]].&lt;ref&gt;''Society of American Baseball Research'' â Publisher: Turner Publishing Company, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 120pp. Language: English. ISBN 1563115948&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy was also honored by the [[Colorado Silver Bullets]] all-female baseball team in their 1994 inaugural season, in which she threw out the first ball pitch of a game celebrated in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coloradosilverbullets.org/ Colorado Silver Bullets Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;
