'''''Medal of Honor: Allied Assault''''' ('''''MoHAA''''') is a [[first-person shooter]] (FPS) [[Video game|computer game]] developed by [[2015, Inc.]] and created by [[Steven Spielberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/medal-of-honor-allied-assault/credits |title=Medal of Honor credits | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 3rd installment of the [[Medal of Honor (series)|Medal of Honor series]]. The game, based on the [[id Tech 3|Quake III Arena]] engine with modifications from [[Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.Â²]], simulates [[infantry]] [[combat]] in the [[European Theater of World War II|European]] and North African Theaters during [[World War II]]. ''Allied Assault'' is the first game in the [[Medal of Honor series|''Medal of Honor'' series]] to be released for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and the only one to be [[porting|ported]] to [[Linux]] and only as a beta leading to it having numerous bugs.

In the game the player takes on the role of Lt. Mike Powell of the [[United States Army Rangers]] who works for the OSS. [[Single player]] missions include assaulting [[Nazi Germany|German]] bases in [[Algiers]] and [[Norway]], storming [[Omaha Beach]] on [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]], and rescuing comrades behind enemy lines in occupied [[France]]. The game's levels are often compared to [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1998 film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''; many of the levels are direct quotations of the scenery (or even complete sequences as in the Omaha Beach mission) in the film. This level was re-created in ''[[Medal of Honor: Frontline]]'' for consoles. Other elements in the game are also comparable to the film, like the &quot;Sniper Town&quot; level and the &quot;Guarding of the Bridge&quot; level where the final battle sequence of the movie is very similar in action and visuals to the game.

The game has been re-released as the ''Medal of Honor: Allied Assault Deluxe Edition'' which includes the ''Medal of Honor: Spearhead'' expansion pack, two strategy guides, music from ''Allied Assault'', and a preview of ''[[Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault]]'', and the ''Medal of Honor Allied Assault War Chest'' which includes the game and both expansion packs.

==Expansion packs==
'''''Spearhead''''' is the first expansion pack for ''Allied Assault''. It was developed by [[EA Los Angeles]]. ''Spearhead'' re-enacts 3 major [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]] battles through the eyes of Sgt. Jack Barnes (who is voiced by [[Gary Oldman]]), a [[paratroop]]er of the [[501st Parachute Infantry Regiment]], [[101st Airborne Division]]. As Barnes, players land behind the [[Atlantic Wall]] on [[D-Day]] in [[Normandy]], hold the line near [[Bastogne]] in the [[Ardennes]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], and infiltrate [[Berlin]] before the [[Red Army]] begins their attack. ''Spearhead'' adds Russian and British weapons to the player's arsenal as well as being available for multiplayer selection.

'''''Breakthrough''''' is the second expansion pack for ''Medal of Honor: Allied Assault'' this time developed by [[TKO Software]] where the player takes the role of Sgt. John Baker of the [[US 34th Infantry Division]]. This campaign covers the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]], the turning point of the North African campaign, [[Operation Vulcan|the fall of Bizerte]] and the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in 1943, along with the epic race to [[Messina, Italy]] between [[George Patton]]'s [[Seventh United States Army|7th U.S. Army]] and [[Bernard Law Montgomery]]'s [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British 8th Army]], the bloody [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], followed by the [[Operation Shingle|amphibious landings and defense]] of the beachhead at [[Anzio, Italy]] in 1944. ''Breakthrough'' adds Italian weapons for single player and multiplayer as well as the British and Russian weapons from ''Spearhead''.
