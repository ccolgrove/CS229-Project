'''Spybot Search &amp; Destroy''' (S&amp;D) is a popular [[spyware]] and [[adware]] removal program compatible with [[Microsoft]] [[Windows 95]] and later. It scans the computer [[hard disk]] and/or [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] for malicious [[software]].

Spybot-S&amp;D was written by the German [[software engineering|software engineer]] [[Patrick Michael Kolla]], and is distributed by Kolla's [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] company Safer Networking Limited. Development began in 2000 when Kolla, still a student, wrote a small program to deal with the ''Aureate/Radiate'' and ''Conducent TimeSink'' programs, two of the earliest examples of adware.

==Licensing==

Spybot â Search &amp; Destroy is currently released as [[freeware]]. Corporate users are required to purchase a yearly license.

==Spybot features==
Along with spyware and adware detection and disinfection capabilities, Spybot-S&amp;D can repair the [[Windows registry|registry]], [[winsock]] [[Layered Service Provider|LSPs]], [[Component Object Model|ActiveX]] objects, [[malware|browser hijacker]]s and [[Browser Helper Object|BHO]]s, PUPS, [[cookies|computer cookies]], trackerware, heavy duty, homepage hijackers, [[keyloggers]], LSP, tracks, trojans, spybots, revision, and other kinds of malware. It can also, to some extent, protect a user's privacy by deleting usage tracks like tracking [[HTTP cookie|cookies]]. Spybot-S&amp;D also includes an &quot;Immunize&quot; feature to block the installation of spyware before it occurs e.g. by modifying the [[hosts file]]. Another tool included in Spybot-S&amp;D is a file shredder, for the secure deletion of files.  Spybot-S&amp;D is not intended to replace [[anti-virus software|anti-virus programs]], but it does detect some common [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]]. 

In 2008 Spybot-S&amp;D announced that they could recognize rootkits much better, and also provided a free-standing rootkit finder, RootAlyzer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spybot.info/de/news/2008-03-19.html| title=Die Seite von Spybot-S&amp;D!| language=[[German language]]| publisher=The official site}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The TeaTimer module can be optionally enabled, providing a level of active, [[real-time protection]] against unwanted registry changes. This comes in the form of pop-ups which alert the user to registry changes, and ask for approval before allowing the change. Registry changes are mostly (but by no means always) made when programs are installed, uninstalled, or updated; changes when program modification is not known to be happening can be due to hidden installation of malicious software.

Some programs ship with attached spyware or adware and refuse to run when they are not present; newer versions of Spybot replace the spyware binaries with inert dummies (designed to fool programs which simply check for the presence of the spyware's file). 

In order to detect recently created programs efficiently, detection [[Patch (computing)|updates]] are released weekly with other improvements such as added languages and better [[heuristic]] [[algorithm]]s. These updates are downloaded and installed from within the software from a variety of [[Mirror (computing)|mirrors]]. 

Spybot-S&amp;D is available for all versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] from [[Windows 95]] and up, and offers more than two dozen different languages and several [[Skin (computing)|skins]] to users.  Instructions are available on the website to enable users to design their own skins. 

Technical support is currently supplied by means of Internet forums&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.spybot.info/ |title=Welcome to the Safer Networking Forums |publisher= Spybot Search and Destroy |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support [[e-mail]]s (with a usual response time of no more than 24 hours).

==Reviews and awards==
{{Update|type=section|date=September 2011}}
In previous years Spybot-S&amp;D has been applauded for its ease of installation, free updates, and excellent features. It won numerous awards, including the World Class 2003 Awards, the ''[[PC Magazine]]'' Editor's Choice and ''[[PC User]]'' Top Buy #1. Additionally, Spybot was recommended by [[ZDNet]], the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[MSNBC]], [[CNN]] and other reviewers.

Although PC Magazine initially rated it highly in 2003, their rating declined to &quot;poor&quot; in 2008:
:PC Magazine Editors' Ratings (out of 5 possible)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcmag.com/products/0%2C%2Ctqs%3DBA55530DB50C2E5881C43D8444D653D6954AA142%2C00.asp?query=spybot&amp;action=newsimplequery&amp;cid=1562&amp;sid=1562&amp;gridtitle=Search+Results&amp;stpdinglp=1 |title=PC Magazine: Product Guides Archive |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* v1.3 2005 3/5
* v1.4 2005 2.5/5
* v1.5 2008 1.5/5

In January 2008, [[PC Magazine]], after giving ''Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 1.5'' a score of just 1.5 out of 5,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2261193,00.asp Free Security Software - Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 1.5 - At A Glance - Reviews by PC Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; elected it as one of the worst tech products of the first quarter of 2008 and called its [[malware]] cleaning-up skills mediocre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2282701,00.asp The Worst Tech Products of Q1 2008 - Reviews by PC Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==

Version 1.5 has better compatibility than previous versions with [[Wine (software)|Wine]] (software which allows running of Windows programs under [[Linux]]), and restores compatibility with Windows 95&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd15/index.html |title=Welcome to Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy 1.5 |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was faulty in 1.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spybot.info/en/faq/55.html |title=Is there a solution for the graphic bug in the TeaTimer notification window? |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Version 1.6 is said by Safer Networking to scan several times faster than version 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safer-networking.org/en/news/2008-07-08.html The home of Spybot-S&amp;D!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malicious clones==
Several people, knowing the program's great legitimacy, have made Spybot 'clones' with similar [[user interface]]s and similar sounding program names.  Some clones have been made by spyware manufacturers to make programs that pose as anti-spyware programs, but actually install spyware themselves. These programs are known as [[Rogue Antispyware|rogue antispyware]].

Searching the words &quot;spybot&quot;, or &quot;search &amp; destroy&quot;, &quot;spybot antispyware&quot; or any other related search on a [[web search engine|search engine]] will often result in a paid advertisement for &quot;[[SpySheriff|SpywareBot]]&quot;. This program is a known [[Rogue Antispyware|rogue antispyware]] program, which fraudulently uses the &quot;search and destroy&quot; logo and a name similar to Spybot to fool users into downloading their product instead of the original Spybot Search &amp; Destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm Spyware Warriors Rogue Antispyware Listing]&lt;/ref&gt; A key difference between the real Spybot S&amp;D, and false anti-virus programs is that the real Spybot S&amp;D does not require any payment.

Some malicious sites were subtle variations of the legitimate spybot s&amp;d URL such as &quot;Safer-networking.com&quot;. The real site is .org, and not .com.

== Incompatibility and conflicts  ==
;Removal by commercial security products
Several of the largest commercial security products require users to uninstall Spybot when they are being installed or when they run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Spybot-Search-Destroy-competitors-are-trying-to-force-its-removal/1237840882| title=Spybot Search &amp; Destroy competitors are trying to force its removal| publisher=Betanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Norton Internet Security
The makers of Spybot-S&amp;D came into conflict with [[Norton Internet Security]] over compatibility issues in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antivirus.about.com/od/spywareandadware/a/symandspy.htm|title=Symantec and Spybot: War of the Words|author=Mary Landesman|date=October 3, 2006|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symantec recommended [[Uninstaller|uninstalling]] Spybot-S&amp;D before installing Norton Internet Security. According to Safer Networking, no satisfactory explanation was provided to them for this decision. Antivirus professional Mary Landesman suggests a possible explanation may stem from a graphical glitch in TeaTimer module's confirmation dialog. An official explanation from Safer Networking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safer-networking.org/en/news/2005-06-22.html|title=Small bugs in TeaTimer|date=June 22, 2005|accessdate=2007-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the error was caused by a [[Software bug|bug]] in the program used to build their code. The result of the bug was that users had difficulty enabling Norton Internet Security to make necessary changes to critical registry areas, such as allowing itself to launch on computer startup. Aside from this, Mary Landesman, like Safer Networking, concluded that the two programs had no issue with one another. The bug was was fixed in the 1.5 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.spybot.info/en/faq/55.html| title=FAQ #55| publisher=The official site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Kaspersky Internet Security
[[Kaspersky]] Antivirus and Kaspersky Internet Security since version 2009 force users to uninstall Spybot during the installation process, although there is no serious incompatibility yet known. The discussion was concluded in the Kaspersky forum, which said not to install Spybot at all. Kaspersky seems to be reluctant to fix the issue, despite receiving several complaints.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.spybot.info/showthread.php?t=33577&lt;/ref&gt;

;Trend Micro
Trend Micro Officescan follows Norton, Kaspersky and McAfee in simply removing Spybot without warning or notification afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.spybot.info/showpost.php?p=154830&amp;postcount=11&lt;/ref&gt;

;Internet Explorer 8
The immunisation feature of Spybot â Search &amp; Destroy caused Internet Explorer 8 to start slower than expected.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969938/en-us&lt;/ref&gt; Fix [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969897 KB969897] to resolve this problem was issued by Microsoft on June 9, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safer-networking.org/en/news/2009-03-25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

;Avira AntiVir
AntiVir tells the user to uninstall Spybot. According to Spybot's developers this is unnecessary and they recommend reinstalling it if you did uninstall it during AntiVir's installation. Spybot's developers have contacted Avira, but Avira refuses to cooperate to resolve the problem.
