{{Security-Hacking}}
In computer security and everyday language, a '''hacker''' is someone who breaks into computers and computer networks. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, including profit, protest, or because of the challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;crackdown&quot; /&gt; The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground but it is now an open community.&lt;ref&gt;Blomquist, Brian (May 29, 1999). &quot;[http://archive.nypost.com/a/475198 FBI's Web Site Socked as Hackers Target Feds]&quot;. ''New York Post''. Retrieved on October 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- historical precedent, takes precedence --&gt;
While other uses of the word hacker exist that are not related to computer security, they are rarely used in mainstream context. They are subject to the long standing [[hacker definition controversy]] about the true meaning of the term hacker. In this controversy, the term hacker is reclaimed by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|computer programmers]] who argue that someone breaking into computers is better called a '''cracker''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html |title=Jargon File: Cracker |first=Eric |last=S. Raymond |accessdate=2010-05-08 |quote=Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker }}&lt;/ref&gt; not making a difference between computer criminals ([[black hats]]) and computer security experts ([[white hats]]). Some white hat hackers claim that they also deserve the title hacker, and that only black hats should be called crackers.

==History==
{{See|Timeline of computer security hacker history}}
[[Bruce Sterling]] traces part of the roots of the computer underground to the [[Yippies]], a 1960s counterculture movement which published the ''Technological Assistance Program'' (TAP) newsletter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''TAP'' was a ''[[phreaking|phone phreaking]]'' newsletter that taught the techniques necessary for the unauthorized exploration of the phone network. Many people from the phreaking community are also active in the hacking community even today, and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common among hackers to use aliases for the purpose of concealing identity, rather than revealing their real names.

===Hacker groups and conventions===
{{Main|Hacker conference|Hacker group}}

The computer underground is supported by regular real-world gatherings called [[hacker convention]]s or &quot;hacker cons&quot;. These draw many people every year including [[SummerCon]] (Summer), [[DEF CON]], [[HoHoCon]] (Christmas), ShmooCon (February), BlackHat, Hacker Halted, and [[H.O.P.E.]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In the early 1980s Hacker Groups became popular, Hacker groups provided access to information and resources, and a place to learn from other members. Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with an elite group.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas&quot;/&gt;

==Hacker attitudes==
Several subgroups of the computer underground with different attitudes and aims use different terms to demarcate themselves from each other, or try to exclude some specific group with which they do not agree. [[Eric S. Raymond]] (author of [[Jargon File|The New Hacker's Dictionary]]) advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers. Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as one wider hacker culture, a view harshly rejected by Raymond himself. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they give more emphasis to a spectrum of different categories, such as [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]],  [[grey hat]], [[black hat]] and [[script kiddie]]. In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term cracker. According to (Clifford R.D. 2006) a cracker or cracking is to &quot;gain unauthorized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information contained in that system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cybercrime:The Investigation, Prosecution and Defense of a Computer-Related Crime&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These subgroups may also be defined by the legal status of their activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;hacker hats&quot;/&gt;

;White hat
:A [[white hat (computer security)|white hat hacker]] breaks security for non-malicious reasons, for instance testing their own security system.The term &quot;white hat&quot; in Internet slang refers to an [[ethical hacker]]. This classification also includes individuals who perform [[Penetration testing|penetration tests]] and [[vulnerability assessment]]s within a contractual agreement. Often, this type of 'white hat' hacker is called an ethical hacker.  The International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants, also known as the [http://www.eccouncil.org/ EC-Council] has developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training covering the diverse arena of Ethical Hacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;hacker hats&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Douglas |title=Professional Penetration Testing |origyear=2010 |publisher=Syngress Press |location= |isbn=9781597494250 |page=503 |chapter=2 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Hat Hackers break into secure networks to destroy data or make the network unusable for those who are authorized to use the network. The way Black Hat Hackers choose the networks that they are going to break into is by a process that can be broken down into two parts. This is called the pre-hacking stage.

'''''Part 1 Targeting'''''
Targeting is when the hacker determines what network to break into. The target may be of particular interest to the hacker, or the hacker may &quot;Port Scan&quot; a network to determine if it is vulnerable to attacks. A port is defined as &quot;an opening through which the computer receives data via the network&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore2005&quot; /&gt; Open ports will allow a hacker to access the system.

'''''Part 2 Research and Information Gathering'''''
It is in this stage that the hacker will visit or contact the target in some way in hopes of finding out vital information that will help them access the system. The main way that hackers get desired results from this stage is from Social Engineering, which will be explained below. Aside from Social Engineering hackers can also use a technique called Dumpster Diving. Dumpster Diving is when a hacker will literally dive into a dumpster in hopes to find documents that users have thrown away, which will help them gain access to a network.
;Grey hat
:A [[grey hat]] hacker is a combination of a Black Hat and a White Hat Hacker. A Grey Hat Hacker may surf the internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of notifying the administrator that their system has been hacked, for example. Then they may offer to repair their system for a small fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore2006&quot; /&gt;

;Script kiddie
:A [[script kiddie]](or skiddie) is a non-expert who breaks into computer systems by using pre-packaged automated tools written by others, usually with little understanding of the underlying conceptâhence the term script (i.e. a prearranged plan or set of activities) kiddie (i.e. kid, childâan individual lacking knowledge and experience, immature).&lt;ref name=&quot;Andress 10&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=CIW Security Professional |last=Andress |first=Mandy |authorlink= |coauthors=Cox, Phil; Tittel, Ed |year= |publisher=Hungry Minds, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0764548220 |page=10 |page=638 |url= |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hacktivist
:A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to announce a social, ideological, religious, or political message. In general, most [[hacktivism]] involves website defacement or [[denial-of-service attack]]s.

==Attacks==
{{Main|Computer insecurity}}
{{Computer security}}

A typical approach in an attack on Internet-connected system is:

# [[Network enumeration]]: Discovering information about the intended target.
# [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability analysis]]: Identifying potential ways of attack.
# [[Exploitation]]: Attempting to compromise the system by employing the vulnerabilities found through the vulnerability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25916 Hacking approach]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to do so, there are several recurring tools of the trade and techniques used by computer criminals and security experts.

===Security exploits===
{{Main|Exploit (computer security)}}

A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness. Common examples of security exploits are [[SQL injection]], [[Cross Site Scripting]] and [[Cross Site Request Forgery]] which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice. Other exploits would be able to be used through [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], [[PHP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and some web-pages. These are very common in website/domain hacking.

===Techniques===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
;Vulnerability scanner
{{main|Vulnerability scanner}}
:A vulnerability scanner is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses. Hackers also commonly use [[port scanner]]s. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are &quot;open&quot; or available to access the computer, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port, and its version number. (Note that [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports/machines both inbound and outbound, but can still be circumvented.)
;Password cracking
{{main|Password cracking}}
:Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords  from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. A common approach is to repeatedly try guesses for the password.
;Packet sniffer
{{main|Packet sniffer}}
:A packet sniffer is an application that captures data packets, which can be used to capture passwords and other data in transit over the network.
;Spoofing attack (Phishing)
{{main|Spoofing attack}}
:A spoofing attack involves one program, system, or website successfully masquerading as another by falsifying data and thereby being treated as a trusted system by a user or another program.  The purpose of this is usually to fool programs, systems, or users into revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords, to the attacker.
;Rootkit
{{main|Rootkit}}
:A rootkit is designed to conceal the compromise of a computer's security, and can represent any of a set of programs which work to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators. Usually, a rootkit will obscure its installation and attempt to prevent its removal through a subversion of standard system security.  Rootkits may include replacements for system binaries so that it becomes impossible for the legitimate user to detect the presence of the intruder on the system by looking at [[process table]]s.
;Social engineering
{{main|Social engineering (computer security)}}
When a Hacker, typically a black hat, is in the second stage of the targeting process, he or she will typically use some social engineering tactics to get enough information to access the network. A common practice for hackers who use this technique, is to contact the system administrator and play the role of a user who cannot get access to his or her system. Hackers who use this technique have to be quite savvy and choose the words they use carefully, in order to trick the system administrator into giving them information. In some cases only an employed help desk user will answer the phone and they are generally easy to trick. Another typical hacker approach is for the hacker to act like a very angry supervisor and when the his/her authority is questioned they will threaten the help desk user with their job. Social Engineering is so effective because users are the most vulnerable part of an organization. All the security devices and programs in the world won't keep an organization safe if an employee gives away a password. Black Hat Hackers take advantage of this fact. Social Engineering can also be broken down into four sub-groups. These are intimidation, helpfulness, technical, and name-dropping.
:* '''''Intimidation''''' As stated above, with the angry supervisor, the hacker attacks the person who answers the phone with threats to their job. Many people at this point will accept that the hacker is a supervisor and give them the needed information.
:* '''''Helpfulness'''''  Opposite to intimidation, helpfulness is taking advantage of a person natural instinct to help someone with a problem. The hacker will not get angry instead act very distressed and concerned. The help desk is the most vulnerable to this type of Social Engineering, because they generally have the authority to change or reset passwords which is exactly what the hacker needs.
:* '''''Name-Dropping''''' Simply put the hacker uses the names of advanced users as &quot;key words&quot;, and gets the person who answers the phone to believe that they are part of the company because of this. Some information, like web page ownership, can be obtained easily on the web. Other information such as president and vice president names might have to be obtained via dumpster diving.
:* '''''Technical'''''  Using technology to get information is also a great way to get it. A hacker can send a fax or an email to a legitimate user in hopes to get a response containing vital information. Many times the hacker will act like he/she is involved with law enforcement and needs certain data for record keeping purposes or investigations.
;Trojan horses
{{main|Trojan horse (computing)}}
:A Trojan horse is a program which seems to be doing one thing, but is actually doing another. A trojan horse can be used to set up a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] in a computer system such that the intruder can gain access later. (The name refers to the [[Trojan Horse|horse]] from the [[Trojan War]], with conceptually similar function of deceiving defenders into bringing an intruder inside.)
;Viruses
{{main|Computer virus}}
:A virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. Therefore, a computer virus behaves in a way similar to a [[Virus|biological virus]], which spreads by inserting itself into living cells.

:While some are harmless or mere hoaxes most computer viruses are considered malicious.
;Worms
{{main|Computer worm}}
:Like a virus, a worm is also a self-replicating program. A worm differs from a virus in that it propagates through computer networks without user intervention. Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Many people conflate the terms &quot;virus&quot; and &quot;worm&quot;, using them both to describe any self-propagating program.
;Key loggers
{{main|Keystroke logging}}
:A key logger is a tool designed to record ('log') every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval.  Its purpose is usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine, such as a user's password or other private data. Some key loggers uses virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to remain active and hidden. However, some key loggers are used in legitimate ways and sometimes to even enhance computer security. As an example, a business might have a key logger on a computer used at a [[point of sale]] and data collected by the key logger could be used for catching employee fraud.
