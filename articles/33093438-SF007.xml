'''Metro''' is an internal code name for a [[typography]]-based [[design language]] created by [[Microsoft]], originally for use in Windows Phone 7. Early uses of the Metro principles, such as the typography, began as early as [[Encarta 95|Microsoft Encarta 95]], and later evolved into products such as [[Windows Media Center]] and [[Zune]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kruzeniski.com/2011/how-print-design-is-the-future-of-interaction/ |title=Mike Kruzeniski â How Print Design is the Future of Interaction |publisher=Kruzeniski.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the principles of Metro were included in Microsoft's mobile operating system, [[Windows Phone]], the [[Xbox 360]] dashboard update, and [[Windows 8]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WindowsPhone7UI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2010/03/18/windows-phone-7-series-ui-design-amp-interaction-guide.aspx| title= Windows Phone 7 Series UI Design &amp; Interaction Guide|accessdate= 2010-10-09|date= March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specially-made version of Microsoft's [[Segoe]] font family, Segoe WP, is used as the main font family for all typographical elements.&lt;ref name = &quot;WindowsPhone7UI&quot; /&gt;  It was confirmed by Microsoft at Computex that [[Windows 8]], the successor to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] 7, takes inspiration from Metro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technewsdaily.com/video-windows-8-uses-wp7-design-runs-from-usb-stick-2529/  &quot;Video: Windows 8 Uses WP7 Design, Runs from USB Stick&quot;]. Published Friday 15 April 2011. Retrieved Friday 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also plans to add the Metro design principles to other products and services, like the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Windows Live]], in order to create a unified and distinctive look across its consumer products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2011/06/06/e3-xbox-360-getting-tv-tuner-bing-search-metro-interface |title=E3: Xbox 360 getting TV tuner, Bing search, Metro interface &amp;#124; The Microsoft Blog - seattlepi.com |publisher=Blog.seattlepi.com |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&quot;Metro&quot; is based on the design principles of classic [[International Typographic Style|Swiss graphic design]].  Early glimpses of this style could be seen in [[Windows Media Center]] for [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]]{{Citation needed |date=October 2010}}, which favored text as the primary form of navigation. This interface carried over into later iterations of Media Center. In 2006, [[Zune]] refreshed its interface using these Metro principles. Microsoft designers decided to redesign the interface and with more focus on clean typography and less on UI chrome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=189338|title=Windows Phone Design System: Codenamed âMetroâ|accessdate=2010-10-09|format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zune Desktop Client was also redesigned with an emphasis on typography and clean design that was different from the Zune's previous [[Portable Media Center]] based UI. Flat colored &quot;live tiles&quot; were introduced into the Metro design language during the early Windows Phone's studies. &lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.findtarget.com/search/Metro%20%28design%20language%29/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has begun integrating these elements of the Metro design language into its other products, with direct influence being seen in newer versions of [[Windows Live Messenger]] and [[Live Mesh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WindowsPhone7UI&quot;/&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Seattle Metro 4.jpg|thumb|A [[King County Metro]] Airport and metro signâsignage partly inspired the language due to its readability and cleanness.]] Microsoft's design team says that the Metro UI is partly inspired by signs commonly found at public transport systems, for instance on the [[King County Metro Transit]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro&quot;/&gt;, a public transit system that serves the Seattle metropolitan area where Microsoft is headquartered. Metro places a large focus on typography and has large text that catches the eye. Microsoft says that Metro is designed to be &quot;sleek, quick, modern&quot; and a &quot;refresh&quot; from the [[computer icon|icon]]-based interfaces of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Browse Blackboard Home |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/metro |title=Metro - Blackboard |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=2011-04-25 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All instances use fonts based on the [[Segoe]] font family designed by Steve Matteson at Agfa Monotype and licensed to Microsoft. For the Zune, Microsoft created a custom version called Zegoe UI, and for [[Windows Phone]], they created the &quot;Segoe WP&quot; font family; apart from minor differences, the fonts are largely the same.

===Response===
Response to Metro has been generally positive. [[Engadget]] said, &quot;Microsoft continues its push towards big, big typography here, providing a sophisticated, neatly designed layout that's almost as functional as it is attractive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zune HD |url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/zune-hd-review/11 |title=Zune HD review |publisher=Engadget |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNET]] complimented the Metro design, saying, &quot;it's a bit more daring and informal than the tight, sterile icon grids and Rolodex menus of the iPhone and iPod Touch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zune HD 64GB Review|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/mp3-players/zune-hd-64gb/4505-6490_7-34060884.html?tag=rvwBody#reviewPage1|publisher=CNET|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Designers Society of America (IDEA) awarded Windows Phone, which uses Metro, the &quot;People's Choice Design&quot; gold award as well as the &quot;Best in Show&quot; award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Warren |url=http://www.winrumors.com/windows-phone-wins-idea-2011-peoples-choice-design-award/ |title=Windows Phone wins IDEA 2011 â peopleâs choice design award |publisher=WinRumors |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isabel Ancona, the User Experience Consultant at IDEA, explained why Windows Phone won this award and explains the user experience of Metro:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.org/windows-phone-7 |title=Windows Phone 7 &amp;#124; Industrial Designers Society of America |publisher=IDSA |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The innovation here is the fluidity of experience and focus on the data, without using tradition user interface conventions of windows and frames.  Data becomes the visual elements and controls. Simple gestures and transitions guide the user deeper into content. A truly elegant and unique experience.}}

==Principles==

[[File:Windows 8 Developer Preview Start Screen.png|thumb|right|The new [[Windows 8]] Start Screen, making use of flat, colored live tiles and a full bleed canvas as used in Windows Phone and Xbox 360 Dashboard.]]
The Metro design language was designed specifically to consolidate groups of common tasks to speed up usage. This is accomplished by excluding superfluous graphics and instead relying on the actual content to also function as the main UI. The resulting interfaces favour larger hubs over smaller buttons and often feature laterally scrolling [[full bleed]] canvases. Page titles are usually large and consequently also take advantage of lateral scrolling. 

Animation plays a large part, with transitions, and user interactions such as presses or swipes recommended to always be acknowledged by some form of natural animation or motion. This is intended to give the user the impression that the UI is &quot;alive&quot; and responsive, with &quot;an added sense of depth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/CL14|title= Windows Phone UI and Design Language| accessdate= 2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Windows team blog | date = 2011-2-16 | url = http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2011/02/16/from-transportation-to-pixels.aspx | title = From Transportation to Pixels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, Microsoft has compiled a list of principles as core to the Metro Design Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/design/toolbox/tutorials/windows-phone-7/metro/ |title=Metro Design Language of Windows Phone 7 &amp;#124; Microsoft Design .toolbox |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
