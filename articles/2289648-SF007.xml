'''Windows Vista''' is an [[operating system]] released in several variations developed by [[Microsoft]] for use on [[personal computer]]s, including home and business [[Desktop computer|desktops]], [[laptop]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s, and [[Home theater PC|media center]] PCs. Prior to its announcement on July 22, 2005, Windows Vista was known by its [[List of Microsoft codenames|codename]] &quot;Longhorn.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/jul05/07-22LHMA.mspx|title=Media Alert: Microsoft Unveils Official Name for &quot;Longhorn&quot; and Sets Date for First Beta Targeted at Developers and IT Professionals|author=Microsoft|accessdate=2007-01-02|date=2005-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development was completed on November 8, 2006; over the following three months it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers, business customers, and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor, [[Windows XP]], the longest time span between successive releases of [[Microsoft Windows]] desktop operating systems. It was succeeded by [[Windows 7]], which was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and released worldwide for retail on October 22, 2009.

Windows Vista contains [[Features new to Windows Vista|many changes and new features]], including an updated [[graphical user interface]] and [[Skin (computing)|visual style]] dubbed [[Windows Aero|Aero]], a redesigned [[Windows Search|search]] function, multimedia tools including [[Windows DVD Maker]], and redesigned networking, audio, print, and display sub-systems. Vista aims to increase the level of communication between machines on a [[home network]], using [[peer-to-peer]] technology to simplify sharing [[computer file|files]] and [[digital media|media]] between computers and devices. Windows Vista includes version 3.0 of the [[.NET Framework]], allowing [[software developer]]s to write applications without traditional [[Windows API]]s.

Microsoft's primary stated objective with Windows Vista was to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatesrsa&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common [[criticism of Windows XP]] and its predecessors was their commonly exploited [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] and overall susceptibility to [[malware]], [[computer virus|viruses]] and [[buffer overflow]]s. In light of this, Microsoft chairman [[Bill Gates]] announced in early 2002 a company-wide &quot;[[Trustworthy Computing]] initiative&quot; which aimed to incorporate security into every aspect of software development at the company. Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and [[Windows Server 2003]] above finishing Windows Vista, thus delaying its completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;winxpdevpriority&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these new features and security improvements have garnered positive reviews, Vista has also been the target of much criticism and negative press. [[Criticism of Windows Vista]] has targeted its high system requirements, its more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of new [[digital rights management]] technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software, and the number of authorization prompts for [[User Account Control]]. As a result of these and other issues, Windows Vista had seen initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld1&quot;&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9072218&amp;source=NLT_AM&amp;nlid=1 Leopard drubs Vista in corporate satisfaction]. Computerworld.com (2008-03-26). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with an estimated 330 million Internet users as of January 2009, it had been announced that Vista usage had surpassed Microsoftâs pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowsitpro2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web

At the release of Windows 7 (October 2009), Windows Vista (with approximately 400 million Internet users) was the second most widely used operating system on the Internet with an approximately 18.6% market share, the most widely used being Windows XP with an approximately 63.3% market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2009&amp;month=8|title=W3Counter Global Web Stats:August 2009|publisher=W3Counter|accessdate= March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|May 2010}}, Windows Vista's market share had an estimated range from 15.26% to 26.04%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10|title=Operating system market share|publisher=Marketshare Hitslink|accessdate= June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statowl.com/operating_system_market_share_by_os_version.php?1=1&amp;timeframe=last_6&amp;interval=month&amp;chart_id=4&amp;fltr_br=&amp;fltr_os=&amp;fltr_se=&amp;fltr_cn=&amp;limit%5B%5D=windows|title=Operating System Version Usage|publisher=StatOwl|accessdate= June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 2011 Vista market share is 11.18%. &lt;ref&gt;{{http://gs.statcounter.com/?PHPSESSID=qj9qsa7sh459ub35u870sbuht1#os-ww-monthly-201108-201110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Development of Vista==
{{Main|Development of Windows Vista}}
[[Image:Windows Longhorn logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The unofficial Windows Longhorn logo]]
Microsoft began work on Windows Vista, known at the time by its [[codename]] Longhorn, in May 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; five months before the release of Windows XP. It was originally expected to ship sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between Windows XP and Blackcomb, which was planned to be the company's next major operating system release. Gradually, &quot;Longhorn&quot; assimilated many of the important new features and technologies slated for Blackcomb, resulting in the release date being pushed back several times. Many of Microsoft's developers were also re-tasked to build updates to [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] to strengthen security. Faced with ongoing delays and concerns about [[feature creep]], Microsoft announced on August 27, 2004, that it had revised its plans. The original Longhorn, based on the [[Windows XP]] source code, was scrapped, and Longhorn's development started anew, building on the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 codebase, and re-incorporating only the features that would be intended for an actual operating system release. Some previously announced features such as [[WinFS]] were dropped or postponed, and a new software development methodology called the [[Security Development Lifecycle]] was incorporated in an effort to address concerns with the security of the Windows codebase which is programmed in [[C Programming Language|C]], [[C++]] and [[Assembly language|Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/winntas/training/ntarchitectoview/ntarc_2.mspx Microsoft Windows System Overview].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Longhorn was named Windows Vista in July 2005, an unprecedented [[Development stage|beta-test]] program was started, involving hundreds of thousands of volunteers and companies. In September of that year, Microsoft started releasing regular [[Community Technology Preview]]s (CTP) to beta testers. The first of these was distributed at the 2005 Microsoft [[Professional Developers Conference]], and was subsequently released to beta testers and [[Microsoft Developer Network]] subscribers. The builds that followed incorporated most of the planned features for the final product, as well as a number of changes to the user interface, based largely on feedback from beta testers. Windows Vista was deemed feature-complete with the release of the &quot;February CTP&quot;, released on February 22, 2006, and much of the remainder of work between that build and the final release of the product focused on stability, performance, application and driver compatibility, and documentation. Beta 2, released in late May, was the first build to be made available to the general public through Microsoft's Customer Preview Program. It was downloaded by over five million people. Two release candidates followed in September and October, both of which were made available to a large number of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Paul | last=Thurrott | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_roadtogold_07.asp | title=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows: Road to Gold: The Long Road to Windows Vista Part 7: July 2006âPresent | publisher=SuperSite for Windows | date=2006-11-05 | accessdate=2007-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Microsoft had originally hoped to have the consumer versions of the operating system available worldwide in time for Christmas 2006, it was announced in March 2006 that the release date would be pushed back to January 2007, in order to give the companyâand the hardware and software companies which Microsoft depends on for providing [[device driver]]sâadditional time to prepare. Development of Windows Vista came to an end when Microsoft announced that it had been finalized on November 8, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Nick | last=White | url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2006/11/08/windows-vista-releases-to-manufacturing.aspx | title=Windows Vista releases to manufacturing | publisher=Windows Vista team blog | date=2006-11-08 | accessdate=2006-11-08 }} Windows Vista cost Microsoft six billion dollars to develop.{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Vista-a-6-Billion-Dollars-Operating-System-44096.shtml |title=Vista â a $6 Billion Dollars Operating System â The best billions Bill Gates has ever spent â Softpedia |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New or changed features==
{{Main| Features new to Windows Vista}}
Windows Vista developed features and functionalities not present in its predecessors.

===End-user===
[[Image:Windows Explorer Vista.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in Windows Vista]]

* '''[[Windows Aero]]:''' The new graphical user interface is named ''Windows Aero'', which [[Jim Allchin]] stated is an acronym for ''Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2006/11/09/the-sounds-of-windows-vista.aspx|title=The Sounds of Windows|author=&quot;JimAll&quot;, links to page identifying him as Jim Allchin, Co-President, Platform and Services Division|accessdate=2007-12-31|date=2006-11-09|publisher=Windows Vista Team Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft intended the new interface to be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing than those of previous Windows versions, including new transparencies, live thumbnails, live icons, and animations, thus providing a new level of [[attractiveness|eye candy]]. [[Laptop]] users report, however, that enabling Aero shortens battery life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/04/vistas-aero-interface-blamed-for-truncated-battery-life/|title=Vista's Aero interface blamed for truncated battery life|author=Darren Murph|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=May 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/05/06/2452864.aspx|title=Vista Battery Fix?|date=May 6, 2007|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Windows Shell]]:''' The new Windows shell differs significantly from the shell in Windows XP, offering a new range of organization, navigation, and search capabilities. [[Windows Explorer|Windows Explorer's]] task pane has been removed, integrating the relevant task options into the toolbar. A &quot;Favorite links&quot; pane has been added, enabling one-click access to common directories. The address bar has been replaced with a [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumb navigation]] system. The preview pane allows users to see thumbnails of various files and view the contents of documents. The details pane shows information such as file size and type, and allows viewing and editing of [[Tag (metadata)|embedded tags]] in supported file formats. The [[Start menu]] has changed as well; it no longer uses ever-expanding boxes when navigating through Programs. The word &quot;Start&quot; itself has been removed in favor of a blue Windows Pearl.
* '''[[Search algorithm|Instant Search]]''' (also known as ''[[Incremental find|search as you type]]'') : Windows Vista features a new way of searching called Instant Search, which is significantly faster and more in-depth (content-based) than the search features found in any of the previous versions of Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = A Closer Look at Windows Vista Part II: Enhanced Search
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Windows Sidebar]]:''' A transparent panel anchored to the side of the screen where a user can place [[Desktop Gadgets]], which are small applets designed for a specialized purpose (such as displaying the weather or sports scores). Gadgets can also be placed on other parts of the desktop.
* '''[[Internet Explorer 7|Windows Internet Explorer 7]]:''' New user interface, [[tabbed browsing]], [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], a search box, improved printing,&lt;ref name=&quot;ieprint&quot;&gt;Windows Internet Explorer, Printing Advances [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/ie7printing.mspx Printing in IE7].&lt;/ref&gt; Page Zoom, Quick Tabs (thumbnails of all open tabs), Anti-Phishing filter, a number of new security protection features, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), and improved web standards support. IE7 in Windows Vista runs in isolation from other applications in the operating system (protected mode); exploits and malicious software are restricted from writing to any location beyond Temporary Internet Files without explicit user consent.
[[Image:Windows Media Player 11 Vista.png|thumb|[[Windows Media Player 11]]]]
* '''[[Windows Media Player 11]]''', a major revamp of Microsoft's program for playing and organizing music and video. New features in this version include word wheeling ([[incremental search]] or &quot;search as you type&quot;), a new [[GUI]] for the media library, photo display and organization, the ability to share music libraries over a network with other Windows Vista machines, [[Xbox 360]] integration, and support for other [[Windows Media Center Extender|Media Center Extenders]].
* '''[[Backup and Restore Center]]:''' Includes a backup and restore application that gives users the ability to schedule periodic backups of files on their computer, as well as recovery from previous backups. Backups are incremental, storing only the changes each time, minimizing disk usage. It also features Complete PC Backup (available only in [[Windows Vista editions|the Ultimate, Business, and Enterprise versions]]) which backs up an entire computer as an image onto a hard disk or DVD. Complete PC Backup can automatically recreate a machine setup onto new hardware or hard disk in case of any hardware failures. Complete PC Restore can be initiated from within Windows Vista or from the Windows Vista installation CD in the event the PC is so corrupt that it cannot start up normally from the hard disk.
* '''[[Windows Mail]]:''' A replacement for Outlook Express that includes a new mail store that improves stability,&lt;ref name=&quot;winmail&quot;&gt;Windows Mail Features Explained, See Reliability Section [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/mail.mspx Windows Mail].&lt;/ref&gt; and features integrated Instant Search. It has the Phishing Filter like IE7 and [[spam filter|Junk mail filtering]] that is enhanced through regular updates via Windows Update.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowsmail&quot;&gt;Windows Mail was demonstrated by the development team in [http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=116711 this Channel 9 video].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Windows Calendar]]''' is a new calendar and task application.
* '''[[Windows Photo Gallery]]''', a photo and movie library management application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual items, adjust colors and exposure, create and display slideshows (with pan and fade effects) and burn slideshows to DVD.
* '''[[Windows DVD Maker]]''', a companion program to [[Windows Movie Maker]] that provides the ability to create video DVDs based on a user's content. Users can design a DVD with title, menu, video, soundtrack, pan and zoom motion effects on pictures or slides.
* '''[[Windows Media Center]]''', which was previously exclusively bundled in a separate version of Windows XP, known as [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]], has been incorporated into the Home Premium and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista.
* '''Games and [[Windows Vista Games Explorer|Games Explorer]]:''' Games included with Windows have been modified to showcase Vista's graphics capabilities. New games are [[Chess Titans]] (3D [[Chess]] game), [[Mahjong Titans]] (3D [[Mahjong]] game) and [[Purble Place]] (A small collection of games, oriented towards younger children. Including: A matching game, a [[cake]]-creator game, and a [[dress-up]] puzzle game). A new Games Explorer special folder contains shortcuts and information to all games on the user's computer.

[[Image:Windows Mobility Center screenshot.png|thumb|[[Windows Mobility Center]].]]
* '''[[Windows Mobility Center]]''' is a control panel that centralizes the most relevant information related to mobile computing (brightness, sound, battery level / power scheme selection, wireless network, screen orientation, presentation settings, etc.).
* '''[[Windows Meeting Space]]''' replaces [[NetMeeting]]. Users can share applications (or their entire desktop) with other users on the local network, or over the Internet using peer-to-peer technology (higher versions than Starter and Home Basic can take advantage of hosting capabilities, Starter and Home Basic editions are limited to &quot;join&quot; mode only)
* '''[[Shadow Copy]]''' automatically creates daily backup copies of files and folders. Users can also create &quot;shadow copies&quot; by setting a System Protection Point using the System Protection tab in the System control panel. The user can be presented multiple versions of a file throughout a limited history and be allowed to restore, delete, or copy those versions. This feature is available only in the Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista and is inherited from [[Windows Server 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Windows Update Vista.png|thumb|[[Windows Update]] with [[Windows Ultimate Extras]]]]
* '''[[Windows Update]]:''' Software and security updates have been simplified,&lt;ref name=&quot;winupdate&quot;&gt;Windows Update, Easier and Less Disruptive [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/windowsupdate.mspx Windows Update in Windows Vista].&lt;/ref&gt; now operating solely via a control panel instead of as a [[web application]]. Windows Mail's spam filter and Windows Defender's definitions are updated automatically via Windows Update. Users who choose the recommended setting for Automatic Updates will have the latest drivers installed and available when they add a new device.
* '''[[Parental controls]]:''' Allows administrators to control which websites, programs and games each Limited user can use and install. This feature is not included in the Business or Enterprise editions of Vista.
* '''[[Windows SideShow]]:''' Enables the auxiliary displays on newer laptops or on supported Windows Mobile devices. It is meant to be used to display device gadgets while the computer is on or off.
* '''[[Windows Speech Recognition|Speech recognition]]''' is integrated into Vista.&lt;ref name=&quot;winspeech&quot;&gt;Windows Vista, SAPI [http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/01/speechinWindowsVista/ Talking Windows]&lt;/ref&gt; It features a redesigned user interface and configurable command-and-control commands. Unlike the Office 2003 version, which works only in Office and WordPad, Speech Recognition in Windows Vista works for any accessible application. In addition, it currently supports several languages: British and American English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) and Japanese.
* New [[font]]s, including several designed for [[screen reading]], and improved Chinese (Yahei, JhengHei), Japanese (Meiryo) and Korean (Malgun) fonts. [[ClearType]] has also been enhanced and enabled by default.
* Improved audio controls allow the system-wide volume or volume of individual audio devices and even individual applications to be controlled separately. New audio functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Speaker Fill and Headphone virtualization have also been incorporated.
* '''[[Problem Reports and Solutions]]''', a control panel which allows users to view previously sent problems and any solutions or additional information that is available.
* '''[[Windows System Assessment Tool]]''' is a tool used to benchmark system performance. Software such as games can retrieve this rating and modify its own behavior at runtime to improve performance. The benchmark tests [[CPU]], [[RAM]], 2-D and 3-D graphics acceleration, graphics memory and hard disk space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/8/f/98f3fe47-dfc3-4e74-92a3-088782200fe7/TWAR05002_WinHEC05.ppt|title=TWAR05002_WinHEC05.ppt at download.microsoft.com|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;winsat&quot;&gt;Windows Vista, The System Assessment Tool [http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/topics/vista/winsat.mspx WinSat].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Windows Ultimate Extras]]''': The Ultimate edition of Windows Vista provides, via Windows Update, access to some additional features. These are a collection of additional [[Multilingual User Interface|MUI]] language packs, ''Texas Hold 'Em'' (a Poker game) and ''Microsoft Tinker'' (a strategy game where the character is a robot), [[BitLocker Drive Encryption|BitLocker]] and [[Encrypting File System|EFS]] enhancements which allow users to back up their encryption [[key (cryptography)|key]] online in a ''Digital Locker'', and [[Windows Dreamscene]], which enables the use of videos in [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]] and [[Windows Media Video|WMV]] formats as the desktop background. On April 21, 2008, Microsoft launched two more Ultimate Extras; three new Windows sound schemes, and a content pack for [[Dreamscene]]. Various DreamScene Content Packs have been released since the final version of DreamScene was released.
* '''Reliability and Performance Monitor''' includes various tools for tuning and monitoring system performance and resources activities of [[Central processing unit|CPU]], disks, network, memory and other resources. It shows the operations on files, the opened connections, etc.
* '''Disk Management''': The [[Logical Disk Manager]] in Windows Vista supports shrinking and expanding volumes on-the-fly.
* '''Windows Anytime Upgrade''': is a program that allows a user to upgrade their computer running Vista to a higher edition.  For example, a computer running Windows Vista Home Basic can be upgraded to Home Premium or better.  The advantages of using Anytime Upgrade are that your programs and data aren't erased, It just installs the extra features of the edition you're upgrading to, and the price is less to upgrade than to replace your installation of windows with the edition you wish to upgrade to.

{{Main|Technical features new to Windows Vista}}
Windows Vista is intended to be a technology-based release, to provide a base to include advanced technologies, many of which are related to how the system functions and thus not readily visible to the user. An example is the complete restructuring of the architecture of the audio, print, display, and networking subsystems; although the results of this work are visible to software developers, end-users will only see what appear to be evolutionary changes in the user interface.

Vista includes technologies such as [[ReadyBoost]] and [[ReadyDrive]] which employ fast [[flash memory]] (located on [[USB drive]]s and [[hybrid drive|hybrid hard disk drive]]s) to improve system performance by caching commonly used programs and data. This manifests itself in improved battery life on notebook computers as well, since a hybrid drive can be spun down when not in use. Another new technology called [[Windows Vista I/O technologies#SuperFetch|SuperFetch]] utilizes [[machine learning]] techniques to analyze usage patterns to allow Windows Vista to make intelligent decisions about what content should be present in system memory at any given time. It uses almost all the extra RAM as [[Page cache|disk cache]]. In conjunction with SuperFetch, an automatic built-in [[Windows Disk Defragmenter]] makes sure that those applications are strategically positioned on the hard disk where they can be loaded into memory very quickly with the least amount of physical movement of the hard diskâs read-write heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/window-on-windows/?p=735 |title=Understand how SuperFetch uses RAM to enhance system performance |work=[[TechRepublic]] |date=9 July 2008 |accessdate=2 October 2008 |first=Greg |last=Shultz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the redesign of the networking architecture, [[IPv6]] has been fully incorporated into the operating system and a number of performance improvements have been introduced, such as [[TCP window scale option|TCP window scaling]]. Earlier versions of Windows typically needed third-party wireless networking software to work properly, but this is not the case with Vista, which includes more comprehensive wireless networking support.

For graphics, Vista introduces a new [[Windows Display Driver Model]] and a major revision to [[Direct3D]]. The new driver model facilitates the new [[Desktop Window Manager]], which provides the [[page tearing|tearing]]-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of Windows Aero. Direct3D 10, developed in conjunction with major graphics card manufacturers, is a new architecture with more advanced [[shader]] support, and allows the [[graphics processing unit]] to render more complex scenes without assistance from the CPU. It features improved load balancing between CPU and GPU and also optimizes data transfer between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/windowsvista/articles/447226.aspx |title=DirectX10: The Next Generation in Gaming |accessdate=25 January 2007 |work=Windows Vista Team Blog |date=16 August 2006 |first=Nick |last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt; WDDM also provides video content playback that rivals typical consumer electronics devices. It does this by making it easy to connect to external monitors, providing for protected HD video playback and increasing overall video playback quality. For the first time in Windows, graphics processing unit (GPU) multitasking is possible, enabling users to run more than one GPU-intensive application simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480220.aspx |title=Windows Vista Display Driver Model |work=[[MSDN Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the core of the [[operating system]], many improvements have been made to the memory manager, process scheduler and I/O scheduler. The Heap Manager implements additional features such as integrity checking in order to improve robustness and defend against [[buffer overflow]] security [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]], although this comes at the price of breaking backward compatibility with some legacy applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kernel Enhancements for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 |format=[[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |year=2006 |month=May |url=

===Security-related===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2007}}
[[Image:User Account Control.png|thumb|A User Account Control consent dialog, showing an administrator, Alex]]
{{Main|Security and safety features new to Windows Vista}}
Improved security was a primary design goal for Vista.&lt;ref name=&quot;gatesrsa&quot; /&gt; Microsoft's [[Trustworthy Computing]] initiative, which aims to improve public trust in its products, has had a direct effect on its development. This effort has resulted in a number of new security and safety features.

[[User Account Control]], or UAC is perhaps the most significant and visible of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it possible for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default, with a view to stopping [[malware]] from making unauthorized changes to the system. This was often difficult in previous versions of Windows, as the previous &quot;limited&quot; user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a large proportion of application software, and even prevented some basic operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray. In Windows Vista, when an action is performed that requires administrative rights (such as installing/uninstalling software or making system-wide configuration changes), the user is first prompted for an administrator name and password; in cases where the user is already an administrator, the user is still prompted to confirm the pending privileged action. Regular use of the computer such as running programs, printing, or surfing the Internet does not trigger UAC prompts. User Account Control asks for credentials in a Secure Desktop mode, in which the entire screen is dimmed, and only the authorization window is active and highlighted. The intent is to stop a malicious program misleading the user by interfering with the authorization window, and to hint to the user the importance of the prompt.

Testing by [[Symantec Corporation]] has proven the effectiveness of UAC. Symantec used over 2,000 active malware samples, consisting of [[backdoor]]s, [[keyloggers]], [[rootkits]], mass mailers, [[trojan horses]], [[spyware]], [[adware]], and various other samples. Each was executed on a default Windows Vista installation within a standard user account. UAC effectively blocked over 50 percent of each [[threat (computer)|threat]], excluding rootkits. 5 percent or less of the [[malware]] which evaded UAC survived a reboot.

[[Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer 7]]'s new security and safety features include a [[phishing]] filter, [[Internationalized domain name|IDN]] with anti-spoofing capabilities, and integration with system-wide parental controls. For added security, [[ActiveX]] controls are disabled by default. Also, Internet Explorer operates in a protected mode, which operates with lower permissions than the user and runs in isolation from other applications in the operating system, preventing it from accessing or modifying anything besides the Temporary Internet Files directory.&lt;ref name=&quot;protectedmodeie&quot;&gt;Protected Mode IE has been described in detail at the Internet Explorer team blog: [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/02/09/528963.aspx Protected Mode in Vista IE7] and [http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/20/471975.aspx More details on Protected Mode IE in Windows Vista].&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's anti-spyware product, ''[[Windows Defender]]'', has been incorporated into Windows, providing protection against malware and other threats. Changes to various system configuration settings (such as new auto-starting applications) are blocked unless the user gives consent.

Whereas prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using [[Encrypting File System]], the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista include [[BitLocker Drive Encryption]] which can protect entire [[volume (computing)|volumes]], notably the operating system volume. However, BitLocker requires approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently unencrypted and to contain system files in order for Windows to boot. In normal circumstances, the only time this partition is accessed is when the computer is booting, or when there is a Windows update that changes files in this area which is a legitimate reason to access this section of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue, because a hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe), or malicious software running with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write to this &quot;Ghost Partition&quot; and allow a piece of malicious software to compromise the system, or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in conjunction with a [[Trusted Platform Module]] (TPM) [[cryptoprocessor]] (version 1.2) embedded in a computer's [[motherboard]], or with a USB key.&lt;ref name=&quot;exec-overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| title = BitLocker Drive Encryption: Executive Overview
| accessdate = 2007-06-19
| date=2006-04-05
| publisher = [[Microsoft]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with other [[full disk encryption]] technologies, BitLocker is vulnerable to a [[cold boot attack]], especially where TPM is used as a [[key (cryptography)|key]] protector without a boot [[personal identification number|PIN]] being required too.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColdBoot&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/|title=Lest We Remember: Cold Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys|author=J.

Felten]]|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|date=February 21, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of other privilege-restriction techniques are also built into Vista. An example is the concept of &quot;integrity levels&quot; in user processes, whereby a process with a lower integrity level cannot interact with processes of a higher integrity level and cannot perform DLLâinjection to a processes of a higher integrity level. The security restrictions of [[Windows service]]s are more fine-grained, so that services (especially those listening on the network) have no ability to interact with parts of the operating system they do not need to. [[Obfuscation]] techniques such as [[address space layout randomization]] are used to increase the amount of effort required of [[malware]] before successful infiltration of a system. Code Integrity verifies that system binaries have not been tampered with by malicious code.

As part of the redesign of the network stack, [[Windows Firewall]] has been upgraded, with new support for filtering both incoming and outgoing traffic. Advanced packet filter rules can be created which can grant or deny communications to specific services.

The 64-bit versions of Vista &lt;!--Please do not list XP x64's features (PatchGuard, DEP) here.

=== System management ===
{{Main|Management features new to Windows Vista}}
While much of the focus of Vista's new capabilities has highlighted the new user-interface{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, security technologies, and improvements to the core operating system, Microsoft also adding new deployment and maintenance features:

* The [[Windows Imaging Format]] (WIM) provides the cornerstone of Microsoft's new deployment and packaging system. WIM files, which contain a [[Hardware Abstraction Layer|HAL]]-independent image of Windows Vista, can be maintained and patched without having to rebuild new images. Windows Images can be delivered via [[Systems Management Server]] or '''Business Desktop Deployment''' technologies. Images can be customized and configured with applications then deployed to corporate client personal computers using little to no touch by a system administrator. [[ImageX]] is the Microsoft tool used to create and customize images.
* [[Windows Deployment Services]] replaces [[Remote Installation Services]] for deploying Vista and prior versions of Windows.
* Approximately 700 new [[Group Policy]] settings have been added, covering most aspects of the new features in the operating system, as well as significantly expanding the configurability of wireless networks, removable storage devices, and user desktop experience. Vista also introduced an XML-based format (ADMX) to display registry-based policy settings, making it easier to manage networks that span geographic locations and different languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX|Services for UNIX]] has been renamed &quot;Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications,&quot; and is included with the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista. [[Network File System (protocol)|Network File System]] (NFS) client support is also included.
* [[Multilingual User Interface]]âUnlike previous versions of Windows (which required the loading of language packs to provide local-language support), Windows Vista Ultimate and Enterprise editions support the ability to dynamically change languages based on the logged-on user's preference.
* Wireless Projector support

===Developer===
Windows Vista includes a large number of new application programming interfaces. Chief among them is the inclusion of [[.NET Framework 3.0|version 3.0]] of the [[.NET Framework]], which consists of a [[class library]] and [[Common Language Runtime]] and OS/2 environment just like its NT predecessors. Version 3.0 includes four new major components:&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/technologies/ .NET Framework 3.0 Technologies], [[Microsoft]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Windows Presentation Foundation]]''' is a [[user interface]] subsystem and framework based [[vector graphics]], which makes use of [[3D computer graphics]] hardware and [[Direct3D]] technologies. It provides the foundation for building applications and blending together application UI, documents, and media content. It is the successor to [[Windows Forms]].
* '''[[Windows Communication Foundation]]''' is a service-oriented messaging subsystem which enables applications and systems to interoperate locally or remotely using [[Web service]]s.
* '''[[Windows Workflow Foundation]]''' provides task automation and integrated transactions using [[workflow]]s. It is the programming model, engine and tools for building workflow-enabled applications on Windows.
* '''[[Windows CardSpace]]''' is a component which securely stores digital identities of a person, and provides a unified interface for choosing the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging into a website.

These technologies are also available for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to facilitate their introduction to and usage by developers and end users.

There are also significant new development APIs in the core of the operating system, notably the completely re-architected audio, networking, print, and video interfaces, major changes to the security infrastructure, improvements to the deployment and installation of applications (&quot;[[ClickOnce]]&quot; and [[Windows Installer]] 4.0), new device driver development model (&quot;[[Windows Driver Foundation]]&quot;), [[Transactional NTFS#Transactional NTFS|Transactional NTFS]], mobile computing API advancements (power management, [[Tablet computer|Tablet PC]] Ink support, [[Windows SideShow|SideShow]]) and major updates to (or complete replacements of) many core subsystems such as [[Winlogon]] and [[Cryptographic Application Programming Interface|CAPI]].

There are some issues for software developers using some of the graphics APIs in Vista. Games or programs which are built solely on the Windows Vista-exclusive version of [[DirectX]], version 10, cannot work on prior versions of Windows, as [[DirectX 10]] is not available for previous Windows versions. Also, games which require the features of D3D9Ex, the updated implementation of DirectX 9 in Windows Vista are also incompatible with previous Windows versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/article.asp?CIID=24636 | title=DirectX 10: More harm than good for graphics? | first=Logan | last=Booker | publisher=Maximum Power Computing Atomic |date=2005-09-15 | accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Microsoft blog, there are three choices for [[OpenGL]] implementation on Vista. An application can use the default implementation, which translates OpenGL calls into the Direct3D API and is frozen at OpenGL version 1.4, or an application can use an Installable Client [[device driver|Driver]] (ICD), which comes in two flavors: legacy and Vista-compatible. A legacy ICD disables the [[Desktop Window Manager]], a Vista-compatible ICD takes advantage of a new API, and is fully compatible with the Desktop Window Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/kamvedbrat/archive/2006/02/22/537624.aspx | title=more comments... | first=Kam | last=VedBrat | publisher=MSDN Blogs |date=2006-02-22 | accessdate=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two primary vendors, [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] and [[NVIDIA]] provided full Vista-compatible ICDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.khronos.org/developers/library/siggraph2006/OpenGL_BOF/&lt;!-- NVIDIA_-_OpenGL_on_Vista.ppt --&gt; | title=OpenGL on Vista | first=Neil | last=Trevett | publisher = Khronos Group |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[hardware overlay]] is not supported, because it is considered as an obsolete feature in Vista. ATI and NVIDIA strongly recommend using compositing desktop/[[Framebuffer Object]]s for same functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=3760|title=OpenGL Now Natively Supported in Windows Vista|accessdate=2007-01-25|last=Nguyen|first=Tuan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removed features==
{{Main| Features removed from Windows Vista}}
Some notable Windows XP features and components have been replaced or removed in Windows Vista, including several [[Features removed from Windows Vista#Windows Shell|shell]] and [[Features removed from Windows Vista#Windows Explorer|Windows Explorer features]], [[Features removed from Windows Vista#Media features|multimedia features]], [[Features removed from Windows Vista#Networking|networking related functionality]], [[Windows Messenger]], [[NTBackup]], the network [[Messenger Service]], [[HyperACCESS|HyperTerminal]], [[MSN Explorer]], [[Active Desktop]], and the replacement of [[NetMeeting]] with [[Windows Meeting Space]]. Windows Vista also does not include the Windows XP &quot;[[Luna (theme)|Luna]]&quot; visual theme, or most of the classic color schemes which have been part of Windows since the Windows 3.x era. The &quot;Hardware profiles&quot; startup feature has also been removed, along with support for older motherboard technologies like the [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] bus, [[Advanced Power Management|APM]] and [[Game port]] support (though on the 32-bit version [[game port]] support can be enabled by applying an older driver).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are roughly divided into two target markets, consumer and business, with editions varying to cater for specific sub-markets. For consumers, there are four editions, with three available for economically more developed countries. Windows Vista Starter edition is for Netbooks and small Pc's. Windows Vista Home Basic is intended for budget users and is available only in [[emerging markets]]. Windows Vista Home Premium covers the majority of the consumer market, and contains applications for creating and using multimedia. The home editions cannot join a [[Windows Server domain]]. For businesses, there are three editions. Windows Vista Business is specifically designed for [[small and medium enterprises|small and medium-sized businesses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/business/default.mspx|title=Windows Vista Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Windows Vista Enterprise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/enterprise/default.mspx|title=Windows Vista Enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt; is only available to customers participating in Microsoft's [[Microsoft Software Assurance|Software Assurance]] program. Windows Vista Ultimate contains the complete feature-set of both the Home and Business (combination of both Home Premium and Enterprise) editions, as well as a set of [[Windows Ultimate Extras]], and is aimed at enthusiasts.

All editions except Windows Vista Starter support both [[32-bit]] ([[x86]]) and [[64-bit]] ([[x86-64|x64]]) processor architectures.

In the [[European Union]], Home Basic N and Business N versions are also available. These come without Windows Media Player, due to EU sanctions brought against Microsoft for [[European Union Microsoft antitrust case|violating anti-trust laws]]. Similar sanctions exist in [[South Korea]].

==Visual styles==

; Windows Aero:
: Vista's premier visual style, [[Windows Aero]], is built on a new desktop composition engine called [[Desktop Window Manager]]. Windows Aero introduces support for 3D graphics (Windows Flip 3D), [[Transparency (optics)|translucency]] effects (Glass), live thumbnails, window animations, and other visual effects, and is intended for mainstream and high-end video cards. To enable these features, the contents of every open window are stored in video memory to facilitate [[Page tearing|tearing]]-free movement of windows. As such, Windows Aero has significantly higher hardware requirements than its predecessors. The minimum requirement is for 128&amp;nbsp;MB of graphics memory, depending on resolution used.&lt;ref name=&quot;TechNet Vista Requirements&quot;&gt;{{cite web

; Windows Vista Basic: This style has aspects that are similar to Windows XP's &quot;[[Luna (theme)|Luna]]&quot; visual style with the addition of subtle animations such as those found on [[progress bar]]s. It does not employ the Desktop Window Manager, as such, it does not feature transparency or translucency, window animation, Windows Flip 3D or any of the functions provided by the DWM. The Basic mode does not require the new [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) for display drivers, and has similar video card requirements to Windows XP. For computers with video cards that are not powerful enough to support Windows Aero, this is the default graphics mode.  Prior to Service Pack 1, a machine that failed [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] validation would also default to this visual style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

; Windows Standard: The Windows Standard (or Windows Classic) visual style is similar to that of [[Windows 2000]] and Microsoft's [[Windows Server]] line of operating systems. It does not use the Desktop Window Manager, and does not require a WDDM driver. As with previous versions of Windows, this visual style supports color schemes, which are collections of color settings. Windows Vista includes six color schemes: four high-contrast color schemes and the default color schemes from [[Windows 95]]/[[Windows 98]] (titled &quot;Windows Classic&quot;) and [[Windows 2000]]/[[Windows Me]] (titled &quot;Windows Standard&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;thurrott-standard&quot;/&gt;

Windows Vista's Basic and Classic interfaces work with virtually any graphics hardware that supports Windows XP or 2000; accordingly, most discussion around Vista's graphics requirements centers on those for the Windows Aero interface. As of Windows Vista Beta 2, the NVIDIA [[GeForce 6]] series and later, the ATI [[Radeon 9500]] and later, Intel's [[GMA 950]] and later integrated graphics, and a handful of [[VIA chipsets]] and [[S3 Graphics]] discrete chips are supported.

==Service packs==
Microsoft occasionally releases [[service pack]]s for its Windows operating systems to fix bugs and add new features.

===Service Pack 1===
Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) was released on February 4, 2008, alongside [[Windows Server 2008]] to [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] partners, it was a five-month beta test period. The initial deployment of the service pack caused a number of machines to continually reboot, rendering the machines unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate = 2008-10-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This caused Microsoft to temporarily suspend automatic deployment of the service pack until the problem was resolved. The synchronized release date of the two operating systems reflected the merging of the workstation and server [[kernel (computer science)|kernels]] back into a single [[source code|code base]] for the first time since [[Windows 2000]]. [[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] subscribers were able to download SP1 on February 15, 2008. SP1 became available to current Windows Vista users on [[Windows Update]] and the Download Center on March 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the service pack only supported 5 languages â English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese. Support for the remaining 31 languages was released on April 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f559842a-9c9b-4579-b64a-09146a0ba746&amp;displaylang=en Download Details: Windows Vista SP1 All Language Standalone (KB936330)]. Microsoft.com (2008-04-14). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

A whitepaper published by Microsoft near the end of August 2007 outlined the scope and intent of the service pack, identifying three major areas of improvement: reliability and performance, administration experience, and support for newer hardware and standards.

One area of particular note is performance. Areas of improvement include file copy operations, hibernation, logging off on domain-joined machines, JavaScript parsing in Internet Explorer, network file share browsing,&lt;ref name=&quot;sp1whitepaper&quot; /&gt; Windows Explorer ZIP file handling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to choose individual drives to defragment is being reintroduced as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;sp1whitepaper&quot; /&gt;

Service Pack 1 introduced support for some new hardware and software standards, notably the [[exFAT]] file system,&lt;ref name=&quot;sp1whitepaper&quot; /&gt; [[802.11n]] wireless networking,&lt;ref name=&quot;SP1APIChanges&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Booting a system using [[Extensible Firmware Interface]] on [[x86-64|x64]] systems was also introduced;&lt;ref name=&quot;sp1whitepaper&quot; /&gt; this feature had originally been slated for the initial release of Vista but was delayed due to a lack of compatible hardware at the time.

Two areas have seen changes in SP1 that have come as the result of concerns from software vendors. One of these is desktop search; users will be able to change the default [[desktop search]] program to one provided by a third party instead of the Microsoft desktop search program that comes with Windows Vista, and desktop search programs will be able to seamlessly tie in their services into the operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fried&quot; /&gt; These changes come in part due to complaints from [[Google]], whose [[Google Desktop Search]] application was hindered by the presence of Vista's built-in desktop search. In June 2007, Google claimed that the changes being introduced for SP1 &quot;are a step in the right direction, but they should be improved further to give consumers greater access to alternate desktop search providers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other area of note is a set of new security [[Application programming interface|API]]s being introduced for the benefit of [[antivirus software]] that currently relies on the unsupported practice of patching the kernel (''see [[Kernel Patch Protection]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

An update to DirectX 10, named DirectX 10.1,&lt;ref name=&quot;sp1whitepaper&quot; /&gt; marked mandatory several features which were previously optional in Direct3D 10 hardware. Graphics cards will be required to support DirectX 10.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; SP1 includes a kernel (6001.18000) that matches the version shipped with Windows Server 2008.

The [[Group Policy]] Management Console (GPMC) was replaced by the Group Policy Object Editor. An updated downloadable version of the Group Policy Management Console was released soon after the service pack.

SP1 enables support for hotpatching, a reboot-reduction servicing technology designed to maximize uptime. It works by allowing Windows components to be updated (or &quot;patched&quot;) while they are still in use by a running process. Hotpatch-enabled update packages are installed via the same methods as traditional update packages, and will not trigger a system reboot.&lt;ref name=&quot;technetnotablesp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Windows Vista and [[Windows Server 2008]] share a single service pack binary, reflecting the fact that their code bases were joined with the release of Server 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nash&quot;/&gt; Service Pack 2 is not a cumulative update meaning that Service Pack 1 must be installed first.

====Platform Update====
The ''Platform Update for Windows Vista'' was released on October 27, 2009. It includes major new components that shipped with [[Windows 7]], as well as updated runtime libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971644 | title = Description of the Platform Update for Windows Server 2008 and the Platform Update for Windows Vista | work = Microsoft Support | date = 27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/directx/archive/2009/09/10/windows-7-transition-pack-for-windows-vista.aspx | title = The Platform Update for Windows Vista  | work = DirectX Developer Blog | date = 10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires Service Pack 2 of Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 and is listed on [[Windows Update]] as a ''Recommended'' download.

The Platform Update allows application developers to target both Windows Vista and Windows 7. It consists of the following components:

* ''Windows Graphics'' runtime: [[Direct2D]], [[DirectWrite]], [[Direct3D 11]], [[DirectX Graphics Infrastructure|DXGI]] 1.1, and [[Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform|WARP]];
* Updates to [[Windows Imaging Component]];
* Updates to [[Open XML Paper Specification|XPS]] Print API, XPS Document API and XPS Rasterization Service;
* ''Windows Automation API'' (updates to [[Microsoft Active Accessibility|MSAA]] and [[Microsoft UI Automation|UI Automation]]); ''(will also be available on [[Windows XP]])''
* ''Windows Portable Devices Platform''; (adds support for [[Media Transfer Protocol|MTP]] over Bluetooth and MTP Device Services)
* Windows [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]] API;
* ''Animation Manager Library''.

Some updates will also be available as separate releases for both Windows XP and Windows Vista:

* ''Windows Management Framework'':  [[Windows PowerShell]] 2.0,  ''Windows Remote Management'' 2.0,  [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service|BITS]] 4.0
* [[Remote Desktop Connection]] 7.0 (RDP7) client

Although extensive, the Platform Update does not bring Windows Vista to the level of features and performance offered by Windows 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;DXPlatformUpdate&quot; /&gt; For example, even though Direct3D 11 runtime will be able to run on D3D9-class hardware and WDDM drivers using &quot;feature levels&quot; first introduced in Direct3D 10.1, Desktop Window Manager has not been updated to use Direct3D 10.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;DXPlatformUpdate&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/directx/archive/2009/11/18/internet-explorer-announces-to-use-directwrite-direct2d.aspx | title=Internet Explorer announces to use DirectWrite &amp; Direct2D (comment from Microsoft official) | date=2009-11-25 | author=Mark Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft also has released Platform Update Supplement for Windows Vista and for Windows Server 2008 (KB2117917)&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2117917 Platform Update Supplement for Windows Vista and for Windows Server 2008]. Support.microsoft.com (2011-02-08). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; which brings many Direct2D and DirectWrite fixes from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows Vista SP2 with Platform Update installed. Another update, KB2505189&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505189 An update is available for DirectWrite and XPS issues in Windows Vista SP2 and in Windows Server 2008 SP2].

==Marketing campaign==
===The Mojave Experiment===
{{Main|The Mojave Experiment}}
In July 2008, Microsoft introduced a web-based advertising campaign called the &quot;Mojave Experiment&quot;, that depicts a group of people who are asked to evaluate the newest operating system from Microsoft, calling it Windows 'Mojave'. Participants are first asked about Vista, if they have used it, and their overall satisfaction with Vista on a scale of 1 to 10. They are then shown a demo of some of the new operating system's features, and asked their opinion and satisfaction with it on the same 1 to 10 scale. After respondents rate &quot;Mojave&quot;, they are then told that they were really shown a demo of Windows Vista. The object was to test &quot;A theory: If people could see Windows Vista firsthand, they would like it.&quot; According to Microsoft, the initial sample of respondents rated Vista an average of 4.4 out of 10, and Mojave received an average of 8.5, with no respondents rating Mojave lower than they originally rated Windows Vista before the demo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mojaveexperiment.com/ |title=The Mojave Experiment |publisher=Mojaveexperiment.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/nz/digitallife/software/mojave_experiment_windows_vista.mspx |title=The Mojave Experiment: Microsoft Windows Vista }}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;experiment&quot; has been criticized for deliberate selection of positive statements and not addressing all aspects of Vista.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/technology/04vista.html|title=Blog Posts Poke Holes in âTaste Testâ by Microsoft|accessdate=2009-04-08|author=The New York Times|date=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This figure combined with World Internet Users and Population Stats yielded a user base of roughly 330 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;internetworldusers&quot;/&gt; which exceeded Microsoft's two-year post launch expectations by 130 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowsitpro2006&quot;/&gt;  The internet user base reached before the release of its successor (Windows 7) was roughly 400 million according to the same statistical sources.

Within its first month, 20 million copies of Vista were sold, double the amount of Windows XP sales within its first month in October 2001, five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft_First_Month_Vista_Sales_Double_XP/1174940745 Microsoft: First Month Vista Sales Double XP, article by Nate Mook].

Amid the negative reviews and reception, there were also significant positive reviews of Vista, most notably among PC gamers and the advantages brought about with DirectX 10, which allows for better gaming performance and more realistic graphics, as well as support for many new capabilities brought about in new video cards and [[GPU]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/11/30/directx10_future_of_pc_gaming/1 DirectX 10: The Future of PC Gaming, Tim Smalley, November 30, 2006].

Though in mid-2008, benchmarks suggested that Vista SP1 was on par with (or better than) Windows XP in terms of game performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Around the release of Windows 7 in October 2009, a survey by [[Valve Corporation]] indicated that 40.41% of gamers were running DirectX 10 systems. The survey also indicated that DirectX 10 was supported on 83.21% of DirectX10 capable OSâs (Windows Vista, Windows 7 beta and Windows 7 represented 48.56% of the survey) and that 42.27% of these OSâs were 64-bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of Windows Vista}}
Windows Vista has received a number of negative assessments. Criticism targets include protracted development time (5â6 years), more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badvista.fsf.org/what-s-wrong-with-microsoft-windows-vista|title=What's wrong with Microsoft Windows Vista?|date=2007-03-06|accessdate=2007-03-24|last=Sullivan|first=John|publisher=Bad Vista}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the usability of the new [[User Account Control]] security technology. Moreover, some concerns have been raised about many PCs meeting &quot;Vista Premium Ready&quot; hardware requirements and Vista's pricing.

=== Hardware requirements ===
While Microsoft claimed &quot;nearly all PCs on the market today will run Windows Vista&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hwreqts2&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1843945,00.asp

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the higher requirements of some of the &quot;premium&quot; features, such as the Aero interface, have had an impact on many upgraders. According to the UK newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in May 2006, the full set of features &quot;would be available to less than 5 percent of Britainâs PC market&quot;; however, this prediction was made several months before Vista was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judge1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For example, Mike Nash (Corporate Vice President, Windows Product Management) commented &quot;I now have a $2,100 e-mail machine&quot; because his laptop's lack of an appropriate graphics chip so hobbled Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09digi.html &quot;They Criticized Vista. And They Should Know.&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Licensing ===
Criticism of upgrade [[Software licensing|licenses]] pertaining to Windows Vista Starter through Home Premium was expressed by [[Ars Technica]]'s Ken Fisher, who noted that the new requirement of having a prior operating system already installed was going to cause irritation for users who reinstall Windows on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It has been revealed that an Upgrade copy of Windows Vista can be installed clean without first installing a previous version of Windows. On the first install, Windows will refuse to activate. The user must then reinstall that same copy of Vista. Vista will then activate on the reinstall, thus allowing a user to install an Upgrade of Windows Vista without owning a previous operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with Windows XP, separate rules still apply to OEM versions of Vista installed on new PCs: Microsoft asserts that these versions are not legally transferable (although whether this conflicts with the [[right of first sale]] has yet to be decided clearly legally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost ===
Initially the cost of Windows Vista was also a source of concern and commentary. A majority of users in a poll said that the prices of various Windows Vista editions posted on the Microsoft Canada website in August 2006 make the product too expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A BBC News report on the day of Vista's release suggested that, &quot;there may be a backlash from consumers over its pricing plansâwith the cost of Vista versions in the US roughly half the price of equivalent versions in the UK.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the release of Vista in 2006 Microsoft has reduced the retail, and upgrade price point of Vista considerably. Originally Vista Ultimate was priced at $399, and Home Premium Vista at $239. These prices have since been reduced to $319 and $199 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Digital rights management ===
Windows Vista supports additional forms of [[digital rights management]] restrictions. One aspect of this is the [[Protected Video Path]], which is designed so that &quot;premium content&quot; from [[HD DVD]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]]s may mandate that the connections between PC components be encrypted. Depending on what the content demands, the devices may not pass premium content over non-encrypted outputs, or they must artificially degrade the quality of the signal on such outputs or not display it at all. Drivers for such hardware must be approved by Microsoft; a revocation mechanism is also included which allows Microsoft to disable drivers of devices in end-user PCs over the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Microsoft-ocp&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=== User Account Control===
Although user Account Control (UAC) is an important part of Vista's security infrastructure, as it blocks software from silently gaining administrator privileges without the user's knowledge, it has been widely{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} criticized for generating too many prompts. This has led many Vista UAC users to consider it annoying and tiresome, with some consequently either turning the feature off or putting it in auto-approval mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/06/dont_shut_off_v.html Don't Shut Off Vista UAC, There's A Better Way]. InformationWeek (2007-06-11). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Responding to this criticism, Microsoft altered the implementation to reduce the number of prompts with SP1.&lt;ref name=&quot;technetnotablesp1&quot;/&gt; Though the changes have resulted in some improvement, it has not alleviated the concerns completely.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Torode, [http://searchwinit.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid1_gci1308132,00.html &quot;Minasi says Vista SP1 solves problems, adds new ones.&quot;], SearchWinIT.com, April 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
