The majority of students are full-time with 54.7% male and 45.3% female.

==History==
===Founding===
The bill founding '''North Dakota Agricultural College''' ('''NDAC''') was signed on March 8, 1890, seven years after initial plans to start an agricultural college in the northern portion of the [[Dakota Territory]]. NDAC was established as a [[land grant university]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NDSU History and Traditions Council&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ndbison.com/htc/didyouknow.php |title=NDSU History and Traditions Council: Did You Know? |accessdate=2007-10-07 |format= |publisher= NDSU History and Traditions Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 1890 Horace E. Stockbridge became the first NDAC president and the Board of Trustees was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Archives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/archives/ndsuhistory/index.html |title=University Archives - NDSU History |accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher= NDSU Archives |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911213405/http://www.lib.ndsu.nodak.edu/archives/ndsuhistory/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes were initially held in six classrooms rented from Fargo College.  A provisional course was held on January 6, 1891 and the first regular class of students was admitted on September 8, 1891.  College Hall (Old Main), completed in 1892, was the first building and consisted of offices, classrooms, and a library to serve the four NDAC students.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Archives&quot;/&gt;

===20th century===
It was in 1909 that the schoolâs official colors, Yellow and Green, were ratified one year after the schoolâs alma mater [[The Yellow and The Green]] was written.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDSU History and Traditions Council&quot;/&gt;

NDAC continued to grow and became known as North Dakota State University on November 8, 1960.  The name change was to reflect the increasing field of study breadth of the institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDSU History and Traditions Council&quot;/&gt;

A {{convert|36|acre|adj=on}} area including 12 historic buildings was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as [[North Dakota State University District]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=nris&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
At the turn of the century, NDSU began a phase of growth.

NDSU surpassed 10,000 students in the fall of 2000 for the first time, and by Fall Semester of 2009, NDSU increased enrollment by another 10% to 11,189 students.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;North Dakota State University&quot; {{cite web |url= http://www.ndsu.edu/news/mediareleases/enrollmentrecord/ |title=Fall Enrollment Report 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-26 |format= |publisher= North Dakota State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;North Dakota State Board of Higher Education&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ndus.edu/Upload/allfile.asp?id=245&amp;tbl=MultiUse |title=Fall Enrollment Report 2006 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |format= |publisher= North Dakota State Board of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research, athletic programs, and campus facilities benefited from increases in student enrollment.  Between 2000 and 2007, NDSU added a number of undergraduate programs and 31 graduate programs.  Research expenditures doubled to reach over $100 million to make the university the largest research institution in the State of North Dakota.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Several buildings have been built or expanded and remodeled over the past seven years, including the Wallman Wellness Center, Memorial Union, and the College of Business.

In 2004, all athletic programs moved to Division I.&lt;ref name=&quot;NDSU: State of the University Address - 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/ndsu/administration/president/chapman/address/2007_address.shtml |title=NDSU: State of the University Address - 2007|accessdate=2007-10-07 |publisher= NDSU}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
[[Image:NDSU Gates.jpgâ|thumb|250px|Gates to North Dakota State University]]
North Dakota State University is primarily located in [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. NDSU consists of several campuses including: the main campus, NDSU Downtown, and several agricultural experiment station campuses.

===Main campus===
The main campus sits on 258 acres (1.04&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of land and consists of over 100 major buildings.  The appearance of the main campus are maintained by the Universityâs extensive agricultural programs.  The main campus is located by 19th Avenue to the North, University Drive to the East, and 12th Avenue to the South.

Located in the historic Minard â South Engineering quad is the Babbling Brook. The Babbling Brook is a large water feature that offers students a serene location to relax and unwind. Enhancing the area are several waterfalls, various fish and flowers, an amphitheater, and &quot;buffalo-rubbed&quot; rocks. This area also offers a space for the holding of classes outdoors as well as performances.
Over the years NDSUâs main campus was aesthetically enhanced with many monuments including: the Bjornson Memorial Obelisk, Theatre Passion: Mask Sculpture, We Will Never Forget Memorial, and Noble's Golden Marguerite, among many others.

====Southern area====
The Southeastern area of campus consists of many of NDSUâs historic buildings including: the Old Main, Minard Hall, Ceres Hall, Putnam Hall, South Engineering, and Morrill Hall, and the Southwestern area consists of agricultural research centers, the USDA, State Seed, and many research plots.

====Central area====
The central area consists of the Engineering Complex, Shepperd Arena, and many academic buildings, and the Industrial Agricultural Communications Center (IACC) which is a technology powerhouse for the entire state. The IACC contains several hundred computers and computer servers for many of the Universities in the [[North Dakota University System]]; and many other technologies and communication devices.
[[Image:NDSU Old Main.jpgâ|left|thumb|250px|Old Main at North Dakota State University]]
The NDSU Memorial Union is also situated within the central campus serves the sole purpose of serving student social needs.  The NDSU Memorial Union recently completed a multi-million dollar addition and renovation, which including the addition of over {{convert|68000|sqft|m2}} used for dining facilities, student offices, lounges, meeting and a new ballroom.
