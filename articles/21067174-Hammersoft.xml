Coastal Carolina's baseball program has been the university's most consistent program in terms of success. Head Coach Gary Gilmore has led the Chanticleers to eight NCAA Regional appearances and two Super Regional appearances since being hired in 1996. The program has received #1 regional seeds on four occasions (2005, 2007, 2008, 2010) and won 50+ games in 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010. In addition, the Chanticleers have hosted NCAA Regionals in 2007, 2008, and 2010 and a Super Regional in 2010. In 2010 Coastal went 29-0 in Big South play winning both the regular season Big South Championship and the Big South Tournament Championship plus the Regional, but lost in the Super Regionals 2-0 to the University of [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team|South Carolina]] who went on to win the College World Series National Championship.
