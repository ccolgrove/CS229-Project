'''Pritam Chakraborty''' ([[Bengali Language|Bengali]]: à¦ªà§à¦°à¦¿à¦¤à¦® à¦à¦à§à¦°à¦¬à¦°à§à¦¤à§), better known as '''Pritam'''  is a music director and composer from [[Kolkata]] who currently works in [[Bollywood]], [[Mumbai]].

== Early life ==
Pritam was born on 14 June 1971 in [[Kolkata]] into a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family to Prabodh Chakraborty, who runs a music school for children. He gained his early training in music from his father and learned to play the guitar in school. After completing his schooling at [[St. James' School (India)|St. James' School]] and college education at [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], he went to a music school. At Presidency he was the Social Services Secretary of the Students Union run by the Independents' Consolidation (IC). Pritam joined a [[Bangla]] band, [[Chandrabindoo (band)|Chandrabindoo]]. Before that he formed another band with his Presidency batchmates, called &quot;Jotugriher Pakhi&quot;. They even have a cassette released to their credit at that time. In January 1993, Pritam joined the [[Film and Television Institute]] in [[Pune]] to undertake a course in [[sound recording]] and [[sound engineering]]. During this time, he was offered a chance to compose background music for a film {{Which?|date=August 2010}} by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] filmmaker [[Istvan Gaal]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He learned music theory, harmony and composition from ethnomusicologist and [[khyal]] singer Warren Senders, as well as briefly encountering principles of [[African Music]] from Senders and musicologist Kedar Avati.

== Career ==

Having completed his education, Pritam moved to [[Mumbai]] to pursue a career in Bollywood. During his stay in Mumbai, he began composing ad jingles and became friendly with a number of other young men struggling to make it big like [[Shantanu Moitra]], [[Rajkumar Hirani]], [[Sanjay Gadhvi]] and [[Jeet Ganguly]], who played the guitar with [[Anup Jalota]].

Pritam got his first break when [[Sanjay Gadhvi]] was signed on to direct ''Tere Liye'' and he, in turn, signed on his friends Jeet and Pritam as music composers. Though the music was well received, the film sank at the box office. However, in 2002 [[Yashraj Films]] signed [[Sanjay Gadhvi]] up to direct ''[[Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai]]'' for which the Pritam-Jeet duo once again composed the music. All the songs from that movie were chartbusters and the duo had hit the big time. His music comprises various kinds including Indian classical music and western influences.
Pritam was then actively involved in mentoring and judging new talent on [[Zee TV]]'s singing competition show ''[[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge 2009]]''.

== Solo career ==

After the separation with Jeet, Pritam's career as a solo musician stalled as he signed a series of flops like ''[[Fun2shh... Dudes in the 10th Century]]''. The film sank at the box office and Pritamâs music too. However, in 2004, Pritam composed the music for Sanjay Gadhvi's second film, ''[[Dhoom]]'', which was a runaway success. The film did well and the music topped the charts.

Pritam followed up the success of ''[[Dhoom]]'' with a string of successful numbers after a year for ''[[Chocolate: Deep Dark Secrets|Chocolate]]'', ''[[Garam Masala (film)|Garam Masala]]'' and ''[[Gangster (film)|Gangster]]''. Also he composed the music for ''[[Dhoom 2]]'', the sequel to ''[[Dhoom]]'' and ''[[Life In A... Metro]]''. He composed the music for ''[[Singh Is Kinng]]'' and ''[[Kismat Konnection]]'' and formed a band named Metro.

His most top rated musics are from the movies  [[Dhoom]], [[Dhoom 2]], [[Life In A... Metro]], [[Gangster (film)|Gangster]], [[Bhool Bhulaiyaa]], [[Awarapan]], [[Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal]], [[Jab We Met]], [[Race (2008 film)|Race]], [[Woh Lamhe]], [[Jannat (film)|Jannat]], [[Singh Is Kinng]], [[Billu]], [[Love Aaj Kal]], [[Golmaal Returns]], [[Tum Mile]], [[Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani]], [[De Dana Dan]], [[Badmaash Company]], [[Raajneeti]], [[Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai]], [[Crook (film)|Crook]], [[Action Replayy]], [[Golmaal 3]], [[Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji]], [[Dum Maaro Dum (film)|Dum Maaro Dum]], [[Ready (2011 film)|Ready]], [[Kucch Luv Jaisaa]], [[Mausam (2011 film)|Mausam]], [[Desi Boyz]], [[Players (film)|Players]] and more.
