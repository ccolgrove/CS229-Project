==Plot==
The story begins with the assassination of Egyptian Princess [[Mayte Garcia|Mayte]]'s father by seven unknown assailants. Mayte believes that the assassins were after the sacred &quot;3 Chains of Gold&quot;. She sets out to meet with Prince, as she believes he is the only one that can protect the chains from the seven assassins. What follows is a romance between Prince and Mayte, and Prince organizing the assassination of the assailants (accompanied by the song &quot;[[7 (song)|7]]&quot;).

==Epilogue==
At the end of the film, prior to the credits, is an explanation of the name change, attributing it to Prince's desire to be &quot;reborn&quot; and start a perfect life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Upon the seventh day of the sixth month&lt;br /&gt;
Nineteen hundred and ninety-three&lt;br /&gt;
Marking the beginning and ending of cycles of creation&lt;br /&gt;
Prince, reaching the balance of thirty-five years,&lt;br /&gt;
Put into practice the precepts of perfection:&lt;br /&gt;
Voicing bliss through the freedom of being one's self&lt;br /&gt;
Incarnating the New Power Generation into&lt;br /&gt;
The close of the six periods of involution giving&lt;br /&gt;
Birth upon himself to regenerate his name as &lt;br /&gt;
For in the dawn, all will require no speakable name&lt;br /&gt;
To differentiate the ineffible one that shall remain.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Film and album==
The film was accompanied by the ''[[Love Symbol]]'' album, however not all of the album's songs make an appearance in the film, and some of the songs are edited versions. The film's title song is only an instrumental at the end. However, some of the dialogue from the album does appear in the film (a phone call from a reporter, played by Kirstie Alley, to Prince). The final speech of the film (made by Mayte) does not appear on the album, instead another phone call is in its place. The actual songs that appear in the film are:
* &quot;[[My Name Is Prince]]&quot;
* &quot;[[Sexy MF]]&quot;
* &quot;Love 2 the 9s&quot;
* &quot;[[The Morning Papers]]&quot;
* &quot;The Max&quot;
* &quot;Blue Light&quot;
* &quot;I Wanna Melt with U&quot;
* &quot;Sweet Baby&quot;
* &quot;The Continental&quot;
* &quot;[[Damn U]]&quot;
* &quot;[[7 (song)|7]]&quot;
* &quot;The Call&quot;
