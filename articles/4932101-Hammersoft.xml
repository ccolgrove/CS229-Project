The '''Arizona Department of Transportation''' ('''ADOT''', pronounced &quot;A-Dot&quot;) is an [[Arizona]] state [[government agency]] charged with facilitating mobility within the state. In addition to managing the state's [[state highways|highway system]], the agency is also involved with [[public transportation]] and [[airport|municipal airports]]. The department was created in [[1974]] when the state merged the Arizona Highway Department with the Arizona Department of Aeronautics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.dot.state.az.us/Highways/AboutITD.asp  About ITD accessed 3 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

ADOT was a pioneer in the use of [[rubberized asphalt]] as a method to increase durability and reduce road noise on state highways while providing an opportunity to recycle scrap tires. Its &quot;Quiet Pavement&quot; project started in 2003 surfaced about {{convert|115|mi|km}} of Phoenix-area freeways with rubberized asphalt. 

Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]] had previously been a Director of ADOT.

ADOT's publications division publishes ''[[Arizona Highways (magazine)|Arizona Highways]]'' magazine.
