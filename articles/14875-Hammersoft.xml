Iowa State is a leader in [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[cooperative extension|extension]], and [[home economics]], and created the nation's first state [[veterinary medicine]] school in 1879.  In 1933, Iowa State established the Statistical Laboratory.  It was and is the first research and consulting institute of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/history.html History of Iowa State]. Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1856, the [[Iowa General Assembly]] enacted legislation to establish the State Agricultural College and Model Farm.  Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm (now Iowa State University) was officially established on March 22, 1858, by the legislature of the State of Iowa. [[Story County, Iowa|Story County]] was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, from proposals by [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Kossuth County, Iowa|Kossuth]], [[Marshall County, Iowa|Marshall]], [[Polk County, Iowa|Polk]], and [[Story County, Iowa|Story]] counties.   The original farm of {{convert|648|acre|km2}} was purchased for a cost of $5,379.&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1858â1874&quot;&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1858.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1858-1874.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iowa]] was the first state in the nation to accept the provisions of the [[Morrill Act of 1862]].&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1858â1874&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pres&gt;{{cite web |title= Sesquicentennial Message from President |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~isu150/president.shtml |publisher=Iowa State University |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iowa subsequently designated Iowa State as the [[land-grant college]] on March 29, 1864.&lt;ref name=Pres/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Iowa State: 150 Points of Pride |url=http://www.ag.iastate.edu/coa150/pop8_20.php |publisher=Iowa State University | accessdate= 8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iowa Agricultural College (Iowa State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts as of 1898), as a land grant institution, focused on the ideals that higher education should be accessible to all and that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects. These ideals are integral to the land-grant university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/time.html History of Iowa State.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1858â1874&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Fountain of Four Seasons.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Buildings of Iowa State University#Fountain of Four Seasons|Fountain of Four Seasons]] by Christian Petersen with the [[Campanile (Iowa State University)|Campanile]] in the background]]
The institution was coeducational from the first preparatory class admitted in 1868. The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and two women.&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1858â1874&quot;/&gt;

The Farm House, the first building on the Iowa State campus, was completed in 1861 before the campus was occupied by students or even classrooms.  It became the home of the superintendent of the Model Farm and in later years, the deans of Agriculture, including Seaman Knapp and &quot;Tama Jim&quot; Wilson. Iowa State's first president, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and penned his inaugural speech in a second floor bedroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1858â1874&quot;/&gt;

The college's first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. The Iowa Experiment Station was one of the university's prominent features.  Practical courses of instruction were taught, including one designed to give a general training for the career of a farmer.  Courses in [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], and [[mining engineering]] were also part of the curriculum.

In 1870, President Welch and I. P. Robert, professor of agriculture, held three-day farmers' institutes at [[Cedar Falls, Iowa|Cedar Falls]], [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]], [[Washington, Iowa|Washington]], and [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]].  These became the earliest institutes held off-campus by a land grant institution and were the forerunners of 20th century extension.

In 1872, the first courses were given in domestic economy (home economics, family and consumer sciences) and were taught by Mrs. Mary B. Welch, the president's wife.  Iowa State became the first land grant university in the nation to offer training in domestic economy for college credit.&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1858â1874&quot;/&gt;

In 1879, the &quot;School&quot; of Veterinary Science was organized, the first state veterinary college in the United States (although veterinary courses has been taught since the beginning of the College).  This was originally a two-year course leading to a diploma.  The veterinary course of study contained classes in zoology, botany, anatomy of domestic animals, veterinary obstetrics, and sanitary science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1875-1899.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:isubeardshear2008.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Beardshear Hall]]
William M. Beardshear was appointed President of Iowa State in 1891, and during his tenure, Iowa Agricultural College truly came of age.  Beardshear developed new agricultural programs and was instrumental in hiring premier faculty members such Anson Marston, Louis B. Spinney, J.B. Weems, Perry G. Holden, and Maria Roberts.  He also expanded the university administration, and the following buildings were added to the campus:  Morrill Hall (1891); the Campanile (1899); Old Botany (now Carrie Chapman Catt Hall) (1892); and Margaret Hall (1895) which continue to stand today.  In his honor, Iowa State named its central administrative building (Central Building) after Beardshear in 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1900â1924&quot;&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1900.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1900-1924.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Beardshear Hall holds the following offices:  President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, Registrar, Provost, and student financial aid.  Catt Hall is named after famed alumna [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] and is the home of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Iowa State celebrated its first [[VEISHEA]] on May 11â13, 1922. Wallace McKee (class of 1922) served as the first chairman of the Central Committee and Frank D. Paine (professor of electrical engineering) chose the name, based on the first letters of Iowa State's colleges: Veterinary Medicine, Engineering, Industrial Science, Home Economics, and Agriculture.  VEISHEA has grown to become the largest student-run festival in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;of Iowa State Time Line, 1900â1924&quot;/&gt;

The Statistical Laboratory was established in 1933, with George W. Snedecor, professor of mathematics, as the first director.  It was and is the first research and consulting institute of its kind in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1925.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1925-1949.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

While attempting to develop a faster method of computation, mathematics and physics professor [[John Vincent Atanasoff]] conceptualized the basic tenets of what would become the worldâs first electronic digital computer, the [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer]] (ABC), during a drive to [[Illinois]] in 1937. These included the use of a binary system of arithmetic, the separation of computer and memory functions, and regenerative drum memory, among others. The 1939 prototype was constructed with graduate student [[Clifford Berry]] in the basement of the Physics Building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.iastate.edu/jva/jva-archive.shtml|Iowa State University Department of Computer Science Website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Iowa State was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;iowastate-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.iastate.edu/command/history.html |title=ISU Naval ROTC - Unit History |publisher=[[Ames, Iowa]]: Iowa State University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maturity as a university===
[[Image:ISU Alumni Hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&lt;center&gt; Enrollment Services Building (Old Alumni Hall)]]
On July 4, 1959, the college was officially renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology.  Official names given the universityâs divisions were the College of Agriculture, College of Engineering, College of Home Economics, College of Sciences and Humanities, and College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1950.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1950-1974.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iowa State's eight colleges today offer more than 100 undergraduate majors and 200 fields of study leading to graduate and professional degrees.  The academic program at ISU includes a vigorous liberal arts education and some of the world's leading research in the biological and physical sciences. 

Breakthroughs at Iowa State changing the world are in the areas of human, social, economic, and environmental sustainability; new materials and processes for biomedical as well as industrial applications; nutrition, health, and wellness for humans and animals; transportation and infrastructure; food safety and security; plant and animal sciences; information and decision sciences; and renewable energies. The focus on technology has led directly to many research patents and inventions including the [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer|first binary computer]] (the ABC), [[Maytag blue cheese]], the round hay baler, and many more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/history.html Iowa State University History website]. Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Located on a lush, {{convert|2,000|acre|km2}} campus, the university has grown considerably from its roots as an agricultural college and model farm to being recognized internationally today for its comprehensive research programs that are especially interdisciplinary.   It continues to grow and set a new record for enrollment in the fall of 2010 with 28,685 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2010/sep/2010enrollment Fall 2010 enrollment numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks Library===
[[Image:Parks Library.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;W. Robert and Ellen Sorge Parks Library]]
The W. Robert and Ellen Sorge Parks Library contains over 2.6 million books and subscribes to more than 98,600 journal titles, making ISU's library one of the 100 largest university libraries in the country.  Named for W. Robert Parks (1915â2003), the 11th president of Iowa State University, and his wife, Ellen Sorge Parks, the original library was built in 1925 with three subsequent additions made in 1961, 1969, and 1983. The library was dedicated and named after W. Robert and Ellen Sorge Parks in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir.iastate.edu/FB11/PDF/FB11-020.pdf]  ISU Fact Book 2010-2011.  Iowa State University website. Retrieved 2011-3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parks Library provides extensive research collections, services and information literacy instruction/information for all students. Facilities consist of the main Parks Library, the e-Library, the Veterinary Medical Library, two subject-oriented reading rooms (design and mathematics), and a remote library storage building.

The Libraryâs extensive collections include electronic and print resources that support research and study for all undergraduate and graduate programs.  Nationally recognized collections support the basic and applied fields of biological and physical sciences. The Parks Library includes four public service desks: the Learning Connections Center, the Circulation Desk, the Media Center (including Maps, Media,
Microforms, and Course Reserve collections), and Special Collections. The Libraryâs instruction program includes a required undergraduate information literacy course as well as a wide variety of subject-based seminars on effective use of Library resources for undergraduate and graduate students.

The e-Library, accessed through the Internet, provides access to local and Web-based resources including electronic journals and books, local collections, online indexes, electronic course reserves and guides, and a broad range of subject research guides. 

Surrounding the first floor lobby staircase in Parks Library are eight mural panels
designed by Iowa artist [[Grant Wood]]. As with ''Breaking the Prairie Sod'', Wood's other
Iowa State University mural painted two years later, Wood borrowed his theme for ''When Tillage Begins Other Arts Follow'' from a speech on [[agriculture]] delivered by Daniel
Webster in 1840 at the State House in [[Boston]]. Webster said, âWhen tillage begins, other
arts follow. The farmers therefore are the founders of human civilization.â Wood had
planned to create seventeen mural panels for the library, but only the eleven devoted to
agriculture and the practical arts were completed. The final six, which would have hung
in the main reading room (now the Periodical Room) and were to have depicted the fine
arts, were never begun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/libinfo/factsfigs.html] Itâs a Fact: Iowa State University.  Iowa State University website. Retrieved 2011-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birthplace of first electronic digital computer===
[[Image:Atanasoff-Berry Computer at Durhum Center.jpg|thumb|250px|right|AtanasoffâBerry Computer replica on 1st floor of Durham Center, Iowa State University.]]
Iowa State is the birthplace of the first electronic digital computer, starting the worldâs computer technology revolution.  Invented by mathematics and physics professor [[John Atanasoff]] and engineering graduate student [[Clifford Berry]] during 1937-42, the [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer]], or [[Atanasoff-Berry Computer|ABC]], pioneered important elements of modern computing, including binary arithmetic, regenerative memory, parallel processing, electronic switching elements, and separation of memory and computer functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.iastate.edu/jva/jva-archive.shtml] About Iowa State University online&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 1973, [[U.S.]] [[Federal Judge]] [[Earl R. Larson]] signed his decision following a lengthy court trial which declared the [[ENIAC]] patent of Mauchly and Eckert invalid and named Atanasoff the [[inventor]] of the electronic digital computerâthe Atanasoff-Berry Computer or the ABC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.iastate.edu/jva/jva-archive.shtml|âJohn Vincent Atanasoff &amp; the Birth of the Digital Computerâ] Iowa State University Department of Computer Science Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ABC Team consisting of Ames Laboratory and Iowa State engineers, technicians, researchers and students unveiled a working replica of the Atanasoff-Berry Computer in 1997 which can be seen on display on campus in the Durham Computation Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1975.html History of Iowa State Time Line, 1975-2008.] Iowa State University Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of cooperative extension===
The [[Cooperative extension service|Extension Service]] traces its roots to farmersâ institutes developed at Iowa State in the late 19th century.  Committed to community, Iowa State pioneered the outreach mission of being a land-grant college through creation of the first Extension Service in 1902.  In 1906, the [[Iowa Legislature]] enacted the Agricultural Extension Act making funds available for demonstration projects.  It is believed this was the first specific legislation establishing state extension work, for which Iowa State assumed responsibility.  The national extension program was created in 1914 based heavily on the Iowa State model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.iastate.edu/dubuque/info/history.htm] Dubuque County Extension History online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iastate.edu/about/highlights/] About Iowa State University online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iastate.edu/IaStater/1997/feb/landgrant.html] The Iowa Stater, February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manhattan Project===
ISU is the only university nationwide that has a [[U.S. Department of Energy]] research laboratory physically located on its campus.  Iowa State played a critical role in the development of the [[atomic bomb]] during [[World War II]].  As part of the [[Manhattan Project]], the process to produce large quantities of high-purity uranium metal was developed at Iowa State.  Iowa State provided one-third of the uranium metal used in the worldâs first controlled nuclear chain reaction, or atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameslab.gov/overview/history.html] The Ames Laboratory website&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ames Laboratory]] now focuses on more peaceful applications of materials research, usually related to increasing energy efficiency.

==Colleges==
ISU is organized into eight colleges that offer 96 Bachelors degree programs, 115 Masters programs, 83 Ph.D programs, and one professional degree program in [[Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine|Veterinary Medicine]].

Iowa State's campus contains over 160 buildings. Several buildings, as well as the Marston Water Tower, are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;&gt;[http://www.iastate.edu/about/fact04/ It's a Fact: Iowa State University]. Iowa State University website.&lt;/ref&gt; The central campus includes {{convert|490|acre|km2}} of trees, plants, and classically designed buildings.  The landscape's most dominant feature is the {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} central lawn, which was listed as a &quot;medallion site&quot; by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 1999, one of only three central campuses designated as such. The other two were [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Virginia]]. 

Thomas Gaines, in ''The Campus As a Work of Art'', proclaimed the Iowa State campus to be one of the twenty-five most beautiful campuses in the country.  Gaines noted Iowa State's park-like expanse of central campus, and the use of trees and shrubbery to draw together ISU's varied building architecture.  Over decades, campus buildings, including the Campanile, Beardshear Hall, and Curtiss Hall, circled and preserved the central lawn, creating a space where students study, relax, and socialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Campus as a Work of Art |last=Gaines |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas A.

===Campanile===
{{main|Campanile (Iowa State University)}}
[[Image:ISU campanile.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;The campanile as seen from the north/northwest]]
The campanile was constructed during 1897-1898 as a [[memorial]] to Margaret MacDonald Stanton, Iowa State's first dean of women, who died on July 25, 1895. The tower is located on ISU's central campus, just north of the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]]. The site was selected by Margaret's husband, Edgar W. Stanton, with the help of then-university president William M. Beardshear. The campanile stands {{convert|110|ft|m}} tall on a 16 by 16 foot (5 by 5 m) base, and cost $6,510.20 to construct.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib.iastate.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/campanile/camphist.html] Iowa State University Library. &quot;History of the Campanile&quot;. Retrieved 2011-3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campanile is widely seen as one of the major symbols of Iowa State University. It is featured prominently on the university's official ring&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isualum.org/en/traditions/official_isu_ring/ring_symbolism.cfm] Iowa State University Alumni Association. &quot;Ring Symbolism&quot;. Retrieved 2011-3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and the university's mace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isualum.org/en/traditions/traditions_of_iowa_state/traditions_and_history/official_university_mace.cfm] Iowa State University Alumni Association. &quot;Official University Mace&quot;. Retrieved 2011-3-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the subject of the university's alma mater, ''The Bells of Iowa State''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib.iastate.edu&quot;/&gt;

===Lake LaVerne===
Named for Dr. LaVerne W. Noyes, who also donated the funds to see that [[#Alumni Hall|Alumni Hall]] could be completed after sitting unfinished and unused from 1905 to 1907.  Dr. Noyes is an 1872 alumnus. Lake LaVerne is located west of the [[#Memorial Union|Memorial Union]] and south of Alumni Hall, [[#Carver Hall|Carver Hall]], and [[#Music Hall|Music Hall]].  The lake was a gift from Dr. Noyes in 1916.

Lake LaVerne is the home of two [[mute swan]]s named Sir Lancelot and Elaine, donated to Iowa State by [[VEISHEA]] 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/VEISHEA/swans.htm Swans] from the Iowa State Libraryâs special exhibits section&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1944, 1970, and 1971 [[Cygnet (bird)|cygnets]]  (baby swans) made their home on Lake LaVerne.  Previously Sir Lancelot and Elaine were [[trumpeter swan]]s but were too aggressive and in 1999 were replaced with two mute swans.

In early spring 2003, Lake LaVerne welcomed its newest and most current mute swan duo.   In support of Iowa Department of Natural Resources efforts to re-establish the trumpeter swans in Iowa, university officials avoided bringing breeding pairs of male and female mute swans to Iowa State which means the current Sir Lancelot and Elaine are both female.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.iastate.edu/oldreleases/2003/mar/swans.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reiman Gardens===
[[Image:RG Lake Helen.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&lt;center&gt;Lake Helen at [[Reiman Gardens]]]]
Iowa State has maintained a [[horticulture]] [[garden]] since 1914. [[Reiman Gardens]] is the third location for these gardens. Today's gardens began in 1993 with a gift from [[Roy Reiman|Bobbi and Roy Reiman]]. Construction began in 1994 and the Gardens' initial 5 acres (20,000 m2) were officially dedicated on September 16, 1995.

Reiman Gardens has since grown to become a {{convert|14|acre|m2}} site consisting of a dozen distinct garden areas, an indoor conservatory and an indoor butterfly &quot;wing&quot;, butterfly emergence cases, a gift shop, and several supporting greenhouses. Located immediately south of [[Jack Trice Stadium]] on the ISU campus, Reiman Gardens is a year-round facility that has become one of the most visited attractions in central Iowa. 

The Gardens has received a number of national, state, and local awards since its opening, and its [[rose garden]]s are particularly noteworthy.  It was honored with the President's Award in 2000 by All American Rose Selections, Inc., which is presented to one public garden in the [[United States]] each year for superior rose maintenance and display: âFor contributing to the public interest in rose growing through its efforts in maintaining an outstanding public rose garden.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reimangardens.com/en/awards_and_publications/] About Iowa State University online&lt;/ref&gt;

===University Museums===
The University Museums consist of the Brunnier Art Museum, Farm House Museum, the Art on Campus Program, the Christian Petersen Art Museum, and the Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden. The Museums include a multitude of unique exhibits, each promoting the understanding and delight of the visual arts as well as attempt to incorporate a vast interaction between the arts, sciences, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.iastate.edu] Iowa State University Museums online. Retrieved 2011-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brunnier Art Museum====
The Brunnier Art Museum, Iowaâs only [[accredited]] [[museum]] emphasizing a [[decorative arts]] collection, is one of the nation's few museums located within a performing arts and conference complex, the [[Iowa State Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/Brunnier.htm] Iowa State University Museums Brunnier Art Museum online. Retrieved 2011-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1975, the museum is named after its benefactors, Iowa State alumnus Henry J. Brunnier and his wife Ann. The decorative arts collection they donated, called the Brunnier Collection, is extensive, consisting of ceramics, glass, dolls, ivory, jade, and enameled metals.
 
Other fine and decorative art objects from the University Art Collection include prints, paintings, sculptures, textiles, carpets, wood objects, lacquered pieces, silver, and furniture. About eight to 12 annual changing exhibitions and permanent collection exhibitions provide educational opportunities for all ages, from learning the history of a quilt hand-stitched over 100 years ago to discovering how scientists analyze the physical properties of artists' materials, such as glass or stone.  Lectures, receptions, conferences, university classes, panel discussions, gallery walks, and gallery talks are presented to assist with further interpretation of objects.

====Farm House Museum====
[[Image:Farm House Museum south sign.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;The Farm House Museum]]
Located near the center of the Iowa State campus, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture as well as a [[National Historic Landmark]].  As the first building on campus, the Farm House was built in 1860 before campus was occupied by students or even classrooms. The collegeâs first farm tenants primed the land for agricultural experimentation. This early practice lead to Iowa State Agricultural College and Model Farm opening its doors to Iowa students for free in 1869 under the [[Morrill Act of 1862|Morrill Act]] (or Land-grant Act) of 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/FarmHouse.htm] Iowa State University Museums Farm House Museum online. Retrieved 2011-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent figures have made the Farm House their home throughout its 150 years of use. The first president of the College, [[Adonijah Welch]], briefly stayed at the Farm House and even wrote his inaugural speech in a bedroom on the second floor.  James âTama Jimâ Wilson resided for much of the 1890s with his family at the Farm House until he joined [[President William McKinley]]âs cabinet as [[U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]]. Agriculture Dean [[Charles Curtiss]] and his young family replaced Wilson and became the longest resident of Farm House.  

In 1976, over 110 years after the initial construction, the Farm House became a museum after much time and effort was put into restoring the early beauty of the modest farm home.  Today, faculty, students, and community members can enjoy the museum while honoring its significance in shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university.   Its collection boasts a large collection of 19th and early 20th century decorative arts, furnishings and material culture reflecting Iowa State and Iowa heritage.  Objects include furnishings from [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] and Charles Curtiss, a wide variety of quilts, a modest collection of textiles and apparel, and various china and glassware items. 

As with many sites on the Iowa State University Campus, The Farm House Museum has a few old [[Iowa State Myths and Legends|myths and legends]] associated with it. There are rumors of a ghost changing silverware and dinnerware, unexplained rattling furniture, and curtains that have opened seemingly by themselves.

The Farm House Museum is a unique on-campus educational resource providing a changing environment of exhibitions among the historical permanent collection objects that are on display. A walk through the Farm House Museum immerses visitors in the [[Victorian era]] (1860-1910) as well as exhibits colorful Iowa and local Ames history.

====Art on Campus Collection====
Iowa State is home to one of the largest campus public art programs in the United States.  Over 2,000 works of public art, including 600 by significant national and international artists, are located across campus in buildings, courtyards, open spaces and offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/AOC.htm] Iowa State University Museums Art on Campus online. Retrieved 2011-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional public art program began during the Depression in the 1930s when Iowa State Collegeâs President Raymond Hughes envisioned that &quot;the arts would enrich and provide substantial intellectual exploration into our college curricula.&quot; Hughes invited [[Grant Wood]] to create the Libraryâs agricultural murals that speak to the founding of Iowa and Iowa State College and Model Farm. He also offered [[Christian Petersen]] a one-semester sculptor residency to design and build the fountain and bas relief at the Dairy Industry Building. In 1955, 21 years later, Petersen retired having created 12 major sculptures for the campus and hundreds of small studio sculptures.

The Art on Campus Collection is a campus-wide resource of over 2000 public works of art. Programs, receptions, dedications, university classes, Wednesday Walks, and educational tours are presented on a regular basis to enhance visual literacy and aesthetic appreciation of this diverse collection.

====Christian Petersen Art Museum====
[[Image:Morrillhall.jpg|thumb|200px|right|&lt;center&gt;Morrill Hall, home to Christian Petersen Art Museum]]
The Christian Petersen Art Museum in Morrill Hall is named for the nationâs first permanent campus artist-in-residence, [[Christian Petersen]], who sculpted and taught at Iowa State from 1934 through 1955, and is considered the founding artist of the Art on Campus Collection.  

Named for [[Justin Smith Morrill]] who created the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], Morrill Hall was completed in 1891.  Originally constructed to fill the capacity of a [[library]], [[museum]], and [[chapel]], its original uses are engraved in the exterior stonework on the east side.  The building was vacated in 1996 when it was determined unsafe and was also listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] the same year.  In 2005, $9 million was raised to renovate the building and convert it into a museum.  Completed and reopened in March 2007, Morrill Hall is home to the Christian Petersen Art Museum.

As part of University Museums, the Christian Petersen Art Museum at Morrill Hall is the home of the Christian Petersen Art Collection, the Art on Campus Program, the University Museumsâ Visual Literacy and Learning Program, and Contemporary Changing Art Exhibitions Program.  
Located within the Christian Petersen Art Museum are the Lyle and Nancy Campbell Art Gallery, the Roy and Bobbi Reiman Public Art Studio Gallery, the Margaret Davidson Center for the Study of the Art on Campus Collection, the Edith D. and Torsten E. Lagerstrom Loaned Collections Center, and the Neva M. Petersen Visual Learning Gallery. University Museums shares the James R. and Barbara R. Palmer Small Objects Classroom in Morrill Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/CPAM.htm] Iowa State University Museums Christian Petersen Art Museum online. Retrieved 2011-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anderson Sculpture Garden====
The Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located by the Christian Petersen Art Museum at historic Morrill Hall. The [[sculpture garden]] design incorporates sculptures, a gathering arena, and sidewalks and pathways. Planted with perennials, ground cover, shrubs, and flowering trees, the landscape design provides a distinctive setting for important works of 20th and 21st century sculpture, primarily American.  Ranging from forty-four inches to nearly nine feet high and from bronze to other metals, these works of art represent the richly diverse character of modern and contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.iastate.edu/ASGMain.htm] Iowa State University Museums Anderson Sculpture Garden online. Retrieved 2011-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture garden is adjacent to Iowa Stateâs {{convert|22|acre|m2}} central campus. [[Adonijah Welch]], ISUâs first president, envisioned a picturesque campus with a winding road encircling the collegeâs majestic buildings, vast lawns of green grass, many varieties of trees sprinkled throughout to provide shade, and shrubbery and flowers for fragrance. Today, the central lawn continues to be an iconic place for all Iowa Staters, and enjoys national acclaim as one of the most beautiful campuses in the country.  The new Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden further enhances the beauty of Iowa State.

===Residence halls===
[[File:Roberts Residence Hall Iowa State University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View looking east towards Roberts Hall.]]

Iowa State operates 19 on-campus [[dormitory|residence halls]]. The residence halls are divided into geographical areas. 

The [[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Union_Drive|Union Drive Association]] 
(UDA) consists of four residence halls located on the west side of campus, including [[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Friley_Hall|Friley Hall]], which has been declared one of the largest residence halls in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;friley&quot;&gt;[http://www.iowastatedaily.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=5e9b12e3-5c74-4628-b30d-9773a75eccc3 The seven wonders of Iowa State]. The Iowa State Daily.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Richardson_Court|Richardson Court Association]] (RCA) consists of 12 residence halls on the east side of campus. 

The [[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Towers|Towers Residence Association]] (TRA) are located south of the main campus. Two of the four towers, Knapp and Storms Halls, were imploded in 2005; however, Wallace and Wilson Halls still stand. 

[[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Buchanan_Hall|Buchanan Hall]] is an upper-division hall housing graduate students that is nominally considered part of the RCA, despite its distance from the other buildings. 

ISU also operates two apartment complexes for upperclassmen, [[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Frederiksen_Court|Frederiksen Court]] and [[Buildings_of_Iowa_State_University#Schilletter.2FUniversity_Village|SUV Apartments]].

===Student government===
The governing body for ISU students is the Government of Student Body or GSB. The GSB is composed of a president, vice president, finance director, cabinet appointed by the president, a clerk appointed by the vice president, senators representing each college and residence area at the university, a nine-member judicial branch and an election commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsb.iastate.edu/ Government of the Student Body]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
ISU has over 800 student organizations on campus that represent a variety of interests. Organizations are supported by Iowa State's Student Activities Center. Many student organization offices are housed in the [[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)|Memorial Union]].

[[Image:Memorial Union east.jpg|thumb|250px|left|&lt;center&gt;Memorial Union]]
The Memorial Union at Iowa State University opened in September 1928 and is currently home to a number of University departments and student organizations, a bowling alley, the University Book Store, and the Hotel Memorial Union.

The original building was designed by architect, William T. Proudfoot. The building employs a classical style of [[architecture]] reflecting [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] influences. The building's design specifically complements the designs of the major buildings surrounding the University's Central Campus area, Beardshear Hall to the west, Curtiss Hall to the east, and MacKay Hall to the north.  The style utilizes columns with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals, Paladian windows, triangular [[pediments]], and formally balanced [[facades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mu.iastate.edu/en/about_the_mu/architecture]âArchitectureâ. Iowa State University website.  Retrieved 2011-3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed to be a living memorial for ISU students lost in [[World War I]], the building includes a solemn memorial hall, named the Gold Star Room, which honors the names of the dead World War I, [[World War II]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Korean War|Korean]], and [[War on Terrorism]] veterans engraved in marble.  Symbolically, the hall was built directly over a library (the Browsing Library) and a small chapel, the symbol being that no country would ever send its young men to die in a war for a noble cause without a solid foundation on both education (the library) and religion (the chapel).&lt;ref&gt;[[Memorial Union (Iowa State University)]] Retrieved 2011-3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renovations and additions have continued through the years to include: elevators, bowling lanes, a parking ramp, a book store, food court, and additional wings.

===Greek community===
ISU is home to an active [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]]. There are 50 chapters that involve 11 percent of undergraduate students. Collectively, [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and [[sorority]] members have raised over $82,000 for philanthropies and committed 31,416 hours to community service. In 2006, the ISU Greek community was named the best large Greek community in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greek Community Membership Statistics |publisher=Iowa State University Office of Greek Affairs |url=http://www.greek.iastate.edu/resources/Greek-Community-Statistics-Fall07.pdf |accessdate=2008-08-07 |format=PDF |date=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ISU Greek Community has received multiple Jellison and Sutherland Awards from Association for Fraternal Leadership and Values, formerly the Mid-American Greek Council Association. These awards recognize the top Greek Communities in the Midwest.

The first fraternity, [[Delta Tau Delta]], was established at Iowa State in 1875, six years after the first graduating class entered Iowa State. The first sorority, I.C. Sorocis, was established only two years later, in 1877. I.C. Sorocis later became a chapter of the first national sorority at Iowa State, [[Pi Beta Phi]]. Anti-Greek rioting occurred in 1888. As reported in ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'', &quot;The anti-secret society men of the college met in a mob last night about 11 o'clock in front of the society rooms in chemical and physical hall, determined to break up a joint meeting of three secret societies.&quot; In 1891, President William Beardshear banned students from joining secret college fraternities, resulting in the eventually closing of all formerly established fraternities. President Storms lifted the ban in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Greek Community Origins from Fraternities &amp; Sororities at Iowa State |publisher=Iowa State University Office of Greek Affairs |url=http://www.greek.iastate.edu/history/timeline.html |accessdate=2008-08-07 |year=1961 |author=Miller, W.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the lifting of the fraternity ban, the first twelve national fraternities (IFC) installed on the Iowa State campus between 1904 and 1913 were, in order, [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Theta Xi]], [[Acacia]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], and [[Phi Delta Theta]].&lt;ref&gt;The Scroll of Phi Delta Theta, Vol. XXXVII, (1912-1913) p 542, edited by Davis, T.&lt;/ref&gt; Though some have suspended their chapters at various times, ten of the original twelve fraternities are active in 2008. Many of these chapters existed on campus as local fraternities before being reorganized as national fraternities, prior to 1904.

===School newspaper===
{{main|Iowa State Daily}}
The ''[[Iowa State Daily]]'' is the university's student newspaper and is the nation's largest student run newspaper. The ''Daily'' has its roots from a news sheet titled the ''Clipper'', which was started in the spring of 1890 by a group of students at Iowa Agricultural College led by F.E. Davidson. The ''Clipper'' soon led to the creation of the ''Iowa Agricultural College Student'', and the beginnings of what would one day become the ''Iowa State Daily''.

{{main|Iowa State Cyclones}}
The [[Iowa State Cyclones|&quot;Cyclones&quot;]] name dates back to 1895. That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as [[tornado]]es were called at the time). In September, the Iowa State football team traveled to [[Northwestern University]] and defeated its highly-regarded team by a score of 36-0. The next day, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'''s headline read &quot;Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isutimeline1875&quot;&gt;[http://www.iastate.edu/~isu150/history/timeline-1875.html Iowa State University Time Line, 1875-1899]. Iowa State University website.&lt;/ref&gt; The article reported that &quot;Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday.&quot; The nickname stuck and the Iowa State team had made a name for itself. 

The school colors are [[cardinal (color)|cardinal]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The mascot is [[Cy the Cardinal]], introduced in 1954. Since a cyclone was determined to be difficult to depict in costume, the cardinal was chosen in reference to the school colors. A contest was held to select a name for the mascot, with the name Cy being chosen as the winner. In early Summer 2007, Cy was voted by fans on the [[CBS Sports]] website as the &quot;Most Dominant College Mascot on Earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roland |last=Liwang |authorlink=Roland Liwag |title=Most Dominant College Mascot on Earth: Cyclones win! |url=http://www.sportsline.com/spin/story/10206409 |work= |publisher=Sportsline.com |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, Cy won the [[Capital One]] Mascot competition. 

The Iowa State Cyclones are a member of the [[Big 12 Conference]] and compete in [[NCAA]] [[Division I-A]], fielding 16 varsity teams in 12 sports. The Cyclones also compete in and are a founding member of the [[Central States Collegiate Hockey League]] of the [[American Collegiate Hockey Association]].  Iowa State teams and individuals have achieved great success, including national championships in wrestling, gymnastics, cross country, and club ice hockey.

Iowa State's intrastate [[College rivalry|archrival]] is the [[University of Iowa]] whom it competes annually for the [[Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series]] trophy, an annual athletic competition between the two schools. Sponsored by the Iowa Corn Growers Association, the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions between the two rival universities in all sports.

Football first made its way onto the Iowa State campus in 1878 as a recreational sport, but it was not until 1892 that Iowa State organized its first team to represent the school in football.  In 1894, college president William M. Beardshear spearheaded the foundation of an athletic association to officially sanction Iowa State football teams.  The 1894 team finished with a 6-1 mark, including a 16-8 victory over what is now the University of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=History of Iowa State: Time Line, 1875-1899.  Iowa State University. 2007. |url=http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/exhibits/150/template/timeline-1875.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cyclones compete each year for traveling trophies.  Since 1977, Iowa State and Iowa compete annually for the [[Cy-Hawk Trophy]].  Iowa State competes with conference rivals [[University of Missouri|Missouri]] for the [[Telephone Trophy]] and [[Kansas State University|Kansas State]] in the annual [[Farmageddon (American football)|Farmageddon]] series.

The Cyclones play its home games at [[Jack Trice Stadium]], named after [[Jack Trice]], ISU's first [[African-American]] athlete and also the first and only Iowa State athlete to die from injuries sustained during athletic competition.  Trice died three days after his first game playing for Iowa State against [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] on October 6, 1923.  Suffering from a broken collarbone early in the game, he continued to play until he was trampled by a group of Minnesota players.  It is disputed whether he was trampled purposely or if it was by accident.  The stadium was named in his honor in 1997 and is the only NCAA Division I-A stadium named after an African-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iowa State Media Guide-Records. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com//pdf7/134422.pdf?SPSID=48396&amp;SPID=4653&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Trice Stadium, formerly known as Cyclone Stadium, opened on September 20, 1975, with a win against the [[Air Force Academy]].

Beginning with its first appearance in the 1971 [[Sun Bowl]], the Cyclones have earned ten trips to [[bowl game|bowl]] games.  In its most recent bowl, Iowa State defeated Minnesota in the 2009 [[Insight Bowl]], 14-13, in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Arizona]].

===Men's Basketball===
{{main|Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball}}
Hopes of &quot;Hilton Magic&quot; returning took a boost with the hiring of ISU alum, Ames native, and fan favorite [[Fred Hoiberg]] as coach of the men's basketball team in April 2010.  Hoiberg (&quot;The Mayor&quot;) played three seasons under legendary coach [[Johnny Orr]] and one season under future [[Chicago Bulls]] coach [[Tim Floyd]] during his standout collegiate career as a Cyclone (1991â95).   Orr laid the foundation of success in men's basketball upon his arrival from [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in 1980 and is credited with building Hilton Magic.  Besides Hoiberg, other Cyclone greats played for Orr and brought winning seasons, including [[Jeff Grayer]], [[Barry Stevens (basketball)|Barry Stevens]], and walk-on [[Jeff Hornacek]].  The 1985-86 Cyclones were one of the most memorable.  Orr coached the team to second place in the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]] and produced one of his greatest career wins, a victory over his former team and No. 2 seed  [[University of Michigan|Michigan]] in the second round of the NCAA tournament.

Under coaches Floyd (1995â98) and [[Larry Eustachy]] (1998â2003), Iowa State achieved even greater success.  Floyd took the Cyclones to the Sweet Sixteen in 1997 and Eustachy led ISU to two consecutive Big 12 regular season conference titles in 1999-2000 and 2000â01, plus the conference tournament title in 2000.  Seeded No. 2 in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Eustachy and the Cyclones defeated [[UCLA]] in the Sweet Sixteen before falling to [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]], the eventual NCAA Champion, in the regional finals by a score of 75-64 (the differential representing the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]]' narrowest margin of victory in the tournament).  Standout [[Marcus Fizer]] and [[Jamaal Tinsley]] were scoring leaders for the Cyclones who finished the season 32-5.  Tinsley returned to lead the Cyclones the following year with another conference title and No. 2 seed, but ISU finished the season with a 25-6 overall record after a stunning loss to No. 15 seed [[Hampton University|Hampton]] in the first round.

Of Iowa State's 13 NCAA Tournament appearances, the Cyclones have reached the Sweet Sixteen four times (1944, 1986, 1997, 2000), made two appearances in the Elite Eight (1944, 2000), and reached the Final Four once in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=&quot;Iowa State Men's Basketball Media Guide&quot; Iowa State University. 2008. |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle,dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=1608347&amp;KEY=&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;DB_LANG=&amp;IN_SUBSCRIBE.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's Basketball===
{{main|Iowa State Cyclones women's basketball}}
Iowa State is known for having one of the most successful women's basketball programs in the nation.  Since the founding of the Big 12, Coach [[Bill Fennelly]] and the Cyclones have won three  conference titles (one regular season, two tournament), and have advanced to the Sweet Sixteen five times (1999â2001, 2009, 2010) and the Elite Eight twice (1999, 2009) in the NCAA Tournament.  The team is also a leader in attendance, finishing third in the nation in both 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Iowa State Bill Fennelly Bio.  Retrieved June 2010. |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=46668&amp;SPID=4253&amp;DB_OEM_ID..html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrestling===
{{main|Iowa State Cyclones wrestling}}
The storied wrestling program has captured the NCAA wrestling tournament title eight times between 1928 and 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=46632&amp;SPID=4248&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=1413974 |title=Cyclone Wrestlers Ready For NCAA's |accessdate=2008-06-09 |publisher=cyclones.com |date=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the Big 12 Conference Tournament three consecutive years, 2007-2009.  On February 7, 2010, the Cyclones became the first collegiate wrestling program to record its 1,000th dual win in program history by defeating [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]], 30-10, in Tempe, Arizona.  

In 2002, under Coach [[Bobby Douglas]], Iowa State became the first school to produce a four-time, undefeated NCAA champion in [[Cael Sanderson]], who also took the gold medal at the 2004 [[Olympic Games]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]], [[Greece]].  [[Dan Gable]], another legendary ISU wrestler, is famous for having lost only one match in his entire Iowa State collegiate career - his last, and winning gold at the 1972 Olympics in [[Munich, Germany|Munich]], [[Germany]], while not giving up a single point.  

In 2013, Iowa State will host its eighth NCAA Wrestling Championships.  The Cyclones hosted the first NCAA championships in 1928.

===Volleyball===
In volleyball, Coach Christy Johnson-Lynch has led the Cyclones to four NCAA tournament appearances since her Iowa State arrival in 2005, including two Sweet Sixteen appearances and an Elite Eight.  In 2009, Iowa State finished the season second in the Big 12 behind [[University of Texas|Texas]] with a 27-5 record and ranked #6, its highest ever finish.

==VEISHEA celebration==
[[Image:VEISHEA2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[VEISHEA]] 2006 Battle of the Bands.]]
{{main|VEISHEA}}
Iowa State is widely known for [[VEISHEA]], an annual education and entertainment festival held on campus each spring. The name VEISHEA is derived from the initials of ISU's five original colleges, forming an acronym as the university existed when the festival was founded in 1922:

*'''V'''eterinary Medicine
*'''E'''ngineering
*'''I'''ndustrial '''S'''cience
*'''H'''ome '''E'''conomics
*'''A'''griculture

VEISHEA is the largest student run festival in the nation, bringing in tens of thousands of visitors to the campus each year.
The celebration features an annual parade and many open-house demonstrations of the university facilities and departments. Campus organizations exhibit products, technologies, and hold fund raisers for various charity groups. In addition, VEISHEA brings speakers, lecturers, and entertainers to Iowa State, and throughout its over eight decade history, it has hosted such distinguished guests as [[Bob Hope]], [[John Wayne]], Presidents [[Harry Truman]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Lyndon Johnson]], and performers [[Diana Ross]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Sonny and Cher]], [[The Who]], The [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Bobby V]], and [[The Black Eyed Peas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veishea.iastate.edu/2006/mediakit/history.pdf VEISHEA History] from the official 2006 media kit&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2007 VEISHEA festivities marked the start of Iowa State's year-long [[sesquicentennial]] celebration.
