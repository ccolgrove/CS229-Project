}}'''''Secret Story 2009''''' is the fifth edition of the [[France|French]] version of the popular reality show [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]] carrying on from the previous similar show, [[Loft Story]]. It began airing on [[TF1]] on June 19, 2009 and continue to air until September 25, 2009, lasting 99 days, and is presented by [[Benjamin Castaldi]], who presented [[Loft Story (France)|Loft Story]] and the first two seasons of Secret Story.

==Principle==
The principle is similar to that of [[Loft Story]]. The contestants are kept locked away for 14 weeks in a house, called ''&quot;La Maison des Secrets&quot;'' (the House of Secrets) measuring 1600mÂ² styled on the UK Big Brother house including a swimming pool, jacuzzi, a lounge, a big bedroom divided by a shattered glass, bathroom with showers and 5 secrets room which are the Crystal room, Love Cave, Museum of Secrets, White Room and Bedsit (like [[Big Brother 2004 (UK)|Big Brother 5 UK]]). All of the rooms are installed with cameras, (except the toilet due to a law imposed by the ''Conseil SupÃ©rieur de l'audiovisuel''). ''The Voice'' speaks to the contestants at times, and acts like &quot;Big Brother&quot; in other countries. Each contestant has to conceal a secret which the other contestants must try to discover. If a contestant does, that contestant wins the jackpot of the contestant whose secret they have guessed. Each secret is worth â¬10,000. Each Tuesday, 2 contestants are nominated and put up against the public vote, one housemate will be evicted every Friday. Housemates are only permitted to nominate every other week and housemates are only allowed to nominate other housemates of the opposite sex.

&lt;small&gt;{{note|1|Note 1}}:  In round one of nominations only male housemates could nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|2|Note 2}}:  As Angie, Kevin, and Romain were only intruders they could not be nominated for eviction.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|3|Note 3}}:  In round two of nominations only female housemates could nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|4|Note 4}}:  As Kevin and Leo were only intruders they could not be nominated for eviction.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|5|Note 5}}:  In week two Big brother gave Romain the choice between immunity from the second eviction or 10,000 euros, Romain chose to take the immunity.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|6|Note 6}}:  In week three, Romain revealed his secret to Jonathan, and as punishment he was automatically nominated and faced the public vote alone.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|7|Note 7}}:  In round four of nominations only male housemates were allowed to nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|8|Note 8}}:  In round four of nominations there was a three way tie between Angie, Maija, and Sabrina. As only two housemates can be nominated at one time, the male housemates were each asked to vote for one of the three to face the public vote. Angie received votes from Didier and Nicolas, Maija received votes from Bruno, Francois-Xavier, and Leo, and Sabrina received votes from Jonathan, Kevin, and Romain. Since Maija and Sabrina received the most votes they remained nominated.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|9|Note 9}}:  In round four of nominations Nicolas was nominated for eviction by Big brother for discussing nominations.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|10|Note 10}}:  In round five of nominations Angie answered the red phone and was told she could nominate anymale housemate for eviction, she chose Leo.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|11|Note 11}}:  In round five of nominations only female housemates could nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|12|Note 12}}:  Nomination results from the fifth round of nominations were discounted and Jonathan and Romain were no longer nominated. Instead of a public vote, on day 36 the housemates were asked to vote on whether or not Leo should be ejected. Angie, Romain, Vanessa, FranÃ§ois-Xavier, Jonathan, Cindy, Sabrina, Kevin, Elizabeth and Maija voted against Leo's return so he was ejected. All other housemates, with the exception of Bruno who chose not to vote, voted for Leo to stay.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|13|Note 13}}:  In round six of nominations only male housemates could nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|14|Note 14}}:  Upon his eviction, Nicolas was asked to choose either Cindy or Vanessa to give exemption to in the next female nominations week. Nicolas chose to give Vanessa the exemption.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|15|Note 15}}:  In round seven of nominations all housemates were allowed to nominate, however the male nominations were fake and, as such, no female contestant was nominated.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|16|Note 16}}:  In round eight of nominations Sabrina was automatically nominated by Big Brother for revealing her secret.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|17|Note 17}}:  Emilie was exempt from nominations as she had been placed in a secret room following Romain's eviction. For the same reason, Jonathan did not nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|18|Note 18}}:  In week nine Jonathan and Maija were automatically nominated for eviction by Big brother for revealing their secrets, as a result the scheduled nominations were cancelled.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|19|Note 19}}:  In week ten, Didier was unanimously given the power to nominate two girls for eviction by the 5 remaining men, all other housemates were ineligible to nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|20|Note 20}}:  In week eleven, Bruno was given the choice to give immunity to FranÃ§ois-Xavier and make everyone lose money or to not give him immunity. He chose to give him immunity.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|21|Note 21}}:  In week eleven, Big Brother asked the boys whether or not they wanted Vanessa to single-handedly nominate two boys for eviction and all but Jonathan agreed, all other housemates were ineligible to nominate.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|22|Note 22}}:  In round twelve of nominations housemates were allowed to nominate any housemate regardless of gender, they nominated one during the Friday show (Kevin nominated Vanessa, leading to a tie with Emilie and as such both were nominated) and one on Tuesday.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|23|Note 23}}:  Jonathan won an automatic pass to the finals after discovering a secret in the house.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;{{note|24|Note 24}}:   As there was only one week left until the final, all housemates apart from Jonathan were nominated for a triple eviction.
&lt;/small&gt;
