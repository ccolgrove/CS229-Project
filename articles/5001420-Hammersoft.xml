'''Montana Grizzlies''' is the nickname given to the athletic teams of the [[University of Montana â Missoula|University of Montana]].  The women's basketball team, however, uses the moniker '''Lady Griz'''. The university is a member of the [[Big Sky Conference]] and competes in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], fielding 6 men's teams (Basketball, Football, Cross Country, Tennis, Indoor Track &amp; Field, and Outdoor Track &amp; Field) and 8 women's teams (Basketball, Cross Country, Golf, Soccer, Tennis, Indoor Track &amp; Field, Outdoor Track &amp; Field, and Volleyball).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gogriz.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The football team has won the university's only two NCAA Championships.

==History==
===Nickname and Mascot===
Originally known as the Bears with a live black bear named Teddy as the mascot, the university's football team officially became the Grizzlies (sometimes called the Silvertips) in 1923 when they were admitted to the [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montanagrizzlies.com/user/pages/MBasketball/2010-11/Section1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year Montana became the first state in the nation to designate grizzlies as a protected game animal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/files/norock/products/StateOfTheGrizzly.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This name change would later prove problematic, however, for their new PCC conference-mate [[UCLA]] who had also recently changed their name to the Grizzlies.  When UCLA petitioned to join the conference in 1926, Montana claimed rights to the name and the UCLA Grizzlies became the [[UCLA Bruins]] when they were admitted to the conference in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Stadium Stories: UCLA Bruins. Roberts, Chris. Globe Pequot. (2005). p. 7 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Grizzlies continued to use live bears as mascots until the early 1960's.  In addition to Teddy, there was a Cocoa, Chester, and three different Fessy's named after former football coach Doug Fessenden, among several others.  In the 1970's and 80's costumed mascots were introduced, but as mascots of local sponsors, not the University.  This included the [[Hamm's Beer bear]], a chicken from a local radio station, and even Ronald McDonald.&lt;ref&gt;http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/ark:/80444/xv80682&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in the 1980's, a costumed mascot by the name of Grizzly Otto (after local sponsor Grizzly Auto) was introduced as part of the Montana cheer squad.  The current mascot, [[Monte (mascot)|Monte]] (short for Montana), was introduced in 1993 and in 2002 became the first winner of the [[Capital_One_Bowl#Mascot_contest|Capital One Bowl's &quot;Mascot of the Year&quot;]] contest.  He won again in 2004 and was nominated three other times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umt.edu/montanan/f06/artifacts.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalonebowl.com/history#2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colors===
''(1893-1967), (1997-Present) Maroon &amp; Silver {{colorbox|#660033}}&amp;nbsp;{{colorbox|silver}}&lt;br&gt; 
(1968-1996) Copper &amp; Gold {{colorbox|#CC5500}}&amp;nbsp;{{colorbox|#FFCC00}}''&lt;br&gt;
The University of Montana's official colors are copper, silver and gold, and were chosen as such in recognition of the state of Montana's mining history.  Contrary to popular perception, these colors have never changed with the confusion stemming from the University's decision to represent &quot;copper&quot; with either ''maroon'' {{colorbox|#660033}} or ''Texas orange'' {{colorbox|#CC5500}} at various times in its history.  In 1893 when the University was founded and its colors chosen a lack of copper dye led the school to use maroon and occasionally other colors to represent the copper.  This had the effect of having the schools athletic teams not always being represented across the board by the same uniform colors.  In 1967, then football coach and athletic director Jack Swarthout, who personally preferred the maroon and silver used by the football team, sought to make the schools colors more consistent and held a vote among UM coaches.  They selected ''Texas orange'' (to represent copper) and gold to be used on the school's uniforms and it would remain so for the next 30 years.  In 1993, the maroon was brought back as part of the University's centennial celebrations and a student survey in 1995 showed support for a return to maroon and silver uniforms.  Despite some vocal opposition, by 1997 the colors began to phase into the maroon and silver that continues to be used.&lt;ref&gt;http://filemanager.montanagrizzlies.com/mtgriz3/custom_pages/files/pdfs/fb/features/coaching_legends/jack_swarthout.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umt.edu/montanan//wint96/oval.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montanakaimin.com/arts-culture/why-we-bleed-maroon-and-silver-1.2622129&lt;/ref&gt;

* Athletic Performance Center was created as part of the recent renovation to the Adams Center in 1999. The current facility is approximately twice as large as the previous weight room used in the Adams Center over the years.

The Athletic Performance Center staff designs, implements and evaluates strength and conditioning programs for all Grizzly athletes including sport-specific weight training, coupled with movement-specific conditioning.  The center features numerous free-weight stations and several weight-training machines.

Sport-specific weight training, coupled with movement-specific conditioning results in a greater overall training effect that transfers to the court during the season. Lifting is also a focus during the season. The student-athletes focus on several core lifts to maintain their strength levels during the long and grueling season.

The RATC provides numerous ways to treat injuries: electrical stimulation units, whirlpools, free weights and balance boards. The primary goal of the athletic training staff is to provide quality care for student-athletes while helping them safely return to competition.

When a student-athlete is injured, an athletic trainer evaluates the severity of the injury and renders whatever care is needed. Depending on the extent of the injury, the student-athlete visits the center daily, at least two to three times, for treatment and rehabilitation exercises. The athletic training staff works together with the Athletic Performance staff to monitor the student-athlete's strengthening exercises. Once student-athletes have regained strength and function, they are allowed to return to the playing field or court.

Although athletic trainers provide injury care, they also promote injury prevention. Preventative maintenance occurs in the form of injury-screening processes, flexibility, taping and strengthening exercises.

* Football Stadium
* Built 1986 (Expansions in 1995, 2003, and 2007)
** Current capacity (25,217)

* In August of 1985 Missoula businessman Dennis R. Washington and the employees of Washington Corporations provided a gift of $1 million and the stadium has since been the named Washington-Grizzly Stadium. The cost of the stadium was around $3.2 million.

There are 49 private boxes located on the east and west sides of the stadium, and they are individually decorated and furnished.

*Stadium Additions
** 1986 - Original layout had 12,500 permanent seats, and seating was available, weather-permitting, in the grass end zones, which made the capacity around 15,000.

** 1995 - In the spring of 1995 the stadium underwent its first expansion in the north and south end zones.  The cost of that expansion was about $2.5 million and brought seating to 19,000.

** 2001 - Sprinturf was added prior to the 2001 season at a cost of about $1 million, which was paid for by an anonymous donor, but with the request that the field be named âJohn Hoyt Fieldâ in honor of John Hoyt, a long-time Grizzly booster, who passed away in March of that year. A new Sprinturf playing surface was installed prior to the 2008 season

** 2002 - GrizVision, a state-of-the-art video and message center, was added in 2002. GrizVision displays game statistics, player profiles, digital replays, and shots of the crowd. The screen is one of the largest in the FCS, measuring 26 feet by 36 feet, and it came from New York City and Times Square.

** 2003 - The second expansion occurred in the spring and summer of 2003, and approximately 4,000 seats were added to the north end zone section, increasing the stadium capacity to 23,183, with a cost around $3.5 million.

** 2007 - The third expansion, at a cost of approximately $6.5 million, occurred prior to the 2008 football season. The eastside expansion now houses a 500-seat âStadium Clubâ with two membership levels: the âCanyon Roomâ has 125 seats inside and 125 seats outside, and the âHellgate Terrace,â which has 250 seats.  This expansion increased the current seating capacity of Washington- Grizzly Stadium to 25,217.

==University Marching Band==
{{Main|University of Montana Grizzly Marching Band}}

The band has its origins in the late 19th Century and has since continued its tradition into the new millennium. Marching in contemporary corps-style, the program endeavors to stay on the cutting edge of trends in outdoor music performances. The program is also one of the most visible organizations on the University of Montana campus, performing at all Grizzly football home games in the 25,500-seat [[Washington-Grizzly Stadium]]. The group also travels to several conference games throughout the Northwest and has accompanied the football team to four Division I-AA National Championships in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umt.edu/music/ensembles/grizzly-marching-band School of Music's Grizzly Marching Band website&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics to &quot;Up with Montana&quot; are credited to Dick Howell, a Law student and member of the glee club in the 1910's, âto commemorate the rivalryâ for game number twenty-one between UM and Montana State University, in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.edu/montanan/s07/artifacts.shtml Montana Magazine ''Artifacts'']&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the tune itself, however, is disputed.  [[The Stanford Jonah]] is a fight song of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] written in 1913 by Ted Haley as an entry into a song contest held by the Daily Californian. The song continues to be a hit at most sporting events, but specifically at events between the [[California Golden Bears]] and their rival, the [[Stanford Cardinal]]. [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech's]] &quot;White And Gold&quot; and The [[Navy_Midshipmen|Naval Academy's]] &quot;Up With The Navy&quot; (which gives credit to the University of Montana&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usna.edu/USNABand/groups/marchingband.htm US Naval Academy Band]&lt;/ref&gt;)also share a similar tune as well.
