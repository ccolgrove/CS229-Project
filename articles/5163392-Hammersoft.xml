==History==
===Kool 106 (CHR)===
{{Copypaste|section|url=http://pinoyexchange.com/forums/showpost.php?s=f916e2600d8e1d4883550307d9971f95&amp;p=36352637&amp;postcount=796|date=October 2011}}
Previously owned by [[Associated Broadcasting Company|Associated Broadcasting Company (TV5)]] then known as KOOL 106 was conceptualized in late 1991 when ABC's Edward Tan took in George Boone as the station manager for their FM radio network. With ABC 5 a fledgling organization that was to rise in February 1992, Tan wanted to make sure that his FM radio affiliate would similarly make a dent in the broadcast circles, similar to what he envisioned his TV network to do. They were able to collar the 106.7 mhz in the FM band, then an empty frequency that was not being used.

KOOL 106 was designed to become an adult contemporary station featuring the hits of the 70âs to the 90âs. It was an innovative, bold and creative approach towards radio programming as no pop radio station dared to do so. While there were a couple of stations that may have done this (Mellow Touch, Love Radio, DM 95.5 [now it will known as Pinas FM 955], WRock), these were not CHR stations. KOOL was the first to breakthrough with this approach in programming. Other CHR stations featured a day or two of oldies (Magic, RX, WRock, RT, Mellow Touch) but they never dared to put this in their regular programming interspersed with the current hits.

Skeptics at the start didnât believe the program would fly. Boone, though, had a different notion. He felt that the peak of radio listenership happened in the 80âs and that those who grew up in the 80âs were looking for a station that will give them the identity they can relate to. Similarly, current hits werenât as big as before, thereby necessitating the inclusion of various oldies in the playlist. Similarly, it was done to synergize the market of ABC since their primary target market were the young adults aged 21 and above. Hence, the BIG MIX tag.

The station armed itself by securing the top veteran jocks who knew their music. Program Director was Bob Novales (The Bug of LS and DMZ), one of the most knowledgeable personalities in the music business. Also with the original cast were Eric Eloriaga (Eric Caine of RT and KISS), D*ckie Aracama (D*ck Reese of KISS and RT), Sonny Zarate (Sonny Zee of RK and KISS) and neophyte Arvi Villamarzo (The Raven). Newscasters were [[DWRR-FM|Marivic Sanz (Victoria of ZOO)]] and Eliza Gotico (fresh graduate from Assumption). The Raven eventually became the merchandising voice over of ABC for a couple of years. A few months after, veteran jocks Joel Domino (KY, RT, CT) and Martin Gill (RT) joined the stable. Newcasters Gidget Alikpala (who became an ABS-CBN newscaster), Candace Giron (who became an ABC, PTV, GMA and UNTV newscaster) and Ultima (later to join RT) were also added in the roster.

===Several Reformats===
Between 1999 &amp; 2001 it became 106.7 Kool, that plays mostly foreign song especially R&amp;B with a very few OPM hits. In 2001, the station went off the air for one month and completely changed its format. It became known as Ritmo Latino RIO 106.7, the first radio station in the country that played [[Latin music]].

===Kool 106 (Hot AC)===
In April 2002, Kool 106 resurrected as a ''Masa'' station with its format playing mainstream pop and OPM music. During the relaunch, Kool 106 and ABC-5 teamed up to produce a 30-minute interactive music show called &quot;Kool on Kam&quot;, originally aired as a hookup with Kool 106 where the jocks can now be seen on TV with music videos. Kool on Kam moved to a primetime slot and increased to 1 hour without the radio hookup where the jocks interviews with its featured celebrity of the week and the show launched its segments. Kool on Kam lasted for a year and a half. The station also has its first ever countdown separated where the top 10 OPM songs and top 10 foreign songs are aired at noontime and 6pm respectively on Sundays. Kool 106 has also developed its &quot;By Request&quot; program aired weekdays 9pm-12mn and Sundays where listeners can call and ask for their requested song. Kool 106 as a masa station lasted for 2 years.

===106.7 Dream FM===
[[File:1067dreamfm.jpg|thumb|Dream FM logo]]
In April 2004, 6 months after Tonyboy Cojuangco took over the management of ABC, 106.7 was reformatted as Dream FM. The station aired in a smooth jazz format added up with R&amp;B, Soul, Bossa Nova and House.

After [[MediaQuest Holdings, Inc.]] acquired TV5 in 2010, Dream FM and its affiliate stations in other parts of the country remained under the Cojuangco management led by former ABC stockholder Anton Lagdameo. They became collectively known as the [[Dream FM Network]], with TV5 as its licensee until June 2011. On the other hand, MediaQuest manages [[DWFM|Radyo5 92.3 News FM]], owned by its sister company, [[Nation Broadcasting Corporation]].

Dream FM signed off at June 30, 2011 with the song, &quot;Till We Meet Again&quot;. It continues to broadcast intermittently online through [http://hayag.com/1067dreamfm Hayag].

===106.7 Energy FM===
Energy FM, a Hot AC / CHR station that used to air on [[DWKY|91.5]] transferred to 106.7 on July 1, 2011. Throughout the last week of June, plugs were aired on 106.7 with the statement ''&quot;Si Pangga, Dreaming!&quot;'', where the slogan of Energy FM ''Pangga'' and Dream FM's name is used. This is a temporary partnership between Cojuangco and UBSI, which took part-ownership of the station.

&quot;Energy FM on Dream&quot; officially signed on at midnight of July 1; its programs and DJs premiered on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Former TV5 owner expands footprint in FM radio business http://www.manilatimes.net/business/former-tv5-owner-expands-footprint-in-fm-radio-business/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Cojuangcoâs Dream FM rebranding http://business.inquirer.net/5640/cojuangco%E2%80%99s-dream-fm-rebranding&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy FM also has a radio segment called SAVED on Energy FM, consisting of praise and worship songs to God. It is run by Becca Music Inc., a Christian events company. Its first broadcast was on February 6, 2011 (while Energy FM was still on 91.5) and airs every Sunday at 8:00PM to midnight.
