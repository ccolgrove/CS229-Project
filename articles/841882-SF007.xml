'''Bastille Unix''' is an [[interactivity|interactive]] [[Hardening (computing)|hardening]] [[script (computer programming)|script]] for selected [[Linux distribution]]s and other [[operating system]]s.  It is [[free software]] licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. It does not appear to be updated or maintained any longer.

==Bastille Linux renamed to Bastille Unix==
As of 11 September 2007, Bastille Linux has been renamed to Bastille Unix.  A [http://www.bastille-unix.org/press-release-newname.html press release] indicates that this has been due for some time, but an unfortunate mishap with the domain pushed the change forward.

==Distributions==

As of 27 January 2005, Bastille hardens these distributions:
*[[Debian Linux|Debian]]
*[[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]]
*[[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]
*[[Mandriva Linux|Mandriva]]
*[[Red Hat Linux|Red Hat]] and [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|Red Hat Enterprise]]
*[[SuSE]] and SuSE Enterprise
*[[TurboLinux]]

Other operating systems supported are [[HP-UX]] and [[Mac OS X]]. The lead developer is [[Jay Beale]].
The name most likely comes from the [[Bastille]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

==Functionality==
Bastille presents a series of console-based screens that present a short description and a multiple-choice prompt.  This makes Bastille an interactive security tutorial for Linux beginners.

==Other Linux hardening projects==
*[[GrSecurity]] (kernel protections, MAC, and more)
*[[Security-Enhanced Linux]] (MAC / labeling)
