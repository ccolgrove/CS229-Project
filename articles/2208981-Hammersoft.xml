The term '''''Freeway Series''''' refers to a series of [[baseball]] games played between [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball's]] [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] &lt;!-- The team name is Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim whether you like it or not! DO NOT CHANGE IT --&gt; of the [[American League]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] of the [[National League]]. The series takes its name from the massive [[freeway]] system in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|greater Los Angeles metropolitan area]], the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along [[Interstate 5]].  The term is akin to ''[[Subway Series]]'' which refers to meetings between [[New York City]] baseball teams. The term &quot;''Freeway Series''&quot; also inspired the official name of the regions' [[National Hockey League|NHL]] rivalry: the ''[[Freeway Face-Off]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No controversy, just champions|date=December 14, 2007|first=Peter|last=Yoon|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=D3|quote=Now that we have the Freeway Faceoff between the Kings and Ducks to go along with the Freeway Series between the Dodgers and Angels, we need a name for this. It might be difficult to incorporate 'freeway' into it, though, since they share the same building. Maybe we could call it the 'We took the same freeway as you did to get here tipoff.' Or, 'The showdown at the intersection of the 10 and 110 freeways.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The first exhibition game between the two clubs (won by the Angels) was played in 1962 in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], at the time the [[spring training]] home of the Angels. The first pre-season series was played at [[Dodger Stadium]], at the time the home ballpark of both teams  April 6â7, 1963.  The Angels won both of the two games played. After the Angels added ''Los Angeles'' to their official name in 2005, the rivalry took on renewed interest, as the series took on a more inter-city atmosphere.

Throughout the 2005 season, Dodger Stadium listed the Angels as ''ANA'' on its out-of-town scoreboard and team schedules, as it was prior to Angels' name change. However, the Dodgers now post &quot;'''LAA'''&quot; on both their scoreboard and schedules. Dodger broadcaster [[Vin Scully]] refers to the team as just the Angels when mentioning them on the air.  Dodgers tickets still refer to the Angels as the &quot;Anaheim Angels.&quot; Interestingly, as of the 2011 season, the Angels' out-of-town scoreboard in right field still lists the Dodgers by their pre-2005 ''LA'' abbreviation instead of ''LAD''.

Regular- and post-season games between the two teams take place at either [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim]] or [[Dodger Stadium]]. The two stadiums are located approximately 30.92 miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=1000+Elysian+Park+Ave,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90012&amp;daddr=2000+Gene+Autry+Way,+Anaheim,+CA+92806&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;om=1|title=Driving directions to 2000 E Gene Autry Way, Anaheim, CA 92806|work=Google Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, both teams were owned by major media conglomerates: the Angels had been owned by [[the Walt Disney Company]],&lt;ref name=Media/&gt; and the Dodgers were owned by [[News Corporation]] (both companies each own 1 of the MLB broadcast partners).&lt;ref name=Media/&gt; Both teams have been sold in recent years.

During the [[2002 World Series]], there was a moment of peace in the rivalry as a result of the nightmares the Dodgers and their fans were facing because the Angels played the [[San Francisco Giants]], the fierce [[DodgersâGiants rivalry|in-state rival]]s of the Dodgers.&lt;ref name=Peace/&gt;&lt;ref name=2002WorldSeries/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorkPost/&gt; ''The Los Angeles Times'' called the series &quot;the Dodgers' 'Nightmare Series.'&quot;&lt;ref name=Media&gt;{{cite news|title=Angels' Dream Is Fox's Nightmare|date=October 28, 2002|first=Mike|last=Penner|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=U3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Post'' called it &quot;the worst-scenario World Series for the Dodgers.&quot;&lt;ref name=NewYorkPost&gt;{{cite news|quote=This is the worst-scenario World Series for the Dodgers...San Francisco is the Dodgers' most hated NL rival. The Angels are the Dodgers' neighbors to the south...'This is not a good situation for the Dodgers,' [[Paul Lo Duca|(Paul) Lo Duca]] admitted.

===Postseason series===
As of {{by|2010}}, the [[Los Angeles Angels|Angels]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] have never met in the postseason.  To meet in the postseason would require that they both advance to the [[World Series]] in the same year. To date, the two teams have made the playoffs in the same year three times, 2004, 2008 and 2009. In 2004, both teams lost in the Division Series, whereas in 2008 the Angels lost to the Boston Red Sox, 3 games to 1 while the Dodgers swept the Chicago Cubs in 3 games only to lose to the [[2008 World Series|eventual champion]] Philadelphia Phillies in 5 games in the NLCS. In the 2009 playoffs, both teams advanced to their respective [[League Championship Series]], which each team needed to win for there to be a freeway World Series. However, the Dodgers lost game 5 of the NLCS to the defending champion Phillies, and the Angels lost the ALCS in six games to the [[2009 World Series|eventual champion]] [[New York Yankees]]. The Dodgers' losses to the Phillies seemed to be a sense of revenge; they beat the Phillies in two straight NLCS Series, in [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977]] and [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978]]. Both times, they lost to the Yankees in the World Series.

The Angels' only World Series appearance came in their championship season of {{wsy|2002}}, while the Dodgers' last one came in their championship season of {{wsy|1988}}.
