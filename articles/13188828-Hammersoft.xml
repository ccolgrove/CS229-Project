'''WLOR''' (1550 [[AM broadcasting|AM]], &quot;Sunny 98&quot;) is a [[radio station]] licensed to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], USA, that serves the greater [[Tennessee Valley]] area. The station carries a mix of [[oldies]] music, [[talk radio]], and sports coverage. WLOR is part of the Black Crow Media Group and the [[broadcast license]] is held by BCA Radio, LLC, Debtor-in-Possession. Black Crow Media Group sought [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection on January 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://orlando.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2010/01/25/story8.html | first=Richard | last=Bilbao | title=Black Crow Media Group LLC files for Ch. 11 protection | date=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early days===
[[File:WAAY-AM 1550 logo.png|thumb|left|Great American WAAY 1970s]]
The station originally started on November 10, 1946, as WHBS on 1490 AM, which was owned by ''[[The Huntsville Times]]''. It later added an FM simulcast in 1946 on 95.1 FM, which was discontinued around 1957. The station moved to 1550&amp;nbsp;kHz, with an increase of daytime power to 5000 watts, on November 4, 1952. From 1958 to 1989, this station used the call letters WAAY as the [[Top 40]]-formatted AM sister station of [[WAAY-TV]]. The station went to 50,000 watts-daytime power in 1980 (the maximum output permitted for U.S. AM radio stations) and then operated from a separate daytime and nighttime site until 1991. WAAY-AM also was the first station to broadcast in [[AM stereo]] in the Huntsville market in 1984, using the Kahn-Hazeltine stereo system. Both WAAY AM/TV stations were owned and operated by Smith Broadcasting, a local family that has since divested its broadcasting interests.

===Finding religion===

When the AM station was sold, the new owners were required to change the callsign. They chose WAAJ in April 1989 to accompany the station's change to a [[gospel music]] and religious format. This format and callsign ran until April 1993 when the station became WLOR.&lt;ref name=&quot;callfcc1a&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=39508 |title=Call Sign History |work=FCC Media Bureau CDBS Public Access Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1998 WLOR returned to the air with a [[black gospel]] format (daytime only, as the nighttime site had been demolished).

In March 2000, the station was purchased by STG Media LLC (Steven J. Shelton, president) for a reported sale price of $425,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Changing Hands |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |date=2000-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2002 the station began the &quot;Jammin' 1550&quot; branding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Huntsville Times |title=Radio mining the 'old is gold' vein |first=Chris |last=Welch |page=S39 |date=July 16, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in early 2002 nighttime operations resumed from the daytime site.

===True Oldies===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WLOR-AM true oldies logo.png|thumb|right|first &quot;True Oldies&quot; logo{{ffdc|1=WAAY-AM 1550 logo.png|log=2011 July 18}}]] --&gt;
In June 2008 ABC's [[The Touch (radio network)|The Touch]] programming was replaced with ABC's [[True Oldies Channel]] format. This &quot;true oldies&quot; format is programmed by legendary disc jockey [[Scott Shannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel.|title=Radio Stations |url=http://www.trueoldieschannel.com/html/stations.html |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080728203304/http://www.trueoldieschannel.com/html/stations.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An FM simulcast of WLOR started on May 1, 2009, on FM translator W251AC at 98.1 FM with a transmitter located on Drake Mountain. The station was re-branded as &quot;Sunny 98&quot;. (The 98.1 translator was previously operated as a WQPR/WBUZ/WKDF translator on [[Capshaw Mountain]].)

==Technical changes==
On June 19, [[2007 in radio|2007]], the station was granted a construction permit to downgrade from a class B to a class D station using a single transmitter site and a nighttime power reduction from 500 [[watt]]s to just 44 watts. The station was licensed to operate as a class D at reduced nighttime power on April 24, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Federal Communications Commission |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/Auth_Files/1225351.pdf |format=PDF |title=AM Broadcast Station License}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translators==
WLOR programming is also carried on a [[broadcast translator]] station to extend or improve the coverage area of the station.
