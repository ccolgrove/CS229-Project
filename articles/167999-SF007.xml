'''RISC&amp;nbsp;OS''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|r|Éª|s|k|oÊ|Ë|É|s}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riscosopen.org/content/about |title=About us: RISC OS Open Limited FAQ |publisher=RISC OS Open |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a computer [[operating system]] originally developed by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]] in [[Cambridge]], [[England]] for their range of desktop computers, based on their own [[ARM architecture]]. First released in 1987, under the name '''Arthur''', the subsequent iteration was renamed as ''{{nowrap|RISC OS 2.00}}'' in 1988. The operating system takes its name from the [[RISC]] (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture used on supported systems.

From 1988 to 1998, RISC&amp;nbsp;OS was bundled with nearly every ARM based Acorn computer model, including the [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] range of computers, and [[RiscPC]] and [[Acorn A7000|A7000]] computers.

After the breakup of Acorn in 1998, development of RISC&amp;nbsp;OS was continued by several companies, including [[RISCOS Ltd]] and [[Castle Technology]]. Also since 1998, RISC&amp;nbsp;OS has been bundled with a number of ARM-based ''Acorn Clone'' personal computers such as the [[Iyonix]]&lt;ref name='Acorn press release 1998-10-12'&gt;{{cite news | first = Acorn Computers Ltd | title = Acorn announces distribution deal with Castle Technology for RISC based products | date = 1998-10-12 | publisher = Acorn Computers Ltd | url = http://www.acorn.co.uk/acorn/news/press/castle.html | work = Press release | accessdate = 2011-01-06 | quote = (October 12th 1998), Cambridge, UK-Acorn announced today that it has completed negotiations with Castle Technology for them to distribute Acorn products. | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19990506180305/http://www.acorn.co.uk/acorn/news/press/castle.html | archivedate = 6 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[A9home]].

== History ==
{{main|History of RISC OS}}

RISC OS was originally released in 1987 as ''Arthur 1.20''. The next version, {{nowrap|Arthur 2}}, became {{nowrap|RISC OS 2}} and was completed and made available in April 1989. RISC OS 3.00 was released with the very earliest version of the A5000 in 1991 and contained a series of new features. By 1996 RISC OS had been shipped on over 500,000 systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/docs/Acorn/ART/ART_DS013_AcornRISCOS.pdf ART - Acorn RISC OS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Acorn officially halted work on the OS in January 1999, renaming themselves Element 14. In March 1999 a new company called [[RISCOS Ltd]] licensed the rights to RISC OS from Element 14 (and eventually from the new owner, [[Pace Micro Technology]]) and continued the development of OS 3.8, releasing it as ''RISC OS 4'' in July 1999. According to the company, over 6,400 copies of RISC OS 4.02 on ROM were sold up until production was ceased in mid 2005.

In May 2001 the company launched ''RISC OS Select'', a subscription scheme allowing users access to the latest OS updates. These upgrades are released as soft-loadable [[ROM image]]s, separate to the ROM where the boot OS is stored, and are loaded at boot time. Select 1 was shipped in May 2002, with Select 2 following in November 2002 and the final release of Select 3 in June 2004. RISCOS Ltd released the ROM based version 4.39 the same month, dubbed ''RISC OS Adjust'' as a play on the RISC OS GUI convention of calling the three mouse buttons 'Select', 'Menu' and 'Adjust'. RISCOS Ltd sold its 500th Adjust ROM in early 2006.

In October 2002, the ''Acorn clone'' [[Iyonix PC]] was released by [[Castle Technology]]. This runs ''RISC OS 5'', a separate evolution based upon the [[NCOS]] work done by Pace for [[set-top box]]es. In October 2006, Castle announced a source sharing license plan for elements of ''RISC OS 5''. This Shared Source Initiative (SSI) is managed by [[RISC OS Open Limited]].

Also in October 2006, RISCOS Ltd announced RISC OS Six, the next generation of their stream of the operating system. The first product to be launched under the name was the continuation of the Select scheme, Select 4. A beta-version of RISC OS 6, Preview 1 (Select 4i1), was available in 2007 as a free download to all subscribers to the Select scheme, while in April 2009 the final release of Select 5 was shipped.

The latest release of RISC OS from RISCOS Ltd is Select 6i1, shipped in December 2009.

== Features ==

=== OS core ===

The core of the OS is stored in [[read-only memory|ROM]], giving a fast [[bootup]] time and safety from operating system corruption. RISC OS 4 and 5 are stored in {{nowrap|4 MB}} of [[flash memory]], allowing the operating system to be updated without having to replace the ROM chip. The OS is made up of a number of [[software module|module]]s. These can be added to and replaced, including soft-loading of modules not present in ROM at run time and on-the-fly replacement. This design has led to OS developers releasing rolling updates to their versions of the OS, while third parties are able to write OS replacement modules to add new features. OS modules are accessed via software interrupts (SWIs), similar to [[system call]]s in other operating systems.

The OS is [[single-user]] and employs [[co-operative multitasking]] (CMT). While most current desktop OSes use [[preemption (computing)|pre-emptive]] [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] (PMT) and [[thread (computer science)|multithreading]], {{nowrap|RISC OS}} remains with a CMT system. Many users have called for the OS to migrate to PMT.{{cn|date=September 2011}} The OS also has rudimentary [[memory protection]], and all users have full [[superuser]] privileges.

The [[file system]] is volume-oriented: the top level of the file hierarchy is a volume (disc, network share) prefixed by the filesystem type. To determine [[file type]], the OS uses [[metadata]] instead of [[file extension]]s. Colons are used to separate the filesystem from the rest of the path; the root is represented by a dollar (&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;) sign and directories by a period (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;). Extensions from foreign filesystems are shown using a forward slash (&lt;code&gt;example.txt&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;example/txt&lt;/code&gt;). For example, &lt;code&gt;ADFS::HardDisc4.$.&lt;/code&gt; is the root of the disc named ''HardDisc4'' using the [[Advanced Disc Filing System|ADFS]] filesystem.

A file system can present a file of a particular type as a volume in its own right, similar to a [[loop device]]. The OS refers to this functionality as an image filing system. This allows transparent handling of archives and similar files, which appear as directories with some special properties. Files inside the image file appear in the hierarchy underneath the parent archive. It is not necessary for the archive to contain the data it refers to: some symbolic link and network share filesystems put a reference inside the image file and go elsewhere for the data.

Most of the OS has defined [[Application binary interface|ABI]]s to handle filters and vectors. The OS provides many ways in which the programmer can intercept and modify its operation. This simplifies the task of modifying its behaviour, either in the GUI or deeper. As a result, there is a number of third-party programs which allow the OS look and feel to be customised.

=== Desktop ===

The [[WIMP (computing)|WIMP]] interface (see link for explanation; Acorn used wimp to refer to their gui) incorporates three [[mouse button]]s (named ''Select'', ''Menu'' and ''Adjust''), [[context-sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] menus, window order control (i.e. send to back) and dynamic window [[focus (computing)|focus]] (a window can have input focus at any position on the stack). The [[Icon bar]] holds icons which represent mounted disc drives, RAM discs, running applications and system utilities. These icons have context-sensitive menus and support [[drag-and-drop]] behaviour. They represent the running application as a whole, irrespective of whether it has open windows.

The GUI is centred around the concept of files. The Filer displays the contents of a disc. Applications are run from the Filer view and files can be dragged to the Filer view from applications to perform saves. [[Application directories]] are used to store applications. The OS differentiates them from normal directories through the use of a [[pling#Computers|pling]] (exclamation mark, also called shreik) prefix. Double-clicking on such a directory launches the application rather than opening the directory. The application's executable files and resources are contained within the directory, but normally they remain hidden from the user. Because applications are self-contained, this allows drag-and-drop installation and removal.

The outline font manager provides [[anti-aliasing]] of fonts, the OS being the first operating system to include such a feature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/6170/Emulating_RISC_OS_under_Windows/page1/ | title = Emulating RISC OS under Windows | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | last = Round | first = Mark | date = 2004-02-26 | work = OSnews | publisher = [[OSNews]] | quote = Many of the UI concepts that we take for granted were first pioneered in RISC OS, for instance: scalable anti-aliased fonts and an operating system extendable by 'modules', while most of the PC world was still on Windows 3.0. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://telcontar.net/Misc/GUI/RISCOS/ | title = The RISC OS GUI | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | last = Ghiraddje | date = 2009-12-22 | publisher = Telcontar.net | quote = Only with Mac OS X did any mainstream graphical interface provide the smoothly rendered, fractionally spaced type that Acorn accomplished in 1992 or earlier. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/05/gui.ars/6 | title = A History of the GUI | accessdate = 2011-05-25 | first = Jeremy | last = Reimer | date = 2005-05 | publisher = [[ArsTechnica]] | quote = [...] in 1987, the UK-based company Acorn Computers introduced their [...] GUI, called &quot;Arthur&quot;, also was the first to feature anti-aliased display of on-screen fonts, even in 16-color mode! }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/21713/Screen_Fonts_Shape_Accuracy_or_On-Screen_Readability_ | title = Screen Fonts: Shape Accuracy or On-Screen Readability? | accessdate = 2011-06-13 | first = Thom | last = Holwerda | date = 2005-06-23 | publisher = [[OSNews]] | quote = [...] it was RISC OS that had the first system-wide, intricate [...] font rendering in operating systems. }}&lt;/ref&gt; having included it since before January 1989&lt;ref name='PCW 1989-01'&gt;{{cite news | first = Dick | last = Pountain | title = Screentest: Archie RISC OS | date = 1988-12 | url = http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/docs/Mags/PCW/PCW_Jan89_RISCOS.pdf | work = [[Personal Computer World]] | page = 154 | accessdate = 2011-01-14 | quote = [ArcDraw] can also add text in multiple sizes and fonts to a drawing (including anti-aliased fonts)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The {{nowrap|RISC OS}} ''Style Guide'' encourages a consistent look and feel across applications. This was introduced in {{nowrap|RISC OS 3}} and specifies application appearance and behaviour. Acorn's own main [[#Bundled applications|bundled applications]] were not updated to comply with the guide until {{nowraplinks|[[RISCOS Ltd]]}}'s ''Select'' release in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;iconbar possibly influential&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iconbar.com/articles/Influential/index1152.html | title=An arbitrary number of possibly influential RISC OS things | work=[[The Icon Bar]] | date=2007-03-23 | accessdate=September 27, 2011 | author=Mellor, Phil | quote=Admittedly it wasn't until RISC OS Select was released, almost 10 years later, that the standard Acorn applications (Draw, Edit, and Paint) implemented the style guide's clipboard recommendations, but most products followed it with care.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
