'''''Virtua Tennis''''' ('''''Power Smash''''' in Japan) is a series of [[tennis]] simulation video games started in 1999 by [[Sega-AM3]]. The player competes through tennis tournaments and various arcade modes. For the home console market the game was expanded with the introduction of the campaign mode. The latest games in the series are available on all major consoles, starting with [[Virtua Tennis 3]].

==Name changes==
===Domestic changes===
Domestically in Japan the series have always been released as '''Power Smash''' although with the third entry in the series the name was expanded to ''Sega Professional Tennis: Power Smash'', although Sega Professional Tennis logo and name have been prominently featured in all the games, it was only in the title of the third game.
Once Sega sold the 2k2 name to [[Take 2]]&lt;ref&gt;Take 2 Article on Wikipedia &amp; Sega's Article&lt;/ref&gt;, the triquel was released under the original branding as ''Virtua Tennis 3'' all updates and sequels have been under the Virtua label to date.

===Worldwide changes===
Internationally it was released as [[Virtua Tennis]], to fall in the same brand as other [[Sega Sports]] games such as [[Virtua Striker]], with the sequel the name was changed to  [[Tennis 2K2]] as at the time all Sega Sports games were being released as 2k2 such as [[NHL 2k2]], [[NBA 2k2]], [[NFL 2k2]] etc.

==Development==
===Main series===
====Inception and response====
The original game were developed for the [[Sega Naomi]] Arcade Hardware by [[Sega-AM3]] as a 2nd party studio under the label of [[Hitmaker]] and ported to the [[Sega Dreamcast]] Sega's home console based on the Naomi Hardware, the sequel [[Virtua Tennis 2]] was built over original home console build, there were several upgrades made to the game most notably Enhanced Graphics, More Courts, and a female roster (composed of 9 players) were introduced to the series featuring the likeness of [[Serena Williams]], [[Lindsay Davenport]] and even lesser known players such as [[Jelena DokiÄ]] (although Dokic was replaced with [[Ai Sugiyama]] a Japanese player in the PS2 port). The sequel was ported to the Playstation 2.

====The return====
The series disappeared for several years because of financial problems at Sega, in 2005 [[Sammy Corporation]] purchased majority shares of Sega from parent company [[CSK Holdings Corporation|CSK]] and merged the company with [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] and all 2nd party studios were absorbed back into Sega. Series helmer [[Hiaso Oguchi]] was promoted to President of all internal teams therefore he passed the torch of future development to [[Mie Kumagi]], however Oguchi remains involved as an executive producer for all games produced by the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kikizo.com/search/search_games.asp?qu=Mie%20Kumagai&amp;sc=/&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, after the studios had resettled into their new division, a new game entered development. In 2006, a new game in the series was released in the arcades for [[SEGA Lindbergh]] Arcade system. The game was ported to [[Playstation 3]] with [[SIXAXIS]] controls incorporated into the gameplay, but since the AM teams now have a diminished role in the home consumer department, the [[Xbox 360]] port was handled by [[Sumo Digital]], a studio that previously ported an upgraded version of Virtua Tennis 2.

====Continuation of the series====
At [[GamesCom]] 2010, Virtua Tennis 4 was revealed for the [[PlayStation 3]] with [[PlayStation Move]] controls incorporated, the series also introduced a new first person perspective to help players control the game more effectively with the MOVE controller, as of yet an Arcade release has not been announced a first for the main series.

===Updates &amp; spinoffs===
In 2001, Sega announced they will be making games for all platforms and made a deal with [[THQ]] that allowed them to make original games based on Sega IPs for the [[Game Boy Advance]], one of the many games included a [[Virtua Tennis]] GBA version.&lt;ref&gt;http://thq.com/segahub&lt;/ref&gt;
While the internal Sega teams were being shuffled due to Sega's financial problems, [[Sumo Digital]] was tasked with porting [[Virtua Tennis 2]] to the Playstation Portable and they released [[Virtua Tennis: World Tour]] in fall 2005, the game was an update to Power Smash 2 expanding the World Tour mode, however the character roaster was the smallest the series, has featured to date&lt;ref&gt;Virtua Tennis World Tour Wikipedia article has a roster list&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2008, while Sumo Digital was porting Virtua Tennis 3 for the Wii, they were instructed by Sega to feature Sonic as an Unlockable character, which gave Sumo Digital an idea to make a Tennis game composed of Sega characters Past and Present, the game was released under the [[Sega Superstars]] label, although it was running on the Virtua Tennis 3 engine, Sumo Digital developed for the Xbox 360 port.

In 2009 Sumo Digital released an update to Virtua Tennis 3 called [[Virtua Tennis 2009]].
