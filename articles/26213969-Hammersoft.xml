The company began its existence as '''Southwestern Bell Corporation''', one of seven [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] created in 1983 as part of the [[Bell System Divestiture|break-up of the original AT&amp;T]] due to the ''[[United States v. AT&amp;T]]'' [[antitrust]] lawsuit. It changed its name to '''SBC Communications Inc.''' in 1995. In 2005, it purchased its former parent company, [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T Corporation]], and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself ''AT&amp;T Inc.'' and using the iconic AT&amp;T logo and stock-trading symbol.

== History ==
=== 1984â1995: Southwestern Bell Corporation ===
American Telephone and Telegraph Company officially transferred full ownership of Southwestern Bell Telephone Company to Southwestern Bell Corporation on January 1, 1984. It had three other subsidiaries: Southwestern Bell Publications, Inc., a directory publisher; Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc., in the business of mobile telephone service; and Southwestern Bell Telecommunications, Inc., focusing on marketing phone equipment to business customers. The holding companies' new president was Zane Edison Barnes.

[[Image:Southwestern_Bell_logo_(1984).png|thumb|upright|Southwestern Bell Corporation logo, 1992-1995]]

In 1987, SBC bought Metromedia Inc.'s cellular and paging business. This in turn boosted the company to third largest cellular-communications company in the United States; behind McCaw Cellular and Pacific Telesis. In January 1990 [[Ed Whitacre|Edward Whitacre]] took over as president of Southwestern Bell. The Headquarters was moved from [[St. Louis]] to [[San Antonio]], Texas in February 1993. It acquired 2 cable companies in [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]] from Hauser Communications for 650 million dollars, becoming the first regional Bell telephone company to acquire a cable company outside of its service area. In 1994 they called off a $1.6&amp;nbsp;billion acquisition attempt for 40 percent of [[Cox Communications|Cox Cable]] due to FCC rules on cable companies. SBC would later start selling its current cable company interests.

=== 1995â2000: Changes in the company ===
[[File:SBC Communications logo.svg|thumb|upright|SBC Communications logo, 2001-2005]]&lt;!--Keep the logo there! A rationale was made for it's use here!--&gt;
In 1995 Southwestern Bell Corp. became SBC Communications. They then combined Southwestern Bell Telecom division (which made telephone equipment) into the company, due to new FCC rules.

In 1996 SBC announced it would acquire Pacific Telesis Group, a [[Regional Bell Operating Company]] (RBOC) in California and Nevada. 1997 brought rumors of a proposed merger between AT&amp;T Corporation (the USA's largest long distance provider) and SBC (the USA's largest local provider). The FCC disapproved of the merger, and it came to end. Later in 1997 SBC sold its last two cable companies, exiting the cable telecom field.

January 1998, SBC announced it would take over Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. (SNET) for $4.4&amp;nbsp;billion in stock (the FCC would approve in October 1998). SBC also won a court judgment that would make it easier for RBOCs to enter the long distance phone service, but it was being challenged by AT&amp;T and the FCC. May 1998 Ameritech and SBC announced a $62&amp;nbsp;billion dollar merger, in which SBC would take over Ameritech. After making several organizational changes (such as the sale of [[Ameritech Cellular|Ameritech Wireless]] to [[GTE]]) to satisfy state and federal regulators, the two merged on October 8, 1999. The FCC later fined SBC Communications $6&amp;nbsp;million for failure to comply with agreements made in order to secure approval of the merger. SBC became the largest RBOC until the [[Bell Atlantic]] and GTE merger. 1998 revenues were $46&amp;nbsp;billion, placing SBC among the top 15 companies in the [[Fortune 500]].

January 1999 SBC announced it would purchase Comcast Cellular, for $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion, plus $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion of debt. During 1999 SBC continued to prepare to be allowed to provide long distance phone service. February SBC acquired up to ten percent of Williams Companies' telecommunications division for about $500&amp;nbsp;million, who was building a fiber optic network across the country and would carry SBC's future service. On November 1, 1999, SBC became a part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].

In 2002, SBC ended marketing its operating companies under different names, and simply opted to give its companies different [[doing business as]] names based on the state (a practice already in use by [[Ameritech]] since 1993), and it gave the holding companies it had purchased [[d/b/a]] names based on their general region.

[[File:Lockup.svg|thumb|left|SBC-AT&amp;T legacy transition logo, used 2005â2006]]

On January 31, 2005, SBC announced that it would purchase [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] for more than US$16&amp;nbsp;billion. The announcement came almost eight years after SBC and AT&amp;T (also known as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp.) called off their first merger talks and nearly a year after initial merger talks between AT&amp;T Corp. and [[BellSouth]] fell apart. AT&amp;T stockholders meeting in Denver, approved the merger on June 30, 2005. The [[U.S. Department of Justice]] cleared the merger on October 27, 2005, and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] approved it on October 31, 2005.

The merger was finalized on November 18, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New AT&amp;T Launches |publisher=AT&amp;T |date=November 18, 2005 |url=http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=21906 |accessdate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the completion of the merger, SBC Communications adopted the AT&amp;T branding, and changed its corporate name to '''AT&amp;T Inc.''' to differentiate the company from the former AT&amp;T Corporation. On December 1, 2005, the merged company's [[New York Stock Exchange]] [[ticker symbol]] was changed from &quot;SBC&quot; to the traditional &quot;T&quot; used by AT&amp;T.

The new AT&amp;T updated the former AT&amp;T's graphic logo (a new &quot;marble&quot; took over the &quot;Death Star&quot;); however the existing AT&amp;T [[sound trademark]] (voiced by [[Pat Fleet]]) continues to be used.

On Friday December 29, 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approved the new AT&amp;T's acquisition of a [[regional Bell Operating Company]], [[BellSouth]], valued at approximately $86&amp;nbsp;billion (or 1.325 shares of AT&amp;T for each share of BellSouth at the close of trading December 29, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vorman |first=Julie |title=AT&amp;T closes $86&amp;nbsp;billion BellSouth deal |agency=Reuters   |date=December 29, 2006 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSWBT00636120070102 |accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new combined company retained the name AT&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bartash |first=Jeffry |coauthors=Jonathan Burton |title=AT&amp;T to pay $67&amp;nbsp;billion for BellSouth |publisher=Dow Jones Market Watch |date=March 5, 2006 |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid={6E4D6E93-004F-4938-9692-B2704970428B}&amp;siteid=mktw&amp;dist= |accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal consolidated ownership of both [[AT&amp;T Mobility|Cingular Wireless]] and [[Yellowpages.com]], once joint ventures between BellSouth and AT&amp;T.

=== 2007â2008 restructuring ===
==== Transition to new media ====
[[File:Att building LA.jpg|thumb|right|The [[AT&amp;T Switching Center]] in downtown Los Angeles.]]

In June 2007, AT&amp;T's new chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson, discussed how wireless services are the core of &quot;The New AT&amp;T&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AT&amp;T's new chief dialed in |date=June 24, 2007 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-sun_front_0624jun24,0,3337832.story?track=rss | first=K C | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; With declining sales of traditional home phone lines, AT&amp;T plans to roll out various new media such as [[AT&amp;T Mobility|Video Share]], [[U-verse]], and to extend its reach in [[broadband Internet access|high speed Internet]] into rural areas across the country. AT&amp;T announced on June 29, 2007, however, that it was acquiring [[Dobson Cellular|Dobson Communications]]. It was then reported on October 2, 2007 that AT&amp;T would purchase Interwise{{Clarify|date=November 2008}} for $121&amp;nbsp;million, which it completed on November 2, 2007. On October 9, 2007, AT&amp;T purchased 12&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum in the prime 700&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum band from privately held [[Aloha Partners]] for nearly $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion; the deal was approved by the FCC on February 4, 2008. On December 4, 2007 AT&amp;T announced plans to acquire [[Edge Wireless]], a regional [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] carrier in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AT&amp;T Buys Edge Wireless |date=December 4, 2007 |publisher=[[Phone Scoop]] |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |url=http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=2569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edge Wireless acquisition was completed in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AT&amp;T completes buy out of Edge Wireless |date=April 18, 2008 |publisher=[[American City Business Journals]] |accessdate=July 26, 2008 |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/stories/2008/04/14/daily37.html |first=San |last=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Job cuts ====

On December 4, 2008, AT&amp;T announced they would be cutting 12,000 jobs due to &quot;economic pressures, a changing business mix and a more streamlined organizational structure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Job cuts mount as year-end nears|publisher=AT&amp;T|date=December 4, 2008 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/04/news/companies/ATNT/index.htm?postversion=2008120409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe]], Centennialâs largest stockholder, has agreed to vote in support of this transaction. In an attempt to quell regulators, on May 9, 2009 AT&amp;T entered an agreement with [[Verizon Wireless]] to sell off certain existing Centennial service areas in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi for $240&amp;nbsp;million pending the successful merger of AT&amp;T and Centennial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =AT&amp;T Agrees to Sell Certain Centennial Communications Corp.

Reaction to the announced merger has generated both support as well as opposition among various groups and communities.

The merger has garnered support from a wide number of civil rights, environmental, and business organizations. These include the [[NAACP]], [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], [[GLAAD|Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD)]], League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), and the [[Sierra Club]].&lt;ref name=OnCall&gt;{{cite web|last=German|first=Kent|title=On Call: Civil rights groups line up behind AT&amp;T-T-Mobile merger|url=http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20070630-85/on-call-civil-rights-groups-line-up-behind-at-t-t-mobile-merger/?tag=mncol;txt|work=CNET|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Labor organizations such as the [[AFL-CIO]], [[Teamsters]], and the [[Communications Workers of America]] also voiced support for the merger.  These organizations point to AT&amp;T's commitment to labor, social, and environmental standards. Many of these organizations have also cited how the merger is likely to accelerate 4G wireless deployment, thus helping underserved communities such as rural areas and disadvantaged urban communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnCall&quot; /&gt; According to the NAACP, the merger will &quot;advance increased access to affordable and sustainable wireless broadband services and in turn stimulate job creation and civic engagement throughout our country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnCall&quot; /&gt;

As of August 2 the governors of 26 states have written letters supporting the merger.&lt;ref name=States&gt;{{cite web|last=German|first=Kent|title=States weigh in on AT&amp;T-T-Mobile merger|url=http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20070911-85/states-weigh-in-on-at-t-t-mobile-merger/?tag=mncol;txt|work=CNET|accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27 the attorneys general of Utah, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming sent a joint letter of support to the FCC.&lt;ref name=&quot;States&quot; /&gt; As of August 2011 state regulatory agencies in Arizona and Louisiana have approved the acquisition.

A diverse group of industry and public-interest organizations are opposed to AT&amp;T's merger with T-Mobile. Consumer groups including [[Public Knowledge]], [[Consumers Union]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] and the [[Media Access Project]] are publicly opposed to AT&amp;T merger. These groups have influence with Democrats at the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and in Congress. These organizations fear that the merger will raise prices and stifle innovation by consolidating so much of the wireless industry in one company.  Free Press and Public Knowledge have started letter-writing campaigns against the deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=T-Mobile, AT&amp;T merger to draw torrent of opposition|author=Sara Jerome |newspaper=The Hill |date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet companies are generally skeptical of the merger because it leaves them with fewer counter-parties to negotiate with for getting their content and applications to customers. The AT&amp;T merger might leave them dependent on just two, AT&amp;T and [[Verizon]]. The [[Computer &amp; Communication Industry Association]] (CCIA), which counts [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]] and [[eBay]] among its members, is opposed to the merger. &quot;A deal like this, if not blocked on antitrust grounds, is of deep concern to all the innovative businesses that build everything from apps to handsets. It would be hypocritical for our nation to talk about unleashing innovation on one hand and then stand by as threats to innovation like this are proposed,&quot; said Ed Black, head of CCIA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill&quot;/&gt;

On April 21, 2011, AT&amp;T defended its proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA before a U.S. Senate committee, saying the combined company will deliver high-speed wireless services to 97 percent of Americans and provide consumer benefits such as fewer dropped calls.&lt;ref&gt; Declan McCullagh, CNET. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-20061889-94.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 AT&amp;T defends T-Mobile deal to U.S. Senate].&quot; May 11, 2011.

If AT&amp;T's acquisition of T-Mobile USA is rejected by federal regulators, AT&amp;T would need to pay $6&amp;nbsp;billion, including $3&amp;nbsp;billion in cash, to T-Mobile USA's parent company Deutsche Telekom.&lt;ref&gt; Don Reisinger, CNET. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20062527-17.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20 Report: AT&amp;T pays $6B if T-Mobile deal fails].&quot; May 13, 2011.

On November 30, 2011, the FCC allowed AT&amp;T to withdraw their merger, saving both carriers from divulging documentation about internal operations. The FCC cited job loss and higher consumer prices as reasons to deny the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shields |first=Todd |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/fcc-allows-at-t-to-withdraw-merger-application.html |title=FCC Allows AT&amp;T to Withdraw Merger Application |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversies ==
=== Contributions to political campaigns ===

According to the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], AT&amp;T is the US' second largest donor to political campaigns, having contributed more than US$ 36 million since 1990, 56% and 44% of which went to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] recipients, respectively. A key political issue for AT&amp;T is the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AT&amp;T Inc |publisher=The Center For Responsive Politics |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.asp?ID=D000000076&amp;Name=AT%26T+Inc |accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, AT&amp;T was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Drinkard |title=Donors get good seats, great access this week |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-16-inauguration-donors_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=January 17, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Financing the inauguration |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-16-inaugural-donors_x.htm |work=USA Today |date= January 16, 2005|accessdate=May 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Some question inaugural's multi-million price tag |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-14-price_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=January 14, 2005 |accessdate=May 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wireless service ===

AT&amp;T has received criticisms for its wireless services. In December 2010, [[Consumer Reports]] named AT&amp;T as the worst wireless provider in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Consumer Reports Names AT&amp;T Worst Wireless Service Provider |url=http://techland.time.com/2010/12/06/consumer-reports-names-att-worst-wireless-service-provider/ |work=Time |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=December 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Censorship  ===

In August 2009, the band [[Pearl Jam]] performed in Chicago at [[Lollapalooza]] which was being web-broadcast by AT&amp;T. The band, while playing the song &quot;Daughter&quot;, started playing a version of [[Pink Floyd]]'s &quot;[[Another Brick in the Wall]]&quot; but with altered lyrics critical of president George Bush. These lyrics included &quot;George Bush, leave this world alone!&quot; and, &quot;George Bush, find yourself another home!&quot;. Listeners to AT&amp;T's web broadcast heard only the first line because the rest was censored,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grossberg |first=Josh |title=AT&amp;T's Pearl Jamming? |publisher=E Online |date=August 9, 2007 |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=4de684ae-62eb-4b23-984c-d07ce72ea5e2 |accessdate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although AT&amp;T spokesman Michael Coe said that the silencing was &quot;a mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Michelle |title=AT&amp;T: Pearl Jam edit a mistake |agency=Associated Press |date=August 10, 2007 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003829996_pearljam10.html?syndication=rss |accessdate=September 29, 2007 | work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy controversy ===

[[File:SER klein exhibits.djvu|thumb|page=9|Diagram of how alleged wiretapping worked. From [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] court filings&lt;ref name=kleinex/&gt;]]

{{further|[[NSA call database]], [[Mark Klein]], [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]], [[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]}}

In 2006, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] lodged a [[class action]] lawsuit, ''[[Hepting v. AT&amp;T]]'', which alleged that AT&amp;T had allowed agents of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&amp;T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. AT&amp;T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, a retired former AT&amp;T technician, [[Mark Klein]], lodged an [[affidavit]] supporting this allegation.&lt;ref&gt;Nakashima, Ellen, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/07/AR2007110700006_pf.html &quot;A Story of Surveillance&quot;], [[Washington Post]], November 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Singel |first= Ryan |title=Whistle-Blower Outs NSA Spy Room |publisher=Wired |date=April 7, 2006 |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70619 |accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] has stated they will intervene in this lawsuit by means of [[State Secrets Privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Government Moves to Intervene in AT&amp;T Surveillance Case |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) |date=April 28, 2006 |url=http://www.eff.org/news/archives/2006_04.php#004613 |accessdate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California â in which the suit was filed â rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss, which invoked the State Secrets Privilege, had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and AT&amp;T would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
&lt;ref&gt;U-verse&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the [[National Security Agency]] by AT&amp;T, [[Verizon]], SBC, and [[BellSouth]] for the purpose of creating a massive [[NSA call database|calling database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cauley |first=Leslie |title=NSA has massive database of Americans' phone calls |work=USA Today |date=May 11, 2006 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm |accessdate=September 29, 2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of the ''new'' AT&amp;T that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18, 2005 were not mentioned.

On June 21, 2006, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reported that AT&amp;T had rewritten rules on their privacy policy. The policy, which took effect June 23, 2006, says that &quot;''AT&amp;T â not customers â owns customers' confidential info and can use it 'to protect its legitimate business interests, safeguard others, or respond to legal process.'

On August 22, 2007, National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell confirmed that AT&amp;T was one of the telecommunications companies that assisted with the government's warrantless wire-tapping program on calls between foreign and domestic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shrader |first=Katherine |title=Spy Chief Reveals Classified Surveillance Details |agency=Associated Press |date=August 22, 2007 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20396282/ |accessdate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2007, [[Mark Klein]], a former AT&amp;T technician, told [[Keith Olbermann]] of MSNBC that all Internet traffic passing over AT&amp;T lines was copied into a locked room at the company's San Francisco office â to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Olbermann |first=Keith |title=Whistleblower Saw AT&amp;T Assist Bush Administration |publisher=MSNBC |date=November 8, 2007 |url=http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-US&amp;brand=msnbc&amp;vid=297abdd5-d0dc-4617-a6c9-c482fa316b59 |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property filtering ===

In January 2008, the company reported plans to begin filtering all [[Internet traffic]] which passes through its network for intellectual property violations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Commentators in the media have speculated that if this plan is implemented, it would lead to a mass exodus of subscribers leaving AT&amp;T,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22829568/ |title=AT&amp;T's Proposed Filtering Policy Is Bad News â Netiquette â MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-01-25 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is misleading as Internet traffic may go through the company's network anyway.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;  Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for government-mandated [[network neutrality]].

=== Discrimination against local Public-access television channels ===

AT&amp;T is accused by [[community media]] groups of discriminating against local [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) cable TV channels:, by &quot;imposing unfair restrictions that will severely restrict the audience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn10&quot;&gt;(March 9, 2009) [http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/9/at_t_accused_of_discriminating_against &quot;AT&amp;T Accused of Discriminating Against Local Public Access Channels, Deadline for Public Comment Expires Tonight&quot;], [[Democracy Now!]], retrieved on March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barbara Popovic, Executive Director of the Chicago public-access service [[Chicago Access Network Television|CAN-TV]], the new AT&amp;T [[U-verse]] system forces all [[Public-access television]] into a special menu system, denying normal functionality such as channel numbers, access to the standard [[program guide]], and [[digital video recording|DVR]] recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn10&quot;/&gt;  The Ratepayer Advocates division of the [[California Public Utilities Commission]] reported: &quot;Instead of putting the stations on individual channels, AT&amp;T has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dn10&quot;/&gt;

Sue Buske (president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers/[[Alliance for Community Media]]) argue that this is &quot;an overall attack [...] on public access across the [United States], the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn10&quot;/&gt;

=== Information security ===

In June 2010, a [[hacker group]] known as [[Goatse Security]] discovered a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] within the AT&amp;T that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of AT&amp;T 3G service for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title='Brute force' script snatched iPad e-mail addresses |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=[[Computerworld]] |date=June 10, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177921/_Brute_force_script_snatched_iPad_e_mail_addresses |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld2-2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=iPad e-mail hackers defend attack as 'ethical' |page=2 |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=[[Computerworld]] |date=June 11, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177991/iPad_e_mail_hackers_defend_attack_as_ethical_?taxonomyId=17&amp;pageNumber=2 |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a script, Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld1&quot;/&gt; Goatse Security informed AT&amp;T about the security flaw through a third party.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld2-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=iPad e-mail hackers defend attack as 'ethical' |page=1 |first=Gregg |last=Keizer |newspaper=[[Computerworld]] |date=June 11, 2010 |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9177991/iPad_e_mail_hackers_defend_attack_as_ethical_ |accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goatse Security then disclosed around 114,000 of these emails to [[Gawker Media]], which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in ''[[Valleywag]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld2-1&quot;/&gt; Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as &quot;poorly designed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld1&quot;/&gt;
