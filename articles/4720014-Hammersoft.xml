'''John Ogwen''' (born 25 April 1944) is a [[Wales|Welsh]] actor.

Best known to British audiences for his starring role in the 1978 drama series ''Hawkmoor'', and appearances in the [[television]] series ''[[The District Nurse]]'' and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', Ogwen has been a stalwart of [[Welsh language]] television and film since the early 1970s.  He has also written plays, presented documentary series and recorded readings of Welsh-language works. 

In 2004 he was awarded a BAFTA Cymru Special Award for his contribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bafta-cymru.org.uk/english/awards/awards.php?year=2003&amp;page=8 BAFTA Cymru Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born and raised in Sling, [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], [[North Wales]], and studied English and Welsh at [[Bangor University]].  When told, &quot;You'll have to make up your mind whether you want to be a nationalist or an actor&quot;, he replied, &quot;I'll be a bit of both.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/gogleddorllewin/enwogion/adloniant/pages/johnogwen.shtml  Profile on BBC Cymru site (in Welsh)]&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a keen interest in football, and played as a striker for [[Bangor City F.C.]] when still in the 6th Form at school.  Today he is a keen [[Everton F.C.]] supporter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cymru/gogleddorllewin/enwogion/adloniant/pages/johnogwen.shtml  Profile on BBC Cymru site (in Welsh)]&lt;/ref&gt;
