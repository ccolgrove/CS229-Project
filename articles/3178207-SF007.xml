'''JWM''' (Joe's Window Manager) is a lightweight [[stacking window manager]] for the [[X Window System]] written by Joe Wingbermuehle. JWM is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and uses only [[Xlib]] at a minimum.  Support for the following can be added as [[compile-time]] options:
*[[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[JPG]] and [[XPM (image format)|XPM]] icons
*[[Xft]]
*[[Xinerama]]
*FriBidi
*The [[Shape extension]]

It provides an interface similar to [[Windows 98]] with a modern-looking appearance and it can support some [[GNOME]], [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] and [[EWMH|Extended Window Manager Hints]].

JWM is the default window manager used in [[Damn Small Linux]] version 4.x, [[Puppy Linux]] and [[SliTaz GNU/Linux]] (&lt; 2.0).
