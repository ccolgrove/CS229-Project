In [[railroad terminology]] a '''Roadrailer''' or '''RoadRailer''' is a highway [[trailer (Vehicle)|trailer]], or [[semi-trailer]], that is specially equipped for use in railroad [[intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] service. 

== Overview ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Amtrak Mark V RoadRailer - tailgate end.jpg|thumb|{{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 11 August 2011}} The tailgate end of an [[Amtrak]] Mark V &quot;RoadRailer&quot; in [[Winslow, Arizona]] in March, 1999. The unit can travel at speeds of up to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in either direction.]] --&gt;

The advantage of using roadrailers is that due to their construction, the trailers can be pulled directly behind other freight (or even passenger) equipment without the use of trailer [[flatcar]]s.

Roadrailers first appeared on [[United States|American]] railroads in the 1950s. The [[Semi-trailer|trailers]] were built with integrated railroad [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]] that could be lowered into position when the trailer was pulled behind a train.  More modern roadrailers do not include integrated railroad wheels, but ride on [[Bogie|regular trucks]] that do double-duty, serving as articulation points between multiple trailers in a train. Each [[Bogie|regular truck]] is equipped with two [[Fifth wheel coupling|fifth wheels]] and at one end (or both ends) of a convoy there is an adaptor truck equipped with one fifth wheel and one regular [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] Type &quot;E&quot; or [[Tightlock coupler|Type &quot;F&quot;]] [[AAR coupler|automatic coupler]]. Each semi-trailer has one [[Fifth wheel coupling|king pin]] at each end. Because the truck (bogie) is significantly lighter than a rail [[flatcar]] or [[Well car|well-car]], roadrailer freight trains are much lighter and therefore are more energy efficient than traditional intermodal trains. 

RoadRailers were built by the Bi-Modal Corporations in the early 1980's located in West Chester Pennsylvania.  The trailiers were built by the Budd Corporation locally with the integration of the [[wheelset (rail transport)|wheelsets]] and [[Railway brake|railroad braking]] system done at the nearby Bi-Modal factory.  This was a modern up-date of C&amp;Oâs Railvan used in the 1950âs.  The railroad wheelsets attached to the aft portion of the trailer were lowed pneumatically by activating a simple valve controller on the left rear of the trailer. To transfer from highway mode to rail mode the trailer driver would position the trailer over tracks inlayed into a paved rail yard.  First the operator would activate the valve to remove the air from the airbags that supported the trailer in the highway mode.  In the fully lowered or squat position, hooks which held the railwheel set up above the road surface released.  Then the operator would move the valve to inflate the two large airbags used for rail mode.  These rail air bags were similar to those used in passenger rail cars at this time.  After being fully transferred, the trailer would be fully level and ready for connection to the next trailer in the train. A similar system was trialed in the UK, though the concept did not prove successful, partly due to the reduction in load volume required to fit inside the UK's smaller [[Loading gauge#Great Britain|loading gauge]].

Throughout the early 1980âs various railroads experimented with the RoadRailer concept to determine if the equipment would be durable enough to endure railroad use.  The positive attributes of the RoadRailer were its exceptionally smooth ride, light weight and low capital costs to set-up a rail yard.  Since no flatcars were involved, no crane systems were needed to transfer the trailers between modes.  In fact during one demonstration test a train of RoadRailers was broken down in the middle of an industrial street in Portland Oregon which happened to have track in the street demonstrating the flexibility of the system.  Another note was that a RoadRailer train did not have a caboose car which at the time was still required for freight trains.  A simple box was designed with a yellow strobe light designed to be installed in the unused coupler of the last car.  Later, as cabooses were phased out, railroads today use a similar strobe to mark the end of the train.

In 1982, Conrail operated a route between (Railports) Buffalo, Rochester and Highbridge New York in the Bronx called the Empire State Xpress operated by Bi-Modal subsidiary Road-Rail Transportation Company.  The concept was to offer customers rapid freight service that would be competitive with traditional over the road service.  Dedicated trains left Buffalo and Highbridge each evening arriving early the next morning.  The line was eventually shut down after never establishing enough key customers to utilize the service.

The primary reason that the original RoadRailer concept did not catch on was the weight penalty imposed on the trailers because of the attached railroad wheelset.   This was resolved in later designs which removed the integrated wheelset by having a dedicated rail bogie assembly that stayed in the rail yard as seen today.

Triple Crown still uses  them, their photo is used in this article, the &quot;TCSZ&quot;  on the trailer is for Triple Crown Service.
The trailer number beginning with 464 indicates that  the trailer was built approximately 1999-2002, and weighs only {{convert|1000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} more than a regular highway only trailer.

== Model versions ==
In the 1960s, a fully functioning OO-scale model RoadRailer was manufactured by British toymaker [[Lines Bros Ltd#Model road vehicles|Lines Brothers]] as part of their 'Minic Motorways' range. This allowed the trailer to be remotely coupled and uncoupled from a railway bogey and/or a road tractor unit.  Today, Bowser makes an HO model of the current RoadRailer in kit form and the couplermate to connect the locomotive to the trailers. DeLuxe Innovations makes an N scale ready to run model of the RoadRailer trailer and CouplerMate as well.

There are also models of the maintenance roadrailers.

== Used in ==
[[Image:Trailerail.jpg|thumb|[[Australian National Railways Commission|Australian National]] operated Roadrailers under the ''[[Trailerail]]'' brand.]]

Roadrailers have been used in:
* [[United States]] and still are.
* [[United Kingdom]] around the 1960s.
* [[Australia]] in the 1980s and 1990s.still used today.
* [[Austria]]
* [[Brazil]]

== Maintenance vehicle ==

Maintenance vehicles from trucks to cranes are often fitted with both road and rail wheels.  The rail wheels are raised when the vehicle operates on the road.  Both wheels are lowered when operating on rail, as the rubber tyres tyred road wheels are used for traction.  The rail wheels are very small and limit the speed on rail to low speeds.

The road-rail vehicles are often fitted with a turntable so that they can drive off the road at 90 degrees to the direction of the tracks, then turn in the direction of the tracks.
