In 2010, Dougie and three other people, including [[Motion In The Ocean]] and [[Radio:ACTIVE]] producer [[Jason Perry]], started a clothing line called 'Zukie' It was apparently named after Dougie's pet lizard. Dougie owns 30 per cent of the business.

The range was set to launch in February. From November to December 2011, Dougie Poynter took part and won series 11 of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here on ITV1, after being strongly persuaded by best friend and former winner Matt Willis, formerly of Busted.
