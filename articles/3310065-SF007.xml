'''Banshee''' is an [[Open source software|open-source]] [[Media player (application software)|media player]], called Sonance until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://git.gnome.org/cgit/banshee/commit/?id=37cd82bf9c14d8217257ccd7901b985fed2518f9 Banshee rename git commit]&lt;/ref&gt; Built upon [[Mono (software)|Mono]] and [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]], it uses the [[GStreamer]] multimedia platform for encoding and decoding various media formats, including [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[MP3]] and [[FLAC]]. Banshee can play and import audio [[Compact Disc|CD]]s and supports many portable media players, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iPod]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[List of Android devices|devices]] and [[Creative Technology|Creative's]] [[Creative ZEN|ZEN]] players.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.gnome.org/users/banshee/1.8/sync.html.en&lt;/ref&gt; Other features include [[Last.fm]] integration, album artwork fetching, smart playlists and podcast support. Banshee is released under the terms of the [[MIT License]]. Stable versions are available for many [[Linux]] [[Linux distribution | distributions]], as well as a beta preview for [[Mac OS X]] and an alpha preview for [[Windows]].

==Plugins==
Using a plugin-capable architecture, Banshee is highly extensible and customizable. Current stable plugins include:
*Audioscrobbler: Adds the capability of reporting played songs to a user's [[Last.fm]] playlist, and play last.fm radio stations (user's library, tags, similar to, etc.).
*[[Digital Audio Access Protocol|DAAP]] music sharing: Allows sharing of music libraries with [[iTunes]] and other DAAP-compatible music software. The current version of Banshee is only partially compatible with iTunes 7, allowing iTunes to open a Banshee library, but not vice-versa.
*iPod manager: Allows the transferring of songs, videos, and album art to and from the device.
*Metadata searcher using [[Musicbrainz]]: Automatically retrieves missing and supplementary metadata for library items, including album art.
*Music Recommendations using [[Last.fm]]: Recommends music based on the currently playing song.
*Mini-Mode plugin: Provides a small window with minimal playback controls and song information.
*Multimedia keys support in [[GNOME]]: Banshee can be controlled via multimedia keys as configured through GNOME.
*Notification Area Icon: Adds an icon to the notification area in GNOME.
*Podcasting: Enables Banshee to subscribe to podcast feeds, which are updated on a regular basis. There is also a &quot;Find new podcasts&quot; feature which utilises [http://www.podcastalley.com Podcast Alley].
*Radio: Provides support for streaming Internet radio stations.

==Cross-platform support==
Compared to the Linux builds, which have stable releases, the Mac OS X builds are considered beta quality, and Windows builds are alpha quality.

The first alpha release of Banshee on Windows was Banshee 1.9.4, released on February 23, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgo#641690 Comment #4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641690#c4 |title=bgo#641690 Comment #4 |publisher=Gnome Bugzilla}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabriel Burt, Twitter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/gabaug/status/39113347198758912 |title=Gabriel Burt, Twitter |publisher=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG!Ubuntu!
