'''Nickelodeon''', often simply called '''Nick''' and originally named '''Pinwheel''', is an [[United States|American]] [[children's television|children's channel]] owned by [[MTV Networks]], a subsidiary of [[Viacom International]]. The channel is primarily aimed at children ages 7â17, with the exception of their weekday morning program block aimed at preschoolers ages 2â6. Since 2006, Nickelodeon has been run by MTVN Kids &amp; Family Group President [[Cyma Zarghami]]. It is ranked as the #1 cable channel as of 2011,&lt;ref name=tvbythenumbers&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=Nickelodeon Scores Its Most-Watched Second Quarter Ever|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/06/29/nickelodeon-scores-its-most-watched-second-quarter-ever/55673/|publisher=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=2011-10-03|date=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been promoted as &quot;The First Kids' Network,&quot; as it was the first American television network aimed at children since the Pinwheel days.

Nickelodeon's broadcast day runs on Sundays from 6 a.m.- 8 p.m., Monday-Fridays from 7 a.m.-9 p.m., and Saturdays from 6 a.m.-10 p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]]). Since 1985, it shares its channel space with [[Nick at Nite]], a night time channel that airs sitcom reruns during the interim hours. It is treated as a separate channel from Nickelodeon by [[A.C. Nielsen Co.]] for ratings purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Multichannel.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/79731-Nielsen_s_51_Solution_Nixes_Nicks.php |title=Nielsenâs 51% Solution Nixes Nicks - 2004-07-19 00:00:00 &amp;#124; Multichannel News |publisher=Multichannel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/25/business/fi-nick25 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Nickelodeon Squeezes 2 Ratings Out of 1 Very Diverse Network | first=Scott | last=Collins | date=March 25, 2004 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two services are sometimes referred to under the collective name &quot;Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite&quot;, due to their association as two individual channels sharing the same channel space.

==History==
===Early history (1977â1979)===
Nickelodeon's pre-history began on December 1, 1977 when [[QUBE]], the first two-way interactive cable TV system was launched in [[Columbus, Ohio]] by [[Warner Cable]] (owned by Warner Communications, and an ancestor of [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]]). One of the specialized channels available to subscribers of the QUBE system was Pinwheel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-visions.com/itv-qube.html |title=iTV &amp;#124; Warner's Qube |publisher=Media Visions |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a cable channel offering children's programming.

===Relaunch as Nickelodeon and national expansion (1979â1990)===
Pinwheel was re-launched as Nickelodeon on April 1, 1979, and despite its prior history on the QUBE system under the Pinwheel name, Nickelodeon has declared that 1979 is the network's official launch year. It began airing on various Warner Cable systems, beginning in [[Buffalo, New York]] and quickly expanded its audience reach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23112505.html Jay Bobbin. &quot;Nickelodeon 20th Birthday from Green Slime to Prime Time, The Kids Network Celebrates with Lots of Special Events&quot;], ''[[Buffalo News]]'', June 20, 1999.

In 1980, new shows were added to the lineup, including ''[[Dusty's Treehouse]]'', ''First Row Features'', ''Special Delivery'', ''[[What Will They Think Of Next?]]'', ''Livewire'', and ''[[Hocus Focus (TV series)|Hocus Focus]]''.

[[Image:Nickelodeon 1982.svg|225px|thumb|right|The third Nickelodeon logo, used from 1981 to October 1984.]]
The network's first logo had a mime looking into a Nickelodeon machine that was placed in the N. In between [[television program]]s, the filler would be a mime, and the mime would turn the crank on the Nickelodeon as soon as the next program was about to start. As the channel signed off for the night, Star Channel (later [[The Movie Channel]]) would take over the channel space; this ended when ARTS launched. The second logo had the word &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; in Pinwheel's logo font. The third logo was a silver pinball with the &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; title in multicolor. Nickelodeon's first popular [[children's television series]] was ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]'', a Canadian sketch comedy that made its American debut on Nickelodeon in late 1981. On April 12, 1981, the channel extended its hours from 8 a.m.-9 p.m. ET by turning its channel over to the [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] (ARTS) and, later until 1985, [[A&amp;E Network]] after ARTS merged with NBC's struggling cable service The Entertainment Channel.

In 1983, Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment began divesting its assets and spun off Nickelodeon and two other channels, MTV and the now-defunct Radio Television Station (RTS) into the newly-formed subsidiary; in order to increase revenue, Nickelodeon began to accept PBS-style corporate underwriting for its programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dudes&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DA1539F932A15753C1A966958260&amp;pagewanted=2 TELEVISION; Hey There, Dudes, the Kids Have Grabbed a Network], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 21, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The green slime originally featured on ''You Can't Do That On Television'' was then adopted by the channel as a primary feature of many of its shows, including ''[[Double Dare (1986 game show)|Double Dare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Video: Letting Kids Just Be Kids Nickelodeon|work= Time|date=December 26, 1988|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956599,00.html|accessdate=2010-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, other shows such as ''[[Livewire (talk show)|Livewire]]'', ''[[Standby: Lights, Camera, Action]]'', ''[[The Third Eye (TV series)|The Third Eye]]'' and ''[[Mr. Wizard's World]]'' were part of the regular Nickelodeon time slots.

The channel struggled at first, having lost $4 million by 1984, mostly due to a lack of successful programs including failed shows such as ''Against the Odds'' and ''[[Going Great]]'', and finishing dead last among the cable channels. After firing the previous staff, MTV Networks president [[Robert W. Pittman|Bob Pittman]] turned to [[Fred Seibert]] and [[Alan Goodman]], who created MTV's iconic IDs a few years earlier, to reinvigorate Nickelodeon. Seibert and Goodman's company, Fred/Alan (now [[Frederator]] Studios), teamed up with Tom Corey and Scott Nash of the advertising firm [[Corey McPherson Nash]] to replace the &quot;Pinball&quot; logo with the &quot;orange splat&quot; logo with the name Nickelodeon written in [[Balloon (typeface)|Balloon font]], that would be used in hundreds of different variations for the next quarter century. Fred/Alan also enlisted the help of animators, writers, producers and doo-wop group [[The Jive Five]] to create new channel IDs. Within six months of the rebranding, Nickelodeon would become the dominant channel in children programming and has remained so for more than 25 years, even in the midst of increasing competition in recent years from other kids-oriented cable channels such as [[Disney Channel]] and [[Cartoon Network]]. The same year as the rebrand, Nickelodeon began accepting traditional advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dudes&quot;/&gt;

In January 1985, after A&amp;E dropped its partnership with Nickelodeon and became its own 24-hour channel, Nickelodeon simply went to a test screen after sign-off. That July, Nickelodeon added a new nighttime block called [[Nick at Nite]], and became a 24/7 service. That same year, American Express sold their stake in Warner-Amex to Warner Communications and was renamed Warner Cable; by 1986, Warner Cable turned MTV Networks into a private company, and sold MTV, RTS, Nickelodeon and the new [[VH1]] network to Viacom for $685 million. In 1988, Nick aired the first annual [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] (previously known as The Big Ballot) and introduced [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]], an [[educational television]] block for younger children around preschool age. Nick Jr. was made to replace Nickelodeon's former preschool block, Pinwheel.

===Success in the 1990s and the 2000s (1990â2009)===
In 1990, Nickelodeon opened [[Nickelodeon Studios]], a television studio/attraction at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando]] which many of its sitcoms and game shows were filmed and entered into a multimillion-dollar joint marketing agreement with international restaurant chain [[Pizza Hut]], which provided ''[[Nickelodeon Magazine]]'' for free at participating Pizza Hut restaurants (which was put on hiatus for three years).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lewin | first = Tamar | title = Hey There, Dudes, the Kids Have Grabbed a Network | date = 1990-10-21 | work = [[The New York Times]] | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/21/arts/television-hey-there-dudes-the-kids-have-grabbed-a-network.html?pagewanted=2 | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Nickelodeon developed its first animated series, ''[[Doug]]'', ''[[Rugrats]]'', and ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]''. These series, known as [[Nicktoons]], premiered on August 11, 1991.&lt;ref name=nick1&gt;{{cite web| title = Nickelodeon to offer cartoons | date = 1991-08-10 | work = Victoria Advocate | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y4cLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WFYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4932,1889166&amp;dq=nickelodeon&amp;hl=en | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The network had previously refused to produce weekly animated series due to high cost.&lt;ref name=nick1/&gt;

The three Nicktoons found success by 1993, so Nickelodeon developed its fourth Nicktoon, ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which was also a success. Also, in March 1993, Nickelodeon ran out of shapes with which to display their iconic orange logo. Because of this, they enlisted the help of viewers everywhere in the USA to come up with new shapes to use for their television promos. The final results (which include the logo in 3D and in form of a cap, balloon, gear, rocket, top, etc.) began airing (along with their new TV promo presentation package) in late-June 1993. Later, Nickelodeon partnered with [[Sony Wonder]] and released top selling video cassettes of the network's programming until 1997. ''Doug'' and ''The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show'' would both end production about that time, but still would air reruns up until about 2001. However ''Doug'' would find success when Disney Channel picked it up and placed it on its new block. It was called [[ABC Kids (US)|Disney's One Saturday Morning]]. ''Rugrats'', on the other hand, returned from hiatus on May 9, 1997 (reruns continued to air up until that point). In 1998, ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]'' was released in theaters. The movie grossed more than $100 million in the United States and became the first non-Disney animated movie to ever earn that much. Then in May 1999, the channel debuted the animated series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', which quickly became one of the most popular Nicktoons in the network's history, and has remained very popular to this day, consistently ranking as the channel's highest-rated series since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lacher | first = Irene | title = Birth of a Nickelodeon Nation |work=[[Newsday]] |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/51891061.html?dids=51891061:51891061&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+26%2C+2000&amp;author=Irene+Lacher&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=EMPIRE+BUILDERS%3A+They+green-light+big-budget+features+and+produce+niche+films.+They+schmooze+with+Julia+Roberts+and+market+the+Rugrats.+And+they%27re+changing+the+course+of+Holly

[[Image:Nickelodeon logo.svg|175px|thumb|right|One of the many variants of the orange logo, commonly known for the 'splat' design, used from October 8, 1984 to 28 September 2009; this particular version was used as the main logo from April 2003 to 28 September 2009, and is still used on [[Nickelodeon Arabia|the Arabian version of Nickelodeon]] and on newer products in tandem with the current logo.]]
On August 15, 1992, the channel extended its Saturday schedule to 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET with the launch of a primetime block called [[SNICK]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22643911.html Virginia Mann, Record Television Critic. &quot;Kids Take Their Piece of Nick's Prime Time&quot;], ''The Record'', August 14, 1992. Retrieved March 1, 2011 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; which was home to shows such as ''[[Are You Afraid of the Dark?]]'', ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]'', ''[[All That]]'', ''[[The Amanda Show]]'' and ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]''; in 2004, the block was reformatted as the Saturday edition of [[TEENick]] (which originally debuted on Sunday evenings in 2000), and the Saturday night block continues today without an official block name (though ''A Night of Premieres'' is occasionally used when two or more programs feature new episodes on that night); the TEENick branding, with its spelling altered to TeenNick, has since been used on the Nickelodeon sister channel previously known as The N. In June 1993, Nickelodeon resumed its magazine brand, Nickelodeon Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = IN THE NICK OF TIME, A KIDS' MAGAZINE THAT'S REALLY GROSS| work = [[NewsLibrary]] | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=LB&amp;p_theme=lb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE8F32D88CB77D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM| accessdate = 2009-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the Saturday primetime block led Nickelodeon to expand its programming into weeknight primetime in 1996, by extending its broadcast day to 8:30 p.m. ET (and later extended to 9 p.m. ET from 1998 to 2009) on Sunday through Friday nights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17480264.html Brown, Rich. &quot;Nick at Nite becoming Nick at Nite-and-Day; MTV Networks Inc.'s launching of classic TV channel called TV Land&quot;], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', October 30, 1995.

In 1994, Nickelodeon launched [[The Big Help]], which spawned a spinoff program [[The Big Green Help]] in 2007; the point of the program is to change yourself and the earth by exercising and protecting the environment to show a difference to the earth. Also that same year, Nickelodeon removed ''You Can't Do That on Television'' from its schedule after a thirteen-year run and by the same year the network had launched a new sketch comedy show, ''[[All That]]''. For many years, until its cancellation in 2005, ''All That'' would launch the careers of many actors and actresses including [[Kenan Thompson]], [[Amanda Bynes]], and [[Jamie Lynn Spears]]. The show's executive producer, [[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]], would go on to create and produce several hit series for Nickelodeon including among others ''[[Kenan &amp; Kel]]'', ''[[The Amanda Show]]'', ''[[Drake &amp; Josh]]'' and ''[[Zoey 101]]'', and more recently ''[[iCarly]]'' and ''[[Victorious]]''. In October and December 1994, Nickelodeon sold [[Halloween]] and [[Christmas]] themed episodes of its Nicktoons through syndication to local markets across the United States, with then-new former corporate relative, Paramount Domestic Television (now [[CBS Television Distribution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Tooned Up Hipper characters and computer power are driving the comeback of cartoons | work = [[Boston Herald]] | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/68278160.html?dids=68278160:68278160&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+1994&amp;author=Frances+Katz&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=JUST+FOR+KIDS+Tooned+Up+Hipper+characters+and+computer+power+are+driving+the+comeback+of+cartoons&amp;pqatl=google | first=Frances | last=Katz | date=September 18, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1995, Nickelodeon ventured in the [[World Wide Web]] and launched [[Nick.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nick History|url=http://www.nick.com/all_nick/everything_nick/history_home.jhtm|publisher=Nickelodeon|accessdate=2011-10-03|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050127084900/http://www.nick.com/all_nick/everything_nick/history_home.jhtml|archivedate=January 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the website was available only using [[America Online]]'s internet service, but was later available to all internet service providers. The website's popularity grew and in March 1999, Nick.com became the highest-rated website aimed at children aged 6â14 years old. Nickelodeon used the website in conjunction with television programs which increased traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54675660.html|title=Nickelodeon TV &amp; Online Are Perfect Together as Nick.com Takes Top Ratings Spot in March. |date=1999-05-19|publisher=Entertainment Wire|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Nickelodeon partnered with Networks Inc. to provide [[broadband]] [[video game]]s for rent from ''Nick.com''. The move was a further step in the multimedia direction that the developers wanted to take the website. Skagerlind indicated that over 50% of Nick.com's audience are using a high speed connection which allows them to expand the gaming options on the website. To accompany the broadband content, [[Nick Video|TurboNick]] was created. Initially it was a popup panel which showcased broadband content on Nick.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10219501_ITM|title=Nick Looks to Gaming As High-Speed Revenue Play|last=Brown|first=Karen|date=2001-11-12|publisher=MultiChannel News|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite were split up in the Nielsen primetime and total day ratings, due to the different programming, advertisers and target audiences between the two services; this caused controversy by cable executives believing this manipulated the ratings, given that Nick at Nite's broadcast day takes up only a fraction of Nickelodeon's programming schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Multichannel.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;/&gt; Nickelodeon's and Nick at Nite's respective ratings periods encompasses only the hours they each operate under the total day rankings, though Nickelodeon only is rated for the daytime ratings; this is due to a ruling by Nielsen in July 2004, that networks have program for 51% or more of a daypart to qualify for ratings for a particular daypart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Linda|title=Nielsen Changes Some Cable-Ratings Rules|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/75906-Nielsen_Changes_Some_Cable_Ratings_Rules.php|publisher=Multichannel News|accessdate=2011-10-16|date=2004-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickelodeon Studios closed down in 2005 and was converted into the Blue Man Group Sharp Aquos Theatre in 2007; Nickelodeon now tapes its live-action series at the [[Nickelodeon On Sunset]] studios (formerly the [[Earl Carroll Theatre]]) in Hollywood, California and other studio locations in Hollywood and other areas. In 2007, Nickelodeon began a four-year development deal with [[Sony Music]] to produce music-themed series for the channel, help fund and launch albums in conjunction with the label tied to Nickelodeon shows and produce original songs for the programs to be released as singles as result;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=By |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966962.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=Nickelodeon, Sony pact for tunes - Entertainment News, TV News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only series produced under the partnership that was greenlit as a series, ''[[Victorious]]'' debuted in 2010, though a similar hit music-themed sitcom, ''[[Big Time Rush]]'' that debuted the same year features a similar partnership with [[Columbia Records]], though with Columbia only being involved with the show's music, Sony Music became involved with that show's production midway through its first season. ''Big Time Rush'' soon, after less than a month on the air, became a hit series, garnering 6.8 million viewers for its debut on January 18, 2010, and setting a new record for highest-rated [[live-action]] series premiere in the network's history.

===Rebranding and plans for the future (2009âpresent)===
Nickelodeon announced in February 2009 that Noggin and The N were to be rebranded as Nick Jr. and TeenNick to bring both channels in line with the Nickelodeon brand identity. Nickelodeon later announced in May 2009 that Nick Magazine would be discontinued by the end of the year. In July 2009, Nickelodeon unveiled a new logo for the first time in 25 years on the packaging of Nickelodeon DVDs coming out beginning that month, the Australian service, and that year's Nickelodeon Animation Festival, intending to create a unified look that can better be conveyed across all of MTV Networks's children's channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Michael|title=Nickelodeon unveils new logo|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006659|publisher=Variety|accessdate=2011-09-29|date=July 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On September 28, 2009, the new logo is used across Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite, along with the rebranded [[TeenNick]], [[Nick Jr. (TV channel)|Nick Jr.]] and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] (formerly The N, Noggin and Nicktoons Network, respectively) channels in varying versions customized for brand unification and refreshment purposes;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;/&gt; a new logo for Nickelodeon Productions also began being used in end credit tags on all Nickelodeon shows, even on episodes aired before the new logo took effect (end credit tags of programs airing on TeenNick, Nick Jr. and some shows on Nicktoons only use the current Nickelodeon Productions logo and variants for their respective channel's original programming on episodes of series made after the rebrand). New York based creative director/designer [[Eric Zim]] rebranded Nickelodeon, creating the new identity, logos, and the look and feel. In addition to creating the new Nickelodeon corporate logo, he created a whole new logo system to represent the companyâs entire family of sub-brands (including digital networks Nick Jr., Nicktoons, TeenNick and Nick at Nite).

Though it is mainly a [[Wordmark (graphic identity)|wordmark]], during the days prior to the [[2010 Kids' Choice Awards|2010]] and [[2011 Kids' Choice Awards]], the logo bug was given a blimp background to match the award given out at the show; and beginning the week of September 7, 2010 the logo was formed by a splat design (a la the 2006-2009 logo) in the on-screen program bug during new episodes of its original series. The new logo was adopted in the UK on February 15, 2010, in Spain on February 19, 2010, in Asia on March 15, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/ |title=Nickelodeon &amp;#124; Kids Games, Kids TV Shows, Videos, Contests, Entertainment Television, Asia |publisher=www.nick-asia.com |date=2008-10-14 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Latin America on April 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mundonick.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Nickelodeon on ABS-CBN&quot; block on [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] in the [[Philippines]] adopted the rebranded logo on July 26, 2010. On November 2, 2009, a Canadian version of Nickelodeon was launched, in partnership between Viacom and [[Corus Entertainment]] (owners of [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], which has aired Nick shows for several years, and will continue to do so); as a result, versions of Nickelodeon now exist in most of [[North America]].

On May 12, 2010, after an agreement was reached with [[Haim Saban]] (who earlier that month had bought back rights to the ''[[Power Rangers]]'' franchise from [[The Walt Disney Company]]), Nickelodeon agreed to air an eighteenth season of the series, and the production resumed in late 2010 for. The new show, ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'', debuted in February 7, 2011; as part of the deal, Nickelodeon also plans to air the existing 700-episode catalog of the series on the Nicktoons cable channel later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/05/13/power-rangers-franchise-moving-to-nickelodeon/ |title='Power Rangers ' Franchise Moving to Nickelodeon |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 1, 2011, Nickelodeon debuted a new original series, ''[[House of Anubis]]''. The show, which was based on the series ''[[Het Huis Anubis]]'' which aired on an international version of Nickelodeon in [[Nickelodeon (Netherlands &amp; Flanders)|The Netherlands]], became the first original scripted series to be broadcast in a weekdaily strip (in a similar format to a soap opera) and the first original series produced by the flagship Nickelodeon in the United States not to be produced in the United States or Canada.

==Programming==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Nickelodeon}}
Current programming on Nickelodeon includes ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[iCarly]]'', ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'', ''[[Fanboy and Chum Chum]]'', ''[[The Fairly Oddparents]]'', ''[[Supah Ninjas]]'', ''[[Planet Sheen]]'', ''[[Bucket &amp; Skinner's Epic Adventures]]'', ''[[Victorious]]'', ''[[Big Time Rush]]'', ''[[House of Anubis]]'', ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'', ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]'' and ''[[The Troop]]'' with reruns of ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', ''[[All Grown Up!]]'' and ''[[Rocket Power]]''. ''SpongeBob'', ''iCarly'' and ''Big Time Rush'' are the most frequently aired programs on Nickelodeon, with ''SpongeBob'' in particular typically airing about 9-11 times each day on average. ''[[iCarly]]'' currently ranks as of 2010 as the channel's highest-rated original series and the highest-rated cable program among children ages 2 and up, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Claire Afan |url=http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/news/20091223/ratingswatch.html |title=Ratings Watch: Disney Channel, Nickelodeon |publisher=KidScreen |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeon also continues to air bi-monthly special editions of the long-running magazine series ''[[Nick News]]'', hosted by [[Linda Ellerbee]] since its debut in 1992 (until the early 2000s, ''Nick News'' had aired on Nick on an almost weekly basis on Sunday nights).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reviewed byPam Gelman |url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/Nick-News-with-Linda.html/details |title=Nick News with Linda Ellerbee - TV Show Rating For Kids and Families |publisher=Commonsensemedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2009, Nickelodeon discontinued the [[TEENick (block)|TEENick]] and [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] programming blocks but the programming within the blocks remained; the former TEENick Saturday evening and Sunday late afternoon blocks no longer carry a name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/189298-_Nick_Of_Time_For_Rebrand.php |title='Nickâ Of Time For Rebrand - 2009-03-01 14:00:00 &amp;#124; Multichannel News |publisher=Multichannel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2009, it was announced that Nickelodeon secured the rights to the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' franchise from [[Mirage Studios]]. The network plans to develop a new CGI-animated TMNT television series and will partner with fellow Viacom company [[Paramount Pictures]] to bring a new TMNT movie to theaters. Both are expected for 2012.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS136562+21-Oct-2009+PRN20091021 The Mirage Group Sells Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(TM) to Nickelodeon | Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2010, Nickelodeon announced it had acquired the rights to the animated series ''[[Winx Club]]'' for broadcast on the flagship American channel and several of its international channels. The channel plans to co-produce the fifth and sixth seasons of the series, and has also gained the rights to air the existing episodes of the TV series and two theatrical films. On June 27, the first of four one-hour specials, created to summarize the first two seasons, aired, with the second set to air on August 1. Season three will air in full when the specials finish, with season four sometime after. Both the specials and the full seasons will feature a new voice cast and a re-vamped animation style, a bit different from the original.

On March 15, 2010, Nickelodeon announced the renewals of 16 of its existing series for the 2010-11 season that include the second season renewals of freshman series ''The Troop'' and ''Big Time Rush'' (the latter series was picked up for another season after only 10 episodes aired) and veteran series such as ''iCarly'' (whose fourth season renewal was already announced in late 2009 and it was announced later that it would be renewed for a 5th season as well), ''True Jackson, VP'' and ''SpongeBob SquarePants''. The channel also announced the additions of an English-language version of the Belgian/Dutch live-action Nickelodeon series ''[[Het Huis Anubis]]'' called ''[[House of Anubis]]'', a ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]''' animated series, and the preschool series ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'' for the Nick Play Date block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/450087-2010_Upfronts_Nick_Looks_To_Build_Tween_Co_Viewing_Appeal.php |title=2010 Upfronts: Nick Looks To Build Tween, Co-Viewing Appeal - 2010-03-11 22:19:21 &amp;#124; Multichannel News |publisher=Multichannel.com |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most cable channels (save for sports-oriented channels), Nickelodeon is sometimes susceptible to programs overrunning their designated timeslot because of short-form segments airing in commercial breaks during special programming which add time to commercial breaks with no limiting of the number of commercials shown when these segments air between breaks, this often causes program start times to be disrupted, which is problematic for those recording Nick programs as part of the program may be cut off. In these circumstances, commercial breaks may be shortened during some programs on Nick at Nite's late evening and overnight schedules and regular &quot;top-and-bottom of the hour&quot; start times would not be restored until early the next morning; similar issues in which programming schedules become off-sync also occur periodically on sister channels MTV and VH1.

===Nicktoons===
{{Main|Nicktoons}}
'''Nicktoons''' are [[animation|animated]] [[television series]] produced by and aired on Nickelodeon. Until 1991, the animated series that aired on Nickelodeon were largely imported from foreign countries, and some original animated specials were also featured on the channel up to that point as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4067509.html Nickelodeon ventures into cartoons], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (via [[HighBeam Research]]), August 10, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicktoons continue to make up a substantial portion of Nickelodeon's lineup, with roughly 6â7 hours airing on weekdays and around nine hours on weekends including a five-hour weekend morning block. Since the late 2000s, after the channel struck a deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]] in 2006 to develop the studio's animated films into weekly series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/25/nickelodeon-and-dreamworks-teaming-up/ |title=Nickelodeon and Dreamworks teaming up |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date=2006-10-25 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a gradual shift towards Nicktoon series using three-dimensional computer animation rather than traditional or digital two-dimensional ink and paint; the introductions of ''The Penguins of Madagascar'' and ''Fanboy and Chum Chum'' to the channel's lineup reflect this.

===Movies===
{{Main|List of films broadcast by Nickelodeon}}
Nickelodeon does not air movies on a regular basis; however, it does produce its own original [[Television film|made-for-cable television movies]], which usually premiere in weekend evening timeslots.

The channel occasionally airs feature films produced by the network's [[Nickelodeon Movies]] film production division (whose films are distributed by sister company [[Paramount Pictures]]); however, despite the fact that the film division bears the Nickelodeon name, the Nickelodeon cable channel does not have access to most Nickelodeon Movies-produced films released through Paramount. Nickelodeon does have broadcast access to most feature films based on or that served as the basis for original series produced by the channel (such as ''[[Barnyard: The Original Party Animals|Barnyard]]'' and ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''); the majority of live-action feature films produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner are licensed for broadcast by various television outlets, primarily cable networks (however, Nickelodeon has aired a small number of live-action features from Nickelodeon Movies including ''[[Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging]]'' and ''[[Good Burger]]'', which have aired on the channel's Nick at Nite nighttime block).

Nickelodeon also advertises hour-long episodes of its original series, such as ''[[iCarly]]'', ''[[True Jackson, VP]]'', ''[[Big Time Rush]]'', ''[[Victorious]]'' and ''[[House of Anubis]]'' as movies; though these technically do not qualify as such as the &quot;TV movie&quot; versions of Nickelodeon's original series are shorter than the standard length of a television movie (approximately 45 minutes without commercials, compared to the typical 75â100 minutes for television movies), the hour-long episodes of the channel's [[multi-camera setup|multi-camera]] comedies are shot using that camera setup (whereas feature films and television movies are standardly shot in a [[single-camera setup]]), [[laugh track]]s are used and the programs are shot on [[videotape]] instead of film (though the video frame rate of its multi-camera comedies are reduced to the [[24p]] film frame rate, using the [[filmizing]] process). Films not produced by Nickelodeon or its Nickelodeon Movies division also occasionally air on the channel including [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment|Universal]]'s ''[[Barbie: A Fashion Fairy Tale]]'', and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles Forever]]'' (which was later released by Nickelodeon Movies through Paramount DVD for DVD release).

===''Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards''===
{{Main|Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards}}
The '''Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards''' are an annual event held on the last Saturday night in March, and airs live and is usually held and telecast live (though with a three-hour time delay for those watching in the Pacific Time Zone or on the Nick 2 feed on digital cable that, on systems in the [[Eastern time zone|Eastern]] and [[Central time zone]]s, simulcasts the Pacific time zone feed), which honors the year's biggest television, movie, and music acts, as voted by Nickelodeon viewers. Winners receive a hollow orange blimp figurine, a logo outline for much of the network's 1984-2009 &quot;splat logo&quot; era.

The show features numerous celebrity guests and about two or three musical acts. In recent years, slime stunts have been incorporated into the show. The KCA's also host live entertainment. It has also been known to overwhelmingly cover people with the network's trademark green slime. [[Will Smith]] has won the most KCA awards; [[Rosie O'Donnell]] has hosted the most KCA awards. In 2011, the first monster truck slime stunt was held.

===''Worldwide Day of Play''===
On October 2, 2004, Nickelodeon launched an annual event to mark the conclusion of its six-month long &quot;[[Let's Just Play Go Healthy Challenge|Let's Just Play]]&quot; campaign launched that same year called the ''[[Worldwide Day of Play]]'', designed to influence kids to get active and participate in outdoor activities; schools and educational organizations are also encouraged to host events to promote activity among children. Nickelodeon and its sister channels Nick Jr., TeenNick and Nicktoons (along with some international versions of the channel) suspend programming for three hours from 12-3 p.m. ET/PT on a Saturday afternoon in late September (since 2005) during the event and show their testcards instead, and the respective websites of all four Nickelodeon channels are taken offline during that same three-hour time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Lepper,, 26 July 2004, 9:05am |url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/217537/Nickelodeon-tells-kids-go-play-anniversary/ |title=Nickelodeon tells kids to go out and play for anniversary - Media news |publisher=Media Week |date=2004-07-26 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four Nickelodeon channels display a message on-screen encouraging viewers to participate in outdoor activities during that time and notifying them that the channels will resume normal programming at 3 p.m. ET/PT (the west coast feed of the main Nickelodeon channel viewable via basic cable in the Pacific and Mountain time zones, and on digital cable and satellite nationwide will begin suspending regular programming at the same time the east coast feed resumes programming). Since 2010, the Worldwide Day of Play event became part of The Big Help program, as part of an added focus on healthy lifestyles in addition to the program's main focus on environmental issues. New episodes of Nickelodeon's original series are commonly aired during its Saturday primetime lineup on the night of the event.

===Programming blocks===
Various types of programs are broadcast on Nickelodeon in named programming blocks.

====Preschool programming block====
Nickelodeon currently programs shows targeted at preschool-age children on Monday through Fridays from 7 a.m.-12 p.m. ET/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nick.com/shows/tvschedule/ Nick TV Schedule] Nickelodeon/MTV Networks/Viacom International. Subject to change.&lt;/ref&gt; This block was known as &quot;[[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]]&quot; from January 1988 to February 2009 and has been known as the &quot;Play Date&quot; since February 2009. The block exists because Nickelodeon's usual audience of school-age children are in school at that time; as such, on holidays and during the summer months, a shorter block of preschool shows will air in the earlier time period of 7-10 a.m. ET/PT, and the block does not air on weekends at any time of the year.

Programming in the Nick Play Date block is somewhat fluid, but currently, ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'', ''[[Max and Ruby]]'', ''[[Team Umizoomi]]'', ''[[The Fresh Beat Band]]'', and ''[[Bubble Guppies]]'' have a permanent place in the schedule.

====Weekend programming blocks====
Nickelodeon airs first-run or recent episodes of its original series on Friday nights from 8-9 p.m. ET, Saturday mornings, Saturday nights from 8-10 p.m. ET, and Sunday nights from 7-7:30 p.m. ET. {{As of|July 2011}}, Friday nights feature primarily reruns of various original series, the Saturday night schedule (sometimes called &quot;A Night of Premieres&quot;, when new episodes of three or four of its original programs are scheduled to air) features episode premieres or repeats of ''[[iCarly]]'', ''[[Big Time Rush]]'' and ''[[Victorious]]'', along with periodic episode premieres of ''[[Supah Ninjas]]'' (all first-run episodes are cycled on the schedule, giving a variable schedule) and occasional original movie premieres, while Sunday nights feature first-run episodes of ''[[Bucket &amp; Skinner's Epic Adventures]]'' and bi-monthly episode premieres of ''[[Nick News]]'' (the latter of which after Nickelodeon gave the Sunday 8 p.m. ET hour to Nick at Nite in June 2010, currently airs during what is technically part of the Nick at Nite schedule). The [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning lineup]] (also sometimes called &quot;A Morning of Premieres&quot;, when new episodes of at least three of its original animated series are scheduled to air), features episode premieres of many of the channel's animated series, including ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[The Penguins of Madagascar]]'', ''[[Planet Sheen]]'' and ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]''.

====Nickelodeon program blocks on other channels====
On November 9, 1998, Spanish-dubbed versions of ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', ''[[KaBlam!]]'' and ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' debuted on [[Telemundo]]. Nickelodeon programs were seen on Telemundo on weekdays until September 5, 2000, when they were relegated on weekends only, to make room for a morning news program; Telemundo terminated the lineup in November 2001 after [[NBC]] purchased that network and now carries [[qubo]] programming on Saturday mornings. On September 14, 2002, a [[Nick on CBS|two-hour block]] featuring ''Blue's Clues'', ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', ''[[As Told by Ginger]]'', ''[[The Wild Thornberrys]]'', ''Hey Arnold!'', and ''[[Pelswick]]'' debuted on most [[CBS]] stations. Then in 2005, a two-hour block featuring Nick Jr. shows returned on most CBS stations until September 2006 after the Viacom-CBS split, when the airtime was leased to [[DiC Entertainment]] and then later DiC purchaser [[Cookie Jar Group]] for their [[Cookie Jar TV]] block. In April 2008 ''Dora the Explorer'', ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'' and ''[[Pinky Dinky Doo]]'' from [[Nick Jr.]] were picked up by [[Univision]] for a block called ''[[Planeta U]]''. [[The 90's Are All That]] is a programing block on TeenNick.

This television channel in the United States is aimed at [[teenagers]] and young adults, and is usually carried on a [[digital cable]] tier and the basic tiers of satellite providers. '''TeenNick''', which has more relaxed program standards than the other Nickelodeon channels allowing for moderate profanity, suggestive dialogue and some violent content (though Nickelodeon series and some off-network programs airing on the channel do not include this), once shared the evening and overnight portion of each day with Noggin as The N (in a similar manner to Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite) starting with The N's initial launch on April 1, 2002, but on December 31, 2007 it took over Nickelodeon GAS's satellite transponder and became a stand-alone channel. The network was rebranded as TeenNick (with actor [[Nick Cannon]] as its &quot;chairman&quot;) on September 28, 2009.

The channel is named after the former [[TEENick]] weekend evening program block on Nickelodeon, that ran from July 2000 to February 2009.

=====TV Land=====
{{Main|TV Land}}
A cable channel that was based on the Nick at Nite block, '''TV Land''' debuted on April 29, 1996 and originally aired classic programming from as far back as the early 1950s. Starting in 2004, TV Land moved to more modern programming such as reality shows and 1990s TV sitcoms. In 2007, TV Land created a programming block called, &quot;TV Land PRIME.&quot; TV Land PRIME runs from 9 p.m. until 12 a.m. ET/PT (though curiously, shows that air within the block that are aired in timeslots outside of the block display the block's logo bug). TV Land PRIME is a programming block aimed towards TV Land viewers that are in the 40- to 55-year-old range. Since 2008, a minimal amount of original programming began being included as well airing within the TV Land PRIME block. In 2006, TV Land stopped operating under the control of Nick at Nite though it is still operated as part of Viacom's MTV Networks division. The channel is usually carried on the basic tiers of cable and satellite providers.

=====Nick at Nite=====
{{Main|Nick at Nite}}
[[File:Nick at Nite logo 2009.svg|150px|right]]
Nick at Nite (stylized as '''&quot;nick@nite&quot;''') is Nickelodeon's nighttime programming Channel. It debuted on July 1, 1985 and broadcasts over Nickelodeon on Sunday through Thursdays from 8 [[12-hour clock|p.m.]]-7 a.m., Fridays from 9 p.m.-7 a.m. and Saturdays from 10 p.m.-7 a.m. ET/PT. Originally featuring classic sitcoms such as ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Mr. Ed]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', programming changed to repeats of popular [[sitcom]]s from the 1980s and 1990s such as ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]''.

===Other Nickelodeon channels===
====Nick HD====
[[File:Nick HD.png|135px|right]]
'''Nick HD''' is the on-air name for a feed provided by Nickelodeon to broadcast a limited schedule of programming, mainly the network's post-2008 live action series and some animation, and much of Nick@Nite's programming created for HD presentation after 2000 or earlier filmed sitcoms remastered for HD, in [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]], which is carried by most of the major American cable providers on a [[simulcast]] schedule that programs based on an Eastern/Central and a Pacific/Mountain schedule. Other non-HD programming is broadcast in pillar-boxed 4:3.

====Nick 2====
[[File:Nick 2 Logo.svg|right|135px]]
'''Nick 2''' is the on-air name for a feed provided by Nickelodeon to [[digital cable]] providers that features either the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] or [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/[[Central Time Zone|Central]] feed of the channel, giving viewers, depending on geographical location, a second chance to watch programming three hours after its airing on the east coast feed in the Eastern and Central time zones, or to watch the show ahead of time three hours before the original airing on the west coast feed in the Pacific and Mountain time zones (for instance, the Nick@Nite block would begin on the Nick 2 feeds at 11 p.m. ET on Nick 2 Pacific or 5 p.m. PT weeknights on Nick 2 Eastern, respectively). The network was originally offered as part of the &quot;MTV Networks Digital Suite&quot; which was intended to offer digital cable providers exclusive channels not offered to satellite providers (though most of these channels now do air over those services also), and is currently the only example of two feeds provided by cable and IPTV providers to be offered to their customers. A '''Nick TOO''' logo was used on the channel until 2004, when MTV Networks decided to no longer customize the feed as Nick TOO (Nick 2 presently uses an off-air logo that is utilized solely for [[electronic program guide]]s as a [[:wikt:placeholder|placeholder]] image); most television listings thus either show the additional channel under the brandings &quot;Nickelodeon Pacific/NICKP&quot; or &quot;Nickelodeon Eastern/NICKE&quot;. [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] also offer both Nickelodeon feeds, though unbranded as most of their children's networks have both time zone feeds by default.

====Nick on Demand====
'''Nick on Demand''' is a free [[video-on-demand]] service available on most cable systems, carrying Nickelodeon's live-action, animated, and preschool programming. Nick at Nite programming is not included as most of the network's syndication rights are limited by contract to late evening and overnight time slots.

===Former channels===
====Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids====
{{Main|Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids}}
'''Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids''' (commonly referred to in on-air usage as '''Nickelodeon GAS''' or '''Nick GAS'''), was an American digital cable and satellite television channel that was launched on March 1, 1999 as part of [[MTV Networks]]' suite of digital cable channels. Nick GAS was essentially a children's version of (and Viacom's answer to) [[Game Show Network]] (now branded as GSN), which had launched in December 1994. The channel ceased operations on December 31, 2007 on digital cable providers and DirecTV, with an automated loop remaining on [[Dish Network]] due to unknown factors until April 23, 2009.
