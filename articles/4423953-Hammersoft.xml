'''Kenya Rugby Football Union (KRFU)''' is the governing body of [[Rugby Union]] in [[Kenya]]. It organises Kenyan national teams and various competitions. It is a member of the [[International Rugby Board]]. 

Rugby has a long history in Kenya. Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K) was formed in 1923. The RFU-K was dissolved and the district unions incorporated into the [[Rugby Football Union of East Africa]] (RFUEA) upon its formation in 1956. After the formation of national unions in Uganda and Tanzania it was decided to form the Kenya Rugby Football Union in 1970 to combine the provincial unions within the country under a national union but still underneath the umbrella of the RFUEA.&lt;ref&gt;KRFU: [http://www.kenyarfu.com/KRFU%20DOCS/Kenya%20Rugby%20History%20Highlights.pdf Kenya Rugby Historical Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

KRFU also oversees Kenyan schools rugby, including the [[Prescott Cup]] (for the nation's top tier clubs), and the [[Damu Pevu Shield]] (for second tier clubs and the second XV's of top tier clubs).

KRFU also organises the [[Kenya national rugby union team]] and participates [[Confederation of African Rugby]] (CAR) tournaments, but has never qualified for the [[Rugby World Cup]]. The [[Kenya national rugby union team (sevens)|Kenyan national sevens team]] is much more successful, doing well in the [[IRB Sevens World Series]], as well the [[Commonwealth Games]] and [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]]. 

At the 2008 [[Kenyan Sports Personality of the Year]] awards KRFU won the federation of the year category &lt;ref&gt;KBC, January 24, 2009: [http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=55142 Jelimo and Wanjiru crowned best sports personalities]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The home ground of Kenya Rugby Football Union is the [[RFUEA Ground]] in [[Nairobi]].
