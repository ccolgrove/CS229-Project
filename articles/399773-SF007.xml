'''Celestia''' is a 3D [[astronomy]] program created by Chris Laurel. The program is based on the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] (HIP) and allows users to travel through an extensive universe, modeled after reality, at any speed, in any direction and at any time in history. Celestia displays and interacts with objects ranging in scale from small [[spacecraft]] to entire [[galaxy|galaxies]] in three dimensions using [[OpenGL]], from perspectives which would not be possible from a classic [[planetarium]] or other ground-based display.

[[NASA]] and [[European Space Agency|ESA]] have used Celestia in their educational&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Celestia Exploration Activity | work = NASA Learning Technologies | publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration | year = 2005 | url = http://learn.arc.nasa.gov/planets/ | accessdate = 2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and outreach programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mars Express orbit lowered | work = Closing in on the Red Planet | publisher = European Space Agency | year = 2003 | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMOUD374OD_index_0.html | accessdate =2007-10-26 | quote = Upcoming Mars Express flight orbits until 7 January, getting closer to the Red Planet.

Celestia is available for [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Released under the [[GNU General Public License]], Celestia is [[free software]].

==Functions==
[[File:Celestia DSOs.jpg|thumb|left|Typical [[Deep sky|DSO]] survey in Celestia]]
Celestia displays the [[Hipparcos Catalogue]] (HIP) of almost 120,000 stars. Celestia uses the very accurate [[Secular variations of the planetary orbits|VSOP87]] theory of planetary orbits. This makes it possible for it to provide a [[solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse]] finder and to display the orbital paths of [[planet]]s (including [[extrasolar planet]]s), [[dwarf planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moon]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, artificial [[satellite]]s, and [[spacecraft]]. The user can vary the number of stars that are visible on the screen and have them drawn in different styles.

Celestia users can travel/fly through the Celestia universe using simple keyboard controls, at any speed from 0.001&amp;nbsp;m/s to millions of light years/s. Viewpoints can be set to look forward, backward or at any angle to direction of travel. Controls allow users to orbit stars, planets, moons and other space objects, track space objects such as spacecraft, asteroids and comets as they fly by, or travel to and/or fly through nebulae and irregular, elliptical and spiral galaxies (over 10,000 galaxies included).

The time simulated by Celestia can be set at any point in the future or past, although planetary orbits are only accurate within a few thousand years of the present day, and date arithmetic overflows at the year 5874774.

The names and positions of multitudes of objects in space can be displayed, from galaxies, [[star cluster]]s, nebula, constellations and [[star]]s to planets, moons, asteroids, comets and artificial satellites, as well as the names and locations of cities, craters, [[Observatory|observatories]], [[valley]]s, landing sites, [[continent]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[sea]]s and other surface features.

Celestia displays such features as detailed atmospheres on planets and moons, [[planetshine|planet shine]] on orbiting satellites, sunsets and sunrises, moving clouds, [[planetary ring]]s, eclipse and ring shadows, constellation lines, borders and illustrations, night-side lights (of cities), detailed [[surface texture]]s, [[specular reflection]]s off water and ice, [[nebula]] gases and [[solar flare|star flares]].

Information about the objects that Celestia draws can also be displayed: the radius, the distance, length of the sidereal day and average [[Black body|blackbody]] temperature of the planets are shown and the distance, luminosity relative to the sun, spectral class, surface temperature and radius of stars are indicated.

The user can change Celestia's field of view from as wide as 120 degrees to a highly magnifying 3.4 seconds of arc, while dividing the window into multiple panes, in order to observe several objects at the same time and including [[Light-time correction|light time delay]] if desired.

Graphic screen-shots and movies can be captured in classic or [[High-definition video|HD]] resolutions (up to 1920x1080) on Windows and Linux platforms.

Celestia's support for game pads and joysticks is relatively limited, employing many keyboard shortcuts instead.

Celestia can be extended with new objects and there are hundreds of third-party, user-created add-ons available for installation, both fictional and realistic. The extension mechanism uses [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] as its built-in scripting language. Educational lessons and computer lesson plans are available.

==Limitations==
[[File:TrES-4 b.jpg|thumb|250px|Celestia's rendition of [[TrES-4 b]].]]
The default setting for Celestia's [[Earth]] is a [[spheroid]]. The irregular surface of the Earth causes [[low Earth orbit]] satellites to appear to be in the wrong places in the sky when watched from Celestia's ground, even when the Earth's [[Flattening|oblateness]] is specified.

Many types of astronomical objects are not included with Celestia. [[Variable star]]s, [[supernova]]e, [[black hole]]s and [[nebula]]e are missing from the standard distribution. Some are available as add-ons. Although objects which form part of a [[planetary system]] move, and stars rotate about their axes and orbit each other in multiple star systems, stellar [[proper motion]] is not simulated and [[Galaxy|galaxies]] are at fixed locations. Celestia's binary star catalogs only describe a few hundred systems of multiple stars. Most [[binary star]] systems cannot be simulated because adequate orbital information is not yet available.

Celestia does not include any stars that are more than a few thousand [[light-year]]s from the Sun because the parallaxes of more distant stars are too small to be accurately measured by the [[Hipparcos]] [[Astrometry|astrometric]] satellite. In addition, objects in solar systems are only drawn to a distance of one light-year from their suns and Celestia does not consider the wobbling of some stars induced by their planets.

Wavelength filtering is not implemented in Celestia's engine. The actual rendering tries to match as closely as possible human vision at the observer's position. This means [[false-color]] maps, multi-color nebulae and over-exposed galaxies are not part of the official distribution. Camera lens artifacts like [[lens flare]] and glare are not rendered. Also, in a total [[lunar eclipse]], the [[moon]] is completely dark.

Celestia also does not simulate [[gravity]]. That means, for example, that a [[near-Earth object]] approaching the Earth will not collide with the planet after being caught by the Earth's gravity unless the person who defined the NEO's trajectory for Celestia included that effect.

Some of Jupiter's moons do not cast a shadow on Jupiter during [[eclipses]]. This is because irregularly shaped objects do not cast shadows in the current version of Celestia.

Most [[spacecraft]] such as the [[Voyager 2]] are not available in Celestia but are provided as add-ons by users.

In the real world, constellations gradually change shape because stars will move over time, which Celestia does not take into account.

==Add-ons==
 
[[File:Celestia mars.jpg|thumb|left|A very high-resolution texture of the [[planet]] [[Mars]]]]
[[File:Celestia moon.jpg|thumb|A very high-resolution texture of the [[Moon]], including a normal map]]
About 18&amp;nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] of extensions are available in addition to the base program, produced by an active user community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/ The Celestia Motherlode]&lt;/ref&gt;

High-resolution surface textures are available for most solar system bodies, including Virtual Textures with complete coverage up to 32768 pixels wide (1.25&amp;nbsp;km/pixel at the Earth's equator), with selected coverage at higher resolutions. This allows very close views of the Earth, Mars and the Moon. Many 3D models of historical and existing spacecraft are available flying in reasonably accurate trajectories, from [[Sputnik 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[International Space Station]], as are extended [[data plot]]s for stars (2 million with correct spatial coordinates). [[Deep sky|DSO]]s (nebulae, galaxies, [[open cluster]]s etc.), as well as catalogues of thousands of asteroids and comets, and more than 96,000 locations on the Earth can be drawn by the program. Add-ons also include extensive space objects such as red and blue supergiants, red and brown dwarfs, neutron stars, spinning pulsars, rotating black holes with accretion disks, protostars, star nursery nebula, supernova and planetary nebula, galactic redshifts, geological planetary displays (e.g. 3-D interiors, topographic and [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] maps, ice age simulations), [[Aurora (astronomy)|planetary aurorae]], rotating magnetic fields, animated [[solar flare]]s and [[prominence]]s, 3-D craters and mountains, and historic collision events. All can be visited via the Celestia travel interface. All stages in the life cycle of stars are available, from [[protostar]] to [[black dwarf]].

Numerous scripts are available; these include simple tours, reconstructions of complex space missions such as [[CassiniâHuygens]] and ''[[Deep Impact (spacecraft)|Deep Impact]]'', and scripts showing useful information, like size comparisons, or particular events such as multiple simultaneous eclipses of Jupiter's moons or the evolution of a star.

Many well known [[fictional universe]]s are depicted in detail, with whole solar systems and 3D models â films such as ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'', and TV shows including ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Babylon 5]]''. Add-ons illustrating less well known Web fiction, like ''[[Orion's Arm]]'', or [[role-playing games]], like [[2300 AD]], and detailed personal works by members of the Celestia community depicting extensive fictional solar systems with inhabited worlds, spacecraft, cities and exotic special effects can also be obtained.
[[File:Red Giant Earth.jpg|thumb|left|The death of Earth 5 billion years from now]]
Educational add-ons (built by and for educators) are also available and are in use worldwide. These activities provide approximately 40 hours of space journeys and astronomical lessons, to include extensive tours of the Celestia universe, the complete life cycle of stars, the solar system, the human space program, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and depictions of astronomical events such as the formation of our moon billions of years ago, and the possible [[terraforming of Mars]] in the future. A special educational version of the Celestia program can also provide sound effects and &quot;cockpit&quot; features to simulate flying in a &quot;real&quot; hyperdrive spacecraft. Targeting the home user, middle and high school students and beginning courses in collegiate astronomy, they are available in several languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celestiamotherlode.net/catalog/educational.php/ The Celestia Motherlode: Educational Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be obtained on CD or DVD for easy installation on school servers, teacher computers and home computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gregs-educational.info/ Obtaining Celestia Educational Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Installation instructions for the add-ons are available on the [[:wikibooks:Celestia|Wikibooks page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
Celestia was used in the media by the CBS television show ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (Season 4, Episode 22: &quot;[[NCIS (season 4)|In the Dark]]&quot;). Character Timothy McGee explains what Celestia is, and how an add-on can allow the user to store a diary within the program as well. Textures designed by Celestia graphic artists were used in the movie ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' and the 2008 miniseries, ''[[The Andromeda Strain (TV miniseries)|The Andromeda Strain]]''. Celestia has also appeared in the Science Channel's ''[[Through the Wormhole]]''.
