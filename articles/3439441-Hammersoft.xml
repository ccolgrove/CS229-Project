'''Chew Chor Meng''' (born November 20, 1968; {{zh|s=å¨åæ|p=ZhÅu ChÅ«mÃ­ng}}) is a [[Singapore]]an television actor.

==Career==
Chew started his career in [[MediaCorp]] Studios after winning [[Star Search Singapore|Star Search]] in 1990, a bi-annual nationwide talent search. Since then, he has never failed to make it to the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes in [[Star Awards]], an award ceremony for TV personalities, since its inception in 1994. In 2004, Chew was awarded the [[Star Awards#All-Time_Favourite_Artiste_Award_.E8.B6.85.E7.BA.A7.E7.BA.A2.E6.98.9F.E5.A5.96|All Time Favourite Artiste Award]] as he had garnered a record of 10 popularity awards.

Chew is able to immerse himself so well into his characters that viewers often have a lasting impression of his roles. He first earned his acting nomination for his role as Hong San in the 1995 epic [[The Teochew Family]], which he's still known to audiences in China.  This was also evident when he bagged the Best Actor Award in Star Awards 2000 in [[Hainan Kopi Tales]]. His popularity has also spread across the causeway as he was voted the Most Popular MediaCorp Male Artiste in [[Malaysia]]. Chor Meng made his first crossover to English sitcom in [[Mr. Kiasu]]. He was best known for his role as Jacky Chang aka Ah Bee, a salesman with a penchant for grabbing 'lobangs' (good opportunities that cannot be missed) in the popular Channel 8 sitcom &quot;Don't Worry, Be Happy&quot;, which spanned for six seasons. Chor Meng initially dropped out from the role of Ah Bee after the 3rd season due to fear of being typecast, and also because he wanted to focus more on drama and variety shows. He eventually reprised the role for the latter half of the 6th (and final) season for &quot;Don't Worry Be Happy&quot;, and appeared in a spinoff series titled &quot;Lobang King&quot; focusing on Ah Bee and his new league of friends. His Lobang King role was named as one of the most memorable TV roles alongside other characters like Teacher Aiyoyo ([[Chen Liping]]), Bobo ([[Zoe Tay]]) and many others in the Star Awards 25 years of Drama special.

Now a well-known household name, Chew has gone from acting in drama series to hosting large-scale events including overseas collaboration with Taiwan and China.

Chew is a contracted artiste for MediaCorp and the contract is set to expire in October 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;july09&quot;/&gt; Due to his illness, Chew initially did not expect his contract to be renewed.&lt;ref name=&quot;july09&quot;/&gt; However, reports surfaced in November 2010 that Chew's contract was renewed for a further two years, with particular emphasis on hosting and new artiste training duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=å¨åæç²çºç´2å¹´ æè½æ°ä¸»ææå­¸ (Translation: Chew Chor Meng's Contract Renewed For Two Years, Might Turn to Hosting and Training)|url=http://www.chinapress.com.my/content_new.asp?dt=2010-11-02&amp;sec=entertainment&amp;art=1102en11.txt|accessdate=21 November 2010|newspaper=ChinaPress.com|date=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the contract extension, Chew was planning to enter the restaurant business before his contract renewal,&lt;ref name=&quot;july09&quot;/&gt; which would have been Chew's second foray into the eatery business.&lt;ref name=&quot;july09&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Chew is married to Deon Tan and they have two daughters, born in 2002 and 2004. He revealed during a celebrity talk show in early 2008 that he did not have a happy childhood, often being abused by his overly strict father (a compulsive gambler), who committed suicide when Chew was still in primary school. He began attending a [[Charismatic]] church, Renewal Centre from 2007 and was baptized in late November 2008 with his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/print/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_317020.html|title='I may need a wheelchair'--But actor Chew Chor Meng refuses to let muscular atrophy get him down|last=Tan|first=Dawn Weie|date=21 December 2008|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=2009-05-30}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness===
On December 19, 2008, Chew announced during a church event that he was suffering from [[Kennedy's disease]], a muscular dystrophy illness that resulted in him limping while filming for his latest role as Wang Zhongkun in [[Love Blossoms II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_316507.html|title=Chew has muscular atrophy|last=Teo|first=Jasmine|date=19 December 2008|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=2008-12-22}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chew said that he was diagnosed with the illness in September 2008, and that he alerted the local press as to his condition, but asked the press to not report it yet, as he was psychologically not ready for it. Chew originally planned on officially announcing his illness during the Star Awards 2008 ceremony, due to be held in March 2009. However, signs of his illness can be clearly seen already, and the news was hard to keep under wraps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812201701-28249.html|title=æ£èèèç¼©ç  å¨åæåè®¿ï¼ åè½®æ¤ä¹è¦ çå¥³å¿é¿å¤§ (Translation: Suffering from muscular atrophy, Chew Chor Meng's Exclusive Interview: &quot;I will watch my daughter grow up, even if I have to watch from a wheelchair&quot;)|date=20 December 2008|publisher=Lianhe Wanbao (carried on omy.sg)|language=Simplified Chinese|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illness has also brought on cardiac problems and [[diabetes]] for Chew.&lt;ref name=&quot;july09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://showbiz.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200907071508-73062.html|title=æå¹´10æçº¦æ»¡ãå¨åæè®¡åè¿åé¥®é£ä¸ (Translation: Artiste Contract Due to Expire in October of Next Year, Chew Plans Eatery Business Venture)|date=7 July 2009|publisher=Lianhe Wanbao (Singapore)|language=Simplified Chinese|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the illness was revealed, Chew became a member of the local disabled sports club, and has been taking swimming lessons to strengthen his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://showbiz.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200907090410-73597.html|title=æä¸ºæ®ç¾äººå£«ä½è²çäºä¼ä¼åãå¨åææ¯å¨4å¤©æ¸¸æ³³å¥èº« (Translation: Becoming a member of a disabled sports organisation, Chew Chor Meng swims 4 times a week for fitness)|publisher=Lianhe Zaobao (Singapore)|language=Simplified Chinese|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
