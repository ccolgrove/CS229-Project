The '''[[Philadelphia Flyers]]â[[Pittsburgh Penguins]] rivalry''' is a [[National Hockey League rivalries|rivalry]] in the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|NHL's Atlantic Division]]. The rivalry began in [[1967 NHL expansion|1967]] when the teams were introduced into the NHL's &quot;[[1967 NHL expansion|Next Six]]&quot; expansion wave. The rivalry exists due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in the state of [[Pennsylvania]]. The Flyers lead the series with a 137â87â30 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeriesRecord&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Philadelphia Flyers Head-to-Head Results|work = Hockey-Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/PHI/head2head.html|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Penguins have eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2008]] and [[2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2009]] - their most recent postseason meeting, strengthening the rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Philly vs. the Burgh|date=May 11, 2008|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early days==
The first meeting between the Flyers and Penguins occurred on October 19, 1967 in the first ever game at the Philadelphia [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstGame&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = October 19th, 1967 - Flyers First Home Game | work = flyershistory.net | publisher = P. Anson | url = http://www.flyershistory.com/cgi-bin/hm.cgi?003hm | accessdate = October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flyers goaltender [[Doug Favell]] stopped all 17 Pittsburgh shots and [[Bill Sutherland]] scored the lone goal 2:59 into the 3rd period for a 1â0 Flyers win.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstGame&quot;/&gt;

The rivalry was not as strong in earlier years, as the Penguins struggled in the NHL until the arrival of [[Mario Lemieux]] in {{nhly|1984}}. The Flyers achieved just the opposite, winning back-to-back [[Stanley Cup]]s in {{scfy|1974}} and {{scfy|1975}}. When the NHL realigned divisions prior to the {{nhly|1974}} season, the two Pennsylvania teams were moved to separate divisions. The Penguins spent the next seven seasons in the [[Norris Division]] and became the Flyers division rivals once again upon joining the [[Patrick Division]] in {{nhly|1981}}.

==Arrival of Mario Lemieux==
With the arrival of Lemieux in Pittsburgh, the Penguins slowly but surely gained respectability in the league and had begun to shed their image as one of the NHL's perennial doormats. In {{nhly|1988}}, the Flyers and the Penguins met for the first time in the playoffs in the [[1989 Stanley Cup Playoffs|Patrick Division Finals]]. Despite the upstart talent on the Penguins roster led by Lemieux against the Flyers' aging core of players, the Penguins blew a 3 games to 2 lead and lost the series in seven games.

Despite the Flyers' victory, the series proved to be a turning point for both franchises. The Flyers fell from grace and missed the playoffs entirely for the next 5 seasons, while the Penguins continued to strengthen their ranks with the additions of [[Jaromir Jagr]], [[Ron Francis]] and [[Tom Barrasso]] among others, and won back-to-back Stanley Cups in {{scfy|1991}} and {{scfy|1992}}.

==Eric Lindros and the 1990s==
The rivalry continued during the 1990s with the arrival of [[Eric Lindros]] in Philadelphia, which gave the Flyers a counterbalance against Lemieux. But further divisional realignment split the teams up again in {{nhly|1993}} and the Penguins spent the next five seasons in the Northeast Division. Lindros and Jagr were tied for the scoring lead in {{nhly|1994}}, but the [[Art Ross Trophy]] was given to Jagr for scoring more goals than Lindros. Lindros won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] that season as MVP, with Lemieux winning it the following season in {{nhly|1995}}, with Lindros as first runner-up. The two teams met again in the playoffs, in the [[1997 Stanley Cup playoffs| 1997 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals]]. The Flyers won in five games and Lemieux retired for the first time at the end of the series. After Game 5, Lemieux skated around the ice and received a [[standing ovation]] from the Philadelphia crowd. He had previously received a standing ovation from the Philadelphia crowd in March 1993 after returning from radiation treatments.

One of the most memorable moments of the rivalry occurred during the {{nhly|1999}} season, when the two teams met in the [[2000 Stanley Cup Playoffs|Eastern Conference Semifinals]]. A season after the Penguins joined the Atlantic Division, the Flyers had won the division and the 1st seed in the East, while the Penguins snuck into the playoffs as the 7th seed. Despite this, the Penguins jumped out to a 2 games to none lead in the series, winning both games in Philadelphia. The Flyers won Game 3 in overtime, but NHL history was made in Game 4. Tied at 1, the game stretched to five overtime periods and set the record for the longest game played in the modern era of the NHL. [[Keith Primeau]]'s goal at the 92:01 mark gave the Flyers a 2â1 win and a 2â2 split in the series. The outcome energized the Flyers and demoralized the Penguins, as the Flyers went on to win the next two games and the series.

==Rivalry in the 21st century==
The rivalry between the two teams lost its luster in the years leading up to the [[2004â05 NHL lockout]] as the Penguins struggled on and off the ice, dropping to the bottom of not only the league standings but the attendance rankings as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/attendance?year=2004|title=NHL Attendance Leaders - National Hockey League|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{nhly|2006}} , the Penguins defeated the Flyers in all eight matchups between the two teams, and Penguins goalie [[Marc-Andre Fleury]] became the first goalie to defeat a team eight times in a season since {{nhly|1967}}. The Flyers have swept the season series twice, winning all four games during the {{nhly|1980}} season and winning all seven games during the {{nhly|1983}} season. During the {{nhly|2007}} season the Flyers won five games and the Penguins won three of the games in the season series. The series was highlighted by an 8â2 win by the Flyers and a 7â1 win by the Penguins. The Penguins and the Flyers faced off in the [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2008 Eastern Conference Finals]], won by the Penguins in 5 games for the Penguins' first-ever playoff series win against the Flyers. A year later in the [[2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals]] the Penguins beat the Flyers again, winning the series 4â2 on their way to winning the [[2009 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup]]. 

In the {{nhly|2010}} season opener, Philadelphia traveled to Pittsburgh to open the Penguins new arena, the [[Consol Energy Center]], on October 7. Rookie goaltender [[Sergei Bobrovsky]] made his NHL debut, leading the Flyers to a 3â2 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2010020002|title=Flyers spoil Pens' debut in new home with 3-2 win|date= 7 October 2010|work=NHL.com|first=Mike G.|last=Morreale|accessdate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flyers forward [[Daniel BriÃ¨re|Daniel Briere]] scored the first NHL goal in the new building, and Penguins forward [[Tyler Kennedy]] scored the first Penguins goal. 

On July 1, 2011, the Flyers signed Jaromir Jagr to a 1-year, $3.3 million deal and [[Maxime Talbot]] to a 5-year, $9 million deal.&lt;ref name=Talbot&gt;{{cite news|title=Flyers add Jagr and lose Leino&amp;ndash;Talbot and Lilja also are in|date=July 2, 2011|first=Sam|last=Carchidi|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Busy Dat at the Ofifce&amp;ndash;Bidding War Ends with Jagr as Flyer; Talbot Joins Him, Too|date=July 2, 2011|first=Dave|last=Molinari|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=D1|authorlink=Dave Molinari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot scored both goals in the Penguins' Cup-clinching Game 7 win against [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit]] in {{scfy|2009}}.&lt;ref name=Talbot/&gt;
