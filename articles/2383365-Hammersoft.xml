<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="2383365" ns="0" title="Byomkesh Bakshi"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Byomkesh Bakshi''' (or, '''Byomkesh Baksi''') (Bengali: à¦¬à§à¦¯à§à¦®à¦à§à¦¶ à¦¬à¦à§à¦¸à§) is a fictional detective in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] literature created by [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]]. He is one of the most successful detective characters in [[Bengali Literature]]. Also, Bandyopadhyay once said that these stories can be thought as and read as social novels only. In [[Bangla]], &quot;''Byomkesh''&quot; means &quot;the sky&quot;.

==Overview==
The advocate-turned-littÃ©rateur Bandyopadhyay was deeply influenced by ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://byomkesh.com/2010/01/17/byomkesh-v-sherlock/&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], ''[[Hercule Poirot]]'' of [[Agatha Christie]] and ''[[Father Brown]]'' of [[G.K.Chesterton]] as well as the &quot;tales of ratiocination&quot; involving [[C. Auguste Dupin]] produced by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He was, however, concerned with how the Indian and Bengali fictional detectives created between 1890 and 1930 had failed to exist as something other than mere copies of the Western (and particularly English) fictional detectives. The stories of Dinendra Kumar Ray's ''[[Robert Blake]]'', Panchkari Dey's ''Debendra Bijoy Mitra'' or Swapan Kumar's ''Deepak Chatterjee'' were almost always set in [[London]] or in [[Kolkata]] which was identifiably the [[British metropolis]]. It was almost as a postcolonial response that [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]] introduced the Bengali ââBhadrolokââ (gentleman) sleuth Byomkesh Bakshi and [[Ajit Bandyopadhyay]] (Byomkesh's associate and narrator) in ''[[Pather Kanta]]'' in 1932, and began to write of them as investigating in an Indian metropolisâthe capital of British India until 1911âthat has had been thoroughly Indianised. Apart from Byomkesh, there are only two other [[detective]] characters who can be thought as purely Bengali of that time are: [[Hemendra Kumar Roy]]'s ''[[Jayanta]]'' [à¦à¦¯à¦¼à¦¨à§à¦¤] &amp; [[Nihar Ranjan Gupta]]âs ''[[Kiriti Roy]]'' [à¦à¦¿à¦°à§à¦à§ à¦°à¦¾à¦¯à¦¼], though in the view point of complexity and importance of crimes, Byomkesh is much more ahead.
In Initially serialized in the literary magazine '''[[Basumati]]''', the stories and novels were all eventually published in hardcover editions, the first being [[Byomkesher Diary]]. In all, Sharadindu wrote 33 stories featuring Byomkesh, one of which remained incomplete due to his death. At first, he wrote in [[Sadhu Bhasha]], but later he preferred [[Chalit Bhasha]] while writing Byomkesh. Byomkesh is one of the most popular characters in [[Bengali literature]], along with [[Feluda]] of [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Kakababu]] of [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Parashor Barma]] and [[Ghanada]] of [[Premendra Mitra]] and [[Tenida]] of [[Narayan Gangopadhyay]].

===Development===
Although the story [[Satyanweshi]], in which Byomkesh and Ajit meet for the first time, is often the first story in most Byomkesh anthologies, the first Byomkesh story written was [[Pother Kanta]] in 1932, followed by [[Seemanto-Heera]] in the same year. Sharadindu started writing the stories regularly, and by 1936 he had written ten stories, all of which were published by Calcutta publishers Gurudas Chatterjee and Sons in three collections. Sharadindu stopped writing Byomkesh stories for 15 years, during which time he lived and worked in [[Bombay]], writing screenplays for [[Bollywood]] films, including [[Durga]], [[Kangan]] and [[Navjeevan]] (all 1939), featuring. 
On returning to [[Calcutta]] in 1951, Sharadindu began writing Byomkesh stories again after friends asked why he had stopped and published [[Chitrochor]] in the same year. He wrote a further 21 stories, including one, ''[[Bishupal Bodh]]'', left incomplete by his death in 1970.

===Meeting with Ajit===
Byomkesh meets Ajit for the first time in the story ''[[Satyanweshi]]''. He initially introduces himself as Atul Mitra to prevent others from knowing his actual motives there. Through a series of complicated events, one of which resulted in him being accidentally arrested by the police on charge of murder, he ultimately unmasks the criminal, which turns out to be the mess owner himself. As a result the mess members are forced to vacate the mess, while Byomkesh takes Ajit to his own mess in [[Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata|Harrison Road]], where he entreats him to stay there with him, saying that after living with him for the last two weeks he would find it difficult to live alone. Ajit consents, and since then they live there along with their devoted servant Puntiram [à¦ªà§à¦à¦à¦¿à¦°à¦¾à¦®], until in [[Arthonamortham]] Byomkesh gets married to [[Satyaboti (character)|Satyaboti]] who henceforth lives there too.&lt;br /&gt;

===Early life===
Not much is known about Byomkesh's background and early life. Ajit mentions in ''[[Adim Ripu]]'' that his father used to be a mathematics teacher in a local school, while his mother busied herself in reading scriptures. Both died of [[tuberculosis]] when he was very young. His relatives never cared to look after him, leaving him to fend for himself. He earned scholarships from universities which enabled him to complete his studies. Though his relatives are still living, Byomkesh isn't interested in keeping any contact with them.

===Relationship with Ajit===
Ajit narrates all but five of the thirty-three cases which feature Byomkesh. In all these stories he assists and accompanies Byomkesh in his escapades. Most of the stories are centered on Kolkata, except a few like in ''[[Byomkesh O Baroda]]'', where they go to [[Munger]] in [[Bihar]], or ''[[Amriter Mrityu]]'', where they go to Baghmari. SharadinduBabu had intended to portray Ajit as a stereotype foil to a 'Super-Sleuth', and indeed in all the stories the readers find that Byomkesh single-handedly solves the mysteries, while Ajit's narration, punctuated by his own interpretations of various events, offers interesting insight into the story. Byomkesh's own opinion about Ajit's intelligence and acumen is somewhat underwhelming- in ''[[Durgo Rohosyo]]'', when Ajit throws some intelligent light on the mystery, he is very surprised, which prompts him to concede &quot;Can it be that at last you have really developed your faculties!&quot; However, he let Ajit try to solve the case in his lieu in ''[[Makorsar Ros]]'', though admittedly it was more due to circumstances precluding him from engaging himself in the case than due to his trust in Ajit's abilities; inasmuch as he was busy solving another case concerning some large scale forgery of notes. Ajit however is unable to solve the case, and even naively suggests at one point that the only explanation of NandadulalBabu still managing to intoxicate himself with [[Tarantula]] extract is that he devours those roaming on his room-walls. This preposterous idea compels a hearty laugh from Byomkesh, much to his chagrin; however after he had solved it out himself, Byomkesh tells the family that it was Ajit who had solved it, with only a minor assistance from him.&lt;br /&gt;
Occasionally Byomkesh assigns Ajit some role in solving the mystery: in ''[[Pother Kanta]]'' he lets Ajit go to [[New Market, Calcutta|New Market]] incognito to procure a letter from an unknown person, though later we find that he followed Ajit close at heels all the time. In ''[[Amriter Mrityu]]'' he asks Ajit to interrogate a suspect while he busied himself in some other affairs.&lt;br /&gt;

==Personality and Traits==
In ''[[Pother Kanta]]'', Ajit writes that Byomkesh, for all his astuteness and intelligence, is a bit queer. For example, he opines that the most spectacular pieces of news in a newspaper lay hidden not under the headlines, but in the advertisements. Though Ajit refuses to buy this, and can't control an urge to chaff him too, it later turns out that what Byomkesh had told was true, at least for that story. Ajit also writes that the outer appearance of Byomkesh won't do much to suggest anything out of the ordinary, but if he is cornered, he comes out of his shell and then his words and actions become something to be reckoned with. He calls himself a ââSatyanweshiââ (the ââtruth-seekerââ), and dislikes it when people call him a detective, perhaps to avoid the negative connotations of professionalism likely to be associated with the term [[private detective]]. However Ajit insists that even though Byomkesh dislikes the moniker, he knows very well that he is indeed one. &lt;br /&gt;
He often quotes [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]] to explain a certain situation to Ajit; in the later stories we find that the nonsense poems of [[Abol Tabol]] by [[Sukumar Ray]] too had attracted his interest. He is an avid reader of [[Mahabharata]] which we discover in [[The Will That Vanished]]. He never discloses the actual specifics of an ongoing case to Ajit until the very end (''[[Amriter Mrityu]]'' being one exception), but occasionally drops subtle hints, which however fail to satisfy the curiosity of the latter in most cases. Since Byomkesh isn't interested in cases involving petty thefts or murders as they don't provide much space to exercise his intelligence, most of the times he remains at home idling away his time in newspapers and his personal library. He ascribes this to brilliant criminals being few and far between. He often paces his room relentlessly while cogitating on a mystery, consuming endless number of cigarettes. He knows that sound contribution from the police is essential to solving any case, and hence maintains a cordial relation with most police officers. When this doesn't work out, for example in ''[[Arthonamortham]]'', finding that the officer in charge is adverse to him, Byomkesh blandishes him to elicit a thorough description of the entire event.&lt;br /&gt;
Although he is supposed to determine the culprit and hand him (or her) to the police, Byomkesh refrains from doing so on more than one occasion. In ''[[Adim Ripu]]'', he lets the murderer go scot-free, stating that even criminals have a right to freedom on the auspicious day of their nation's freedom (the timeline of the said story coincides with the last phase of [[Indian independence movement]]) and concluding that the knowledge of his parentage obviates having him to go through any further punishment. In ''[[Rokter Dag]]'', he lets the murderer off on moral grounds, arguing that the act, while not acceptable in the eyes of the law, works for the greater well and hence he is worthy of pardon. He repeats this act in ''[[Hneyalir Chhondo]]'' and ''[[Achin Pakhi]]''.&lt;br /&gt;

==Methods of detection==
In most of the story we find that Byomkesh banks more on instinct and intuition when concrete proof is unavailable. Sharadindu never expresses it explicitly through Ajit; however in ''[[Seemanto-heera| Seemonto-Heera]]'' the boastful and condescending Sir Digindranarayan Roy mentions it while he pretends to make an analysis of Byomkesh's faculties from his appearance only. Ajit visibly is unable to agree with the fact that intuition can supplant material proof, though he acquiesces after Byomkesh does solve the case. In ''[[Bahnni-Patanga]]'' we see that Byomkesh is somewhat perplexed by the seemingly trivial fact that in a painting depicting [[Dushmanta]] stealing a glance at [[Shakuntala]], the artist had chosen to paint the iris of the latter in blue. Based on this fact alone, he constructs the entire case, which we later we find accurate. ''[[Achin Pakhi]]'' perhaps provides the best example of his intuitive skills, here just in the act listening to an unsolved case as recounted by a retired police officer, he realises that the perpetrator of the crime in question is none other than the person recounting it. Byomkesh keenly focuses on the most quotidian events and facts, and many a time we find that such a fact proves all important in the solution of the mystery. He encourages his clients to state everything they can remember while they recount their experiences, insisting that nothing is unimportant to him. In [[Pother Kanta]], this leads to the client stating that just prior to his being attacked; he heard the ringing of a bicycle bell. Later this turned out to be the most crucial piece of clue in deciphering the mystery. In &quot;[[Arthonamortham]]&quot;, he correctly guesses that Sukumar returned from cinema at exactly 12 am. In fact there are very few stories where concrete proof does materialise to help him solve the case; for example in ''[[Chiriyakhana]]'' and ''[[Benisanghar]]'' he gets substantial help from the police. Many times we see that even though he already knows who the culprit is, he waits for an opportune moment to catch him flagrante delicto, such as in ''[[Pather Kanta]]'', ''[[Lohar Biscuit]]'' and ''[[Shojarur Kanta]]''.

==Trivia==
[[Image:Harrison street strand rd ( burra bazar ).jpg|thumb|Harrison Road and Strand Road intersection c. 1945. Byomkesh and Ajit spent most of the years in an apartment not far from here.]]
# The customs and manners of [[Calcutta]] during the [[British Raj]] are very well portrayed in the earlier books, from street names to the names of the shops. Interestingly, the bridge spanning the [[River Hooghly|Hooghly river]], was a [[pontoon bridge]] as mentioned by Byomkesh twice in ''Pother kanta''. This was prior to the current [[Howrah Bridge]], construction of which began three years after the publication of the first edition of the novel.
# In the [[foreword]] to the first anthologized edition of stories featuring Byomkesh, ''Byomkesher diary,'' published by Gurudas Chottopadhyay &amp; Sons, which contained ''[[Pother Kanta]]'', ''[[Satyanweshi]]'', ''[[Seemanto-Heera]]'' and ''[[Makorshar Ros]]'', [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]] wrote: &quot;Many will be anxious to know whether these are original stories or merely transcreated from foreign novels. For the interest of the general reader, I'd like to make it known that these are completely my own creations&quot;
# Although ''[[Pother Kanta]]'' was the first novel featuring Byomkesh that Sharadindu wrote, since ''[[Satyanweshi]]'' is the novel in which the character of Byomkesh Bakshi is established, it is considered by readers to be the first in the series.
# Byomkesh received M.Sc. in [[Physics]] from [[Calcutta University]].
# Byomkesh learned to play chess from Ajit.
# Byomkesh learns to love poetry on reading [[Sukumar Ray]]'s ''[[Abol Tabol]]'', a book presented to his son by Ajit.
# Byomkesh's father was a mathematics teacher by profession.
# Byomkesh reads the personal advertisements in a newspaper as if they were the real news. In stories like Pather Kanta, cases are partially introduced through the personal advertisement section of the newspaper.  
# Although most stories are penned by Ajit, somewhere through the second book of Byomkesh stories, he gives up writing Byomkesh's accounts. Though, in a few of the last stories, the narrator is the author himself, i.e., these stories are written in a third person speech.

Actor [[Saptarshi Roy]] has played Bakshi while Ajit and Satyaboti were played by two other lesser-known actors. This version of series is a bit low-profile unlike its predecedors. The series did not get the success also. the DVDs of the series was released by Mosearbear again.

# ''Byomkesh Bakshi'' is first installment of another Byomkesh-film-trilogy  directed by singer-songwriter-actor-director [[Anjan Dutta]] and produced by R P Techvision Pvt Ltd.  The film was released on 13th August 2010 and turned out to be quite popular with the audience. This movie is scheduled be followed by the other two film-adaptations - of ''Chitrochor'' and ''Kohen Kobi Kalidas''. The Second film adaption is titled &quot;Abar Byomkesh&quot;. Like several successful films of Dutta, this trilogy is also expected to be enacted by some young and relatively lesser-known actors. In the first film, [[Abir Chatterjee]] plays Bakshi while [[Ushoshi Chakrabarty]] plays Satyboti. The character of Ajit is played by the veteran actor [[Saswata Chatterjee]]. Three of them are going to reprise their roles in the second film. Coincidentally, Chatterjee also played the role of Topse - the juvenile assistant of another Bengali private investigator, [[Feluda]] (played by [[Sabyasachi Chakraborty]]) in ''[[Baksho Rahashya]]'' (film) in1996 and a T.V. miniseries ''Feluda 30'' (1997-2001).
# Director [[Shaibal Mitra]] had approached the experienced Hindi-film actor [[Naseeruddin Shah]] for the role of ''Bakshi in his 60s'' for a Hindi film-adaptation of ''Shajarur Kanta''.
# [[Prabir Chakroborty]], a Mumbai-based film-director, has had negotiated for the Hindi rights of six Byomkesh Bakshi stories, including that of ''Arthonamortham''. This information was supplied by Malabika Chakroborty, the director's wife who has the power of attorney for dealing with Bandopadhyayâs works, to ''The Times of India'', 21 February 2009.
# Director [[Rituporno Ghosh]] announced his intention to make a film-trilogy on Byomkesh, starting with ''Arthamanartham'', under the productions of ''[[Rose Valleys Motion Pictures]]''. It was decided that the Bengali film-actor, [[Prosenjit Chatterjee]] would enact Bakshi, [[Tapas Paul]] as Ajit, and [[Paoli Dam]] as Satyaboti. The project was, however, shelved.

Besides, many small scale productions have been made by various drama organizations throughout [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]].
