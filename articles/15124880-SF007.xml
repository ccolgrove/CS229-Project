'''SpiderOak''' is an online backup tool for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Apple Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Linux]] users to back up, share, sync, access and store &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; their data using an off-site server. SpiderOak allows the user to back up any given folder of his/her computer. SpiderOak uses encrypted [[Cloud storage#Storage|cloud storage]] and [[client-side encryption]] key creation, so even employees of SpiderOak cannot access users' information (this is the 'zero-knowledge' data encryption).  However, that can't be assured due to its client's closed source nature.

SpiderOak distinguishes itself from competition in provision of encryption, in provision for syncing files and folders across multiple devices, and in automatic de-duplication of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, SpiderOak uses a layered approach to encryption, using a combination of 2048 bit RSA and 256-bit AES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

SpiderOak offers two account types, a free 2 [[gigabyte|GB]] version and a paid subscription for capacity above the free account limit. Some components of SpiderOak are open source, and the company has announced their intent for the client to be fully open source in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
