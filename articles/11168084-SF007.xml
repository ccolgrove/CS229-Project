Microsoft '''Hyper-V''', codenamed '''Viridian'''&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=935 | title = Microsoft to ship Windows Server 2008, over time, in eight flavors | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formerly known as '''Windows Server Virtualization''', is a [[hypervisor]]-based [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] system for [[x86-64]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/viridian_preview.asp | title = Windows Server Virtualization Preview | author = Paul Thurrott | accessdate = 2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A beta version of Hyper-V was shipped with certain x86-64 editions of [[Windows Server 2008]], and the finalized version (automatically updated through [[Windows Update]]) was released on June 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/jhoward/archive/2008/06/26/hyper-v-rtm-announcement-available-today-from-the-microsoft-download-centre.aspx|title=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2008/jun08/06-26hyperv.mspx|accessdate=2008-06-26|lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyper-V has since been released in a free stand-alone version, and has been upgraded to Release 2 (R2) status.{{Cn|date=September 2011}}

==Versions and variants==
Hyper-V exists in two variants: as a stand-alone product called Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008, and as an installable role in [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] (the former containing the later release of Hyper-V).

The stand-alone version of Hyper-V is free, and was released on October 1, 2008. It is a variant of the core installation of [[Windows Server 2008]] that includes full Hyper-V functionality; other Windows Server 2008 roles are disabled, and there are limited Windows Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=2008-10-02
|work=PressPass
|publisher=[[Microsoft]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free Hyper-V Server 2008 variant is limited to a command line interface (CLI), where configuration of the &quot;Host&quot; or &quot;Parent&quot; (Hyper-V Server 2008) OS, physical hardware and software is done using shell commands. A new menu driven CLI interface does simplify initial configuration considerably, and some freely downloadable script files extend this concept. Administration and configuration of the &quot;Host&quot; (Hyper-V Server 2008 OS) and the &quot;guest&quot; or virtual OSes is generally done by downloading extended [[Microsoft Management Console]]s that are installed onto a Windows 7 PC or Windows 2008 Server (32 or 64 bit) or System Center Virtual Machine.

Alternatively, another Windows Server 2008 computer, with the Hyper-V role installed, can be used to manage Hyper-V Server 2008 by redirecting the management console. Other administration and configuration of Hyper-V Server 2008 can be done using a [[Remote Desktop]] RDP session (though still CLI) or redirected standard management consoles (MMC) such as &quot;Computer Management&quot; and &quot;Group Policy (Local)&quot; from a Vista PC or a full installation of Windows 2008 Server. This allows much easier &quot;point and click&quot; configuration, and monitoring of the Hyper-V Server 2008. Hyper-V Server Release 2 (R2) was made available in September 2009, its main feature being the inclusion of [[Windows Powershell]] v2 for greater CLI control, and the updated Windows Server 2008 R2 code base.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Hyper-V.png|275px|thumb|right|Hyper-V architecture]]
Hyper-V supports isolation in terms of a ''partition''. A partition is a logical unit of isolation, supported by the hypervisor, in which [[operating system]]s execute. A hypervisor instance has to have at least one ''parent partition'', running [[Windows Server 2008]]. The virtualization stack runs in the parent partition and has direct access to the hardware devices. The parent partition then creates the ''child partitions'' which host the guest OSs. A parent partition creates child partitions using the ''hypercall'' API, which is the [[application programming interface]] exposed by Hyper-V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Benchmarking Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 | url=http://capitalhead.com/articles/benchmarking-hyper-v-on-windows-server-2008-r2-x64.aspx | accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A virtualized partition does not have access to the physical [[central processing unit|processor]], nor does it handle its real [[interrupt]]s. Instead, it has a virtual view of the processor and runs in ''Guest Virtual Address'', which, depending on the configuration of the hypervisor, might not necessarily be the entire [[virtual memory|virtual address space]]. A hypervisor could choose to expose only a subset of the processors to each partition. The hypervisor handles the interrupts to the processor, and redirects them to the respective partition using a logical ''Synthetic Interrupt Controller'' (SynIC).  Hyper-V can hardware accelerate the address translation of Guest Virtual Address-spaces by using second level address translation provided by the CPU, referred to as EPT on Intel and NPT on AMD.

Child partitions do not have direct access to hardware resources, but instead have a virtual view of the resources, in terms of ''virtual devices''. Any request to the virtual devices is redirected via the ''VMBus'' to the devices in the parent partition, which will manage the requests. The VMBus is a logical channel which enables inter-partition communication. The response is also redirected via the VMBus. If the devices in the parent partition are also virtual devices, it will be redirected further until it reaches the parent partition, where it will gain access to the physical devices. Parent partitions run a ''Virtualization Service Provider'' (VSP), which connects to the VMBus and handles device access requests from child partitions. Child partition virtual devices internally run a ''Virtualization Service Client'' (VSC), which redirect the request to VSPs in the parent partition via the VMBus. This entire process is transparent to the guest OS.

Virtual Devices can also take advantage of a Windows Server Virtualization feature, named ''Enlightened I/O'', for storage, networking and graphics subsystems, among others. Enlightened I/O is specialized virtualization-aware implementation of high level communication protocols like [[SCSI]] to take advantage of VMBus directly, that allows bypassing any device emulation layer. This makes the communication more efficient, but requires the guest OS to support Enlightened I/O.  [[Windows Server 2008]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], and [[SUSE Linux]] are currently the only operating systems that support Enlightened I/O, allowing them therefore to run faster as guest operating systems under Hyper-V than other operating systems that need to use slower emulated hardware.

==System requirements / specifications==
{{See also|Windows Server 2008#System_requirements}}
*Host operating system:

** Hyper-V supports both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) guest VMs.

===Microsoft Hyper-V Server===
The stand-alone Hyper-V Server variant does not require an existing installation of Windows Server 2008 nor Windows Server 2008 R2. The standalone installation is called Microsoft Hyper-V Server for the non-R2 version and Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 R2. Microsoft Hyper-V server is built with components of Windows and has a Windows Server Core user experience. None of the other roles of Windows Server are available in Microsoft Hyper-V Server. This version supports up to 64 VMs per system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v-server/en/us/faq.aspx|title=Microsoft Hyper-V Server:Frequently asked questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;System requirements of Microsoft Hyper-V server are the same for supported guest operating systems and processor, but differ in the following :&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/hyper-v-server/en/us/system-requirements.aspx |title=Microsoft Hyper-V Server: System Requirements |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RAM: Minimum: 1 GB RAM; Recommended: 2 GB RAM or greater; Maximum 1 TB.
*Available disk space: Minimum: 8 GB; Recommended: 20 GB or greater.

Guest operating systems with ''Enlightened I/O'' and a [[hypervisor]]-aware kernel such as [[Windows Server 2008]] and later server versions, [[Windows Vista]] SP1 and later clients and offerings from Citrix XenServer and Novell will be able to use the host resources better since VSC drivers in these guests communicate with the VSPs directly over VMBus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianmadden.com/content/article/Microsoft-Windows-Server-2008--Hyper-V-solution-overview Hyper-V solution overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Non-enlightened operating systems will run with emulated I/O;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.zdnet.co.uk/software/os/0,1000001098,39352929,00.htm Microsoft's Hyper-V: why all the fuss?]&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''integration components'' (which include the VSC drivers) are available for [[Windows Server 2003]] SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and Linux to achieve better performance. [[Xen]]-enabled Linux guest distributions can also be [[paravirtualization|paravirtualized]] in Hyper-V. Currently, only [[SUSE Linux]] Enterprise Server 10 SP1/SP2 x86 and x64 Editions are officially supported by Microsoft in this way,&lt;ref name=&quot;InfoWeek&quot;&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/server_virtualization/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207401993 Microsoft Hyper-V To Flaunt Advanced Virtualization Features]&lt;/ref&gt; though any Xen-enabled Linux should be able to run. In February 2008, [[Red Hat]] and Microsoft signed a virtualization pact for hypervisor interoperability with their respective server operating systems, to enable [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] 5 to be officially supported on Hyper-V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=2046 Microsoft and Red Hat sign virtualization pact]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux support===
In July 2009 Microsoft submitted Hyper-V drivers to the kernel, which improve the performance of virtual [[Linux]] guest systems in a Windows hosted environment. Microsoft was forced to submit the code when it was discovered that Microsoft had incorporated a Hyper-V network driver with GPL-licensed components statically linked to closed-source binaries.
Hyper-V provides basic virtualization support for Linux guests out of the box. [[Paravirtualization]] support is, however, available by installing the [http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26837 Linux Integration Components]  or [http://www.xen.org/download/satori.html Satori InputVSC] drivers. On July 20, 2009, Microsoft submitted these drivers for inclusion in the [[Linux kernel]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2009/Jul09/07-20LinuxQA.mspx |title=Microsoft Contributes Linux Drivers to Linux Community: Roundtable Q&amp;A: Sam Ramji, senior director of Platform Strategy at Microsoft, and Tom Hanrahan, director of Microsoftâs Open Source Technology Center, discuss the companyâs release of Linux device driver code under General Public License v2 |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2009-07-20 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that kernels from 2.6.32 may include inbuilt Hyper-V paravirtualization support.

==VHD compatibility with Virtual Server 2005 and Virtual PC 2004/2007==
Hyper-V, like Virtual Server 2005 and Virtual PC 2004/2007, saves each guest OS to a single virtual hard disk file with the extension [[VHD (file format)|.VHD]]. This file contains the entire guest OS, though other files can also be configured to allow &quot;undo information&quot; etc.

Older .vhd files from Virtual Server 2005 and Virtual PC 2004/2007 can be copied and used by Windows 2008 Hyper-V Server, but the old &quot;Virtual Machine add-ons&quot; require removing prior to migration. After the migrated guest OS is configured and started using Hyper-V, the guest OS will detect changes to the (virtual) hardware. Installing &quot;Hyper-V Integration Services&quot; installs five services to improve performance, at the same time adding the new Guest Video and Network Card drivers. Consequently later versions of Windows may require re-activation.  Virtual Server 2005 R2 SP1 supports guest operating systems OS/2 4.5 and Solaris 10 while Hyper-V does not.

==Limitations==
===USB passthrough===
Hyper-V does not support virtualized USB ports or COM ports. &lt;ref&gt; [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744892(WS.10).aspx Hyper-V FAQ] &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd239204(v=ws.10).aspx Known Issues with Running Windows Small Business Server 2008 in a Hyper-V Environment] &lt;/ref&gt; However, a workaround to access USB drives in Windows guest VMs involves using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client to &quot;share&quot; host drives with guests over a [[Remote Desktop Services|Remote Desktop]] Connection.

Other techniques exist to allow USB utilisation, an example would be using a network to USB device and extracting the &quot;usbd.sys&quot; file from the installation media to the host machine.

===Audio===
Audio hardware is not virtualized by Hyper-V although the above Remote Desktop workaround may be used.

===Optical drives pass-through===
Optical drives virtualized in the guest VM are read-only. &lt;ref&gt; [http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winserverhyperv/thread/216845b2-faf4-4c4c-b3d2-8ed1ba72f906/ DVD writer on Hyper-V server] &lt;/ref&gt; Hyper-V does not support the host/root operating system's optical drives to pass-through in guest VMs. As a result, burning to discs, audio CDs, video CD/DVD-Video playback are not supported.

===Graphics issues on the host===
&lt;!--
DO NOT REMOVE THIS PART NOW
1) The problem with graphics performance still persists now, even with the latest Windows versions, when using CPU without EPT feature (e.g. all Intel pre-Nehalem CPUs, such as Core 2). It will not be fixed.
2) In this part there is also mentioned another problem: WS 2k8 R2 won't boot at all with Hyper-V installed on a second-gen (32nm) Core iX CPUs with an integrated GPU. The problem is solved with R2 SP1, but it is certainly not obsolete, and even more certainly it wasn't obsolete on 25 January 2011, when this part of the article was deleted (SP1 was not released then).
--&gt;
When manufacturer-supplied Vista-compatible [[Windows Display Driver Model|(WDDM)]] display drivers are installed on the host OS, most servers and PCs will experience a dramatic drop in graphic performance, including 'page flipping'-like effects when viewing high definition content or scrolling in applications and system hangs when switching between applications on the host; guest systems performance is unaffected. Users may install XP/2003-compatible (Non-WDDM) display drivers but may have compatibility problems and will be unable to use [[Windows Aero|Aero]]. This occurs regardless of whether a VM actually exists or whether any Hyper-V services are running.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poor Host System Performance after RC1 Update (RTM as Well)&quot;&gt;[http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/winserverhyperv/thread/4e1c53f5-0400-4ca9-8819-f942c10881c1 Poor Host System Performance after RC1 Update (RTM as Well)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft recommends to use default VGA drivers (shipped with Windows Server 2008) on the host systems instead of manufacturer- supplied ones,&lt;ref name=&quot;Video performance may decrease when a Windows Server 2008-based computer has the Hyper-V role enabled and an accelerated display adapter installed&quot;&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961661 Video performance may decrease when a Windows Server 2008-based computer has the Hyper-V role enabled and an accelerated display adapter installed]&lt;/ref&gt; however, such drivers, in turn, do not support multiple displays and high resolution configurations, as well as Aero, [[DirectX]], [[DXVA|Hardware-accelerated video decoding]] and other graphic accelerated features, thereby limiting its use on workstations (default VGA drivers do not support e.g. resolutions higher than 1280x1024).

This issue in Windows Server 2008 (not R2) is still not solved. According to a Microsoft specialist's statement, systems with Windows Server 2008 R2 and processors supporting [[Extended Page Table]] are unaffected;&lt;ref name=&quot;GraphicAcceleration_EPT&quot;/&gt; however, at least some users experience an even more significant problem: Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V and manufacturer-supplied graphic drivers installed won't boot at all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/527817/hyper-v-install-blue-screen-video-tdr-failure Hyper-V install = Blue Screen - VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE]&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is fixed in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Live migration===
Hyper-V in Windows Server 2008 (not R2) does not support &quot;live migration&quot; of guest VMs (where &quot;live migration&quot; is defined as maintaining network connections and uninterrupted services during VM migration between physical hosts).  Instead, Hyper-V on Server 2008 Enterprise and Datacenter Editions supports &quot;quick migration&quot;, where a guest VM is suspended on one host and resumed on another host.  This operation happens in the time it takes to transfer the active memory of the guest VM over the network from the first host to the second host.&lt;ref name=&quot;Live Migration&quot;&gt;[http://www.virtualizationteam.com/microsoft/hyper-v/live-migration-vs-quick-migration.html Hyper-V Live Migration vs. Quick Migration]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]], Live Migration is supported with the use of [[Cluster Shared Volumes]] (CSVs). This allows for failover of an individual VM as opposed to the entire host having to failover (it seems that when a node (Hyper-V server, not a VM) fails then each &quot;VM running on the failed node&quot; may migrate to other live nodes independently of &quot;other VMs on the same LUN running on other nodes that share the LUN with the failed node&quot;. In Hyper-V we are clustering the Hyper-V nodes not the VMs.). See also [[Cluster Shared Volumes]]

===Degraded performance for Windows XP VMs===
32-bit Windows XP guests running on Hyper-V experience degraded CPU and I/O performance because the Windows XP kernel frequently accesses the CPU APIC's ''Task Priority Register'' (TPR) which Hyper-V intercepts putting more overhead on the hypervisor. &lt;ref name=&quot;XPHyperVTPR&quot;&gt; [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee407540(WS.10).aspx Degraded I/O Performance using a Windows XP Virtual Machine with Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V] &lt;/ref&gt; While there is no resolution for this issue, some Intel CPUs include a technology called vTPR which works around this issue. AMD CPUs have a software workaround. 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows XP x64 Edition and Windows Vista and later Windows versions are not affected.

===NIC teaming===
Network card teaming or [[link aggregation]] is only supported if the NIC manufacturer supplied drivers support NIC teaming. &lt;ref&gt; [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968703 Microsoft Support Policy for NIC Teaming with Hyper-V] &lt;/ref&gt;
