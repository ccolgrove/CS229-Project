'''Sir Thomas Daniel &quot;Tom&quot; Courtenay''' ({{IPA-en|ËkÉrtni|pron}}; born 25 February 1937) is an English actor who came to prominence in the early 1960s with a succession of films including ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'' (1962), ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' (1963), and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Dr. Zhivago]]'' (1965). Since the mid-1960s he has been known primarily for his work in the theatre. Courtenay received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] in February 2001 for forty years' service to cinema and theatre. Courtenay is the President of [[Hull City A.F.C.]]'s Official Supporters Club. In 1999, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by [[Hull University]].

==Early life==
Courtenay was born in [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of Annie Eliza ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] Quest) and Thomas Henry Courtenay, a boat painter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Tom-Courtenay.html Tom Courtenay Biography (1937-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Kingston High School, Hull|Kingston High School]] there. Courtenay studied drama at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London.

==Career==
Courtenay made his stage dÃ©but in 1960 with the [[Old Vic]] theatre company at the Lyceum, Edinburgh, before taking over from [[Albert Finney]] in the title role of ''[[Billy Liar]]'' at the [[Cambridge Theatre]] in 1961. In 1963 he would play that same title role in the film version, directed by [[John Schlesinger]]. He said of Albert Finney, &quot;We both have the same problem, overcoming the flat harsh speech of the North.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Films in Review'', February 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Courtenay's film debut was in 1962 with ''[[Private Potter]]'', directed by Finnish-born director [[Caspar Wrede]], who had first spotted Courtenay while he was still at RADA. This was followed by ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'', directed by [[Tony Richardson]] and ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'', two highly acclaimed films and performances which helped usher in the [[British New Wave]] of the early-to-mid '60s. For these performance Courtenay was awarded the 1962 [[BAFTA Award]] for most promising newcomer and the 1963 [[BAFTA Award]] for best actor respectively. For his role as the dedicated revolutionary leader Pasha Antipov in ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965), he was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], but was bested by [[Martin Balsam]]. Among his other well-known films is ''[[King &amp; Country]]'', directed by [[Joseph Losey]], where he played opposite [[Dirk Bogarde]]; the all-star war film,  ''[[Operation Crossbow]]'', directed by [[Michael Anderson (director)|Michael Anderson]] (starring [[George Peppard]] and [[Sophia Loren]]); and ''[[The Night of the Generals]]'', directed by [[Anatole Litvak]] with [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Omar Sharif]].

Despite being catapulted to fame by the aforementioned films, Courtenay has said that he has not particularly enjoyed film acting;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/09/03/btroyal03.xml &quot;A master in the round&quot;, ''Daily Telegraph'', 09/2001]&lt;/ref&gt; and from the mid-1960s concentrated more on stage work. In 1968 Courtenay began a long association with [[Manchester]] when he played in [[The Playboy of the Western World]] for the Century Theatre at [[Manchester University]] directed by [[Michael Elliott]]. The theatre was a precursor of the [[Royal Exchange Theatre]], which was founded in 1976 where he was to give many performances, firstly under the direction of Casper Wrede.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Braham &quot;The Worst It Can be is A Disaster&quot;, A &amp; C Black,2007, 0 9512017 1 9&lt;/ref&gt; His first roles for the Royal Exchange were as Faulkland in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Sheridan's]] [[The Rivals]] and the hero of [[Heinrich von Kleist|von Kleist's]] ''The Prince of Homburg''. Since then he has played a variety of roles, including in 1999 the leading role in the theatre's production of ''[[King Lear]]'', and in 2001 ''[[Uncle Vanya]]''.

Courtenay's working relationship with Wrede returned to film when he played the title role in the latter's 1970 production of ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (film)|One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''. His best known film role since then was in ''[[The Dresser]]'', from [[Ronald Harwood]]'s play of the same name (in which he also appeared) with [[Albert Finney]]. Both Courtenay and Finney received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] in the 1984 [[Academy Awards]] for their roles, losing to [[Robert Duvall]]. He played the father of Derek Bentley ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) in the 1991 film ''[[Let Him Have It]]''.  

Courtenay's television and radio appearances have been relatively few, but have included ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' in 1971 on [[BBC]] and several [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] plays. He appeared in ''[[I Heard the Owl Call My Name]]'' on US television in 1973. In 1994 he starred with [[Peter Ustinov]] in a [[Disney Channel]] 'made for television' version of ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]''. Rather unexpecedly, he had a cameo role as the anthropologist [[BronisÅaw Malinowski]] in the 1995 US TV movie [[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles|Young Indiana Jones and the Treasure of the Peacock's Eye]]. In 1998 he teamed with [[Albert Finney]] again for the acclaimed BBC drama ''[[A Rather English Marriage]]''. He played the role of God, opposite [[Sebastian Graham-Jones]], in Ben Steiner's radio play &quot;A Brief Interruption&quot;, broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2004. Also for Radio 4, he played the title role in Nick Leather's ''The Domino Man of Lancashire'' and ''Maurice'' in Richard Lumsden's ''Man in the Moon'', both broadcast in 2007.  Courtenay also appeared in the 2008 Christmas special of the BBC show [[The Royle Family]], playing the role of Dave's father, David Senior.

In 2002, based on an idea by Michael Godley, Courtenay compiled a one-man show ''Pretending To Be Me'' based on the letters and writings of poet [[Philip Larkin]], which first played at the [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]] in [[Leeds]]. It later transferred to the [[Comedy Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Courtenay records in an interview in the newspaper [[The Independent]] (12.2.2002) that he was unhappy about initially being credited as the &quot;author&quot; of the show. The connection between Courtenay and Larkin is the city of Hull, the former's home town and the latter's adopted town. http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre/features/tom-courtenay-put-yourself-in-larkins-shoes-609599.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007 Courtenay appeared in two films: ''[[Flood (film)|Flood]]'', a disaster epic in which London is overwhelmed by floods, and ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', an adaptation of [[Philip Pullman|Philip Pullman's]] novel, playing the part of Farder Coram. In 2008 he appeared in the BBC adaptation of ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' by ''[[Charles Dickens]]'', playing William Dorrit, and the Christmas edition of ''[[The Royle Family]]'', playing David (Senior).

In March 2011, multiple media sites reported that Courtenay has joined the cast of ''[[Gambit]]'', a film starring [[Colin Firth]] scheduled to begin filming in May.

==Personal life==
Courtenay was married to actress [[Cheryl Kennedy]] from 1973 to 1982. In 1988, he married Isabel Crossley, a stage manager at the Royal Exchange Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A master in the round&quot;, ''Daily Telegraph'', 09/2001. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/09/03/btroyal03.xml&lt;/ref&gt; They have homes in Manchester and [[Putney]] in London.

In 2000, Courtenay's memoir ''Dear Tom: Letters From Home'' was published to critical acclaim. It comprises a selection of the letters exchanged between Courtenay and his mother, interspersed with his own recollections of life as a young student actor in London in the early 1960s.
