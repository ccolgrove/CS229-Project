==History==
The International Evangelistic Association was founded in [[1952]] by [[Reverend]] [[Everett Swanson]] to help children orphaned by war in [[South Korea]]. He traveled there to preach the gospel to the troops of the army but during his visit he saw children orphaned by the war. In 1953, he began to raise funds and the next year he developed sponsorship programs to help support orphans for a few dollars a month. For thirty-eight dollars a month, a sponsor such as yourself, can provide Biblical lessons, food, clothing, shelter and medical aid on a regular basis for the children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compassion.com/sponsor_a_child/default.htm [http://www.compassion.com/about/history/1950s/default.htm Christian Child Sponsorship - Compassion - Compassion International - 1950s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the association changed to Compassion in 1963, inspired on Jesus' words &quot;I have compassion on the multitude. I will not send them away hungry&quot; ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew 15.32]]).

===Canada===
The same year Compassion Canada was formed. This is the organization's Canadian branch. Based in [[London, Ontario]], it was founded by Bob and Janet Forsyth of [[Blenheim, Ontario]], who wanted to expand Compassion's ministry from the United States to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Co-Operation for Habitat and Urban Development|publisher=Organization for Economic Co-ope|year=1997|isbn=9264055371|pages=128|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XmPsomRrQzsC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=%22Compassion+Canada%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
