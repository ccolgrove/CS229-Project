'''MTV Russia''' ({{lang-ru|MTV Ð Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸Ñ}}) is a [[Russian language]] [[free-to-air]] 24 hour entertainment and music service seen in 22 million households in [[Moscow]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Omsk]], [[Voronezh]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Chelyabinsk]] and [[Yekaterinburg]], among other cities.

==History==
*Through a multi-year licensing agreement with [[BIZ Enterprises]], MTV Russia became the first western television network customized specifically for Russian youth in 1998. In January 2000, [[MTV Networks International]] acquired an equity position in MTV Russia. As of 2007, the channel could be viewed in 724 towns all over the former [[USSR]].

*Targeting 14 to 34 year olds, the advertiser-supported network features a mixture of music videos from Russian and international artists programmed locally from its Moscow production base. MTV Russia VJs cover the Russian music scene and introduce locally relevant programming. Its main domestic rival is [[Muz-TV]], a music channel based in Moscow.

*Since 2005, in the face of rising competition from [[TNT (Russia)|TNT]] and [[STS (TV channel)|STS]], MTV Russia has moved away from music videos and towards talk shows, the coverage of Moscow nightlife, and producing its own TV series.

*Since April 10, 2010, MTV Russia has adopted the same onscreen logo as MTV US. The channel continues to share the  same onscreen identity as MTV International which launched July 1, 2009
