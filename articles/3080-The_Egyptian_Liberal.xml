It is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports. Alexandria is also an important tourist resort. It is home to the ''[[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]'' (the new [[Library of Alexandria]]). It is an important industrial centre because of its [[natural gas]] and [[Pipeline transport|oil pipeline]]s from [[Suez]].

Alexandria was founded around a small [[Ancient Egypt|pharaonic]] town ''c.'' 331 BC by [[Alexander the Great]]. It remained Egypt's capital for nearly a thousand years, until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at [[Fustat]] (Fustat was later absorbed into [[Cairo]]). Alexandria was known because of its [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (''Pharos''), one of the ''[[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]''; its library (the largest library in the ancient world); and the [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa]], one of the [[Wonders of the Middle Ages|Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages]]. Ongoing [[maritime archaeology]] in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named [[Rhacotis]] existed there, and during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

From the late 19th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the [[Red Sea]], and the lucrative trade in [[Egyptian cotton]].

[[File:The Roman Theatre in Alexandria.JPG|thumb|270px|An ancient Roman [[theatre]] in Alexandria]]
Alexandria was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in April 331 BC as {{polytonic|á¼Î»ÎµÎ¾Î¬Î½Î´ÏÎµÎ¹Î±}} (''AlexÃ¡ndreia''). Alexander's [[Architecture|chief architect]] for the project was [[Dinocrates]]. Alexandria was intended to supersede [[Naucratis]] as a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich [[Nile|Nile Valley]]. An Egyptian city, [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]], already existed on the shore, and later gave its name to Alexandria in the [[Egyptian language]] (Egyptian '''*RaË-á¸²Äá¹­it''', written ''rË-á¸³á¹­y.t'', 'That which is built up'). It continued to exist as the Egyptian quarter of the city. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to his city. After Alexander's departure, his viceroy, [[Cleomenes of Naucratis|Cleomenes]], continued the expansion. Following a struggle with the other successors of Alexander, his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] succeeded in bringing Alexander's body to Alexandria.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Although Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's continuous development, the ''Heptastadion'' and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and becoming the centre of the new commerce between Europe and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than [[Carthage]]. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with [[Greeks|Greek people]] from diverse backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece &amp; Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume= 42 |issue= 1  |month=April | date=1995-04 | author=Erskine, Andrew |pages=pp 38â48 [42] |quote=One effect of the newly created Hellenistic kingdoms was the imposition of Greek cities occupied by Greeks on an alien landscape. In Egypt, there was a native Egyptian population with its own culture, history, and traditions. The Greeks who came to Egypt, to the court or to live in Alexandria, were separated from their original cultures. Alexandria was the main Greek city of Egypt and within it there was an extraordinary mix of Greeks from many cities and backgrounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandria was not only a centre of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]], but was also home to the largest Jewish community in the world. The [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning ([[Library of Alexandria]]), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and [[Egyptians|Egyptian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Culture and Power in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] p. 42-43&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece &amp; Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume= 42 |issue= 1  |month=April | year=1995 | date=1994-04 | author=Erskine, Andrew |pages=pp 38â48 [42â43] |quote=The Ptolemaic emphasis on Greek culture establishes the Greeks of Egypt with an identity for themselves. [â¦] But the emphasis on Greek culture does even more than this â these are Greeks ruling in a foreign land. The more Greeks can indulge in their own culture, the more they can exclude non-Greeks, in other words Egyptians, the subjects whose land has been taken over. The assertion of Greek culture serves to enforce Egyptian subjection. So the presence in Alexandria of two institutions devoted to the preservation and study of Greek culture acts as a powerful symbol of Egyptian exclusion and subjection. Texts from other cultures could be kept in the library, but only once they had been translated, that is to say Hellenized.&lt;br /&gt;[â¦] A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all; indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood, [â¦] This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity. It is no coincidence that one of the few poetic references to Egyptians presents them as muggers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this division arose much of the later turbulence, which began to manifest itself under [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy Philopater]] who reigned from 221â204 BC. The reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]] from 144â116 BC was marked by purges and civil warfare.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The city passed formally under Roman jurisdiction in 80 BC, according to the will of [[Ptolemy X Alexander I|Ptolemy Alexander]], but only after it had been under Roman influence for more than a hundred years. It was captured by [[Julius Caesar]] in 47 BC during a Roman intervention in the domestic civil war between king [[Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator|Ptolemy XIII]] and his advisers, and the fabled queen [[Cleopatra VII]]. It was finally captured by [[Augustus|Octavian]], future [[emperor]] Augustus on 1 August 30 BC, with the name of the month later being changed to ''August'' to commemorate his victory.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the [[Kitos War]], which gave [[Hadrian]] and his architect, [[Decriannus]], an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Caracalla]] visited the city and, because of some insulting [[satire]]s that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to [[Capital punishment|put to death]] all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a [[tsunami]] ([[365 Crete earthquake]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ammianus Marcellinus, 26.10.15-19&quot;&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_26_book26.htm#C9 &quot;Res Gestae&quot;, 26.10.15-19]&lt;/ref&gt; an event still annually commemorated 17 hundred years later  as a &quot;day of horror.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stiros, Stathis C.: âThe AD 365 Crete earthquake and possible seismic clustering during the fourth to sixth centuries AD in the Eastern Mediterranean: a review of historical and archaeological dataâ, ''Journal of Structural Geology'', Vol. 23 (2001), pp. 545-562 (549 &amp; 557)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 4th century, persecution of [[Paganism|pagans]] by newly Christian Romans had reached new levels of intensity. In 391, the Patriarch [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]] destroyed all pagan temples in Alexandria under orders from Emperor [[Theodosius I]]. The [[Brucheum]] and Jewish quarters were desolate in the 5th century. On the mainland, life seemed to have centred in the vicinity of the ''Serapeum'' and ''[[Caesareum]]'', both of which became [[Christian Church|Christian churches]]. The ''[[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]]'' and ''Heptastadium'' quarters, however, remained populous and were left intact.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 619, Alexandria [[Sassanid conquest of Egypt|fell]] to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. Although the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general [['Amr ibn al-'As|Amr ibn al-As]] captured it during the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], after a siege that lasted 14 months.

Alexandria figured prominently in the [[military operation]]s of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]] in 1798. French troops stormed the town on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the [[Battle of Alexandria (1801)|Battle of Alexandria]] on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the town, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], the Ottoman Governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Modern&quot;{{citation |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111760/modern.htm |accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied. In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the [[Lavon Affair]]. On October 26, 1954, Alexandria's [[Mansheyya Square]] was the site of a failed [[Assassination|assassination attempt]] on [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Thornton, &quot;Nasser Assassination Attempt, October 26, 1954,&quot; Middle East History Database{{citation |url=http://www.nmhtthornton.com/mehistorydatabase/nasser_assassination_attempt.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout of the ancient city===
[[File:alexandria egypt.jpg|thumb|300px|Alexandria from space, March 1990]]
[[File:AlexandriaMap1.jpg|thumb|300px|Location of Alexandria on the map of [[Egypt]]]]
Greek Alexandria was divided into three regions:
;Brucheum
:the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;
;The Jewish quarter
:forming the northeast portion of the city;
;Rhakotis
:The old city of [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] that had been absorbed into Alexandria. It was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''RakotÉ'' &quot;Alexandria&quot;).

Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; and the line of the great EastâWest &quot;Canopic&quot; street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.

Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]] nearly a mile long (1260 m) and called the ''Heptastadion'' (&quot;seven stadia&quot;âa ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately 180&amp;nbsp;m). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the &quot;Moon Gate&quot; rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern &quot;Ras al-Tiin&quot; quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tiin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.

In [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.

#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the &quot;Private Port,&quot; and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.
#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by Caesar as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]
#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater
#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]
#The Emporium (Exchange)
#The Apostases (Magazines)
#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole
#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, which become known as â[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s,â and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.
#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.
#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; site unknown.
#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.
#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.
#The [[Serapeum]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near âPompey's Pillar,â which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.

The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be 138&amp;nbsp;meters (450&amp;nbsp;ft) high, was situated. The first [[Ptolemy]] began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&amp;nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&amp;nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.

In the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens (from a papyrus dated 32 AD), in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 500,000 to over 1,000,000, making it one of the largest cities ever built before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.

==Ancient remains==
[[File:Alex Sawary.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman [[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]]]
Due to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbor due to [[earthquake]] [[subsidence]], and the rest has been built over in modern times.

&quot;[[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]&quot;, a [[Roman triumphal column]], is one of the best-known [[ancient monument]]s still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient [[acropolis]]âa modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab [[cemetery]]âand was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its [[pedestal]], it is 30&amp;nbsp;m (99&amp;nbsp;ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, 2.7 meters in diameter at the base, tapering to 2.4 meters at the top. The shaft is {{convert|88|ft|m}} high made out of a single piece of granite. This would be 132 cubic meters or approximately 396 tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://touregypt.net/featurestories/sarapeiona.htm |title=The Sarapeion, including Pompay's Pillar In Alexandria, Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date= |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Egyptian pyramids|The Pyramids]] and Sphinx by Desmond Stewart and editors of the Newsweek Book Division 1971 p. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt; Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient [[obelisk]]s. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several [[Obelisks#Obelisk erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiments]] including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=NOVA Online &amp;#124; Mysteries of the Nile &amp;#124; 27 August 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[TimeâLife|Time Life]] Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993)p. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. &quot;Pompey's Pillar&quot; is a [[misnomer]], as it has nothing to do with [[Pompey]], having been erected in 293 for [[Diocletian]], possibly in memory of the rebellion of [[Domitius Domitianus]]. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god [[Serapis]] were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, a lot of ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.

Alexandria's [[catacombs]], known as ''[[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom al-Shoqafa]]'', are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large [[Stairway|spiral staircase]], and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other [[syncretism|syncretic]] Romano-Egyptian [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], burial niches, and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in the 1800s.

The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as ''Kom al-Dikka''. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its [[Thermae|Roman-era baths]].

==Antiquities==
Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history.

The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898â1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.

Since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tidal waves, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |title=Fgs Project Alexandria |publisher=Underwaterdiscovery.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |title=Divers probe underwater palace |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]]. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/940333.stm |title=New underwater tourist attraction in Egypt |publisher=BBC News |date=24 September 2000 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman [[stratum|strata]].

The most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of âPompey's Pillarâ, where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.

The objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom al-Shoqqafa]] (Roman) and Ras al-Tiin (painted).

The German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of ''Kom al-Dikka'', which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.

The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of âPompey's Pillarâ.

===Islam===
The most famous mosque in Alexandria is [[El-Mursi Abul Abbas Mosque]] in [[Bahary]]. Other notable mosques in the city include [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] mosque in Somouha, [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]] mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, and Sultan mosque.

===Christianity===
After Rome, Alexandria was considered the major seat of [[Christianity]] in the world. The [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] was the second ''among equals'', second only to the bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] until 430. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over the entire continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on the constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.

Today, the patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] in Ramleh. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] &amp; [[Pope Peter of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara, and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.

The most important [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are Saint Anargyri Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]] Church, [[Gabriel|Archangels Gabriel]] &amp; [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Saint Catherine Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, Saint Georges Church, Church of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Ibrahemeya, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, Saint Mark &amp; [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nectarios]] Chapel in Ramleh, [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, and [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel. In communion with the Greek Orthodox Church is the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.

Churches that follow the Latin Catholic rite include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra.

The Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], found as part of [[CollÃ¨ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|CollÃ¨ge Saint Marc]] is multi-denominational and hold liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.

===Judaism===
Alexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], after which negative reactions towards [[Zionism]] among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt left to the newly established [[Israel|State of Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]], and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue Egypt to restore Alexandriaâs historic synagogue], (December 20, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important [[synagogue]] in Alexandria is the [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]].

==Education==

===Colleges and universities===
Alexandria has a number of higher education institutions. [[Alexandria University]] is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Alexandria Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] &amp; [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, the [[Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC [[American University in Cairo]] because of its worldwide recognition from (board of engineers at UK &amp; ABET in US). [[Senghor University|UniversitÃ© Senghor]] is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly targets students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].

===Schools===
Alexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include [[CollÃ¨ge de la MÃ¨re de Dieu]], CollÃ¨ge Notre Dame de Sion, [[CollÃ¨ge Saint Marc, Alexandria|CollÃ¨ge Saint Marc]], Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), Ãcole GÃ©rard, Ãcole Saint Gabriel, Ãcole Saint-Vincent de Paul, Ãcole saint joseph, Ãcole Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established LycÃ©e el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Ãcole Champollion. It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria.

English schools in Alexandria are fewer in number and more recently established, in comparison with the French schools. The most important English language schools in the city include Alexandria Language School(AlS), Alexandria American School, British School of Alexandria, Egyptian American School, Modern American School, Sidi Gaber Language Schools, Riada American school, Taymour English School (TES), Sacred Heart Girls' School (SHS), [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], [[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]], previously called (Scottish School for Girls), [[Kaumeya Language School]] (KLS), [[El Nasr Boys' School]] (EBS), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]] (EGC). Most of these schools were nationalized during the era of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], and are currently Egyptian public schools run by the Egyptian ministry of education.

The only German school in Alexandria is the Deutsche Schule der BorromÃ¤rinnen (DSB of Saint Charles BorromÃ©).

The [[Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at [[Alexandria Montessori]].

N.B: The most notable public schools in Alexandria include, AlAbasseia High School, Gamal Abdel Nasser High School and [[EL Manar language School for girls]].

===Airports===
Alexandria is served by [[Alexandria International Airport (Egypt)|Alexandria International Airport]] and [[Borg El Arab Airport|Borg al Arab Airport]] which is located about 25&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre.

From late 2011, Alexandria International  will be closed to commercial operations for two years as it undergoes expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg al Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | title = A new gateway for Alexandria  | newspaper = [[Al-Ahram Weekly]]  | url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/954/sk1.htm  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train===
Alexandria's intracity [[commuter rail]] system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity [[train station|railway station]]) to [[Abu Qir]], parallel to the [[Alexandria Tram|tram line]]. The commuter line's [[locomotives]] operate on [[diesel locomotive|diesel]], as opposed to the [[railway electrification system#Overhead systems|overhead-electric]] tram.

Alexandria plays host to two intercity rail stations: the aforementioned [[Misr Station]] (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and [[Sidi Gaber Station]] (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]].

===Tram===
{{Main|Alexandria Tram}}
An extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa.

===Buses===
Public buses are operated by Alexandria Governorate's Agency for Public Passenger Transport.

Modern [[air conditioned]] red [[double-decker bus]]es run the length of the Courniche. Fare (any distance) is 3 L.E. ([[Egyptian pound]]) (Â£0.33/0.39â¬/$0.52) ({{as of|January 2011|lc=on}}).

===Taxis and minibuses===
{{see also|Taxicabs by country#Egypt}}
Taxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black [[livery]] and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry [[taximeter|meters]], these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.

The [[minibus]] [[share taxi]] system, or ''[[Share taxi#MashrÅ«` (Egypt)|mashrÅ«`]]'' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:
*Corniche routes:
**Mandara-Bahari
**Mandara-Manshia
**Assafra-Bahari
**Assafra-Manshia
**Al-Sa'aa-Manshia
*Abu Qir routes
**Mandara-El Mahata (i.e. Misr Station)
**Abu Qir-El Mahata
**Victoria-El Mahata
**Mandara-Victoria
*Interior routes
**Cabo-Bahari
**Manshia-El Awayid
**Manshia-Al Mouqif Al Gadid (the New Bus Station)

The route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.

Fare is generally L.E. 1.25 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.

===Port===

The [[port]] is divided into:
*The Eastern Harbour

===Libraries===
[[File:Poseidon and the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
[[File:BA night over.jpg|thumb|The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, a modern project based on reviving the ancient [[Library of Alexandria]].]]
The Royal Library of Alexandria in Alexandria, [[Egypt]], was once the largest [[library]] in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BCE, during the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II of Egypt]]. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the Library complex, the temple of the [[Muse]]sâthe [[Musaeum|Museion]], Greek ''ÎÎ¿ÏÏÎµÎ¯Î¿Î½'' (from which the [[modern English]] word ''[[museum#Etymology|museum]]'' is derived).

It has been reasonably established that the Library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy. The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] was inaugurated in 2003 near the site of the old Library.

*The Alexandria National Museum was inaugurated 31 December 2003. It is located in a restored Italian style palace in Tariq Al-Horreya Street (former Rue Fouad), near the centre of the city. It contains about 1,800 artifacts that narrate the story of Alexandria and [[Egypt]]. Most of these pieces came from other Egyptian museums.
The museum is housed in the old Al-Saad Bassili Pasha Palace, who was one of the wealthiest wood merchants in Alexandria. Construction on the site was first undertaken in 1926.

===Related words===
* '''''al-Iskandariyya(h)''''' (Ø§ÙØ¥Ø³ÙÙØ¯Ø±ÙØ©) (noun) (formal): Refers to the city of &quot;Alexandria&quot;, used in formal texts and speech. Its [[Egyptian Arabic]] equivalent is '''''Eskenderreya''''' or '''''Iskindereyya(h)'''''. ''Iskandariyya(h)'' and ''Eskendereyya(h)'' are different in pronunciation, though they have the same [[spelling]] when written in Arabic. In [[Modern Standard Arabic]], ''Iskandariyya(h)'' always takes the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] ''al-'', whereas in Egyptian Arabic, ''Eskendereyya(h)'' either never takes  ''al-'' or it does but is then [[elision|elided]] into the main word, depending on one's linguistic opinion; the effect, however, is the same. The optional ''h'' at the end of both of them is called a ''[[TÄÊ¾ marbÅ«á¹­a|ta' marbuta]]'' which is not usually pronounced, but is always written.

[[File:GD-EG-Alex-Stade002.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandria Stadium]]]]
The main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. [[Alexandria Stadium]] is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in Alexandria, [[Egypt]]. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 African Cup of Nations]]. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt and Africa, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the [[Africa Cup of Nations|African Cup of Nations]] in January 2006, which [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] won.

===Literature===
Two writers loom large over the modern literature of Alexandria: [[C.P. Cavafy]], the Alexandria-born Greek poet, and the Indian-born Briton [[Lawrence Durrell]], author of ''[[The Alexandria Quartet]]''. Cavafy incorporated Greek history and mythology and his homosexuality into his poetry. Durrell used the cosmopolitan city as a landscape to explore human desires. Of Arabic novels set in Alexandria [[Naguib Mahfouz]]'s ''[[Miramar (novel)|Miramar]]'' is the best known. In the 2000s writers such as [[Jon Courtenay Grimwood]], [[Ki Longfellow]], and Keith Miller have used Alexandria as a setting for [[speculative fiction]].
