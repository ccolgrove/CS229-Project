OWS was preceded and partly inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] and [[2010â2011 Greek protests|Greek]], [[2011 Spanish protests|Spanish]], [[2011 United Kingdom anti-austerity protests|British]], [[2011 Chilean protests|Chilean]], and [[2011 Israeli middle class protests|Israeli]] protest movements. A precursor in the United States was the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] occurring from late winter through the spring.

According to [http://15october.net/ 15october.net], as of October 15, 2011, the protests spread to more than 1,000 cities in 82 countries and formed a [[&quot;Occupy&quot; protests|single global protest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=October 2011|reason=what are credentials of this website? no wikipedia article. a mainstream and third-party &quot;reliable source&quot;? to support?}}[http://15october.net/]. 15october.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''November 13 (day 58)'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Occupy Portland camp is, first, defended by the people of the City of Portland, and then cleared by Portland Police Bureau, with the assistance of local, state, and international police forces. A tense stand-off began at midnight and lasted until dawn, with the People forcing the retreat of the Police, until, exhausted and confused, the People were finally pushed out of their encampment when, early on Sunday morning, the Police made an unexpected raid on the camp, violently forcing out the remaining Occupants. The clearing of the camp included multiple arrests, mostly involving campers sitting and Police arresting them without incident. Multiple campers, who were not arrested, were injured at the hands of Police.  
The clearing of the camp was followed by another standoff at the intersection of SW Main and 4th Avenue. The final stand-off of the day came to an end as the Police made another assault on the people, and on the Constitution, by forcing the move of a General Assembly taking place in the street. Few arrests were made, as only two protestors made symbolic stands against the unConstitutional assault by the Police. The Assembly, in the moments before the Police &quot;cleared the street&quot;, made a decision to move their body to Pioneer Square and continue their discussion there. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wweek.com/portland/article-18220-chaos_to_checkmate.html/|title=chaos to checkmate.|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
