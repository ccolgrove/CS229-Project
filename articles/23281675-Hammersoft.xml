The '''1950 Princeton Tigers football team''' represented [[Princeton University]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[college football|intercollegiate competition]] during the [[1950 college football season|1950 season]]. The Tigers were led by sixth-year head coach [[Charlie Caldwell]], a future [[College Football Hall of Fame]] inductee, who utilized an &quot;unbalanced&quot; version of the [[single-wing formation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coachwyatt.com/singlewing.html A Very Brief Look at &quot;the&quot; Single-Wing], Coach Wyatt, retrieved June 19, 2009. [http://www.webcitation.org/5hj0bNYML Archived] 2009-06-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Princeton offense, which made use of the [[buck-lateral series]], was one of the last successful employers of the single-wing formation, which had been made obsolete by the modernized T formation.&lt;ref&gt;Masin, Herman L., [It Fit the Millennium To A T! http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-27450841_ITM], ''Coach and Athletic Director'', 2000, retrieved August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton finished with a perfect undefeated record of 9â0, and the Tigers outscored their opponents 349â94. Against other [[Ivy League]] teams, Princeton compiled a 5â0 record and outscored their opponents 184â45, although the conference did not begin awarding a football championship until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=307&amp;year=1950 1950 Princeton Tigers], College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved June 19, 2009.

Some selectors named Princeton the national champions, most notably the NCAA-recognized [[Poling System]] and [[Boand System]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;National Poll Champions&quot;, [http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2007/2007RB.pdf ''2007 NCAA Division I Football Records Book''] (PDF), p. 77, National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2007.
