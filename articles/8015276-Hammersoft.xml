<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="8015276" ns="0" title="Al-Qaeda guest houses, Faisalabad"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The [[United States|American]] [[intelligence analysts]] who compiled the justifications for continuing to detain the captives taken in the [[war on terror]] made dozens of references to an '''[[al Qaida safe house]]''', in '''[[Faisalabad]]''', [[Pakistan]].

Five of the twenty men who face charges before [[Guantanamo military commission]]s were captured in a single raid on a safe house in Faisalabad.  

American and Pakistani counter-terrorism officials have made multiple raids on suspected safe houses in Faisalabad.

One large raid, of what counter-terrorism officials described as an &quot;al-Qaida safe house&quot;, netted dozens of foreigners, from around the world, who the counter-terrorism officials described as suspicious.  The captives however, during their [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, disputed that living with other foreigners should be a trigger for suspicions, when they were all foreign students living in [[Salafi University]]'s foreign student's dormitory.

* American intelligence analysts assert he is a top member of the [[al Qaeda]] leadership.
* Some skeptics assert that he was mentally unstable, and had less serious responsibilities the American intelligence community asserts.
* Was held, until the fall of 2006, in the [[CIA]]'s archipelago of covert interrogation centres, known as the [[black site]]s.
* Was transferred to military custody at Guantanamo in the fall of 2006, with thirteen other &quot;[[high value detainees]]&quot;.
* The Bush administration announced plans for Abu Zubaydah and the other thirteen &quot;high value detainees&quot; to face charges before military commissions.
* The DoD has not convened a [[Competent Tribunal]], to determine whether Abu Zubaydah has broken the laws of war, so that he is not entitled to the protections of [[Prisoner of War]] status, which many legal scholars argue the USA is obliged to do, to fulfill its responsibilities as a signatory of the [[Geneva Conventions]].
* The DoD has not convened a [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]], to determine whether or not Abu Zubaydah should be classified as an [[enemy combatant]].
* A May 28, 2008 article in the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' reported the safehouse was a [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] safehouse.&lt;ref name=HindustanTimes20080528&gt;
