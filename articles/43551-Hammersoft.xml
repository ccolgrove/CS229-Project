A '''ruby''' is a pink to blood-red colored [[gemstone]], a variety of the [[mineral]] [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]). The red color is caused mainly by the presence of the element [[chromium]]. Its name comes from ''ruber'', [[Latin]] for red. Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called [[sapphire]]s. The ruby is considered one of the four [[precious stones]], together with the [[sapphire]], the [[emerald]], and the [[diamond]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=types+of+precious+stone&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=WBW1SvaHLYn4zASD9uT8Dg#v=onepage&amp;q=types%20of%20precious%20stone&amp;f=false ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Prices of rubies are primarily determined by color. The brightest and most valuable &quot;red&quot; called pigeon blood-red, commands a huge premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like [[rutile]] inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated. Cut and [[Carat (unit)|carat]] (weight) are also an important factor in determining the price.

==Physical properties==
[[Image:Corundum.GIF|thumb|left|Crystal structure of ruby]]
Rubies have a [[hardness]] of 9.0 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]. Among the natural gems only [[moissanite]] and [[diamond]] are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissonite falling somewhere in between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Ruby is Î±-alumina (the most stable form of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in which a small fraction of the aluminum&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are replaced by chromium&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Each Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is surrounded octahedrally by six O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This crystallographic arrangement strongly affects each Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in light absorption in the yellow-green region of the spectrum and thus in the red color of the gem. When yellow-green light is absorbed by Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, it is re-emitted as red [[Photoluminescence|luminescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/6AA.html| title = Ruby: causes of color| accessdate=15 may 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This red emission adds to the red colour perceived by the subtraction of green and violet light from white light, and adds luster to the gem's appearance. When the optical arrangement is such that the emission is stimulated by 694-nanometer photons reflecting back and forth between two mirrors, the emission grows strongly in intensity. This effect was used by [[Theodore Maiman]] in 1960 to make the first successful [[Ruby laser|laser]], based on ruby.

All natural rubies have imperfections in them, including color impurities and inclusions of [[rutile]] needles known as &quot;silk&quot;. Gemologists use these needle inclusions found in natural rubies to distinguish them from synthetics, simulants, or substitutes. Usually the rough stone is heated before cutting. Almost all rubies today are treated in some form, with heat treatment being the most common practice. However, rubies that are completely untreated but still of excellent quality command a large premium.

Some rubies show a 3-point or 6-point [[asterism (gemmology)|asterism]] or &quot;star&quot;. These rubies are cut into [[cabochons]] to display the effect properly. Asterisms are best visible with a single-light source, and move across the stone as the light moves or the stone is rotated. Such effects occur when light is reflected off the &quot;silk&quot; (the structurally oriented [[rutile]] needle inclusions) in a certain way. This is one example where inclusions increase the value of a gemstone. Furthermore, rubies can show color changes â though this occurs very rarely â as well as [[chatoyancy]] or the &quot;cat's eye&quot; effect.

==Natural occurrence==
The [[Mogok]] Valley in Upper [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was for centuries the world's main source for rubies. That region has produced some of the finest rubies ever mined, but in recent years very few good rubies have been found there. The very best color in Myanmar rubies is sometimes described as &quot;pigeon's blood.&quot; In central Myanmar, the area of Mong Hsu began producing rubies during the 1990s and rapidly became the world's main ruby mining area. The most recently found ruby deposit in Myanmar is in Namya (Namyazeik) located in the northern state of [[Kachin State|Kachin]].

Rubies have historically been mined in [[Thailand]], the [[Pailin]] and [[Samlout District]] of [[Cambodia]], [[Burma]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]] and in [[Pakistan]]. Rubies have rarely been found in [[Sri Lanka]], where pink [[sapphire]]s are more common. After the [[Second World War]] ruby deposits were found in [[Tanzania]], [[Madagascar]], [[Vietnam]], [[Nepal]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Pakistan]]. A few rubies have been found in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Montana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[South Carolina]]. More recently, [[Greenland Ruby|large ruby deposits]] have been found under the receding ice shelf of [[Greenland]]. In 2002 rubies were found in the Waseges River area of [[Kenya]].

There are reports of a large deposit of rubies found in 2009 in [[Mozambique]], in [[Nanhumbir]] in the [[Cabo Delgado Province|Cabo Delgado]] district of [[Montepuez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201011050270.html Mozambique: Police Seize Boat With 96 Illegal Immigrants]. AllAfrica. 4 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spinel]], another red gemstone, is sometimes found along with rubies in the same gem gravel or marble. Red spinel may be mistaken for ruby by those lacking experience with gems. However, the finest red spinels can have a value approaching that of the average ruby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wenk, Hans-Rudolf; Bulakh, A. G.|title=Minerals: their constitution and origin|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=0-521-52958-1|pages=539â541|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0GAvKQJ2JuwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting value==
Diamonds are graded using criteria that have become known as the four Cs, namely color, cut, clarity and carat weight. Similarly natural rubies can be evaluated using the four Cs together with their size and geographic origin.

'''Color:''' In the evaluation of colored gemstones, color is the single most important factor. Color divides into three components; ''hue'', ''saturation'' and ''tone''. Hue refers to &quot;color&quot; as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the following hues: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, purple and pink. The first six are known as spectral hues; the last two are modified spectral hues. Purple is a hue that falls halfway between red and blue. Pink is a paler shade of red.&lt;ref name=wise&gt;{{cite book|author=Wise, Richard W.|title=Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones|pages=18â22|isbn=0972822380|year=2006|publisher=Brunswick House Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nature there are rarely pure hues so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. In ruby the primary hue must be red. All other hues of the gem species corundum are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues. Orange, purple, violet and pink are possible.

Image:Cut Ruby.jpg|A cut ruby.&lt;!-- Note that most jewelers would consider this to be very pink for a ruby. Higher quality rubies are a darker red. This stone might even be a pink sapphire.--&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The finest ruby is best described as being a vivid medium-dark toned red. Secondary hues add an additional complication. Pink, orange, and purple are the normal secondary hues in ruby. Of the three, purple is preferred because, firstly, the purple reinforces the red making it appear richer.&lt;ref name=wise/&gt; Secondly, purple occupies a position on the color wheel halfway between red and blue. In Burma where the term pigeon blood originated, rubies are set in pure gold. Pure gold is itself a highly saturated yellow. Set a purplish-red ruby in yellow and the yellow neutralizes its complement blue leaving the stone appearing to be pure red in the setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gemwiseblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2007/11/asking-to-see-pigeons-blood-is-like.html GemWise: What Color is Pigeon's Blood]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments and enhancements==
Improving the quality of gemstones by treating them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a downward pressure on ruby prices.

Improvements used include color alteration, improving transparency by dissolving rutile inclusions, healing of fractures (cracks) or even completely filling them.

The most common treatment is the application of heat. Most, if not all, rubies at the lower end of the market are heat treated on the rough stones to improve color, remove ''purple tinge'', blue patches and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800 Â°C (3300 Â°F).&lt;ref name=&quot;ThemelisRubyHeat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heat Treatment of Ruby and Sapphire|publisher=Gemlab Inc.|location=Bangkok, Thailand|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300 Â°C (2400 Â°F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is only partially broken as the color is improved.

Another treatment, which has become more frequent in recent years, is lead glass filling. Filling the fractures inside the ruby with [[lead glass]] (or a similar material) dramatically improves the transparency of the stone, making previously unsuitable rubies fit for applications in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Pardieu [http://www.fieldgemology.org/Ruby_lead_glass_treatment.pdf Lead Glass Filled/Repaired Rubies]. Asian Institute of Gemological Sciences Gem Testing Laboratory. February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The process is done in four steps:

# The rough stones are pre-polished to eradicate all surface impurities that may affect the process
# The rough is cleaned with [[hydrogen fluoride]]
# The first heating process during which no fillers are added. The heating process eradicates impurities inside the fractures. Although this can be done at temperatures up to 1400 Â°C (2500 Â°F) it most likely occurs at a temperature of around 900 Â°C (1600 Â°F) since the rutile silk is still intact
# The second heating process in an electrical oven with different chemical additives. Different solutions and mixes have shown to be successful, however mostly lead-containing glass-powder is used at present. The ruby is dipped into oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile and placed in the oven where it is heated at around 900 Â°C (1600 Â°F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures. After cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Hughes (1997), ''Ruby &amp; Sapphire,'' Boulder, CO, RWH Publishing, ISBN 978-0964509764&lt;/ref&gt;.

If a color needs to be added, the glass powder can be &quot;enhanced&quot; with copper or other metal oxides as well as elements such as sodium, calcium, potassium etc.

The second heating process can be repeated three to four times, even applying different mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Milisenda| first=C C| title=Rubine mit bleihaltigen Glasern gefullt| journal=Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft| volume=54 |issue=1| pages=35â41|publisher=Deutschen Gemmologischen Gesellschaft|year=2005|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; When jewelry containing rubies is heated (for repairs) it should not be coated with boracic acid or any other substance, as this can etch the surface; it does not have to be &quot;protected&quot; like a diamond.

==Synthetic and imitation rubies==

In 1837 Gaudin made the first synthetic rubies by fusing potash [[alum]] at a high temperature with a little chromium as a pigment. In 1847 [[Jacques-Joseph Ebelmen|Ebelmen]] made white sapphire by fusing [[alumina]] in boric acid. In 1877 Frenic and Freil made crystal [[corundum]] from which small stones could be cut. Frimy and [[Auguste Verneuil]] manufactured artificial ruby by fusing BaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with a little Chromium at [[Incandescence|red heat]]. In 1903 Verneuil announced he could produce synthetic rubies on a commercial scale using this [[flame fusion]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/bahadur_handbook_of_precious_stones/page_067|title = Bahadur: a Handbook of Precious Stones|year = 1943|accessdate = 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910, Verneuil's laboratory had expanded into a 30 furnace production facility, with annual gemstone production having reached 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg (2,205&amp;nbsp;lb) in 1907.

Other processes in which synthetic rubies can be produced are through the Czochralski's [[Czochralski process|Pulling process]], flux process, and the [[hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]. Most synthetic rubies originate from flame fusion, due to the low costs involved. Synthetic rubies may have no imperfections visible to the naked eye but magnification may reveal curves, [[striae]] and gas bubbles. The fewer the number and the less obvious the imperfections, the more valuable the ruby is; unless there are no imperfections (i.e., a &quot;perfect&quot; ruby), in which case it will be suspected of being artificial. [[Dopant]]s are added to some manufactured rubies so they can be identified as synthetic, but most need [[gemology|gemological]] testing to determine their origin.

Synthetic rubies have technological uses as well as gemological ones. Rods of synthetic ruby are used to make [[ruby laser]]s and [[maser]]s. The first working laser was made by [[Theodore Maiman|Theodore H. Maiman]] in 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maiman |first=T.H. |authorlink=Theodore Harold Maiman |year=1960 |title=Stimulated optical radiation in ruby |journal=Nature|volume=187 |issue=4736 |pages=493â494 |doi=10.1038/187493a0 |bibcode=1960Natur.187..493M}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]] in [[Malibu, California]], beating several research teams including those of [[Charles H. Townes]] at [[Columbia University]], [[Arthur L. Schawlow|Arthur Schawlow]] at [[Bell Labs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hecht |first=Jeff |year=2005 |title=Beam: The Race to Make the Laser |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-514210-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gould at a company called TRG (Technical Research Group). Maiman used a solid-state light-pumped synthetic ruby to produce red laser light at a wavelength of 694 nanometers (nm). Ruby lasers are still in use. Rubies are also used in applications where high hardness is required such as at wear exposed locations in modern mechanical clockworks, or as scanning probe tips in a [[coordinate measuring machine]].

[[Imitation]] rubies are also marketed. Red [[spinel]]s, red [[garnet]]s, and colored glass have been falsely claimed to be rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century techniques were developed to color foil redâby burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnaceâwhich was then placed under the imitation stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/nicols-history-gemstones/page_036|title = Thomas Nicols: A Lapidary or History of Gemstones|year = 1652|accessdate = 2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Trade terms such as [[balas ruby]] for red spinel and [[rubellite]] for red [[tourmaline]] can mislead unsuspecting buyers. Such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).

==Records and famous rubies==
[[Image:National Museum of Natural History Rubies.JPG|thumb|right|Rubies at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Washington DC]], USA]]
* The Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington DC, has received one of the world's largest and finest ruby gemstones. The {{convert|23.1|carat|g}} Burmese ruby, set in a platinum ring with diamonds, was donated by businessman and philanthropist Peter Buck in memory of his late wife Carmen LÃºcia. This gemstone displays a richly saturated red color combined with an exceptional transparency. The finely proportioned cut provides vivid red reflections. The stone was mined from the [[Mogok]] region of [[Burma]] (now [[Myanmar]]) in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/ruby/index.htm |title=The Carmen LÃºcia Ruby |accessdate=2008-02-28|work=Exhibitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
