'''Pan Africanist Youth Congress(PAYCO)''' is the youth wing of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC) in [[South Africa]]. PAYCO was founded in 1981. It held its first congress in 1986. Formerly known as '''Azanian Youth Unity''' up to until 1997.

Its achievements include the formation of [[National Council of Trade Unions]] (NACTU), formation of [[Pan Africanist Student Organistion]] (PASO) and [[Pan-Africanist Student Movement of Azania]] (PASMA). PAYCO organization was critical in recruiting soldiers for the [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA) and for the PAC to reestablish itself as a major political party in [[Azania]]. 

The PAC's opposition to the [[Freedom Charter]] created conflict with the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), which was a significant member of the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] (UDF). Members of the UDF who supported the Charter, called charterists, killed many of their opposers by &quot;[[necklacing]]&quot; them, or burning them with gasoline-filled tires placed around their necks. The PAYCO was opposed to this treatment, further endangering themselves.

After the PAC's demise in 1986 following the death of [[Potlako Leballo]], the PAYCO later played a role in resurrecting the PAC as the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] under the leadership of [[Uncle Zeph]].
