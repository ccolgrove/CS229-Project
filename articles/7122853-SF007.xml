'''Beryl''' was a [[compositing window manager]] for the [[X Window System]] which [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from [[Compiz]] in September 2006 and was re-merged in 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;BerylCompizMerge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/compiz/2007-April/001809.html|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[compiz]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Compiz and Beryl are Reuniting|accessdate=2007-04-04|author=freedesktop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;, under the name of [[Compiz Fusion]].

==Origin==
'''Beryl''' was the project name for the '''Quinnstorm''' branch of [[Compiz]], announced on 19 September 2006 after Quinnstorm and the development team decided that the fork had come too far from the original Compiz started by [[Novell]] (&lt;tt&gt;compiz-vanilla&lt;/tt&gt;). After the Novell XGL/Compiz team (mostly [[David Reveman]]) refused the proposition to merge the Quinnstorm changes with compiz-vanilla, the decision was made to make a real differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-4562-1.html | title = Compiz.net forums - &quot;Announcing the Beryl Project&quot; | accessdate = 2006-09-19}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.beryl-project.org/topic-4591-beryl-informations-announcement | title=Compiz.net forums - Information on Beryl | accessdate = 2006-09-19}}{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they remerged into Compiz-Fusion.

==Differences==
Notable differences between Compiz and Beryl were the following:

* The window decorator, formerly known as [[cgwd]], was renamed emerald. A cgwd theme could be ported to emerald by changing the extension from .cgwd to .emerald.
* Beryl used a flat file backend instead of [[gconf]], no [[GNOME]] dependency.
* Initially had a large variety of extra plugins, and enhanced features in other plugins, later however most of the functionality had been ported to the ''compiz-extra'' package&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anykeysoftware.co.uk/compiz/plugins/ Compiz Plugins&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://go-compiz.org/index.php?title=Porting_Plugins{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contained three themeable decorators: &lt;tt&gt;Emerald&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Heliodor&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Aquamarine&lt;/tt&gt;.
* It had a theme manager called &lt;tt&gt;emerald-theme-manager&lt;/tt&gt;.
* Created by the community at [http://forum.beryl-project.org Beryl Project Forums].

== Window decorators ==

[[Image:Beryl wobbly.png|thumb|300px|&quot;Wobbly Windows&quot; made windows move like [[gelatin|jelly]] ]]

Like [[Compiz]] and unlike traditional window managers, Beryl delegated the drawing of window borders to a separate process, called a window decorator. There were three of them, all named after varieties of [[beryl]], although only Emerald was considered stable.
*'''[[Emerald (window decorator)|Emerald]]''', the default window decorator and a continuation of [[cgwd]], had its own theme format and supported effects like alpha transparency, a fork of Compiz's gtk-window-decorator.
*'''Heliodor''', another fork of Compiz's ''gtk-window-decorator'', supported [[Metacity]] themes.
*'''[[Aquamarine (window decorator)|Aquamarine]]''' supported [[KWin]] themes.

== System requirements ==
According to the Beryl [[FAQ]], Beryl ran acceptably well on a [[GeForce 3 Series|GeForce 3]]/[[Intel GMA|Intel i855]]/[[Radeon|Radeon 7500]], 256MB of RAM, and a 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz processor, although the processor is not a strong requirement {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. Version 7.1 of [[X.Org Server|Xorg]] and a recent version of [[Mesa 3D]] was recommended. [http://www.beryl-project.org/faq.php#gq5]

== Plugins ==
Included in the 0.1.4 release were the following plugins. As of the 0.1.4 release plugins were sorted into groups. Also introduced in 0.1.4 was a new plugin configuration interface that was more intuitive. Plugins were sorted into groups and the actual options for each plugin were also sorted more intuitively.

The Beryl project has been shut down in favor of the new merged project [[Compiz Fusion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forums.opencompositing.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=825 | title = OpenCompositing forums - CompComm has a real name! &quot;Compiz Fusion&quot; | accessdate = 2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;; its main activities will be focused on installation, configuration and additional plugins for addition to the core functionalities of Compiz, which will be responsible for core and base plugins.
