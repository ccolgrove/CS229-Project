The '''Fiat 128''' is a [[small family car]] manufactured by the Italian manufacturer [[Fiat]] from 1969 to 1985. The engine was designed by the famous Ferrari racing engine designer Aurelio Lampredi.

==History==
[[File:Fiat 128 2 door Graham Ruckert.jpg|thumb|left|First series 128 two door]]
Although the styling was similar to the 124 and 125, the 128 was an advanced and influential design that pioneered the [[front-wheel drive]] revolution at Fiat.  Like the [[Mini]], the 128 has a transverse-mounted [[engine]], however, the significant breakthrough with the 128 was the use of unequal length drive shafts which allowed the engine and gearbox to be located side by side, a layout which has since become ubiquitous for small cars.

The 128 was voted [[European Car of the Year]] for 1970,&lt;ref name=&quot;caroftheyear.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caroftheyear.org/pages/Previous_Cars/1970.htm|title=Previous_Cars|accessdate=2008-01-29|work=caroftheyear.org |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213214502/http://www.caroftheyear.org/pages/Previous_Cars/1970.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to be acclaimed by the press throughout its lifetime: the magazine ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' placed the 128 above the [[Datsun B210]], [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Mazda 808]], and [[Subaru Leone|Subaru DL]] but behind the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (which was launched in 1974 some five years after the 128) and [[Honda Civic]] in a comparison test, praising it as a &quot;driver's car&quot; with &quot;excellent&quot; brakes and &quot;outstanding handling&quot;.

The 128 was the first car to feature the all-new [[Fiat SOHC]] engine, an engine design which was considerably advanced for its time, featuring an aluminium alloy [[cylinder head]] with a direct [[overhead camshaft]] driven by a rubber toothed belt. This type of engine design became commonly adopted by most manufacturers of small cars at the beginning of the 1980s, but in the late 60s was unusual.

[[File:Fiat 128-Mk2 Front-view.JPG|thumb|left|Second series (1976-) 128 with new rectangular headlights.]]
Initially, the 128 was available as a two door sedan, four door sedan or [[station wagon]]. The car was only available with a 1116&amp;nbsp;cc engine on launch, though the 2-door-only 128 Rally edition launched in 1971 used a 1290&amp;nbsp;cc unit.  Also in 1971, the Sport Coupe, an all-new coupe body on a shortened 128 platform, was unveiled at the [[Turin Motor Show]]. On launch it was available with both existing 128 engines. The 128 range underwent a revamp in 1972, featuring a range of minor changes inside and out; pre- and post-revamp cars can be distinguished by their differing radiator grilles. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, which used the Rally engine in a four-door sedan body. In 1975 the 128 3P (3-door) Berlinetta replaced the Sport Coupe. The range was overhauled in 1976 with an array of exterior and interior changes including new bumpers, rectangular [[headlights]], new taillights and dashboard as well as modifications to the engines.

Production of all 128s except that of the base 1100&amp;nbsp;cc powered model ceased in 1979 after the introduction of the [[Fiat Ritmo/Strada]] in 1978, whilst in 1980 a small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range. Production finally ceased in 1985.

The 128 running gear and engine was used for the [[Fiat X1/9]] sports car, where the entire front-wheel drive train, suspension and engine was moved to the rear of the car to provide a mid-engined layout.

==Road test==
The British &quot;[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]&quot; magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch.  The car had a top speed of {{convert|85.4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and accelerated from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 15.5 seconds. An &quot;overall&quot; fuel consumption of {{convert|27.5|mpgimp|L/100 km mpgus}} was recorded. This put it fractionally behind the contemporary [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1300]] on maximum speed but usefully ahead on acceleration.  The two were closely matched on fuel economy, where both were outrun by the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort 1300 Super]] also included in the comparison, here in its four door version.   The Fiat's Â£876 manufacturer's recommended price was not too far above the Morris 1300's Â£830 and the Escort's Â£838.  The testers commended the Fiat's interior space and excellent performance.  Wind and road noise were low, but engine noise was not.&lt;ref name=Motor1970&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Unsigned| title = Fiat 128 &quot;Once more a winner&quot;| journal = [[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume =| pages = 23â28| date = 4 April 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moretti Fiat 128 Roadster ==

Moretti 128 Roadster was a coupe with removable roof (hard, in two parts) made by [[Moretti Motor Company|Moretti]] and unveiled at the Turin Auto Show 1969. The Moretti (coachbuilder) in Turin was the first to produce an open car based on Fiat 128, using the traditional engine of 1,100 cc. It was built factories via Monginevro in semi-scale and a very limited number of copies. Along with the roadster also a coupe version was also presented (with the same mechanics and aesthetics but with fixed roof) that was produced in several copies, most of which ended up abroad.

==Foreign production==
{{update|section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:Zastava 128.jpg|thumb|Zastava 128]]
[[File:Fiat Super Europa CL 1990.JPG|thumb|Fiat 128 Super Europa was made between 1983 -1990 by [[Sevel Argentina S.A.]]]]
The 128 formed the basis of the Zastava 128 (four-door sedan) and Zastava 101 (three-door and five-door hatchbacks) ranges of cars made by the &quot;[[Zastava]] Automobili&quot; company in [[Serbia]]. The 128-based Zastavas were available throughout Europe in the '70s. In Britain, three variants were offered: a three-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 311/313), four-door saloon (Zastava Yugo 411/413) and a five-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 511/513).

Production stopped in November 2009. It used to be one of the Serbian automaker's most affordable models and, at a price of approximately 3,750 euros, it was also among the most affordable cars in the world. Spare parts are particularly cheap.

Zastava also produced the 128 in its original, four-door sedan form. Regarding exports, as of 2001 no longer sells the car as a whole. Rather, [[Complete knock down|CKD]] kits are sent to Egypt's [[Nasr (car company)|Nasr]] car company, who assemble and sell the cars under the Nasr marque as the Nasr 128.&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/2009&quot;/&gt; The 128 remains the Nasr's most popular model.

In Argentina, the 128 was produced between 1971 and 1990. Only the 4-door sedan and a 5-door wagon (Fiat 128 Rural) were built. Several trims and versions were available, including the IAVA sport series. In 1983 the car received a facelift with new headlamps, tail lamps and front grille, which was marketed as '''Super Europa'''.

In Colombia, the 128 was produced by &quot;CompanÃ­a Colombiana Automotriz&quot; in Bogota. 

In Spain, [[SEAT]] manufactured its own version of 128 3P model (31,893 copies).

In Sri Lanka, the Fiat 128 was manufactured by the [[Upali Motor Company]] until 1978.
