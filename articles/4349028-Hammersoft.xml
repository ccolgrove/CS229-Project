'''BenoÃ®t Pedretti''' (born 12 November 1980 in [[Audincourt]], Doubs) is a [[football in France|French association football]] [[midfielder]] playing for [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. He is a deep lying playmaker well known for his wide range of passing.

He started his professional career at [[FC Sochaux-MontbÃ©liard|Sochaux]], and played there from 1999 to 2004. He then played for [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] for one season. Following his brief stint with [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] he joined [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] before moving once again to the club he now plays for, [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]]. He has gained 22 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for France.

==Club career==
Pedretti began his career at [[FC Sochaux-MontbÃ©liard]] in 1999 at the clubs youth system. He became a regular first team player in the 2002-2003 season when he made 35 league appearances and scored 3 goals. The team also had a strong cup run that year, reaching the final of the [[Coupe de la Ligue]], but losing 4-1 to Monaco.He also made his debut for the [[French National Team]] that year, coming on as a late substitute. Pedretti also featured in the [[UEFA Cup]] with Sochaux the following year as they defied all expectations to qualify for European football. However they struggled to make any significant impact on the competition.

Pedretti then moved to [[Olympique de Marseille]] in 2004 but found it difficult to cement his place in the starting line-up. He made 31 appearances in all competitions before moving to [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in 2005 for â¬7,000,000 after one season at the club. Pedretti was again used sparingly at the club which at the time had fierce competition for midfield places. Pedretti only amassed 21 appearances in all competitions and was often denied a place by the likes of [[Florent Malouda]] and [[Juninho Pernambucano]].

Pedretti again moved, this time to [[AJ Auxerre]] for an undisclosed fee in 2006. This move gave Pedretti the first team action he had desired with him being a mainstay in their midfield for several years. During his time at the club he featured in the [[UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Pedretti amassed 170 appearances during his five year stay. He was a highly influential member of the squad and featured for the national team, increasing his total to 22 caps. 

After the end of the 2010-2011 season, Pedretti stated his desire to move with [[Lille OSC]] being his preferred club after their recent league victory. Pedretti got his wish and signed for an undisclosed fee on the opening day of the summer 2011 transfer window as a replacement for the [[Newcastle United F.C.]] bound [[Yohan Cabaye]]. Pedretti said that âIt [Lille] is a very good club with great, interesting challenges,&quot;. &quot;My choice is to come to Lille.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer-zone/2011/06/01/2513762/official-lille-sign-benoit-pedretti-from-auxerre]&lt;/ref&gt;
