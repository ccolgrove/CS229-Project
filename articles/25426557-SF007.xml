Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002, and has since been critical of the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Australian IT&quot; /&gt; He articulated that despite its merits, Wikipedia lacks [[credibility]] due to, among other things, a lack of respect for [[expertise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jettison&quot; /&gt; After leaving the project, Sanger taught [[philosophy]] at [[Ohio State University]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade_Roush&quot; /&gt; and was an early strategist for the expert-authored [[Encyclopedia of Earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Terdiman&quot; /&gt; On September 15, 2006 he publicly announced Citizendium, first envisioned as a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;LaunchingPlan&quot; /&gt; It was launched on March 25, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brian Bergstein&quot; /&gt; Citizendium represents an effort to create a credible and free-access encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christopher Dawson&quot; /&gt; Sanger had aimed to bring more accountability to the internet encyclopedia model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jennifer LeClaire&quot; /&gt;

He is currently working on developing educational projects for individuals behind [[WatchKnowLearn]] and is designing a program to teach children how to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;CZ Charter Ratified&quot; /&gt; He started blogging on various subjects, including baby reading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toddler&quot; /&gt; He also works [[part-time]] as a writer, speaker, and consultant on the topic of collaborative [[Virtual community|online communities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Consulting&quot; /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sanger was born in [[Bellevue, Washington]]. When he was seven years old, the family moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chillingworth&quot;&gt;

where Sanger spent his formative years and excelled in the classroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Poe&quot; /&gt; At an early age, he was interested in philosophical topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade_Roush&quot; /&gt; Alan Boraas from ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' writes &quot;I can visualize the scene in his high school counselor's office when he announced his intended major. 'Kid,' I can hear the counselor say, 'What are you ever going to do with philosophy?' 'Well, change the way the world thinks, for one thing.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan_Boraas&quot;&gt;

He graduated from high school in 1986 and went off to [[Reed College]], [[academic major|majoring]] in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Alan_Boraas&quot; /&gt; As a college student, he explored the understanding and sources of knowledge. He also became interested in the Internet and its publishing abilities. These interests helped him to realize the benefits of using a wiki for an online encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade_Roush&quot;&gt;

He set up an early attempt with a listserver as a medium for students and tutors to meet up for &quot;expert tutoring&quot; and &quot;to act as a forum for discussion of tutorials, tutorial methods, and the possibility and merits of a voluntary, free network of individual tutors and students finding each other via the Internet for education outside the traditional university setting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tutor-L&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dated March 22, 1994, Sanger wrote in his opening [[manifesto]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The history of philosophy is full of disagreement and confusion. One reaction by philosophers to this state of things is to doubt whether the truth about philosophy can ever be known, or whether there is any such thing as the truth about philosophy. But there is another reaction: one may set out to think more carefully and methodically than one's intellectual forebears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall Poe&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[philosophy]] from [[Reed College]] in 1991, a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] from [[Ohio State University]] in 1995, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] from [[Ohio State University]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Education&quot;&gt;

==Nupedia and Wikipedia==
{{See|History of Wikipedia}}

[[Nupedia]] was a [[World Wide Web|Web-based]] [[encyclopedia]] whose articles were written by experts and licensed as free content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gouthro&quot;&gt;

| quote = Wales and Sanger created the first Nupedia wiki on January 10, 2001. The initial purpose was to get the public to add entries that would then be &quot;fed into the Nupedia process&quot; of authorization. Most of Nupedia's expert volunteers, however, wanted nothing to do with this, so Sanger decided to launch a separate site called &quot;Wikipedia.&quot; Neither Sanger nor Wales looked on Wikipedia as anything more than a lark. This is evident in Sanger's flip announcement of Wikipedia to the Nupedia discussion list. &quot;Humor me,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Go there and add a little article. It will take all of five or ten minutes.&quot; And, to Sanger's surprise, go they did. Within a few days, Wikipedia outstripped Nupedia in terms of quantity, if not quality, and a small community developed. In late January, Sanger created a Wikipedia discussion list (Wikipedia-L) to facilitate discussion of the project.

It was initially intended as a collaborative wiki for the public to write entries that would then be fed into the Nupedia review process of expertise.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallPoe&quot; /&gt; The majority of Nupedia's experts wanted little to do with this project, so Sanger initiated a separate site named Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallPoe&quot; /&gt;

To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching, Wikipedia had outgrown Nupedia, and a small community of editors gathered.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallPoe&quot; /&gt; By virtue of his position with Nupedia, Sanger spearheaded and named the project, and formulated much of the original policy, including &quot;[[Ignore all rules]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ignore_all_rules&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia quickly took off, but just months after it was launched, things started to go off the rails and by the summer of 2001, Sanger says, the new online community was being overrun by what he described as &quot;trolls&quot; and &quot;anarchist-types&quot;, who were &quot;opposed to the idea that anyone should have any kind of authority that others do not&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Waters&quot; /&gt; Sanger responded by proposing a stronger emphasis for expert editors, individuals with the authority to resolve disputes and enforce the rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Waters&quot; /&gt;

Tired of endless content battles and feeling he had a lack of support from Wales, Sanger eventually left the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Waters&quot;&gt;

Sanger was the only paid editor of Wikipedia, a status he held from January 15, 2001, until March 1, 2002. Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002 after the collapse in Internet advertising spending;&lt;ref name=&quot;my resignation&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicole Ferraro&quot; /&gt;

| quote = Larry Sanger is widely credited as &quot;co-founder&quot; of Wikipedia&amp;nbsp;â something Wales disputes.&quot; In a 2009 Hot Press interview Sanger said in part: &quot;I essentially guided what was a blank, infinitely expandable community bulletin board into a rapidly growing encyclopedia. I formulated or articulated many of the most basic policies of the website and, more importantly, actually enforced these policies. Had I not enforced the policies in those early months, the project simply would have become another wiki&amp;nbsp;â which is to say, nothing in particular, or whatever users happen to want to make it. What really made Wikipedia catch on was the notion, which I was very keen to promote, that we were merely using a wiki for the special purpose of creating an encyclopedia, not a collection of opinions, not a dictionary, not many other things that you can use a wiki to create. Jimmy was understood to be a very hands-off owner or distant overseer, and so his involvement in that seminal first year was far less than mine. This makes sense, of course, because while he was busy being CEO of Bomis, my job was to start Wikipedia&amp;nbsp;â which I did.

While Sanger organized the project Wales concentrated on Bomis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergstein&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stacy Schiff&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired News&quot; /&gt;

It was only in 2005, after Wales first began his efforts to identify himself as the sole founder of Wikipedia by downplaying Sanger's early role, that Wales first claimed that he had actually initially heard of the wiki concept in 2001 not from Sanger, but instead from Jeremy Rosenfeld.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired News&quot;&gt;

Wales had also been quoted in the press as far back as October 2001, stating that it was &quot;Larry (who) had the idea to use Wiki software.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wikipedia-l-000671&quot; /&gt;

According to all known documents actually dating from before 2005, the critical concept of marrying two of the three fundamental elements of Wikipedia, namely an encyclopedia and a wiki, first took form when Sanger met up with an old friend, [[History of Wikipedia#Formulation of the concept|Ben Kovitz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidener&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glyn Moody&quot; /&gt; This meeting occurred at a dinner on January 2, 2001, and it was here that Sanger was first introduced to the functionality of wiki software. Kovitz was a computer programmer and a regular on [[Ward Cunningham]]'s [[WikiWikiWeb|wiki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidener&quot;&gt;

Sanger thought a wiki would be a good platform to use and decided to present the idea to Jimmy Wales, at that time the head of Bomis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben_Kovitz&quot;&gt;

Sanger initially proposed the wiki concept to Wales and suggested it be applied to Nupedia and, after some initial skepticism, Wales agreed to try it.&lt;ref name=&quot;lets make a wiki&quot;&gt;

Sanger formally proposed a &quot;feeder&quot; project for Nupedia titled &quot;Nupedia Wiki&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lets make a wiki&quot; /&gt; and created a new page on Ward's wiki named &quot;WikiPedia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marshall-Poe&quot;&gt;

}}Over tacos that night, Sanger explained his concerns about Nupedia's lack of progress, the root cause of which was its serial editorial system. As Nupedia was then structured, no stage of the editorial process could proceed before the previous stage was completed. Kovitz brought up the wiki and sketched out &quot;wiki magic,&quot; the mysterious process by which communities with common interests work to improve wiki pages by incremental contributions. If it worked for the rambunctious hacker culture of programming, Kovitz said, it could work for any online collaborative project. The wiki could break the Nupedia bottleneck by permitting volunteers to work simultaneously all over the project. With Kovitz in tow, Sanger rushed back to his apartment and called Wales to share the idea. Over the next few days he wrote a formal proposal for Wales and started a page on Cunningham's wiki called &quot;WikiPedia.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WikiPedia&quot;&gt;

It was Jimmy Wales who added the third critical ingredient to the mix. He directed Sanger to give essentially unrestricted editorial access to this new wiki to the &quot;non expert&quot; public.&lt;ref name=&quot;memoirofwiki&quot; /&gt; Sanger came up with the name 'Wikipedia', which at the time, Sanger wrote that he believed would merely be, &quot;a silly name for what was at first a very silly project.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;memoirofwiki&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;J Sidener&quot;&gt;

Sanger first conceived of the wiki-based encyclopedia project only as a means to hopefully accelerate Nupedia's slow growth. During Wikipedia's critical first year of growth, Sanger spearheaded and guided the following that gathered around this nucleus. Through this early period, he served as Wikipedia's editor-in-chief, a position which has not been filled since his departure from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergstein&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;memoirofwiki&quot;&gt;

One of the first things I asked Jimmy is how free a rein I had in designing the project. What were my constraints, and in what areas was I free to exercise my own creativity? He replied, as I clearly recall, that most of the decisions should be mine; and in most respects, as a manager, Jimmy was indeed very hands-off. Nevertheless, I always did consult with him about important decisions, and moreover, I wanted his advice. Now, Jimmy was quite clear that he wanted the project to be in principle open to everyone to develop, just as open source software is (to an extent). Beyond this, however, I believe I was given a pretty free rein. So I spent the first month or so thinking very broadly about different possibilities.

While claiming &quot;to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully&quot; and to know and support &quot;the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well,&quot; Sanger maintained that there are serious problems with the project. There was, he wrote, a lack of public perception of credibility, and the project put &quot;difficult people, [[Troll (Internet)|trolls]], and their enablers&quot; into too much prominence; these problems, he maintained, were a feature of the project's &quot;[[anti-elitism]], or lack of respect for expertise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jettison&quot; /&gt; The article was the subject of much controversy in the [[blogosphere]], and led to some reaction in the news media as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel H Pink&quot;&gt;

In September 2009, Sanger mentioned one reason for distancing himself from Wikipedia: &quot;I thought that the project would never have the amount of credibility it could have if it were not somehow more open and welcoming to experts.&quot; He pointed out &quot;The other problem was the community had essentially been taken over by trolls to a great extent. That was a real problem, and Jimmy Wales absolutely refused to do anything about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicole Ferraro&quot;&gt;

Stressing that successful communication needn't be informative, and that good communication is very different than good information. Sanger is careful to point out his criticisms of Wikipedia aren't as much based on its lack of [[meritocracy]], but rather in its credibility as an informational medium. Sanger sees most [[web 2.0]] websites as being built upon communication and socialization, instead of impersonal information resources. As a consequence of this, Sanger sees a continuing demand for more authoritative information sources. Saying: &quot;Even in the field of encyclopedias, while the industry does seem to have taken a blow, some of the heavyweights are still alive and kicking.&quot;&lt;ref name=FateOfWiki&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanger|first=Larry|title=THE FATE OF EXPERTISE AFTER WIKIPEDIA|url=http://larrysanger.org/old-writing-and-speeches/published-writings/|work=larrysanger.org|publisher=LAWRENCE M.

In April 2006, Sanger published &quot;Text and Collaboration: A personal manifesto for the Text Outline Project&quot; arguing for the importance of what he called &quot;strong collaboration&quot; (that is, collaboration in which people work on the parts they're interested and nobody gets to claim control), the possibility that strong collaboration could be more effective with a less anarchistic set of ground rules than Wikipedia, and the creation of a new Text Outline Project to create The Book of the World, featuring summaries of the arguments of the great philosophers, organized by topic and time, along with summaries of their debates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Text and Collaboration&quot;&gt;

At the [[Wizards of OS]] conference in September 2006, Sanger announced Citizendium as a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of Wikipedia. The objectives of the fork were to address various perceived flaws in the Wikipedia system. The main differences would be no anonymous editing: every author/editor would have to be identified by his/her real name, no &quot;top-down&quot; hierarchy of editors: it would aspire to be a &quot;real encyclopedia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dossier Open Source&quot;&gt;

In 2007 Sanger examined the possibilities for [[electronic learning|education online]]. He explained, &quot;Imagine that education were not delivered but organized and managed in a way that were fully digitized, decentralized, self-directed, asynchronous, and at-a-distance.&quot; He further stated, &quot;There would be no bureaucracy to enforce anything beyond some very basic rules, and decision-making would be placed almost entirely in the hands of teachers and students.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Education 2.0&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the launch of Citizendium, Sanger criticized Wikipedia, stating the latter was &quot;broken beyond repair,&quot; and had a range of problems &quot;from serious management problems, to an often dysfunctional community, to frequently unreliable content, and to a whole series of scandals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Iain Thomson&quot;&gt;

Sanger stated in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The work of the Wikipedians has astounded the world, but the amateur nature of Wikipedia's contributions, whose authors remain anonymous, is not for everyone. Some experts are hostile toward the idea of Wikipedia and many avoid Wikipedia altogether. We may take Wikipedia as an early prototype of the application of open source hacker principles to content rather than code. I want to argue that it is just that, an early prototype, rather than a mature model of how such principles should be applied to reference, scholarly and educational content. Where Wikipedia shares the culture of anonymity found in the broader Internet, the Citizendium will have a culture of real-world, personal responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;JayLyman&quot;&gt;

I think we absolutely need another wikiâfirst of all, simply because Wikipedia lacks credibility, unfortunately. It's a good starting place, as people sayâon some subjects anywayâbut it isn't really what we want out of a reliable reference resource. And frankly, I don't think that the Wikipedia community is prepared to make the changes that I think need to be made in order to transform Wikipedia into something that's really reliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neha Tiwari&quot;&gt;
