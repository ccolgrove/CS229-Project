Smyser, who lives, teaches, and performs in southeastern [[Pennsylvania]], is listed among greats in Maurice J. Summerfield's book ''The Jazz Guitar'', and was on the Artist Roster of the Pennsylvania Performing Arts on Tour (PennPAT) from 1997 to 2004. He is also an endorser for American [[Archtop guitar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=American Archtop Guitars | url=http://www.americanarchtop.com/ | accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pete Smyser performs solo, duo or ensemble concert performances and educational programs. Pete's concert repertoire is centered around  [[Great American Songbook]] and [[jazz standards]], [[classical guitar]] selections, as well as original compositions.

==Background==
Smyser has appeared on television and radio shows in addition to countless performances at festivals, clubs, universities, and churches. In addition to these appearances, he has given frequent performances at the top jazz clubs in the greater [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] area. He has shared the bandstand with many notable jazz artists including [[Warren Vache]], Larry McKenna, John Swana, [[Claude &quot;The Fiddler&quot; Williams]], Grant Stewart, Steve Gilmore, and [[Bootsie Barnes|Robert &quot;Bootsie&quot; Barnes]].

==Latest work==
Pete's latest album, '''Opportunity Knocks''', contains a refreshing blend of [[jazz standards]] and original compositions. The ensemble accompanying Pete on the album includes Mike Boone on bass, Byron Landham on drums, as well as several tracks recorded with Philadelphia jazz piano legend Sid Simmons.  Karl Stark, of the [[Philadelphia Inquirer]], recently reviewed Pete's latest release, Opportunity Knocks, saying &quot;''The mostly trio session with bassist Mike Boone and drummer Byron Landham could stand up to an old [[Wes Montgomery]] disc. The swing is deep, the intentions old-school.  Smyser's tunes go down easily... The set is highly traditional and worthy of wider recognition.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Philadelphia Inquirer- Arts and Entertainment: New Recordings- 5-10-09 | url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/entertainment/44584672.html?viewAll=y | accessdate=2009-06-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
