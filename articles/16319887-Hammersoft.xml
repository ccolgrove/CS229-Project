'''The Florida State Seminoles men's basketball team''' represents [[Florida State University]] in the Atlantic Division of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in [[NCAA Division I]]. The current head men's basketball coach is [[Leonard Hamilton]].

==History==
===Hugh Durham Era===
[[Hugh Durham]] played at Florida State in the 1950s, scoring 1,381 points in three years. His average of 21.9 points per game in 1958â59 is the seventh best tally in Florida State history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hugh Durham| url =http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Durham| format =English | accessdate =2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durham's career average of 18.9 points per game is still the ninth best in school history. After his playing career had ended, he began his coaching career as an assistant coach in 1959. Seven years later, Durham would be named head coach in 1966. One of the top players during this time was future NBA Hall-of-Famer [[Dave Cowens]]. Durham led the Seminoles from 1966 to 1978. In 1972, Durham led Florida State to a runner-up finish in the NCAA tournament. A hard-fought 81â76 loss to the top-ranked UCLA Bruins in the NCAA Championship game prevented Durham's Florida State team from winning the [[NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. Another key player for the Seminoles was [[Harry Davis (basketball)|Harry Davis]], who helped the program sustain stability. 

Durham's overall record at Florida State was a 230â95 record with three NCAA tournament bids. He still owns the highest winning percentage of any Florida State coach at .708. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The 20th Greatest College Basketball In The South: Florida State Seminoles | url =http://thenastyboys.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/the-20th-greatest-college-basketball-in-the-southflorida-state-seminoles/| format =English | accessdate =2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durham is the only coach in NCAA history to be the all-time winningest coach (percentage or wins) at three different Division I schools.

===Joe Williams Era===
After the departure of Hugh Durham, [[Joe Williams (basketball coach)|Joe Williams]] took over the Seminole basketball program. One of the standout players during this period was [[George McCloud]]. McCloud helped the Seminoles rebuild after the departure of Durham by becoming one of the most prolific scorers in FSU history. During his senior season, McCloud had the second-highest scoring average and the sixth-highest in Florida State history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The 20th Greatest College Basketball In The South: Florida State Seminoles | url =http://thenastyboys.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/the-20th-greatest-college-basketball-in-the-southflorida-state-seminoles/| format =English | accessdate =2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Williams would coach his final season in 1986.

===Pat Kennedy Era===
The 1992â1993 season would see the emergence of one of the Seminoles' best players in its history, [[Sam Cassell]]. Not much was expected of the Seminoles in 1992 as they entered into their first season in the ACC, yet they finished second in the conference to national champion [[Duke]]. The team repeated the second-place finish in 1993, establishing itself as a legitimate national power. In the 1993 NCAA Tournament they fell to [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] in the Elite Eight round.  In Kennedy's final season (1996â1997) he led the team to the NIT Final, losing to the [[Michigan Wolverines]].

===Steve Robinson Era===
[[Steve Robinson (basketball coach)|Steve Robinson]] took over the program for the 1997â1998 season and led the Seminoles to the NCAA tournament his first year.  However, the team suffered losing records the next four seasons and Robinson left the program after the 2001â2002 campaign.  Robinson is now an assistant coach with the [[North Carolina Tarheels]].

===Leonard Hamilton Era===
[[Leonard Hamilton]] became Florida Stateâs seventh head basketball coach on March 19, 2002. In two years, [[Tim Pickett]] scored 1,039 points, earning him First-Team All-ACC and All-American Honorable Mention honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Florida State Basketball  | url =http://graphics.fansonly.com/schools/fsu/graphics/mediaguides/06-mbb/2006-07universitysection.pdf| format =English | accessdate =2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008â2009 season, Hamilton led the Seminoles to a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament and runner-up in the ACC tournament. Hamilton was named ACC coach of the year.
