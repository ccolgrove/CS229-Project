In [[computing]], '''&lt;code&gt;fc&lt;/code&gt;''' ('''F'''ile '''C'''ompare) is a [[command line interface|command line]] program that compares multiple [[computer file|files]] and outputs the differences between them. The &lt;code&gt;fc&lt;/code&gt; [[command (computing)|command]] has been included in [[Microsoft]] [[operating system]]s since [[MS-DOS]] 2.0 and is included in all versions of [[Microsoft Windows]].
The command is equivalent to the [[Unix]] commands &lt;code&gt;[[comm]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[cmp (Unix)|cmp]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[diff]]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/fc.mspx?mfr=true&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
The latest version of &lt;code&gt;fc&lt;/code&gt; can compare [[text file]]s as well as [[binary file]]s. The text can either be encoded in [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]]. The result of comparisons are output to the standard output. The output of &lt;code&gt;fc&lt;/code&gt; is intended primarily to be human readable and may be difficult to use in other programs.
