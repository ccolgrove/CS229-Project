}}'''The Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales')''' (or simply &quot;Staffords&quot; for short) was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Army]], part of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]]. The regiment was formed in 1959 by the amalgamation of [[The South Staffordshire Regiment]] and [[The North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)]]. The Staffords can trace their history back to 1705 when a regiment known as the [[38th Regiment of Foot|38th Foot]] was raised at [[Lichfield]] by Colonel [[Luke Lillingstone]].

==History==
===Africa===
After the creation of the regiment, its first overseas posting was a six month exercise in Kenya, followed by a year in Colchester and then a return to Kenya for a further two years.  On the tour the regiment had to deal with a mutiny by the [[Uganda People's Defence Force#History|Ugandan Army]].  Returning home the regiment was the last unit of the British Army to serve in East Africa.  A home tour in Dover followed, then came a two year posting to Berlin followed by tours in [[Bahrain]] and [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]] in the Persian Gulf where the regiment again recorded a 'last unit' distinction being the last unit to serve in Sharjah.

===Northern Ireland===
Five tours in Northern Ireland were undertaken between 1972 and 1984.  For the rest of the 1980s the regiment served in the United Kingdom and Germany.

===Gulf War===

In October 1990 The Staffordshire Regiment was deployed to [[Saudi Arabia]] as part of [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade]], better known as the 'Desert Rats'. The deployment was in response to the dictator [[Saddam Hussein]]'s invasion of the sovereign territory of [[Kuwait]], claiming it to rightfully belong to [[Iraq]]. The Staffords comprised 45 [[Warrior (vehicle)|Warrior APC]]s, with a company from the [[Grenadier Guards]] and the 1st Battalion, [[The Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] being attached to the regiment. They were involved in fierce fighting with Iraqi forces from the beginning of land operations to the end. They covered an astonishing 290&amp;nbsp;km/180 miles in just 100 hours.

===Iraq War===
Following a first deployment in Iraq in 2005 at the end of October 2006 the Staffordshire Regiment commenced its final overseas deployment with a second deployment in Iraq.

===Amalgamation===
Under [[Options for Change]] it was announced that the Regiment would amalgamate with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] to form a single battalion regiment called the [[Cheshire and Staffordshire Regiment]]. This amalgamation was suspended in 1994.

As part of the [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|reorganisation]] of the infantry announced in 2004, it was announced that the Staffordshire Regiment would merge with the Cheshire Regiment and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment]] into a new three-battalion regiment to be called the [[Mercian Regiment]]. On 1 September 2007 the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, Mercian Regiment (Staffords), and will operate permanently in the [[armoured infantry]] role. Initially based at [[Tidworth]], the battalion moved to [[Bad Fallingbostel]], Germany in August 2009, where it is now permanently based as part of [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade (The Desert Rats)]].
