'''Manhattan Beach''' is the wealthiest beachfront city located in southwestern [[Los Angeles County, California]], [[United States|USA]].  The city is on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, south of [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], and north of [[Hermosa Beach, California|Hermosa Beach]]. Manhattan Beach is the home of both beach and indoor volleyball, and surfing. During the winter, the waves can get as big as {{convert|12|ft|m}}.  It is one of the three [[Beach Cities]] in the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]].  Manhattan Beach is known for its homes with prices averaging above 9 million dollars.  In the past 15 years, it has become home to professional athletes such as Maria Sharapova, Tiger Woods, and Blake Griffin.  The average income of a typical Manhattan Beach household is 3.4 million dollars annually. 

Manhattan Beach is an affluent beach town within commuting distance of [[Los Angeles]] and therefore it is one of the most expensive coastal towns in which to live in America, according to the most recent ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' rankings. The median price of a single family dwelling greatly exceeds the already high Los Angeles County median price by well over 100%.  Property in Manhattan Beach is exceptionally expensive when considering the size of land for sale.  In comparison, a half acre of land in Bel-Air is valued at $20 million, while a half acre of land on the Strand in Manhattan Beach is valued at $35 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manhattanbeach.patch.com/articles/the-most-expensive-homes-in-america]&lt;/ref&gt;  Homes with an ocean view often exceed $5 million in cost.

Manhattan Beach and the local high school, [[Mira Costa High School]], were the real-life film locations for the popular TV show ''[[The O.C.]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seeing-stars.com/oc/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcontentproducer.com/digitalfilm/video_production_meets_post/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Manhattan Pier.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Manhattan Beach pier]] in downtown Manhattan Beach on a typical fall afternoon.]]

In 1863, a Scottish immigrant, Sir Robert Burnett, purchased [[Rancho Sausal Redondo]] and [[Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela]] from [[Cornelio Avila#Antonio Ygnacio Avila|Avila]]'s heirs for $33,000.  Ten years later in 1873, Burnett leased the ranch to a Canadian, Daniel Freeman (not the American [[Daniel Freeman]], who was the first to file a claim under the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862).  Burnett returned to Scotland.  Freeman moved his wife and three children onto the ranch and started growing various crops.  On May 4, 1885 Freeman bought the ranch from Burnett for $140,000.

[[George H. Peck (1856-1940)|George H. Peck]] owned a lot of the land that became part of the north section of Manhattan Beach. Supposedly, a coin flip decided the town's name.  Around 1902, the beach suburb was named &quot;Manhattan Beach&quot; after the developer's home town, [[Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn|Manhattan Beach]], Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History of Manhattan Beach| author = Bonnie Beckerson| url = http://history90266.org/HistoryMB.htm| accessdate = 2008-09-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080606024945/http://history90266.org/HistoryMB.htm |archivedate = 2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The city has a total area of {{convert|4.9|sqmi|km2}}. 
Manhattan Beach features {{convert|2.1|mi|km}} of ocean frontage.  Much of Manhattan Beach was once sand dunes.  The city is quite hilly, but the only remaining sand dune is at Sand Dune Park.

===Neighborhoods===
[[Image:Manhattan Beach houses.jpg|thumb|A view of the ocean in Manhattan Beach.]]
Residents have divided the city into several distinct neighborhoods, including &quot;The Village&quot;, &quot;Sand Section&quot;, &quot;Hill Section&quot;, &quot;Tree Section&quot;, &quot;Gas Lamp&quot; section, Manhattan Heights, East Manhattan Beach, Liberty Village, &quot;Poet's Section&quot; (Shelley, Tennyson, Longfellow), and El Porto (North Manhattan Beach).

The Hill Section includes higher priced homes where many of the residences are remodeled and situated on steep hills allowing panoramic ocean and city views. 

The nearby Sand Section is notable for its pockets of quiet neighborhoods adjacent to the ocean.  Multi-million dollar ocean-front homes line the bike path and walking lane along The Strand.

====Downtown====
&quot;Downtown&quot; Manhattan Beach runs along Manhattan Beach Boulevard and the streets perpendicular to it in the area near the [[Manhattan Beach Pier]] up to Valley Drive. There are restaurants and stores and a mixed-use center, where once the [[Metlox Pottery|pottery factory]], famous for its colorful plates, stood for decades.  The Metlox site closed in the early 1990s, and it took several years for the contaminated soil to be removed.  The new &quot;Metlox&quot; site includes a boutique hotel and a few restaurants and shops. 

The Manhattan Beach Library is near downtown on Highland Avenue two blocks north of Manhattan Beach Boulevard. The library is part of the [[County of Los Angeles Public Library]] system, and includes internet accessible computers, WiFi, and access to the six million items in the county library collection.

====Rosecrans Strip====
The Rosecrans strip is located on the south side of Rosecrans Avenue, east of Sepulveda, and west of Aviation.  

The area includes the small Manhattan Village Mall, which is located on the southeast corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue.  The mall, built in the early 1980s, was once anchored by the department stores [[Bullock's]] and [[Buffums]], which both went bankrupt in the early 1990s.  Most of the original stores in the mall also went bankrupt in the 1980s and 1990s (Miller's Outpost, Contempo Casuals, [[Music Plus]], Orange Julius, Tequila Willies, Kinney Shoes, [[B. Dalton]] bookstore).  The mall was remodeled in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and is now anchored by [[Macy's]] on both ends.  It also has higher-end stores such as [[Pottery Barn]], [[Pottery Barn Kids]], and [[Williams and Sonoma]].   

The Manhattan Beach Country Club, the Marriott Hotel and Golf Course, restaurants, retail stores, supermarkets, and shopping centers are along the strip between the Manhattan Mall and Aviation Boulevard.

====Sepulveda Strip====
The &quot;Sepulveda Strip&quot; occupies the commercial zone, which runs north-south through the city.  There is often very heavy traffic on this main thoroughfare.

====Aviation Strip====
The Aviation Strip is located along Aviation Boulevard (the city's eastern boundary), south of Rosecrans Avenue, and north of Marine Avenue.  Aviation High School once stood there until it was closed in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Manhattan Beach Studios| author =| url = http://www.raleighstudios.com/index_manhattan.aspx
| accessdate = 2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The zone includes several major complexes, including the Manhattan Beach Film Studios and the Northrop Grumman Space Technology Plant (where TRW once stood).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Northrop Grumman Space Technology| author =| url = http://www.st.northropgrumman.com/index.html| accessdate = 2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks and recreation==
The Strand path and bikeway along the beach is popular for [[biking]], [[jogging]], [[roller blading]], and [[skateboarding]]. Volleyball nets are set up along the beach, and swimming, [[body boarding]] and [[surfing]] are popular among residents and visitors. At Manhattan Beach you are allowed to surf at the [[Manhattan Beach Pier]], and North Manhattan Beach (El Porto).
