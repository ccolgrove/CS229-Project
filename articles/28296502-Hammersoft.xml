[[Phi Chi]] is one of the oldest and largest international medical fraternities of its kind in the world. Phi Chi evolved from the merging of two professional medical fraternities bearing the same name. [[Phi Chi Society]] (Phi Chi East) was founded on March 31, 1889, at the [[University of Vermont College of Medicine|University of Vermont]], Burlington, Vt. [[Phi Chi Medical Fraternity]] (Phi Chi South) was founded on October 26, 1894, at the Louisville Medical College, Louisville, Ky. These two organizations did not know that they shared a similar name when they were founded. On March 5, 1905, in Burlington, Vt., [[Phi Chi Society]] and [[Phi Chi Medical Fraternity]], Inc., were consolidated taking the name Phi Chi Medical Fraternity, Inc.

Chapters from the following Medical Societies have merged with [[Phi Chi]] over the years:

When the Phi Chi Society and Phi Chi Medical Fraternity combined in 1905, it was decided that when the name of any two chapters conflicted, the chapter with precedence would retain the single letter and the chapter following shall duplicate its name, such as Alpha (1889), [[University of Vermont]], and Alpha of Louisville (1894), which became Alpha Alpha.
