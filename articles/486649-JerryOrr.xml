'''Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan''' ({{lang-hy|Ô±Õ¶Õ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ½ ÕÕ¸Õ¾Õ°Õ¡Õ¶Õ¶Õ¥Õ½Õ« ÕÕ«Õ¯Õ¸ÕµÕ¡Õ¶}}, ''Anastas Hovhannesi Mikoyan''; {{lang-ru|ÐÐ½Ð°ÑÑÐ°ÌÑ ÐÐ²Ð°ÌÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾ÑÌÐ½}}; {{OldStyleDate|25 November|1895|13 November}}&amp;nbsp;â 21 October 1978) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Old Bolshevik]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] statesman during the rules of [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], and [[Leonid Brezhnev]].

Mikoyan became an early convert to the Bolshevik cause. Mikoyan was a strong supporter of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of [[Ministry of Foreign Trade (Soviet Union)|Minister of Foreign Trade]]. By the end of Stalin's rule Mikoyan was starting to lose favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of foreign trade minister. At the [[19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|19th Party Congress]] Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his [[de-Stalinization]] policy, and became [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.

Mikoyan made several key trips to communist [[Cuba]] and to the United States, acquiring an important stature on the international diplomatic scene. In 1964 Khrushchev was forced to step down in a coup that brought Leonid Brezhnev to power. Mikoyan served as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]], the nominal Head of State, from 1964 until his forced retirement in 1965.

==Early life and career==
[[Image:Ordzhonikidze, Stalin and Mikoyan, 1925.jpg|255px|left|thumb|The Caucasus trio: Mikoyan, [[Joseph Stalin]], and [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze]].]]
Mikoyan was born in the village of [[Sanahin]], then a part of the [[Yelizavetpol Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (presently a part of [[Alaverdi]] in [[Armenia]]'s [[Lori Province]]) in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|The American Heritage Dictionary]]'' | title = The Riverside Dictionary of Biography | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=Boston | year = 2004 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=4zxQ5dr61X8C&amp;dq | isbn = 0618493379 | page = 522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Hovhannes, worked as a carpenter and his mother as a rug weaver. He had one younger brother, [[Artem Ivanovich Mikoyan]], who would go on to become the co-founder of the [[MiG]] aviation design bureau which became one of the primary design bureaus of fast jets in Soviet military aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Mikoyan, Stepan A. | title = Stepan Anastasovich Mikoyan: An Autobiography |location =Shrewsbury| publisher = Airlife Publishing | year = 1999 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JuNoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q | isbn = 1853109169 | page = 522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikoyan received his education at the [[Nersisyan School|Nersisyan Theological seminary]] in [[Tiflis]] and the [[Gevorkian Theological Seminary]] in [[Echmiadzin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SovArmenian&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| language = Armenian | author = Anon. | title = ÕÕ«Õ¯Õ¸ÕµÕ¡Õ¶, Ô±Õ¶Õ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ½ ÕÕ¸Õ¾Õ°Õ¡Õ¶Õ¶Õ¥Õ½Õ« | trans_title = Mikoyan, Anastas Hovhannesi | volume = vii | publisher = [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]] | year = 1981 | location = Yerevan | page = 542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to [[atheism]]: &quot;I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less I believed in God.&quot; Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbed in in [[liberalism|liberal]] and [[socialist]] politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timemag&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | title = Russia: The Survivor | page = 2 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809881-2,00.html | accessdate = 19 January 2011 | date = 16 September 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of twenty, he formed a workers' ''[[Soviet (council)|soviet]]'' in Echmiadzin. In 1915 Mikoyan formally joined the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (later known as the Bolshevik Party) and became a leader of the revolutionary movement in the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SovArmenian&quot; /&gt; His interactions with Soviet revolutionaries led him to [[Baku]], where he became the co-editor for the Armenian-language newspaper ''Sotsyal-Demokrat'' and later for the Russian-language paper ''Izvestia Bakinskogo Soveta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SovArmenian&quot; /&gt; After the [[February Revolution|February 1917 revolution]], which toppled the [[House of Romanov|tsarist government]], Mikoyan and other Bolsheviks fought against anti-Bolshevik elements in the Caucasus.&lt;ref name=&quot;SovArmenian&quot; /&gt;

Mikoyan became a [[commissar]] in the newly-formed [[Red Army]] and continued to fight in Baku against anti-Bolshevik forces. He was wounded in the fighting and was noted for saving the life of fellow Party-member [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pagefour&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | title = Russia: The Survivor | page = 4 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809881-4,00.html | accessdate = 19 January 2011 | date = 16 September 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he continued his Party work, becoming one of the co-founders of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Soviet]], which lasted until 1918, when he and twenty-five other commissars fled Baku and were captured by the [[Transcaspian Government]]. Known as the Baku 26, all the commissars were executed with the sole exception of Mikoyan; the circumstances of his survival are shrouded in mystery.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=214}} In February 1919 Mikoyan returned to Baku and resumed his activities there, helping to establish the Baku Bureau of the Caucasus Regional Committee (Kraikom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Politburo member==
[[File:Ð.Ð. ÐÐ°Ð´Ð°ÐµÐ², Ð.Ð. ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ½, Ð¡.Ð. ÐÐ¸ÑÐ¾Ð² Ð½Ð° 10-Ð¾Ð¼ ÑÐ»ÐµÐ±Ð¾Ð·Ð°Ð²Ð¾Ð´Ðµ, ÐÐµÐ½Ð¸Ð½Ð³ÑÐ°Ð´, 1927.jpg|thumb|250px|A. Badayev, Mikoyan, and [[Sergei Kirov]] at a bread factory in Leningrad in 1927]]
Mikoyan supported Stalin in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; he had become a member of the Bolshevik [[CPSU Central Committee|Central Committee]] in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;SovArmenian&quot; /&gt; In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with [[Henry Ford]] and inspected [[Macy's]] in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=192â193n}}

In the late 1930s Stalin embarked upon the [[Great Purge]], a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union orchestrated against members of the Communist Party, the peasantry, and other unaffiliated persons. Mikoyan, like many other Politburo members, tried to save some close-knit companions from being executed. In assessing Mikoyan's role in the purges, historian [[Simon Sebag-Montefiore]] states that he &quot;enjoyed the reputation of one of the more decent leaders: he certainly helped the victims later and worked hard to undo Stalin's rule after the Leader's death&quot;. Mikoyan was not without faults; in 1936 he enthusiastically supported the execution of [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]], claiming it to be a &quot;just verdict&quot;. As with other leading officials in 1937, Mikoyan signed death-lists given to him by the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=256}} The purges were often accomplished by officials close to Stalin; he gave them the assignment largely as a way to test their loyalty to the regime. In September 1937 Stalin dispatched Mikoyan, along with [[Georgy Malenkov]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]], with a list of 300 names to [[Yerevan]], the capital of the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (ASSR), to oversee the liquidation of the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA), largely made up of Old Bolsheviks. Mikoyan tried, but failed, to save one from being executed during his trip to Armenia. That person was arrested during one of his speeches to the  CPA by Beria. Over a thousand people were arrested and seven of nine members of the Armenian Politburo were sacked from office.&lt;ref&gt;

==World War II and de-Stalinization==
In September 1939, [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union each carved out their own spheres of influence in Poland and Eastern Europe via the [[MolotovâRibbentrop Pact]]. The Soviets arrested 26,000 Polish officers in the eastern portion of Poland and in March 1940, after some deliberation, Stalin and number of other high-ranking officials, Mikoyan included, signed an order for [[Katyn Massacre|their execution]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=333}} When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Mikoyan was placed in charge of organizing the transportation of food and supplies. His son Vladimir, a pilot in the [[Red Air Force]], died in combat when shot down over [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]].{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=463}} Mikoyan's main assignment throughout the war was supplying the [[Red Army]] with materials, food, and other necessities.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=373}} Mikoyan became a Special Representative of the [[State Defense Committee]] in 1941 by Stalin's orders; he was until that point not a member because Beria believed he would be of better use in government administration.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=383}} Mikoyan was decorated with a [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] in 1943 for his efforts during the war. In 1946 Mikoyan became the [[Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|Vice-Premier]] of the Council of Ministers.&lt;ref name=&quot;reallyshortbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = ÐÐ½Ð°ÑÑÐ°Ñ ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ, ÐÐ¸ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ½ | trans_title = Mikoyan, Anastas Ivanovich | language = Russian | publisher = warheroes.ru | url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=9089 | accessdate = 27 January 2011 | author = Vasilyevich, Ufarkinym Nikolai }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before his death in 1953, Stalin considered launching a new purge against Mikoyan, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], and several other Party leaders. This never came to fruition as Stalin died before he could put the plan into motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;pagefour&quot;/&gt; Mikoyan originally argued in favor of keeping Stalin's right-hand man, Beria, from punishment but later gave in to popular support among Party members for his arrest. Mikoyan remained in the government after Stalin's death, in the post of Minister of Trade, under Malenkov.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=662}} He supported Khrushchev in the power struggle to succeed Stalin, and became [[First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|First Deputy Premier]] in recognition of his services.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=666}}

In 1956 Mikoyan helped Khrushchev organize the [[Secret Speech]] which Khrushchev delivered to the [[20th Party Congress]] that denounced Stalin's personality cult.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=652}} It was him, and not Khrushchev, who made the first anti-Stalinist speech at the 20th Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | title = Russia: The Survivor (page 5) | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809881-5,00.html | accessdate = 19 January 2011 | date = 16 September 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 Mikoyan refused to back an attempt by Malenkov and Molotov to remove Khrushchev from power; he thus secured his position as one of Khrushchev's closest allies. He backed Khrushchev because of his strong support for [[de-Stalinization]] and his belief that a triumph by the plotters might have given way to purges similar to the ones in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mikoyan Anti-Stalin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first = Walter | last = Laqueur | title = Russia and Germany: A Century of Conflict |location= New Brunswick, NJ | publisher = Transaction Publishers | page = 313 | year = 1990 | isbn = 0887383491 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign diplomacy==

===Hungary===
In October 1956 Mikoyan was sent to the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] to gather information on the developing crisis caused by the [[Hungarian revolution of 1956|revolution]] against the communist government there. Together with [[Mikhail Suslov]], Mikoyan traveled in an [[armored personnel carrier]] to [[Budapest]], due to the shooting on the streets. He sent a telegram to Moscow reporting his impressions of the situation. &quot;We had the impression that [[ErnÅ GerÅ]] especially, but the other comrades as well, are exaggerating the strength of the opponent and underestimating their own strength,&quot; he and Suslov wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mikoyan, Anastas; [[Mikhail Suslov|Suslov, Mikhail]] | title = Soviet Documents on the Hungarian Revolution, 24 October&amp;nbsp;â 4 November 1956 | url = http://www.scribd.com/doc/14152546/Soviet-Archival-Documents-on-Hungary-OctoberNovember-1956-Translated-by-Johanna-Granville | accessdate = 19 January 2011 | date = 24 October&amp;nbsp;â 4 November 1956 | pages = 22â23 and 29â34 | publisher = ''Cold War International History Project Bulletin''.

* '''Note:''' See the Mikoyan-Suslov Report of 24 October in Johanna Granville&lt;/ref&gt; Mikoyan strongly opposed the decision by Khrushchev and the Politburo to use Soviet troops, believing it would destroy the Soviet Union's international reputation, instead arguing for the application of &quot;military intimidation&quot; and economic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;BÃ©kÃ©s, Csaba, Malcolm Byrne, M.

===The United States===
Khrushchev's liberalization of hard-line policies led to an improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States during the late 1950s. As Khrushchev's primary emissary, Mikoyan visited the United States several times. Despite the volatility of the [[Cold War]] between the two superpowers, many Americans received Mikoyan  amiably, including [[Minnesota]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], who characterized him as someone who showed a &quot;flexibility of attitude&quot; and [[New York (state)|New York]] governor [[Averell Harriman]], who described him as a &quot;less rigid&quot; Soviet politician.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timemag2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | title = Foreign Relations: Down to Hard Cases | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892066,00.html | accessdate = 19 January 2011 | date = 26 January 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 1958 Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of [[Berlin]] into an independent, demilitarized &quot;free city&quot;, giving the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the [[East German]]s. Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev's actions, claiming they violated &quot;Party principle.&quot; Khrushchev had proposed the ultimatum to the West before discussing it with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]]. Ruud van Djik, a historian, believed Mikoyan was angry because of Khrushchev didn't consult him about the proposal. When asked by Khrushchev to ease tension with the United States, Mikoyan responded, &quot;You started it, so you go!&quot; However, Mikoyan eventually left for Washington and discussed the situation with [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[President of the United States]]. While he succeeded in reducing the tension between the two countries, Mikoyan failed to alter the US's Berlin policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWV&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | author = van Djik, Ruud | title = Encyclopedia of the Cold War | volume = 1 | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |location=New York| year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=rUdmyzkw9q4C&amp;dq | isbn = 0415975158 | page = 586 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikoyan disapproved of Khrushchev's walkout from the 1960 [[Paris]] Summit over the [[U-2 Crisis of 1960]], which he believed kept tension in the Cold War high for another fifteen years. However, throughout this time, he remained Khrushchev's closest ally in the upper echelons of the Soviet leadership. As Mikoyan later noted, Khrushchev &quot;engaged [in] inexcusable hysterics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Newman, Kitty | title = Macmillan, Khrushchev and the Berlin Crisis 1958â1960 | volume = | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |location=New York| year = 2007 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=JKPBwM-dtBsC&amp;dq | isbn = 0415354633 | page = 175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1963 Mikoyan was asked by Khrushchev to represent the USSR at [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]]'s funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Cuba===
[[Image:Image-Mikoyan Fidel.png|thumb|250px|Mikoyan (right) standing beside the two Cuban revolutionary leaders, [[Che Guevara]] (middle) and [[Fidel Castro]] (left)]]
The Soviet government welcomed the overthrow of Cuban President [[Fulgencio Batista]] by [[Fidel Castro]]'s pro-socialist rebels in 1959. Khrushchev realized the potential of a Soviet ally in the [[Caribbean]] and dispatched Mikoyan as one of the top diplomats in Latin America. He was the first Soviet official to visit Cuba after the revolution, and secured important trade agreements with the new government.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWV&quot;/&gt; He left Cuba with a very positive impression, saying that the atmosphere there made him feel &quot;as though I had returned to my childhood.&quot;{{sfn|Taubman|2004|pp=532â533}}

Khrushchev told Mikoyan of his idea of shipping Soviet missiles to Cuba; Mikoyan was opposed to the idea, and was even more opposed to giving the Cubans control over the Soviet missiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWV&quot;/&gt; During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], Mikoyan was sent to Cuba to persuade Castro to remove the nuclear missiles and bombers the Soviet Union had placed on the island.{{sfn|Taubman|2004|pp=580ff}} In this he failed, and the Soviets were forced to remove the missiles and the bombers without any Cuban participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CWV&quot;/&gt; Just prior to beginning negotiations with Castro, Mikoyan was informed about the death of his wife, Ashkhen, in Moscow; rather than return there for the funeral, Mikoyan opted to stay and sent his son [[Sergo Mikoyan|Sergo]] there instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Sergei Khrushchev|Khrushchev, Sergei]]; Benson, Shirley | title = Nikita Khrushchev and the Creation of a Superpower | volume = 1 | publisher = [[Penn State Press]]|location=University Park, PA | year = 2008 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=dQeahlZdM7sC&amp;dq | isbn = 0271021705 | pages = 652â653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Head of state and coup involvement==
Nikita Khrushchev, in a three-minute speech, decreed the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] would replace [[Leonid Brezhnev]] as [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] with Mikoyan. Mikoyan's appointment to the office of head of state was, according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, due to Mikoyan's declining health and old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Staff writer]] | title = Russia: Successor Confirmed | page = 1 | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939017,00.html | accessdate = 14 February 2011 | date = 24 July 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[William Taubman]] states in his book ''Khrushchev: The Man and His Era'' that there are some historians who are convinced that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev had turned into a liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and [[Alexei Kosygin]] to power.{{sfn|Taubman|2004|pp=3â17}} However, Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was the only member of the Presidium (the name for the Politburo at this time) to defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). Alone among Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, though he never spoke to him again.

==Death, personality, and legacy==

As with Khrushchev and other companions, Mikoyan in his last days wrote frank but selective [[memoirs]] from his political career during Stalin's rule.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=669}} Mikoyan died on 21 October 1978, at the age of 82, from natural causes and was buried at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. He received six commendations of the [[Order of Lenin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SovArmenian&quot; /&gt;

Mikoyan, in a description by [[Simon Sebag-Montefiore]], was &quot;slim, circumspect, wily and industrious&quot;. He has been described as an intelligent man, understanding English, having learned [[German language|German]] on his own by translating the German version of [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' to [[Russian language|Russian]]. Unlike many others, Mikoyan was not afraid to come into a heated argument with Stalin. &quot;One was never bored with Mikoyan&quot;, Artyom Sergeev notes, while Khrushchev called him a true [[cavalier]]. However, Khrushchev warned of trusting &quot;that shrewd fox from the east.&quot;{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=83n}} In a close conversation with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], Stalin referred Mikoyan as a &quot;duckling in politics&quot;; he noted, however, that if Mikoyan ever took a serious shot he would improve.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=52}} Mikoyan had so many children, five boys and the two sons of the late Bolshevik leader [[Stepan Shahumyan]], that he and his wife faced economic problems. His wife Ashkhen would borrow money from Politburo wives who had fewer children. If Mikoyan had discovered this he would, according to his children, have become furious.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|pp=12n., 43â44}}

Dubbed the [[Vicar of Bray]] of politics and known as the &quot;Survivor&quot; during his time, Mikoyan was one of the few Old Bolsheviks who was spared from Stalin's purges and was able to retire comfortably from political life. This was highlighted in a number of popular sayings in Russian, including &quot;From Illich [Lenin] to Illich &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Leonid Brezhnev|Leonid Illich Brezhnev]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;...without accident or stroke!&quot;.{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=83n}} One veteran Soviet official described his political career in the following manner: &quot;The rascal was able to walk through [[Red Square]] on a rainy day without an umbrella [and] without getting wet. He could dodge the raindrops.&quot;{{sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=83n}}
