The '''Free Software Foundation''' ('''FSF''') is a [[non-profit corporation]] founded by [[Richard Stallman]] on 4 October 1985 to support the [[free software movement]], a [[copyleft]]-based movement which aims to promote the universal freedom to create, distribute and modify [[computer software]]. The FSF is incorporated in [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FSF MACorpRegistry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/CorpSearchSummary.asp?ReadFromDB=True&amp;UpdateAllowed=&amp;FEIN=042888848|title=FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC. Summary Screen | publisher=The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Commonwealth, Corporations Division|accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its founding until the mid-1990s, FSF's funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write [[free software]] for the [[GNU Project]]. Since the mid-1990s, the FSF's employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the [[free software community]].

Consistent with its goals, only [[free software]] is used on FSF's computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/linux-gnu-freedom.html | title = Linux, GNU, and freedom | accessdate = 2006-12-10 | author = Stallman, Richard M. | authorlink = Richard Stallman | year = 2002 | work = Philosophy of the GNU Project | publisher = GNU Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GPL enforcement ==

The FSF holds the copyrights on many pieces of the [[GNU]] system, such as [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. As holder of these copyrights, it has the authority to enforce the [[copyleft]] requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) when [[copyright infringement]] occurs on that software. While other copyright holders of other software systems adopted the GPL as their license, FSF was the only{{By whom|date=May 2011}} organization to regularly assert its copyright interests on software so licensed{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} until [[Harald Welte]] launched [[gpl-violations.org]] in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

From 1991 until 2001, GPL enforcement was done informally, usually by Stallman himself, often with assistance from FSF's lawyer, [[Eben Moglen]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Typically, GPL violations during this time were cleared up by short email exchanges between Stallman and the violator.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In late 2001, [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] (then Executive Director), with the assistance of Moglen, David Turner, and [[Peter T. Brown]], formalized these efforts into FSF's GPL Compliance Labs. From 2002-2004, high profile GPL enforcement cases, such as those against [[Linksys]] and [[OpenTV]], became frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Meeker | first = Heather | title = The Legend of Linksys | date=  2005-06-28 | url = http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090419230853/http://linuxinsider.com/story/qECCd2x743n32T/The-Legend-of-Linksys.xhtml | archivedate = 2009-04-19}} Hosted on the [[Wayback machine]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Gillmor  | first = Dan | title = GPL Legal Battle Coming? | publisher = SiliconValley.com (a division of the [[San Jose Mercury News]]) | date=  2003-05-21 | url = http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030524174013/http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/001029.shtml |archivedate = 2003-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Turner | first = David | coauthors = [[Bradley M.

GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSF's efforts during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy | first = Dennis | date=  2004-01-11 | title = A Great Learning Opportunity for Software Lawyers&amp;nbsp;â Upcoming GPL Seminar | url = http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928125310/http://www.denniskennedy.com/blog/2004/01/a_great_learning_opportunity_f.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 | publisher= [[Slashdot]] | last = Lord | first = Timothy | date=  2003-07-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | title =  Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 FSF filed a lawsuit against [[Cisco]] for using GPL-licensed components shipped with [[Linksys]] products. Cisco was notified of the licensing issue in 2003 but Cisco repeatedly disregarded its obligations under the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Paul | first = Ryan | title = Free Software Foundation lawsuit against Cisco a first | date = 2007-12-13 | publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081211-free-software-foundation-lawsuit-against-cisco-a-first.html | accessdate = 2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 FSF dropped the lawsuit when Cisco agreed to make a monetary donation to the FSF and appoint a Free Software Director to conduct continuous reviews of the company's license compliance practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Paul | first = Ryan | title = Cisco settles FSF GPL lawsuit, appoints compliance officer | date = 2009-05-21 | publisher = [[Arstechnica.com]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/05/cisco-settles-fsf-gpl-lawsuit-appoints-compliance-officer.ars | accessdate = 2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2005, FSF held legal seminars to explain the GPL and the law around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =  Seminar On Details Of The GPL And Related Licenses | url = http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/18/1835252 | accessdate = 2008-07-04 | date = 2003-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually taught by [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] and [[Daniel Ravicher]], these seminars offered [[Continuing Legal Education|CLE credit]] and were the first effort to give formal legal education on the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;FSF Bulletin 3 notes that a seminar led by Kuhn and Ravicher occurred on 2003-08-08{{cite web | author = Free Software Foundation  | title = FSF Bulletin&amp;nbsp;â Issue No.2 - June 2003 | publisher = Free Software Foundation | date=  2003-06 | url = http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bulletin-002.html | accessdate =  2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/press/2004-01-02-nyc-seminars.html |title=FSF To Host Free Software Licensing Seminars and Discussions on SCO v.

== Current and ongoing activities ==

; The [[GNU project]]: The original purpose of the FSF was to promote the ideals of free software. The organization developed the [[GNU]] operating system as an example of this.
; GNU licenses: The [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) is a widely used license for free software projects. The current version (version 3) was released in June 2007. The FSF has also published the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL), and the [[GNU Affero General Public License]] (AGPL).
; GNU Press: The FSF's publishing department, responsible for &quot;publishing affordable books on computer science using freely distributable licenses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.fsf.org/category/books/ List of books published] in GNU Press home site&lt;/ref&gt;
; The [[Free Software Directory]] : This is a listing of software packages that have been verified as free software. Each package entry contains 47 pieces of information such as the project's homepage, developers, programming language, etc. The goals are to provide a search engine for free software, and to provide a cross-reference for users to check if a package has been verified as being free software. FSF has received a small amount of funding from [[UNESCO]] for this project. It is hoped that the directory can be translated into many languages in the future{{By whom|date=May 2010}}.
; Maintaining the [[Free Software Definition]] : FSF maintains many of the documents that define the free software movement.
; Project hosting: FSF hosts software development projects on their [[GNU Savannah|Savannah]] website.
; [[Political campaign]]s : FSF sponsors a number of campaigns against what it perceives as dangers to software freedom, including [[software patent]]s, [[digital rights management]] (which the FSF has re-termed &quot;digital restrictions management&quot;, as part of their effort to highlight their view that such technologies are &quot;designed to take away and limit your rights,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/drm.html |title=Digital Restrictions Management and Treacherous Computing |date=September 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-12-17 |publisher=Free Software Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and user interface copyright. [[Defective by Design]] is an FSF-initiated campaign against DRM. They also have a campaign to promote [[Ogg]]+[[Vorbis]], a free alternative to [[proprietary formats]] like [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]]. They also sponsor some free software projects that are deemed to be &quot;high-priority&quot;.
; Annual awards: &quot;[[Award for the Advancement of Free Software]]&quot; and &quot;[[Free Software Award for Projects of Social Benefit]]&quot;

== High priority projects ==
[[File:GNewSense screenshot.png|thumb|300px|[[gNewSense]] is a distribution officially supported by the ''FSF'']]

The FSF maintains a [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority-projects/ list of &quot;high priority projects&quot;] to which the Foundation claims that &quot;''there is a vital need to draw the [[free software community]]'s attention''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;highpriority&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html |title=High Priority Free Software Projects|accessdate=January 4, 2009 |publisher=Free Software Foundation |authorlink=Free Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF considers these projects &quot;''important because computer users are continually being seduced into using [[non-free software]], because there is no adequate free replacement.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;highpriority&quot; /&gt;

Previous projects highlighted as needing work included the [[Free Java implementations]], [[GNU Classpath]], and [[GNU Compiler for Java]], which ensure compatibility for the Java part of [[OpenOffice.org]], and the [[GNOME]] desktop environment (see [[Java (Sun)#Licensing|Java: Licensing]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The effort has been criticized for either not instigating active development or for there only being slow work being done, even after certain projects were added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTM1OQ FSF's High-Priority Driver Project Doesn't Move] [[Phoronix]], April 20, 2011 (Article by [[Michael Larabel]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The FSF's [[board of directors]] is:

* [[Hal Abelson]], Founding member,&lt;ref name=&quot;founders&quot;&gt;The first GNU's Bulletin ({{cite web| title = GNU'S Bulletin, Volume 1, No.1 | publisher = Free Software Foundation | month=  February | year=  1986 | url = http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}), indicates this list of people as ''round[ing] out FSF's board of directors''.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Computer Science at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (served from inception until March 5, 1998, and rejoined circa 2005)

* [[Gerald Jay Sussman]], Professor of [[Computer Science]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (served since inception)
* [[Benjamin Mako Hill]], graduate student at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. (served since July 25, 2007)
* [[Bradley Kuhn]], Executive Director of the [[Software Freedom Conservancy]] and FSF's former Executive Director (served since March 25, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bradley Kuhn Joins the FSF Board | date=  2010-03-25 | url = http://www.fsf.org/blogs/bradley-kuhn-joins-the-fsf-board | accessdate = 2010-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous board members include:

* [[Lawrence Lessig]], Professor of Law at [[Stanford University]] (served since  March 28, 2004 until 2008)
* [[Robert J. Chassell]], Founding Treasurer,&lt;ref name=&quot;founders&quot; /&gt; as well as a Founding Director (served from inception until June 3, 1997)
* [[Leonard H. Tower Jr.|Len Tower Jr.]], Founding member,&lt;ref name=&quot;founders&quot; /&gt; served until September 2, 1997
* [[Miguel de Icaza]] (served from August 1999&lt;ref&gt;The FSF annual filings with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 1998 and
1999 show that De Icaza was not on the board on 1998-11-01 and was as of 1999-11-01, so he clearly joined sometime between those dates. Those documents further indicate that the 1999 Annual meeting occurred in August; usually, new directors are elected at annual meetings.&lt;/ref&gt; until February 25, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;The FSF annual filings with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 2002 ({{cite web | authorlink = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm | title = 2002 Annual Report for Free Software Foundation, Inc. | publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts | date=  2002-12-17 | url = http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/display_pdf.asp?CORP_DRIVE1/2002/1217/000000000/9152/200228079130_1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}) show that De Icaza has left the board. Changes to board composition are usually made at the annual meeting; which occurred on February 25, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Eben Moglen]] (served from July 28, 2000&lt;ref&gt;The FSF annual filings with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for 1999 and
2000 show that Moglen was not on the board on 1999-11-01 and was as of 2000-11-01, so he clearly joined sometime between those dates. Those documents further indicate that the 2000 Annual meeting occurred on July 28, 2000; usually, new directors are elected at annual meetings.&lt;/ref&gt; until 2007&lt;ref&gt;Moglen announced his intention to resign in his blog ({{cite web | last = Moglen | first = Eben | authorlink = Eben Moglen | title = And Now ... Life After GPLv3 | date=  2007-04-23 | url = http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/blog/organizations/SFLC/Transition.html | accessdate = 2007-08-11 }}). The resignation likely occurred at the 2007 annual meeting of the directors; the exact date of that meeting is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;!--I know he announced on [[April 23]], but when did his term actually end?  Bkuhn responds: There are no third-party sources for that yet, but I've added a link to what we know. --&gt;

The FSF Board of Directors is elected by the Voting Membership, whose powers include at least this are outlined in the by-laws:&lt;ref name=&quot;maaa&quot;/&gt; {{quote|In addition to the right to elect Directors as provided in the by-laws and such other powers and rights as may be vested in them by law, these Articles of Organization or the by-laws, the Voting Members shall have such other powers and rights as the Directors may designate.|Articles of Amendment|Free Software Foundation, Inc.}}

There are currently no known documents available that indicate the composition of the FSF's Voting Membership.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

John Sullivan is the current FSF Executive Director. Previous members that occupied the position were Peter Brown (2005-2010) and Bradley Kuhn (2001-2005).

At any given time, there are usually around a dozen employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.fsf.org/about/staff | title = Meet the staff of the Free Software Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most, but not all, work at the FSF headquarters in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm | title = Certificate of Change of Principal Office | publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts | date=  2005-05-26 | url = http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/corp/corpsearch/display_pdf.asp?CORP_DRIVE1/2005/0526/000000000/4122/200516698270_1.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eben Moglen]] and [[Dan Ravicher]] previously served individually as [[pro bono]] legal counsel to the FSF. Since the forming of the [[Software Freedom Law Center]], legal services to the FSF are provided by that organization.

On November 25, 2002, the FSF launched the FSF Associate Membership program for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;The site member.fsf.org first appears in the Internet Archive in  December 2002, and that site lists the date of the launch as 25 November 2002. {{cite web | title = FSF Membership Page, as of 2002-12-20 | publisher = The Internet Archive | date=  2002-12-20 | url = http://member.fsf.org/  | accessdate = 2007-08-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20021220112452/http://member.fsf.org/ |archivedate = 2002-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bradley M.

Associate members hold a purely honorary and funding support role to the FSF.&lt;ref name=&quot;maaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web   | authorlink = http://www.sec.state.ma.us/cor/coridx.htm   | title = Articles of Amendment   | publisher = The Commonwealth of Massachusetts   | date= | url = http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/Constitution#cart000.htm | accessdate = 2011-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SCO lawsuit ==
In March 2003, [[SCO v. IBM|SCO filed suit against IBM]] alleging that IBM's contributions to various [[free software]], including FSF's [[GNU]], violated SCO's rights. While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit, FSF was [[subpoena]]ed on November 5, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Heise | first = Mark | title = SCO Subpoena of FSF | publisher = Free Software Foundation | date=  2003-11-05 | url = http://www.fsf.org/licensing/sco/sco-subpoena.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2003 and 2004, FSF put substantial advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and quelling its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kuhn | first = Bradley | authorlink = Bradley M.

== Criticism ==
On May 2, 2010, Ed Bott, author of 25 books on Microsoft Windows and Office&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott&lt;/ref&gt;, on [[ZDNet]] accused the FSF of presenting factual errors on the front page of their PlayOgg campaign and accused the author of deliberately attempting to misinform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | authorlink = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/ogg-versus-the-world-dont-fall-for-open-source-fud/2086 | title = Ogg versus the world: Don't fall for open-source FUD.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 | url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/ogg-versus-the-world-dont-fall-for-open-source-fud/2086}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ed Bott stated that the FSF's reference to Microsoft being ordered to pay [[Alcatel-Lucent]] $1.5 billion in a MP3 patent lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/02/8910.ars|title=Microsoft ordered to pay $1.5 billion in MP3 patent lawsuit|publisher=Ars Technica|date=2007-02-22|accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was &quot;an outright lie&quot; because, although Microsoft was in fact found guilty and ordered to pay for infringing on their patent, the verdict was later reversed.
Ed Bott also criticized an alleged reference to software such as [[RealPlayer]], [[Windows Media Player]] and [[iTunes]] as being formats instead of software, claiming that it was [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|FUD]].  He also referred to the statement that those software titles spied on users as being &quot;FUD in its purest form&quot; and were &quot;pretty serious accusation to make with no factual backup&quot;, in spite of widely reported privacy issues in RealPlayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerbytesman.com/privacy/realjb.htm|publisher=computerbytesman.com|title=The RealJukeBox monitoring system|date=October 31, 1999 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_07/b3668067.htm|title=The Privacy War of Richard Smith|publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772-2/the_25_worst_tech_products_of_all_time.html|title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time|accessdate=2011-11-03|publisher=PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt; iTunes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/48880/2006/01/ministore.html|publisher=MacWorld|title=Eyeing the iTunes MiniStore |date=2006-11-01|accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes-update-spies.html|title=iTunes update spies on your listening and sends it to Apple?|publisher=Boingboing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows Media Player&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/73158-is-media-player-spyware|title=Is Media Player Spyware?|publisher=ExtremeTech|date=2002-04-06|accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerbytesman.com/privacy/wmp8dvd.htm|title=Serious privacy problems in Windows Media Player for Windows XP|date=February 20, 2002|accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Linus Torvalds]] has criticized FSF for using GPL3 as a weapon in their fight against DRM. Torvalds argues that the issue of DRM and that of a software license should be treated as two separate issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ã  21:00 |url=https://linuxfr.org/nodes/85904/comments/1230981 |title=Original version |publisher=LinuxFr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2010, Joe Brockmeier, a journalist at [[Linux Magazine]], criticized the campaigning practices of the FSF, calling their campaigns such as [[Defective by Design]], &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;juvenile&quot; and not being adequate for providing users with &quot;credible alternatives&quot; to proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Party of Gno.| accessdate = 2010-06-22 | url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7806/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
