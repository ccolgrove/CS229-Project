'''Nicola Panaro''' (born in [[Casal di Principe]], September 12, 1968), is an  Italian [[Camorra|Camorrista]] and member in the [[Casalesi clan]] from [[Casal di Principe]] in the [[province of Caserta]] between [[Naples]] and [[Salerno]]. He has been on the &quot;[[List of most wanted fugitives in Italy|most wanted list]]&quot; of the Italian ministry of the Interior since 2003 until his arrest in April 2010. Convicted for extortion and membership in the Camorra, he has yet to serve a prison sentence of nine years and four months.&lt;ref name=ricerca&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.interno.it/mininterno/export/sites/default/it/sezioni/sala_stampa/notizie/polizia/Latitante_panaro_nicola.html Direzione centrale della Polizia Criminale - Programma Speciale di Ricerca -  Nicola Panaro]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He is a nephew of Casalesi boss [[Francesco Schiavone]] and considered to be the actual leader of the clan with Schiavoneâs wife Giuseppina Nappa, [[Vincenzo Schiavone]] and [[Mario Caterino]].&lt;ref name=rai300908&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.rainews24.it/it/news.php?newsid=86489 100 arresti e 100 milioni sequestrati ai casalesi], Rai News, September 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was first arrested in March 1999 for [[racketeering]] and Mafia association. He was also charged with the murder of Aldo Scalzone in 1991. The Camorra considered Scalzone to be a police informer. Panaro was released in 2002 after his lawyers demonstrated that testimonies of Camorra turncoats were insufficient. Since his release he became a fugitive.&lt;ref name=meo&gt;{{it icon}} [http://simonedimeo.blogspot.com/2009/06/nicola-panaro-superlatitante-casalese.html Nicola Panaro superlatitante casalese], Simone Di Meo blogspot, June 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rep140410/&gt;
