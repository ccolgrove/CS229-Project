''' Eli Nelson Manning'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Giantsbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.giants.com/team/roster/Eli-Manning/076f2201-496c-4eb7-83e2-18a01a412059 Player: Eli Manning-Personal]. New York Giants official website. Retrieved 201-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; (born Elisha Nelson Manning on January 3, 1981) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]].  He is the younger brother of NFL quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] and the son of former NFL quarterback [[Archie Manning]]. He played [[college football]] at [[University of Mississippi]] (Ole Miss) after attending prep school at [[Isidore Newman School]] in New Orleans. He was drafted as the first overall pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] by the [[San Diego Chargers]], and immediately traded to the [[New York Giants]], who in return, gave up a package highlighted by 4th overall selection [[Philip Rivers]]. Manning won the [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award in [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008 after he led the Giants to a victory over the previously undefeated [[New England Patriots]].
==College career==
[[Image:Elimanning1.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Eli Manning during his tenure at the University of Mississippi.]]
Prior to deciding which [[college]] to attend, Manning received a call from [[David Cutcliffe]], formerly the [[offensive coordinator]] at the [[University of Tennessee]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Cutcliffe, who had previously helped Eli's older brother Cooper, improve his game, had been hired as the [[head coach]] at the University of Mississippi. Upon learning Cutcliffe was now in charge of the Rebel program, the 18-year-old followed his fatherâs footsteps, and made his way to [[Oxford, Mississippi]]

During his [[American football|football]] [[career]] at [[Ole Miss]], Manning set or tied 45 single-game, [[Season (sports)|season]], and career records. His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list). Manning also led the Rebels to a 10-3 record and a 31-28 [[AT&amp;T|SBC]] [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] victory over the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] in 2003.  He was invited to play in the 2004 [[Senior Bowl]], but chose not to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;nflplayers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflplayers.com/players/player.aspx?id=35635&amp;section=bio|title=Eli Manning-PLAYERS-NFLPLAYERS.COM|author=|publisher=NFL Players Association|accessdate=2008-03-05|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--ref is for entire paragraph--&gt;

As his senior year came to a close, Manning won many awards including the [[Maxwell Award]] as the nationâs best all-around player, the [[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]], the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame Scholar Athlete Award, the Sporting News Radio Socrates Award, and the SEC Player of the Year. He was also a candidate for the [[Heisman Trophy]] but lost to Oklahoma's quarterback [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]] (1,481 voting points). Manning had 710 voting points making him third behind White and [[University of Pittsburgh]] wide receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heisman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/2003_archive_awards.html|title=Heisman Won By A QB For 4th Straight Year

==Professional career==
===2004 NFL Draft===
The [[San Diego Chargers]] originally held the rights to the overall first pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] due to them going 4-12 in 2003. With Manning being the most highly coveted player in the draft, it appeared that the Chargers' intentions were to draft Manning first overall. However, Manning (echoed by his father Archie) stated publicly that he would refuse to play for the Chargers if drafted by them. The Chargers selected him with the first pick overall nonetheless as the team had a deal in place with the [[New York Giants]] where the Giants would draft and then trade [[Philip Rivers]] and draft picks (used to pick [[Shawne Merriman]] and [[Nate Kaeding]]) to the Chargers for Manning.

===Quarterback class of 2004===
Manning was one of four quarterbacks taken in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft along with [[Ben Roethlisberger]], [[Philip Rivers]], and [[J.P. Losman]].  Manning, Roethlisberger, and Rivers have been voted to the Pro Bowl since becoming starters, none has produced a season with a losing record (although each has had an 8-8 season), and Roethlisberger and Manning have each won a Super Bowl.  They have been compared favorably to the [[Quarterback class of 1983]], which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks [[Dan Marino]], [[John Elway]], and [[Jim Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/don_banks/08/28/qbs/index.html Best quarterback class ever? Trio from '04 makes its case over '83]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 Season===
Manning made his first career regular season start against the Atlanta Falcons at [[Giants Stadium]] on November 21, 2004. In his fourth start, against the Baltimore Ravens in M&amp;T Bank Stadium on December 12, 2004, he ended the day with a 0.0 passer rating and was benched in the second half in favor of Kurt Warner, but remained the Giants starter through the end of the season.

===2005 season: NFC East champions===
{{See also|2005 New York Giants season}}
Following 2004, [[Kurt Warner]] voided the last year of his contract&lt;ref name=&quot;warner&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1955151|title=Warner won't be Eli's backup for next year|agency=Associated Press|publisher=sports.espn.go.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2004-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Eli was named the starter for 2005. Manning led the Giants to a 2-0 record with victories against the [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]] and [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsucks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20050921-9999-1s21manning1.html|title=Nothing personal, San Diego; Eli Manning just didn't want to be a Charger|author=Jerry Magee|publisher=UNION-TRIBUNE|accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2005-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;giants lead&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/giants/2005-09-20-hot-start_x.htm|title=At 2-0, Giants taking baby steps toward bigger things|author=Stephen Edelson|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2005-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; before traveling to the West Coast for a test in San Diego. Chargers fans did not forget the snub, and on September 25, 2005 when Manning and the Giants made their first trip to [[San Diego]] for a game since that draft day, the crowd booed Manning loudly every time he touched the ball. San Diego defeated the Giants,&lt;ref name=&quot;chargers05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giants.com/gameday/2005Week3GiantsatChargers.asp|title=Giants Fall to Chargers, 45-23|author=|publisher=giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2005-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45-23, but Eli displayed what may have been his most impressive performance of his young career, going 24-41 for 352 yards and two touchdowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;inside story&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giants.com/news/eisen/story.asp?story_id=9181|title=Chargers 45, Giants 23: Inside the Numbers!|author=Michael Eisen|publisher=giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2005-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his performance at San Diego, Manning returned home to throw for almost 300 yards and a career high four touchdowns against the Rams at Giants stadium in a 44-24 romp.&lt;ref name=&quot;rams05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251002019|title=Giants versus Rams recap|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two games later, he led a last-minute drive against the Broncos to secure a 24-23 victory for the Giants.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncos05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251023019|title=Giants versus [[Broncos]] recap|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drive culminated in a two yard touchdown to [[Amani Toomer]] with five seconds remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncos05&quot;/&gt; Two weeks later, Manning overcame a weak first half at San Francisco to help his team secure their first official road victory of the season, 24&amp;ndash;6. Despite a poor performance at home against the [[Vikings]], throwing four [[interceptions]], he again led his team back to tie the game in the final minutes before the Vikings won on a late field goal.

Manning's second season was largely a success. He finished in the top 5 in both [[passing yards]] and touchdown passes, while leading an offense that finished 3rd in the NFL in scoring, with a total of 422 points. It was the most points the Giants scored in a single season since 1963. The Giants won the NFC East with an 11&amp;ndash;5 record,&lt;ref name=&quot;05finalstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamgiants.com/05reviews.htm|title=2005 NFC East Final Standings|author=|publisher=Team Giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to the postseason.

===2006 season===
{{See also|2006 New York Giants season}}
Manning's second full season was reminiscent of his 2005 campaign. He started off playing well and completed over 65 percent of his passes through the first four games. However, he struggled in the second half of the season and his production diminished towards the end of the regular season. After losing a tough game to his brother Peyton and the [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] on opening day,&lt;ref name=&quot;firstday06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/20060908-0112-fbn-giants-ratingeli.html|title=Hype aside, Colts game should offer gauge of Eli Manning's progress|author=David Porter|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eli and the Giants rebounded from a 24-7 4th-quarter deficit en route to a 30-24 overtime victory over the division rival [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] in week two.&lt;ref name=&quot;eagles06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/games/2006-09-17-giants-eagles_x.htm|title=Manning, Giants rally to stun Eagles with overtime road victory |author=Tom Pedulla|work=USA Today|accessdate=2011-08-19|date=2006-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning threw for a career high 371 yards in the win with three touchdowns including a game-winning pass to [[Plaxico Burress]] in overtime.&lt;ref name=&quot;eagles06-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap?gid=20060917021|title=NY Giants 30, Philadelphia 24, OT|author=Rob Maaddi|publisher=AP Sports|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a poor performance against [[Seattle Seahawks|Seattle]] the next week,&lt;ref name=&quot;seahawks06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/boxscore?gid=20060924026|title=Seattle 42, NY Giants 30|author=|publisher=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning and the Giants responded by winning five straight games including wins over the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]], [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] and [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]] to push their record to 6-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;biggame06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061112/news_lz1s12biggame.html|title=Today's big game: Bears (7-1) at Giants (6-2)|author=Joe Pascale|publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this winning streak, key injuries including one to receiver [[Amani Toomer]] pushed Manning and the Giants into a downward slide.&lt;ref name=&quot;toomer06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/giants/2006-11-08-toomer-injury_x.htm|title=Giants receiver Amani Toomer out for year with knee injury|author=Tom Canavan|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-08|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing against the [[Chicago Bears]], Manning started well, but the Giant's offense was derailed by the loss of left tackle [[Luke Petitgout]] to a broken leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;petitgout06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2659628|title=Depleted Giants lose Petitgout to fractured left leg|author=ESPN.com news services|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning was held to only 141 yards passing with two interceptions. Petigout's loss left a gaping hole at the crucial left tackle position, and Manning was unable to repeat his first half success. Manning struggled the next week at [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jags06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores106/106324/NFL702292.htm|title=Box Score|author=|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the week after that, a costly interception helped to culminate a huge collapse at [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]], with the Giants seeing a 21-point fourth quarter lead simply evaporate.&lt;ref name=&quot;titans06&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/sports/football/28giants.html?_r=1&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/M/Manning,%20Eli&amp;oref=slogin|title=Day After Debacle, the Giants Close Ranks|author=John Branch|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning improved the following week, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns, but the Giants lost again. Finally regaining momentum, Manning threw three touchdowns in a win at [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]],&lt;ref name=&quot;panthers06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports-att.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=261210029|title=NY Giants 27, Carolina 13|author=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then he stumbled badly in the final three games. He threw two interceptions against the Eagles and tallied only 73 passing yards in a game against the [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]]. Although the Giants battled back to 8-8 the following week at Washington, Manning completed only 12 of 26 passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. The Giants qualified for the postseason and met the Eagles again. Although he did significantly better in this game than the 2005 playoff matchup, completing 16 of 27 passes and two touchdowns, the Giants lost on a last-second field goal by the Eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;playoffs06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270107021|title=Westbrook, Garcia keep streaking Eagles' train rolling|author=|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the year, Manning threw for 3,244 yards, 24 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;totalstats06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/stats?playerId=5526|title=#10 Eli Manning QB
|author=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed 57.7 percent of his passes, a five point improvement from 2005, but he again struggled badly in the second half of the season. Manning finished the season with a quarterback efficiency rating of 77.0 (18th in the league) with 6.2 yards per attempt.

Manning threw two touchdowns in the victory, but the crucial play occurred in the third quarter. With the Giants trailing by four, Manning appeared to make an illegal forward pass to tight end Kevin Boss. After review, it was determined that the pass was legal. The Giants scored a touchdown two plays later. Week 9 pitted the Giants in a battle with the visiting Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens had come into the game with the league's third-ranked defense; nevertheless, Manning led the Giants to a decisive 30&amp;ndash;10 victory, improving to 9&amp;ndash;1, which included a 200 yard rushing effort by running backs Brandon Jacobs, Derrick Ward and Ahmad Bradshaw.

Two weeks later, the Giants faced the Redskins at Washington in their second encounter in the season. Manning threw his first 300 yard game of the season going 21/34 with an INT and a 40 yard touchdown pass to [[Amani Toomer]]. The Giants beat the Redskins 23â7.

In November, Manning was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month.

In week 16 against the [[Carolina Panthers]] with NFC homefield advantage on the line, Manning had a passing day of 17 of 27 for 181 yards and no interceptions. Manning led the Giants back from deficits of 21â10 and 28â20 to tie the game with just over three minutes left, including a bullet pass to [[Domenik Hixon]] for a key two-point conversion to tie the game at 28. The game was played in freezing conditions.

After becoming the No. 1 seed in the NFC, the Giants had a first playoff round bye week and home field advantage through the rest of the playoffs. In the divisional round, they faced their arch rival [[Philadelphia Eagles]] at Giants Stadium with its signature windy conditions. Philadelphia went on to win the game 23â11.
