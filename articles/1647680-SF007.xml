'''Microsoft Photo Editor''' is an image-editing application found in [[Microsoft Office]] 97&amp;ndash;XP versions for Windows, classified as one of Microsoft Office Tools. It has been replaced by [[Microsoft Office Picture Manager]], although some Photo Editor features are not available in Picture Manager.&lt;ref&gt; Microsoft Knowledgebase http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827740&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was a tool for doing raster graphics with editing tools to texturize, negative, adjust gamma, make GIF transparency and many others. It was based on HALO Desktop Imager by Media Cybernetics, L.P.

==Issues==
Early versions of Microsoft Photo Editor, including the version bundled with Office 2000, erased [[metadata]] from digital camera JPEG images during saves.  The Office 2000 version also, when saving BMP files, sets the resolution metadata to 0 by 0, regardless of what resolution (DPI) is set through the program UI.

Version 3.0.2.3 (and possible other versions) had an issue opening large JPEG photographic images, due in part to its age. The maximum file size is approximately 2 MBs. Large Windows bitmap BMP files can be opened in Microsoft Photo Editor. This suggests an error associated with the decompression logic of the application.
