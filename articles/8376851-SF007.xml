<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="8376851" ns="0" title="List of BSD operating systems"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">There are a number of [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s under active development, descended from the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) series of [[UNIX]] variants developed (originally by [[Bill Joy]]) at the [[UC Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] [[EECS]] department. Currently, there are four major BSD operating systems, and an increasing number of other OSs derived from these, that add or remove certain features but generally remain compatible with their originating OS &amp;mdash; and so are not really forks of them. This is a list of those that have been active in the last couple of years, and their respective [[website]]s.

==FreeBSD-based==
[[FreeBSD]] is a free Unix-like operating system descended from AT&amp;T UNIX via the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). FreeBSD currently has more than 200 active developers and thousands of contributors. Other notable derivatives include [[DragonFly BSD]], which was forked from FreeBSD 4.8, and [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Mac OS X]], with its [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] base including a large amount of code derived from FreeBSD.

==NetBSD-based==
[[NetBSD]] is a freely redistributable, open source version of the Unix-derivative Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) computer operating system. It was the second open source BSD descendant to be formally released, after 386BSD, and continues to be actively developed. Noted for its portability and quality of design and implementation, it is often used in embedded systems and as a starting point for the porting of other operating systems to new computer architectures.

==OpenBSD-based==
[[OpenBSD]] is a Unix-like computer operating system descended from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a Unix derivative developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It was forked from NetBSD in 1995. OpenBSD includes a number of security features absent or optional in other operating systems and has a tradition of developers auditing the source code for software bugs and security problems.

==Historic BSD==
{{Main|Berkeley Software Distribution}}

BSD was originally derived from Unix, using the complete source code for [[Sixth Edition Unix]] for the [[PDP-11]] from [[Bell Labs]] as a starting point for the First Berkeley Software Distribution, or ''1BSD''. A series of updated versions for the PDP-11 followed (the 2.xBSD releases). A [[32-bit]] version for the [[VAX]] platform was released as 3BSD, and the 4.xBSD series added many new features, including [[TCP/IP]] networking.

For many years, the primary developer and project leader was [[Bill Joy]], who was a graduate student at the time; funding for this project was provided by [[DARPA]].  DARPA was interested in obtaining a programming platform and programmer's interface which would provide a robust, general purpose, time-sharing computing platform which would not become obsolete every time computing hardware was or is replaced.  Such an operating system would allow [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] software, especially for intricate, long-term finance and logistics operations, to be quickly ported to new hardware as it became available.

As time went on, code was later ported both from and to [[Unix System III]] and still later [[Unix System V]]. Unix System V Revision 4 ([[SVR4]]), released circa 1992, contained much code which was ported from BSD version up to and including 4.3BSD.
