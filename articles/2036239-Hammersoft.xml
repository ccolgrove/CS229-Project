'''ÄuraÄ BrankoviÄ''' ({{IPA-sh|dÍ¡ÊÃ»radÍ¡Ê brÇËÅkoÌÊitÍ¡É|pron}}) ({{lang-sr-cyr|ÐÑÑÐ°Ñ ÐÑÐ°Ð½ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ}}; {{lang-hu|Brankovics GyÃ¶rgy}}) (1377 â 24 December 1456), also known under the [[patronymic]] ''(ÄuraÄ) VukoviÄ'' and frequently called ''George BrankoviÄ'' in English-language sources, was a [[Serbia]]n [[Despotes|despot]] from 1427 to 1456 and a [[baron]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. He was the first of the [[House of BrankoviÄ]] to hold the [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian monarchy]].

== Family ==
His father was [[Vuk BrankoviÄ, Prince of Kosovo|Vuk BrankoviÄ]] and his mother was Mara, daughter of [[knez (title)|Knez]] [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar HrebeljanoviÄ]], popularly known as [[Tsar]] Lazar. His wife was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] princess, [[Eirene Kantakouzene]], a granddaughter of [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[John VI Kantakouzenos]].

== Reign ==

During his reign the Serbian capital was moved to [[Smederevo]] (near Belgrade) after the [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]].
After he was appointed as a successor for his uncle, Despot [[Stefan LazareviÄ]], BrankoviÄ's rule was marked by new conflicts and the fall of [[Kosovo|Kosovo and Metohia]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. BrankoviÄ allied himself with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1439 the Ottomans captured [[Smederevo]], the BrankoviÄ's capital. The prince fled to the Kingdom of Hungary where he had large estates, which included [[Zemun]], [[Stari Slankamen|Slankamen]], [[Kupinovo|Kupinik]], [[Sremska Mitrovica|Mitrovica]], [[BeÄej|Stari BeÄej]], [[Kulpin, Serbia|Kulpin]], [[Äurug]], [[Sveti Petar]], [[Perlek]], [[Peser]], [[BaÄko Petrovo Selo|Petrovo Selo]], [[Novi BeÄej|BeÄej]], [[AraÄ]], [[Zrenjanin|Veliki BeÄkerek]], [[VrÅ¡ac]], etc.


== Crusade of Varna ==
{{main|Crusade of Varna}}

Following the conflicts that concluded 1443, BrankoviÄ had a significant role in facilitating the [[Peace of Szeged]] (1444) between Kingdom of Hungary and the Ottomans. [[Murad II]], who also desired peace, was married to BrankoviÄ's daughter [[Mara BrankoviÄ|Mara]].&lt;ref name=Florescu1&gt;{{cite book |title=Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times |last=Florescu |first=Radu R. |authorlink=Radu R.

On 22 August 1444 the prince peacefully took possession the evacuated town of Smederevo.

The peace was broken in the same year by Hunyadi and king WÅadysÅaw during the [[Crusade of Varna]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Varna]]. Because of this he estranged from his Hungarian allies. A [[crusades|crusading]] army led by Regent [[John Hunyadi]] of Hungary was [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|defeated by Sultan Murad II's forces]] at [[Kosovo Polje]] in 1448. This was the last concerted attempt in the [[Middle Ages]] to expel the Ottomans from southeastern Europe. Although Hungary was able to successfully defy the Ottomans despite the defeat at Kosovo Polje during Hunyadi's lifetime, the kingdom fell to the Ottomans in the 16th century. BrankoviÄ also captured Hunyadi at Smederevo for a short time when he was going home from Kosovo in 1448.

== Return and Death ==
[[Image:Djuradj Vukovic Brankovic.png|150px|thumb|right|One of Djuradj's many Coats of Arms]]
Following Hunyadi's victory over the Mehmet II at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] on 14 July 1456, a period of relative peace began in the region.  The sultan retreated to Adrianople, and BrankoviÄ regained possession of Serbia.  Before the end of the year, however, the 79-year old BrankoviÄ died.  Serbian independence survived him for only another year, when the Ottoman empire formally annexed his lands following dissension among his widow and three remaining sons.  Lazar, the youngest, poisoned his mother and exiled his brothers, and the land returned to the sultan's subjugation.&lt;ref name=Miller1&gt;{{cite book |title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro |last=Miller |first=William |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1896 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J98DAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exchequer ==

BrankoviÄ was deemed by contemporaries as the richest [[monarch]] in all of Europe; the [[France|French]] [[knight]] [[Bertrand de la Broquierre]] stated the despot's annual income from the gold and silver mines of [[Novo Brdo]] (near [[Gnjilane]] in [[Kosovo]]) amassed to about 200,000 [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ducats. Among other of the Despot's sources of income, there are his possessions in the Kingdom of Hungary, for which expenses were covered by the Hungarian crown. The annual income from them alone was estimated to 50,000 ducats.

==Marriage and children==

ÄuraÄ and [[Eirene Kantakouzene]] had at least six children &lt;ref&gt;[http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SERBIA.htm#DjuradjVukovicdied1456 Profile of ÄuraÄ in &quot;Medieval Lands&quot; by Charles Cawley]&lt;/ref&gt;:
