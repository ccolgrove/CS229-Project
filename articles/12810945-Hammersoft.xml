'''Lola Christie''' is a [[fictional character]]. She appeared in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' for six months in 1998. The character was played by [[Diane Parish]], who notably returned to ''EastEnders'' in 2006 playing a different character, [[Denise Wicks|Denise Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/cast/cast_diane_p.shtml|title= Diane Parish plays Denise Wicks|publisher=''BBC''  | accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lola Christie was introduced in 1998 as a love interest for the character [[Mick McFarlane]], played by Sylvester Williams. At the time, it was the highest profile role for actress Diane Parish.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60730055.html|title= So that's where Lola went to |publisher=''The News Letter''  | date = 1998-10-22| accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was a singer in Mick's jazz band, which suited Diane Parish as she had worked her way through drama school at [[RADA]] by doing session singing at a recording studio, though she had never seriously considered singing as a career. Parish has commented, &quot;The only reason I took on the role of Lola was because her storyline wasn't really to do with her singing, that was just incidental. There was a bit of interest at the time - but I have to confess I didn't exactly have [[Island Records]] beating my door down with a contract!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview1&quot;/&gt; 

Following the end of her initial six month contract, Parish decided to leave ''EastEnders''. In a 1998 interview she revealed, &quot;I had made a decision that I would stay only six months, whatever happened. But I was tempted to stay longer because it is such a great show and lovely people. Leaving was like ripping away from real friendships - but I'm not in this business to settle down. I get itchy feet and I left to do ''[[Picking Up the Pieces (TV series)|Picking Up the Pieces]]'' which is a real challenge. Being a part of ''EastEnders'' is like nothing else, a whole different beast from other shows because practically everyone has watched it at some time and you get to be known wherever you go. I thought that would end when I left, but I still get it even now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview1&quot;/&gt;  

She has since revealed that she found it hard to cope with the fame of being in such a high-profile soap, and in a 2002 interview with the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' it was reported that she &quot;hated&quot; her time in the soap so much, that she had no qualms about turning down a long-term contract: &quot;I resented being a 'star' and I resented acting like one. It is cliquey, and once you are in a soap, that is it. The soap just clings on to you. People say: 'Everything you do before a soap and after does not matter.' It is true. EE made me odd. I was bobbing along happily as a jobbing actress, and then EE came along. I found it strange to lose my anonymity. People really believe they own you. They grab you, scream at you. I did not cope well. I became introverted and I stayed in a lot. I felt a bit depressed, too. I felt I had lost something. In the end I just had to get out. I lost the point as to why I was doing the job, and to be perfectly frank it just got messy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85796002.html|title= EXCLUSIVE: WHY HER 'OSCAR' IS SO SPECIAL FOR BILL'S DIANE.|publisher=''The Mirror''  | date = 2002-05-11| accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-138510698.html|title= YOU'RE NICKED!

I love watching it. [[Jim Branning]] is fab.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview3&quot;/&gt; Parish did return to the soap in 2006, but playing a completely different character, [[Denise Wicks|Denise Fox]]. On her decision to return, Parish said, &quot;''EastEnders'' was different back then. There was a spotlight on anyone in it - some actors were akin to pop stars. It's calmer now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interview4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/latest/2008/06/25/eastenders-diane-parish-on-why-she-won-t-have-more-children-89520-20620081/|title= EastEnders Diane Parish on why she won't have more children|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''  | date = 2008-06-25| accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
Lola Christie auditioned as a singer for [[Mick McFarlane]]'s band. Mick was impressed with her singing talents and offered her the job. Mick was attracted to Lola, they started dating, but she was always rushing off without warning and Mick was surprised to discover that Lola had a secret young son named Carl whose father, Neil, had abandoned Lola when she was 5 months pregnant. Mick proved supportive, but Lola eventually left Mick and the band when she got her own recording contract as a soloist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicoletta &quot;Nicky&quot; di Marco''', played by [[Carly Hillman]], arrived with mother [[Rosa di Marco|Rosa]], brothers [[Beppe di Marco|Beppe]] and [[Gianni di Marco|Gianni]] and sister [[Teresa di Marco|Teresa]] in 1998.

In her first few years, she had very little to do apart from being the best friend of [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] and briefly dating [[Jamie Mitchell]], [[Asif Malik]] and [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]].

Her only major storyline came in 2000 when her mother Rosa arranged for some home [[maths]] lessons to help with her exams. Her tutor was [[Rod Morris (EastEnders)|Rod Morris]], who she fell in love with. Nicky made the first move on her tutor and he initially reciprocated, but then took things too far and [[assault|sexually assaulted]] Nicky, who then told her family what had happened, but didn't reveal she was partly to blame. This led to her overprotective brother [[Gianni di Marco|Gianni]] attacking Rod. Gianni was charged with assault but the charges were dropped when Nicky admitted that she had not told the whole truth. Nicky then admitted that she was afraid that her family wouldn't have believed that she had been molested if she had admitted she'd made the first move, when she realised her family had doubts of her innocence, she decided to leave home, and was last seen explaining that she had received the address for a [[hostel]]. The rest of the di Marco family except [[Beppe di Marco|Beppe]] left Walford soon after for a new life in [[Leicester]] in August 2000. The charges on Rod were also dropped.

'''Teresa di Marco''', played by [[Leila Birch]], was [[Rosa di Marco]]'s eldest daughter and a wild child, despite the fact she had her overprotective, big brothers [[Beppe di Marco|Beppe]] and [[Gianni di Marco|Gianni]] looking out for her.

She first appeared on-screen when [[George Palmer (EastEnders)|George Palmer]] and [[Peggy Mitchell]] attended her father's funeral in January 1998, and had recently failed her A-level exams, making her mother suspicious that she had done this on purpose, so she could stay as a waitress in the family restaurant. However, Teresa had higher aspirations than working in the family restaurant and so got her own stall on the market.

Teresa also knew how to find trouble. She was caught with drugs by the police, found out her then boyfriend [[Tony Hills]] was gay, and flings with unsuitable [[Lenny Wallace]] and [[Ricky Butcher]] (who was married) before running away with [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] who was suspected for murder. When they were finally found, Matthew was found guilty and Teresa was crushed. She campaigned to get him freed, and when he was the two were reunited, but his desire for revenge on the real murderer [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] scared her and they broke up. 

Following her sister [[Nicky di Marco|Nicky's]] accusations of assault, the di Marcos decided to leave for [[Leicester]] and, although reluctant at first, a heart to heart with brother Beppe made Teresa realise she needed a new start and joined Rosa, Gianni and Nicky heading out of [[Walford]].

'''Joe di Marco''' is a [[fictional character]] that appeared in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by Jake Kyprianou between 1998 and 2002. Joe's most notable storyline was being &quot;the focus of a tug-of-love&quot; between his mother and father.&lt;ref name=&quot;rise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=15430111&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=94762&amp;headline=getting-axed-by-eastenders-hurt-so-much-i-hit-the-bottle-and-my-weight-soared-to-17st-name_page.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: FALL AND RISE OF CELEB WRESTLING'S MARC|publisher=''The Mirror'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe, along with his father [[Beppe di Marco]], was axed by the [[executive producer]] of ''EastEnders'', [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1815554.stm|title=EastEnder Beppe moving on|publisher=''BBC'' |accessdate=2007-10-21 | date=12 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian di Marco family were introduced early in 1998 by executive producer [[Jane Harris (director)|Jane Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LDXI609H|title=EASTENDERS: 29 January 1998|publisher=''BBC programme catalogue'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The di Marcos were a family of eight, consisting of grandparents [[Bruno di Marco|Bruno]] and [[Luisa di Marco|Luisa]], their daughter-in-law [[Rosa di Marco|Rosa]], her children [[Beppe di Marco|Beppe]], [[Gianni di Marco|Gianni]], [[Teresa di Marco|Teresa]] and [[Nicky di Marco|Nicky]], and Beppe's young son Joe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980118/ai_n9702545|title=Priest in 'stop the suicides' plea over EastEnder Nadia's husband|publisher=''Sunday Mirror'' |accessdate=2007-10-21 | first=Tracy | last=Schaverien | date=18 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were heralded as the &quot;family that would rival the [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Mitchells]]&quot;âwho are one of the most successful and long-running families to have been featured in ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name=&quot;farewell&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2003/2/9/104439.html|title=Farewell my luvvies|publisher=''The Northern Echo'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The di Marcos &quot;landed with an almighty thud in January [1998], turning out in force for the funeral of patriarch Giuseppe&quot;, Joe's grandfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;20years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-52165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the family moved to the area in which the soap is set, [[Walford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60606437.html|title=ALBERTO SQUARE|publisher=''Daily Record'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe was featured in various storylines that focused on his relationship with his father, Beppe ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]), and Beppe's struggles as a single parent. &quot;There was a flurry of interest&quot; in 2000, when Joe's estranged mother [[Sandra di Marco|Sandra]] ([[Clare Wilkie]]) was introduced into the serial. She vowed to take Beppe to court for custody of Joe, but after a lengthy battle, and a tug-of-love that led to Joe getting injured, this did not occur. In the storyline, Joe remained with his father after Beppe agreed to give Sandra visitation rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4056298-103689,00.html|title=Easy come, easy go|publisher=''The Guardian'' |accessdate=2007-10-21 | location=London | date=29 August 2000 | first=Matthew | last=Baylis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the di Marcos stayed in ''EastEnders'' until 2000, when a new executive producer, [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]], decided to cull them all, except Joe, Beppe and his estranged wife Sandra (though she was also written out early in 2001 when the custody battle storyline ended).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60828485.html|title=EASTEND OF THE ROAD FOR STARS|publisher=''Daily Record'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.northernmedia.org/?mod=news&amp;pageid=38&amp;id=46|title=BBC 'supremo' John Yorke hits the Sage|publisher=northernmedia.org|accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The di Marcos were reportedly &quot;slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;farewell&quot;/&gt; However, a spokesperson at the time commented: &quot;These changesâ¦are just part of [John Yorke's] plans to revamp the series and give it a new look.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/664219.stm|title=Axe falls on five EastEnders

This was due to Beppe's actor Michael Greco, who requested to be released early from his contract because he was angry at being axed. Scripts were rapidly turned around and the characters were given a hasty exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article148309.ece|title=EastEnder Beppe out early|publisher=''The Sun'' |accessdate=2007-10-21|location=London|first=Emily|last=Smith|date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boy who played Joe, Jake Kyprianou, reportedly gave up acting after leaving the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;rise&quot;/&gt; The di Marcos are now deemed as something of a failure for ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;/&gt;

===Storylines===
Joe di Marco was the son of [[Beppe di Marco|Beppe]] and [[Sandra di Marco]]. Sandra abandoned Joe when he was young due to Beppe's interfering family. Joe was raised by his father, his grandmother [[Rosa di Marco|Rosa]] and his great grandmother [[#Luisa di Marco|Luisa]].

Sandra came back into Joe's life in 2000. He bonded with his mother, and despite initial hostilities Beppe also welcomed Sandra back into his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20000326/ai_n14500822|title=WasSandra savaged by that badger called Rosa?|publisher=''Sunday Mirror'' |accessdate=2007-10-21 | date=26 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it transpired that Sandra was only using Beppe to get access to Joe and she later reconciled with her former lover, Jack Robins. She and Jack planned to abscond with Joe, however Beppe caught her in the act. Beppe and Sandra were then involved in a custody battle for Joe. The constant rowing had a negative effect on Joe and he found it difficult to choose between his warring parents. This culminated in him getting hit by a car when he disobeyed his father and ran across the road to be with his mother. Joe was not seriously hurt, but the accident made his parents rethink their behaviour. Beppe eventually allowed Sandra visitation rights and Joe remained with his father.

Beppe's serial womanising had a negative effect on Joe in 2001 when he walked in on his father being seduced by his teacher, [[List of EastEnders characters (2001)#Kay Bradshaw|Kay Bradshaw]]. Joe was so unsettled that he refused to go to school the following day. In 2002, Joe left with his father to live in [[Leicester]] following Rosa's death.

'''Kim McFarlane''', played by [[Krystle Williams]], first arrived in [[Albert Square]] in August 1998 along with her guardian [[Josie McFarlane]]. Both had supposedly come over from [[Jamaica]] to visit Josie's son, [[Mick McFarlane|Mick]], however it soon became clear that the purpose for their visit was not as innocent as Josie initially made out. Mick was expecting his mother, but was surprised when she turned up with Kim, who he had never met or heard of before. Josie claimed that Kim was a distant relative, who she was looking after for a while. However, it was subsequently revealed that instead of being a distant relative, Kim was actually Mick's sister. Kim was the product of an [[affair]] Mick's father had when he was temporarily estranged from Josie. Her mother had died when she was eight and Josie - who had lost her husband by then too - adopted Kim, rather than see her taken into care. Mick was shocked at this revelation, but he was a pretty easy going guy, so he soon accepted Kim as his new little sister, although he found Kim's tagging around after him a little irksome at first.

Kim attended Walford High School and soon became friendly with local girls [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] and [[Nicky di Marco]], although she was a bit younger than them, so she would often get excluded from their more mature conversations. Later on in her time in Walford, Kim attended a [[Model (person)|modelling]] audition with Nicky to give her moral support. However, it was Kim who was successful and not Nicky. Ambitious Josie was delighted and set about trying to get Kim to attend as many auditions as possible. However, Kim was rejected at a casting for not being slim enough and so she started cutting out food, developing an [[eating disorder]] that threatened to spiral dangerously out of control. It took the combined efforts of Mick and Dr [[Fred Fonseca]] to get Kim back on the road to recovery.

In 2000, Josie was deported back to Jamaica for forgetting to renew her [[Visa (document)|visa]] and Kim remained living in Walford with her brother. Kim appeared infrequently after this, occasionally showing up to visit Sonia and she also got a part-time job washing cars for [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]]. 

Kim was also very upset when Sonia decided to give up her newborn daughter, [[Chloe Jackson|Chloe]], for adoption, as Kim herself had been an adoptee.

When Mick was offered a job touring with a Killa Beatzband in 2002, he initially rejected it, due to his responsibilities towards Kim. However, Kim was adamant that he should take the job, and so he left Walford, leaving Kim in the care of another relative, aunt Winnie, who lived away from the square. (This was in contrast to press reports at the time, which stated Kim would move in with the Jackson family.) Kim then disappeared after this and her current whereabouts have never been revealed. Her last appearance was in January 2002.

'''Cindy Williams''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. She appeared in 1998 as a baby played by Ella Wortley and Cydney Parker, and returned on 14 September 2007 played by child actress [[Eva Sayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a64243/cindys-youngest-child-to-make-enders-appearance.html|title=Cindy's youngest child to make 'Enders appearance|publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]''|date=2007-07-05|accessdate=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cindy is the daughter of characters [[Cindy Beale]] and [[List of EastEnders characters (1997)#Nick Holland|Nick Holland]]. She is the half-sister of [[Steven Beale|Steven]], [[Peter Beale|Peter]] and [[Lucy Beale]].

Cindy Sr. gave birth to Cindy while in prison for trying to have her ex-husband [[Ian Beale]], father of Lucy and Peter, murdered. Cindy has never known either of her parents; Nick had cut all contact with Cindy Sr. after finding out she'd tried to have Ian killed and Cindy Sr. died after the birth due to an [[embolism]].

After her mother's death, Cindy was taken to Devon to live with her maternal grandmother and aunt, [[Bev Williams|Bev]] and [[List of EastEnders characters (1998)#Gina Williams|Gina Williams]]. Ian and Steven met Cindy when they went to Devon for Cindy Sr.'s funeral. Ian suggested naming her after her late mother as a mark of respect. Bev and Gina agreed. 

Bev initially thought she was too old to look after Cindy. Bearing in mind that Ian had accepted his stepson Steven as his own, she suggested that Cindy live with Ian and her half-siblings. Reluctant at first, Ian eventually agreed, but Gina wanted Cindy to stay with her and Bev had second thoughts about giving her up. Ian and Gina briefly fought over Cindy before Ian decided that she'd be best off living with Gina and Bev.

In 2007, Ian thought that Gina was sending messages to Lucy pretending to be Cindy Sr., so he went to visit her. Cindy was featured in this episode when Gina introduce her to Ian.
