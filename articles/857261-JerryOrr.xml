'''Industrial unrest''' is the term used to describe activities undertaken by the [[workforce]] when they protest against [[wage|pay]] or conditions of their [[employment]].

Actions may include [[strike action|strikes]], [[sit-in]]s, [[slowdown]]s or [[work-to-rule]].  Historically, [[riot]]s also took place, such as the action taken by the [[Luddite]]s during the [[Industrial Revolution]], and other [[machine]]-wrecking outbreaks.
