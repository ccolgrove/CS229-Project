The '''double-headed eagle''' is a common symbol in [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]]. It is most commonly associated with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In Byzantine heraldry, the heads represent the dual sovereignty of the Emperor (secular and religious) and/or dominance of the [[Byzantine Emperors]] over [[Byzantine Empire#Constantine I and his successors|both East and West]]. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]]'s heraldry, it represented the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|State]]. Several Eastern European nations adopted it from the Byzantines and continue to use it as their national symbol to this day, the most prominent being [[Russia]].

==Origins==
Double-headed eagles have been present in imagery for millennia. The two-headed eagle can be found in the archaeological remains&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.hd.org/_c/places-and-sights/_more2003/_more08/Turkey-Alaja-Huyuk-Hittite-temple-carving-of-two-headed-eagle-with-two-rabbits-in-its-claws-SEW.jpg.html Gallery.hd.org]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Sumerian civilization]] and through the [[Hittites|Hittite]] civilization, dating from a period that ranges from the 20th century BC to the 7th century BC. The [[Gandaberunda]] is another example of a myhthological two-headed bird, which is in common use in [[India]]

Cylindric seals discovered in [[Bogazkoy]], an old [[Hittites|Hittite]] capital in modern-day [[Turkey]], represent clearly a two-headed eagle with spread wings. The aesthetics of this symmetrical position explains in part the birth of this religious figure: It originally dates from circa [[38th century BC|3,800 BC]], and was the Sumerian symbol for the god of [[Lagash]], [[Ninurta]] son of [[Enlil]].  It can also be seen in the same region in three monumental settings: Circa [[9th century BC|1,900 BC]] during the Hittite surge from north-central Anatolia down into [[Babylonia]]; in [[AlacahÃ¶yÃ¼k]] around [[1409â1400 BC|1400 BC]] and in [[Yazilikaya]] before [[1250s BC|1250 BC]]. Here the context looks slightly different and totally religious: The eagle returns to its ancient origins as a symbol of divine power.  The two-headed eagle is seen less and less during the last [[Hittites|Hittite]] period (from the [[9th century BC]] to the [[7th century BC]]) and totally disappears after the end of the empire.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The double-headed eagle was also in use by the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]]  in the 3rd to 9th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Byzantine Empire==

[[File:Queen Theodora ring.jpg|thumb|left|Double-headed eagle on the golden ring of the Serbian [[Theodora Smilets of Bulgaria|Queen Theodora]] (1296-1322), [[National Museum of Serbia]].]]
[[File:Chrysobull of Alexius III of Trebizond.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Example of the use of the eagle on imperial vestments of [[Theodora Kantakouzene]], empress consort of emperor [[Alexios III of Trebizond]]. [[Golden Bull]] of Alexios III of Trebizond, mid-14th century.]]
[[Constantinople]] was the successor of Rome, and the Byzantines continued the use of the old imperial &quot;single-headed&quot; eagle motif. Although the roots of the transformation to double-headed are almost certainly connected with old depictions in Asia Minor, the details of its adoption are uncertain. It was, however, already in use by the 10th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The Ancients used no flags in the modern sense. The Romans used various ''signa'', such as the [[bronze]] [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]]s (adopted as the legions' symbol by [[Marius]]) and [[vexilloid]]s, and, if the emperor was present, pikes or banners with the [[Imaginifer|emperor's portrait]]. With the adoption of [[Christianity]] as state religion during the later Empire, the [[Chi-Rho]] and the cross became more and more used in military standards, such as the [[labarum]]. The Roman single-headed eagle however continued to be used as a symbol of imperial authority.

According to the most prevalent theory, the single-headed eagle was modified to double-headed by emperor [[Isaac I Komnenos]] (1057â1059) being influenced from local traditions about such a (mythical) beast (the ''haga'') in his native Paphlagonia in Asia Minor. Local legends talked about this giant eagle with two heads that could easily hold a bull in its claws; the ''haga'' was seen as a representation of power, and people would often &quot;call&quot; it for protection. Isaac Komnenos, deeply influenced by these beliefs, had already used it as a family emblem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zapheiriou, N.|title=The Greek Flag from Antiquity to present|location=Athens, Greece|year=1947|pages=21â22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Divrigi02.jpg|thumb|left|Emblem of the [[Seljuk Turks]] dynasty and the [[Great Seljuk Empire]]]]

==Use by the Seljuk Turks (c.1058â1246)==
The double-headed eagle became the standard of the [[Seljuk Turks]] with the crowning of [[TuÄrul]] (meaning &quot;Falcon&quot;) Beg at [[Mosul]] in 1058 as &quot;King of the East and the West&quot; and was much used afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Sultans of [[Seljuk Sultanate of RÃ»m|Rum]], Ala ad-Din [[Kayqubad I]] (1220â1237) and his son [[Kaykhusraw II]] (1237â1246) used the bicephalous eagle in their standards,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the motif was also found on tissues, cut stones, mural squares, and [[Koran]] holders.&lt;ref&gt;A picture can be found in Titus Burckhardt, Art of Islam, under the chapter on the Rum seljuks.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oghuz Turks|Turcomans]] who ruled in Anatolia during the 13th century, inherited it from the Seljuk Turks. Islamic coins from the reign of Khalif Nasreddin Mahmoud bin Mohammad, following Turkish influence, sporting a double-headed eagle on one side and the [[Star of David]] on the other as early as year 1200.

Today, [[Law enforcement in Turkey|Turkish police]] have a double-headed eagle in its insignia as a secondary charge, in addition to the AtatÃ¼rk University in Erzurum, municipality of [[DiyarbakÄ±r]] and two football clubs of Turkey, Erzurumspor and Konyaspor using it as their coat of arms.

==Holy Roman Empire (c.1250â1806)==

[[File:Aigle bicephale poignee bibliotheque cabinets interieurs Reine Versailles.jpg|thumb|Double-headed eagle, reminiscent of the [[House of Habsburg|House of Austria]], in the ''[[petit appartement de la reine]]'' in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].]]
The first mention of a double-headed eagle in the West dates from 1250, in a roll of arms of Matthew of Paris for Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Usually depicted black on a gold background, it replaced the earlier single-headed eagle, and was subsequently adopted in the coats of arms of many German cities and aristocratic families. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the double-headed eagle was retained by the [[Austrian Empire]], and served also as the coat of arms of the [[German Confederation]].

==Use by other countries==

From Byzantium, two-headed eagles spread to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] after [[Ivan III]]'s second marriage to [[Sophia Palaiologina|Zoe Palaiologina]] (a niece of the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Illustrated book of Flags|author=Alfred Znamierowski|publisher=Southwater - Annes Publishing Ltd|year=2003|location=London|isbn=1-84215-881-3|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Montferrat]], where a [[Rulers of Montferrat#Palaeologi dynasty|cadet branch of the Palaeologi]] ruled. It remains also an important motif in the heraldry of the imperial families of Russia (the House of [[Romanov]]) and [[Austria-Hungary]] (the House of [[Habsburg]]), as well as the royal family of Montenegro (the [[House of Petrovic]]).

It was the [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in the Coat of Arms of the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Tsar]] [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] (reigned 1331â1371).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[NemanjiÄ]] dynasty adopted a white version as their own to signify their own independence of, and indeed, claim to the imperial throne of Constantinople. The white eagle was retained by most Serbian medieval dynasties, as well as the [[KaraÄorÄeviÄ]], [[ObrenoviÄ]] and [[PetroviÄ-NjegoÅ¡]] houses and remains to this day in use in the coat-of-arms of the countries of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. George Kastrioti ([[Skanderbeg]]) adopted a similar flag in his struggle against the [[Ottomans]], consisting of a black eagle on red background, which has been resurrected in the current [[Flag of Albania]]. During the next centuries, the eagle was made to hold a sword and/or a [[scepter]] and an [[Globus cruciger|orb with a cross]], symbols of the aforementioned double sovereignty.

Its usage also survived as a decorative element in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]], which was the inheritor of the Byzantine legacy during the [[Ottoman Empire]], while it remained a popular symbol among Greeks and is still in use in Church flags. In modern Greece it is used officially by the [[Hellenic Army]] (Coat of Arms of [[Hellenic Army General Staff]]). It was also used as a charge on the Greek coat of arms for a brief period in 1925â1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kokkonis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek flags, arms and insignia (ÎÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ­Ï Î£Î·Î¼Î±Î¯ÎµÏ, Î£Î®Î¼Î±ÏÎ±-ÎÎ¼Î²Î»Î®Î¼Î±ÏÎ±)|language=greek|author=Eleni Kokkonis-Lambropoulos &amp; Katerina Korres-Zografos|year=1997|publisher=E.

==Use in Masonry==
[[File:Morals and Dogma eagle.jpg|thumb|right|The Double-Headed Eagle of [[Lagash]] on the cover of [[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry|Morals and Dogma]]]]

The ''Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash'' [there's no double-headed eagle at Lagash] is used as an emblem by the [[Scottish Rite]] of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scottishritemasons-can.org/eagle.htm Scottishritemasons-can.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many meanings attached to this symbol. It has been introduced in France in the early 1760s as the emblem of the Kadosh degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Double-Headed Eagle: iconographic sources of the masonic symbol |url=http://pierre.mollier.perso.sfr.fr/articles/PM-12-Double-Headed-Eagle.pdf |author=Pierre Mollier |authorlink=Pierre Mollier |journal=The Chain of Union |issue= Special issue No.3 |year=2004 |pages=5â15|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in fiction==
* In the world of ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'', the double-headed eagle forms the crest of the [[Imperium of Man]], earning it considerable religious and cultural significance. For this reason, it is not too uncommon to create actual double-headed eagles through surgery, mechanical proxy or genetic manipulation. When these are used to aid the abilities of a [[psyker]], they are known as psyber-eagles. The [[Emperor of Mankind]] is known to be from central [[Anatolia]], so it may be a reference to his geographic origins.
* In [[Namco]]'s game, ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]'', Aska, a golden, twin-headed bird who is one of the two Summon Spirits of Light is thought to have been inspired by the two-headed eagle. In ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', the double-headed eagle appears in many flags and buildings of the city of [[Prontera]].
* In ''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' and its sequels, the double-headed eagle is on the national flag of [[Grand Fenwick]].
* In ''[[The Nightly News]]'', a six-issue comic book mini-series by [[Jonathan Hickman]] (published by [[Image Comics]]), the Brotherhood of The Voice uses a double-headed eagle as one of their symbols.
* In the anime ''[[Beyblade]]'', Claude from [[Barthez Battalion]] has a beyblade with the bit beast Rapid Eagle which is a two-headed eagle.
* A [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]] appeared as a double-headed eagle in the film ''[[Sinbad's Seventh Voyage]]''. The same description is used in the online game ''[[AdventureQuest]]''.
* ''The Double-Headed Eagle'' has sometimes been used as the English title of Jean Cocteau's play ''[[L'Aigle Ã  deux tÃªtes]]''.
*In the fictional world of ''[[Star Trek]]'', the Romulans and their empire are heavily based on the Roman Empire. The crest of the Romulan Star Empire consist of a creature very similar to a double-headed eagle.

==Use in sports==
The double-headed eagle is the emblem of the Greek sport clubs [[Athletic Union of Constantinople|A.E.K]] (black eagle on yellow background, with open wings) and [[PAOK FC|P.A.O.K.]] (black eagle on white background, with folded wings). It is a symbol of the clubs' origins, since both clubs were founded by [[Greeks|Greek]] refugees who fled to [[Greece]] from [[Constantinople]] in 1922-23. It is also the emblem of the Turkish [[Konyaspor]] [http://www.konyaspor.org.tr/], the Dutch clubs [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC]] and [[Vitesse]], the English League Two football club [[AFC Wimbledon]] and Scottish Premier League side [[St.Johnstone F.C.]]

==Use in cults==
The double-headed eagle was part of the emblem of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]]. This cult was started by Joseph Di Mambro and [[Luc Jouret]] in 1984 in Geneva. It gained notoriety in 1994 when members of the cult committed mass suicide and murders in two villages in Switzerland, followed in 1997 by suicide/murders in Canada.
