==2003==
William &amp; Mary only played 10 games compared to the regular 11-game season due to a cancellation of the [[Maine Black Bears|Maine]] contest, which had been scheduled for September 27. The presidents of the Atlantic 10 Football Conference awarded the University of Maine a victory and the College of William &amp; Mary a no-contest as a result of the cancellation of their game. The decision of the presidents, based upon the recommendation of the league's directors of athletics, was unprecedented in Atlantic 10 Football Conference history. Factored into the decision were Maine's efforts to play the game and the understanding of the unique circumstances facing William &amp; Mary in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Isabel]]. However, the NCAA does not recognize the win in their official records.

The William &amp; Mary Tribe football team represented the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS) [[college football]] during the [[2008 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2009 season]]. William &amp; Mary competed as a member of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] (CAA) under head football coach [[Jimmye Laycock]] and played their home games at [[Zable Stadium]]. The 2008 campaign came on the heels of a 4â7 record in 2007. William &amp; Mary finished the season ranked #20 according to the final Sports Network FCS Poll.

The 2008 season was also the final one for redshirt senior cornerback and punt returner [[Derek Cox]]. Cox, an All-Conference player, would later be selected in the [[2009 NFL Draft]] by the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] with the 9th pick in the 3rd round (73rd overall), making him the second-highest player ever drafted out of William &amp; Mary ([[Darren Sharper]], 60th overall pick in the 2nd round, [[1997 NFL Draft|1997]]).
