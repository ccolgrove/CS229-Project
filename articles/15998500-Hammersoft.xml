The '''Thayer Public Library''' is a public [[library]] located in the town of [[Braintree, Massachusetts]] with 102,000 [[book]]s, 200 [[Magazine|periodical]] subscriptions, and 8,000 [[videotape|videos]], [[DVD]]s, music [[Compact Disk|CDs]], and [[audiobook]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thayerpubliclibrary.net/about.html Thayer Public Library, About the Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The library is a member of the [[Old Colony Library Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocln.org/wp-public/?page_id=24 Old Colony Library Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the library==
The library is named for [[Sylvanus Thayer|General Sylvanus Thayer]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who helped found it through a $20,000 bequest in his will. The original building was dedicated June 4, 1874, and opened to the public in September of the same year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It operated as a library until 1953, when it was replaced by a larger building across the street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thayerpubliclibrary.net/about.html About]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1874 building was occupied by the Braintree Water Department for many years, but is currently vacant. This building is included in the [[List of Registered Historic Places in Norfolk County, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/MA/Norfolk/state.html National Register of Historical Places - MASSACHUSETTS (MA), Norfolk County&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the 1953 library building was razed to and replaced by the current three-story brick [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]] building that opened in 1999.

==Antitrust lawsuit participation==
In March 2008, the Thayer Public Library was notified that it was among several libraries in [[Massachusetts]] that would share in the 2002 settlement of an [[antitrust]] case that was brought against [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[EMI Music]], [[Warner-Elektra-Atlantic|Warner Music Group]], and [[Sony Music Entertainment]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5226945/ Librarians: Free CDs too much of a good thing - U.S. news - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[antitrust]] division of [[Attorney General of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Martha Coakley]]âs office, along with the Attorneys General of thirty-nine other states. The lawsuit was settled in 2002 for $144 million, and alleged that the music distribution companies illegally inflated the price of CDs by requiring retailers to sell them at or above a set level in order to qualify for substantial advertising funding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', October 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The library is expected to receive a minimum of $300, which must be used exclusively for its music related programs or projects.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Patriot Ledger]]'', March 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
