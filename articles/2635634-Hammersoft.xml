The '''Young Guard''' ({{lang-ru|ÐÐ¾Ð»Ð¾Ð´Ð°Ñ Ð³Ð²Ð°ÑÐ´Ð¸Ñ}}, {{translit|Molodaya gvardiya}}, {{lang-uk|ÐÐ¾Ð»Ð¾Ð´Ð° Ð³Ð²Ð°ÑÐ´ÑÑ}}, {{translit|Moloda hvardiya}}) was an underground [[anti-fascist]] [[Komsomol]] organization, in the [[Nazi Germany|German]]-occupied [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] city of [[Krasnodon]] ([[Ukrainian SSR]], now [[Luhansk Oblast]] of [[Ukraine]]). They were active during the [[Great Patriotic War]] until January 1943. They carried out several acts of sabotage and protest before being betrayed to the Germans. Most members of the ''Young Guard'', about 80 people, were tortured and then executed by the Germans.

==History==
[[Image:ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½ Ð¢ÑÑÐºÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ.PNG|right|thumb|[[Ivan Turkenich]], leader of Young Guard 1943]]

The ''Young Guard'' was established soon after Krasnodon was occupied by Nazi Germany on 20 July 1942. Several youth groups amalgamated, calling themselves the ''Young Guard''. One of the first meetings of the organization was held on October 2 of the same year.

The organization was led by the local [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] underground of Krasnodon, headed by [[Philipp Lyutikov]]. Lyutikov was the former head of the parents' committee of the 4th [[secondary school]] of Krasnodon, where many members of the organization had studied. There is some controversy concerning the leadership of the ''Young Guard''. It is widely accepted that the [[commander]] was [[Ivan Turkenich]] and the [[commissar]] was [[Oleg Koshevoy]], but recent sources claim that the leaders were other members of the ''Staff of the Young Guard'', namely [[Viktor Tretyakevich]], [[Sergei Tyulenin]] and [[Ivan Zemnukhov]].

There were about 100 members of the ''Young Guard'', all young boys and girls - workers, 8th-10th form schoolboys and schoolgirls from Krasnodon and surrounding villages and settlements. Due to the secret nature of the ''Young Guard'', only people well-known to other organization members, and who took the special [[Oath of the Young Guard (Soviet resistance)|oath of faithfulness]], could become members. Most of them either belonged to the [[Komsomol]] or were accepted into [[Komsomol]] upon joining the ''Young Guard''. 15 were members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. The most active members and founders of the organization made up the ''Staff of the Young Guard'': [[Ulyana Gromova]], [[Oleg Koshevoy]], [[Vasily Levashov]], [[Lyubov Shevtsova]],  Viktor Tretyakevich, Ivan Turkenich, Sergei Tyulenin, and Ivan Zemnukhov.

===Activities===
Among the main activities of the organization were
*the release of 70 prisoners from the German [[concentration camp]] on 15 November 1942 (20 more people were released from the hospital of the camp)
*the burning of the German Labour Exchange of Krasnodon on 6 December 1942. A list of about 2,000 citizens of Krasnodon, who were intended for the deportation into Germany was burnt, thus saving them from deportation
*eight [[Flag of the Soviet Union|flags of the Soviet Union]] were hung out on highest buildings of Krasnodon on 6 and 7 November 1942 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]
*about 5,000 anti-fascist [[Leaflet (information)|leaflet]]s were issued and spread in Krasnodon during the existence of the organization
Members of the organization also destroyed motor vehicles, ammunition and enemy fuel supplies.
Jointly with the ''[[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] underground of Krasnodon'' the ''Young Guard'' prepared for an anti-fascist armed [[rebellion]], but treachery within the organization and the betrayal to the Germans stopped these preparations.

===Treachery and execution===
The Germans knew about the existence of the underground and tried to discover its membership. Finally they succeeded in this, helped by treachery within the organization. Massive arrests began on 5 January 1943 and lasted until 11 January. Just 11 members managed to evade their pursuers. All the arrested people were tortured. 71 of them, along with members of the ''Communist Party underground'' (including its head [[Philipp Lyutikov]]), many alive, were thrown into the pit of ''[[Coal mining|Coal Mine]] Number 5'' (53 meters in depth), on 15 January, 16 January, and 31 January, 1943. [[Oleg Koshevoy]],  [[Lyubov Shevtsova]], Viktor Subbotin, Dmitry Ogurtsov, Sergei Ostapenkov were shot on 9 February 1943 in the town park of the town [[Rovenki]]. Just five days later, on 14 February 1943 Krasnodon was liberated by the [[Red Army]].

==Tributes==
On 13 September 1943 five members of the ''Young Guard'': [[Ulyana Gromova]], [[Oleg Koshevoy]], [[Lyubov Shevtsova]], [[Sergei Tyulenin]] and [[Ivan Zemnukhov]] were awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] posthumously, many other members were awarded various orders and medals.

Soviet writer [[Alexander Alexandrovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeyev]] wrote the book ''Molodaya Gvardiya'' (''[[The Young Guard (novel)|The Young Guard]]''), in which he depicted the activities of the ''Young Guard''.

In Krasnodon the ''Monument to the Members of the Young Guard'' was erected in 1951-1954, the [[memorial]] complex ''Young Guard'' with the museum was built in 1970 and the [[monument]] ''Nepokoryonnye'' (''Unsubdued'' in English) was erected near the ''Coal Mine Number 5'' in 1982. The new town [[Molodogvardeysk]] in [[Luhansk Oblast]] of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] was named after the ''Young Guard'' in 1961. Many towns, settlements, streets of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] cities were also named after the organization and its members.

[[Russia]]n inter-regional public organization the ''Young Guard'' was established in [[Voronezh]] in 1999.

==Skepticism==
The official story of the group, including Fadeyev's book, has been questioned almost from the day that Krasnodon was liberated. Several researchers (both officially-sanctioned and independent) revealed ambiguities and anomalies in the versions of the story promoted by Fadeyev, the groups survivors, and the Communist Party. Some survivors and witnesses declared they were pressed to follow the official version of events until the end of Soviet era.

Several alternative versions emerged in late 1990s, the most exotic among them being the story of a Young Guard as [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Ukrainian nationalist]] (not Komsomol) organization.

The full true story of the Young Guard remains a mystery. For example, as of 2004 it is not known for certain who betrayed the ''Young Guard''. The leadership of the organization, as mentioned above, has also been called into question.

A stamp was issued in 1944 honoring the leadership of the Young Guard, and featuring [[Ulyana Gromova]], Ivan Zemnukhov, [[Oleg Koshevoy]], [[Sergei Tyulenin]], and [[Lyubov Shevtsova]], all of whom were awarded [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. The Pravda article referenced below, written in 2003, names the leadership as Koshevoy, Shevtsov, Ostapenko, Ogurtsov, and Subbotin. Only two of these names (Koshevoy and Shevstov, presumably Shevstova) correspond with the people named on the stamp.
