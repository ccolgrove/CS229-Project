&lt;!--- Main ---&gt;
'''Paint.NET''' is a proprietary freeware [[raster graphics editor]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed on the [[.NET Framework]]. Originally created by Rick Brewster as a [[Washington State University]] student project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Paint.NET - Free Software for Digital Photo Editing | url=http://www.getpaint.net | accessdate=September 30, 2009}} Bottom of the page, below ''about''.&lt;/ref&gt; Paint.NET has evolved from a simple replacement for the [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]] program, which is included with Windows, into a powerful editor with support for layers, blending, transparency, and plugins.

== Overview ==
Paint.NET is primarily programmed in the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language.  Its native image format, [[File extension|.PDN]], is a [[data compression|compressed]] representation of the application's internal [[object (computer science)|object]] format, which preserves layering and other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Paint.NET's file format, &quot;.pdn&quot; | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2005/01/18/355571.aspx |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080102165718/http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2005/01/18/355571.aspx |archivedate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding the installer, text, and graphics, Paint.NET was released under a modified version of the [[MIT License]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getpaint.net/license.html Paint.NET - Licensing and FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially released as completely [[open source software|open source]], but due to breaches of license, all resource files (such as interface text and icons) were released under a [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons license]] forbidding modification, and the installer was made closed-source.&lt;ref name=&quot;backspaceware&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.getpaint.net/2007/12/04/freeware-authors-beware-of-%E2%80%9Cbackspaceware%E2%80%9D/|title=Freeware Authors: Beware of &quot;Backspaceware&quot;|date=December 4, 2007|publisher=Paint.NET blog|accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.36 was initially released as partial open source as described above, but the sources were later removed by Brewster, citing problems with plagiarism. In version 3.5, the license was altered to reflect this, and users are now prohibited from modifying the software. As free licenses cannot be revoked, developers can still legally develop forks based on version 3.36 and earlier. Unlike most proprietary software licenses, however, the new license allows users to decompile and reverse engineer the software, provided that no modifications are made.

Brewster later stated that he hopes to release portions of the source code back into the public.

== History ==
Paint.NET originated as a computer science senior design project during spring 2004 at [[Washington State University]]. Version 1.0 consisted of 36,000 lines of code and was written in fifteen weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2004/09/03/225514.aspx  | title= Paint.NET v1.1 &quot;Beta 2&quot; Download |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221034115/http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2004/09/03/225514.aspx |archivedate = 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, version 3.35 has approximately 162,000 lines of code. The Paint.NET project continued over the summer and into the fall 2004 semester for both the version 1.1 and 2.0 releases.

Development continues with one developer who now works at Microsoft and worked on previous versions of Paint.NET while he was a student at WSU. As of May 2006 the program had been downloaded at least 2 million times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Paint.NET crosses 2 million downloads, and other news | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2006/05/08/592633.aspx  | accessdate=June 16, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080102023110/http://blogs.msdn.com/rickbrew/archive/2006/05/08/592633.aspx |archivedate = January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a rate of about 180,000 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Interview: A Look Inside Paint.NET | url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Interview_A_Look_Inside_PaintNET/1141071978 | accessdate=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Please only add significant changes/improvements. We don't want this to be a copy of the complete history. For example, don't bother adding bugfix releases or minor feature improvements/additions. --&gt;

== Plugins ==
Paint.NET supports plugins, which add image adjustments, effects, and support for additional file types. They can be programmed using any [[.NET Framework|.NET]] programming language, though they are most commonly written in [[C sharp (programming language)|C#]].&lt;ref name=&quot;plugins&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boltbait.com/pdn/codelab/ | title=CodeLab: Paint.NET Plugin Development Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are created by volunteer coders on the program's discussion board, the [http://forums.getpaint.net/ Paint.NET Forum]. Though most are simply published via the discussion board, some have been included with a later release of the program. For instance, a [[DirectDraw Surface]] file type plugin, (originally by Dean Ashton) and an Ink Sketch and Soften Portrait effect (originally by David Issel) were added to Paint.NET in version 3.10.

Hundreds of plugins have been produced;&lt;ref name=&quot;pluginindex&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/15260-plugin-index/ | title=Plugin Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as Shape3D, which renders a 2D drawing into a 3D shape. Some plugins expand on the functionality that comes with Paint.NET, such as Curves+ and Sharpen+, which extend the included tools Curves and Sharpen, respectively.

Examples of file type plugins include an Animated Cursor and Icon plugin and an Adobe Photoshop file format plugin.&lt;ref name=pluginindex/&gt; Several of these plugins are based on existing open source software, such as a [[raw image format|RAW]] plugin that uses [[dcraw]] and a PNG optimization plugin that uses [[OptiPNG]].

== Support for non-Windows operating systems ==
Paint.NET was created for Windows, and has no native support for any other system. With its previous open-source nature, however, the possibility for alternate versions was available. In May 2007, [[Miguel de Icaza]] officially started a porting project called paint-mono.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ Paint Mono]&lt;/ref&gt; This project had partially ported Paint.NET 3.0 to [[Mono (software)|Mono]], an open-source implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] on which the [[.NET Framework]] is based. This allowed Paint.NET to be run on Mono-supported platforms, such as [[Linux]]. As of December 2010, this port is no longer maintained and hasn't been updated since March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/downloads/list]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also a project called [[Pinta (software)|Pinta]] which is described as a clone of Paint.NET for Mono and GTK.
