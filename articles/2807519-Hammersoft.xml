== Overview ==
Australia's first ever Winter Olympic gold, also the first such medal won by a competitor from any Southern Hemisphere country, was won by [[Steven Bradbury]] in the 1000m [[Short track speed skating at the 2002 Winter Olympics|short track speed skating]].  Well off the pace of the medal favourites, Bradbury was positioned at the rear in the semifinal, only to see his competitors crash into each other, allowing him through to the final.  Again well off the pace in the final all four other competitors crashed out at the final corner, leaving a shocked Bradbury to take the gold medal. Bradbury was also part of the 1994 relay team that won Australia's first Winter Olympics medal.

[[Alisa Camplin]], who hadn't won a world cup event before and was so nervous she didn't eat dinner the night before the final, won the second gold, in [[freestyle skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics|aerial skiing]].  [[Jacqui Cooper]] was previously a favourite, but she injured herself before the competition.

[[Jenny Owens]] had a top 10 result finishing 9th in the Combined Downhill event. The second best performance by any Australian at an Olympic Games.
 
Australia competed in alpine skiing, figure skating, freestyle skiing, short-track speed skating and snowboarding. This was the fewest sports Australia had competed in since 1984. No Australian [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]] competed in the Olympics for the first time since 1976, and no bobsleigh sliders competed for the first time since Australia's debut in [[1988]]. Australian bobsleigh slider Will Alstergren said &quot;We also beat half the teams currently in Salt Lake City, but unfortunately we couldn't meet the very high standard of the AOC, the Australian Olympic Committee&quot;. Australian selection standards has also been listed as a factor for Australia not competing in cross-country skiing at Salt Lake City.

During the 2002 Winter Olympics, the Australian broadcaster, the [[Seven Network]], included in its coverage an irreverent talk show called [[The Dream with Roy and HG#The Ice Dream|The Ice Dream]], which interviewed several celebrities and promoted the [[Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid]]. Steven Bradbury and Alisa Camplin's triumphs were celebrated by [[Australia post]] issuing stamps of them, which followed on from them issuing stamps of Australian gold medallists at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]]. They were produced by high-speed offset stamp-printing, unlike the digitally produced 2000 stamps. Bradbury's stamp was issued on February 20, and Alisa's was issued on February 22, four days after their respective victories. Each received [[Australian dollar|A$]]20,000 for the use of their image. Steven Bradbury said âShould get me a car. I havenât had a car for a long time.â and later described having a stamp issued as &quot;a great honour&quot;. Alisa was also delighted, saying âFor us to be put in with the summer Olympians who had their stamps and the previous 39 sporting legends whoâve had their stamps is amazing.â
