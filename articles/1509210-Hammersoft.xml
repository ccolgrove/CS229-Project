'''Suzanna Hamilton''' (born 1960{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} in [[London]]) is an [[English people|English]] [[actress]]. She is most famous for her performance as [[Julia (1984)|Julia]] in the [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (film)|modern film adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s classic novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

==Career==
===Early career===
Suzanna Hamilton was a protÃ©gÃ©e of filmmaker, [[Claude Whatham]], who discovered her in a children's experimental theatre in [[North London]] in the early 1970s.  She starred in her first feature, ''[[Swallows and Amazons]]'', which was directed by Whatham and based on the popular  children's book of the same name by [[Arthur Ransome]].  ''Swallows and Amazons'' was filmed in 1973 and released to the public the following year.  Billed as Zanna Hamilton, the young actress was cast in the role of Susan Walker, one of four young siblings collectively known as &quot;the Swallows&quot;, who go on a camping and sailing holiday in the [[Lake District]] during the summer of 1929.  Whatham later directed the teenage Suzanna Hamilton as [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Princess Alexandra]] in the [[BBC]] miniseries, ''[[Disraeli (movie)|Disraeli]]'' (1978), which was later broadcast to North American audiences as a featured program on ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' in 1980.

It was during this time in the mid-1970s that Suzanna Hamilton received her acting training at the [[Anna Scher Theatre|Anna Scher Theatre School]] in [[Islington]] and at the famous [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] in [[Swiss Cottage]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]].

For her first appearance in a big-budget motion picture, Hamilton played Izz Huett, the lovesick dairymaid, in [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1979 film, ''[[Tess (film)|Tess]]'' (based on [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]''), which starred [[Nastassja Kinski]] in the title role.  She also appeared as one of the [[boarding school]] girls who organize a strike against the Ministry of Education in ''The Wildcats of St. Trinian's'' (1980) .

Her next significant role was in Richard Loncraine's 1982 film, ''[[Brimstone and Treacle|Brimstone &amp; Treacle]]'', based on [[Dennis Potter]]'s play of the same name. In this film, Hamilton starred as Patricia Bates, the traumatized, catatonic daughter of a devoutly religious, middle-aged [[Home Counties]] couple ([[Denholm Elliott]] and [[Joan Plowright]]) whose lives are changed by a demonic drifter and con man who calls himself Martin Taylor, played by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]].  The following year, Suzanna Hamilton was featured in [[BBC-TV]]'s [[paranormal]] mystery, ''A Pattern of Roses'', with a young [[Helena Bonham Carter]].

===''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1984)===
Hamilton was cast as [[Julia (1984)|Julia]] opposite [[John Hurt]] as [[Winston Smith]] in [[Michael Radford]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (film)|film]] of George Orwell's [[dystopian]] novel.  She had been chosen for the role in 1983 after being referred by the casting agency of the Anna Scher Theatre School.  She was one of the school's earliest [[alumni]], and the theatre is acknowledged in the film's closing credits.

Her performance garnered critical praise, particularly from [[Vincent Canby]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''. However, her work was largely overshadowed by the death of fellow cast member [[Richard Burton]], who delivered his final screen performance in the role of [[O'Brien (book character)|O'Brien]], as well as the much-publicized post-release controversy over the film's [[film score|musical score]].

===Television and film appearances===
1985 proved to be a very active year for Suzanna Hamilton. She starred in British playwright [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]'s film, ''[[Wetherby (film)|Wetherby]]'', opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].  In this film, Hamilton's character, Karen Creasy, is the sullen former friend of a young man who committed suicide.

Her next role was as the equestrienne, Felicity, in [[Sydney Pollack]]'s [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', based on the memoirs of the famed [[Denmark|Danish]] writer, [[Isak Dinesen]], and starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Robert Redford]] and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]].

In the 1986 German film, ''Devil's Paradise'', which was shot in [[Thailand]] and loosely based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1915 novel, ''[[Victory (novel)|Victory]]'', Hamilton was cast as a saxophonist in an all-woman band touring seedy hotels and nightclubs in [[southeast Asia]].  Her character, Julie, escapes a life of sexual slavery by fleeing with an eccentric German adventurer, played by [[JÃ¼rgen Prochnow]], and the two of them take refuge on an island near [[Indonesia]], which is already populated by a savage native warrior tribe.

In 1988 she starred opposite the British classical and horror actor [[Jon Finch]] in another low-budget [[Germany|German]] film, a short called ''The Voice'', about six individuals who are held captive overnight on a floating [[discothÃ¨que]].

By the end of the decade, the majority of her screen roles were in obscure European films made in exotic locations as well as numerous British television dramas.

In 1986, Suzanna Hamilton starred in the well-received television drama ''Johnny Bull'', a movie developed at the National Playwrights Conference of the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre]] Center and filmed in [[Tennessee]].  In this film, a period piece set in the mid-1940s just after [[VE day]], she was cast as Iris Kovacs, a lighthearted [[Cockney]] bride who travels to rural [[Pennsylvania]] to live with her new American [[GI (term)|G.I.]] husband ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and his working-class [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-immigrant coal-mining family; [[Colleen Dewhurst]] and [[Kathy Bates]] starred in supporting roles.

That same year, Hamilton appeared as Emily Barkstone in ''Hold the Dream'', the second of the three BBC miniseries based on [[Barbara Taylor Bradford]]'s popular &quot;Emma Harte&quot; novels about the fortunes of a retail empire and the machinations of the business Ã©lite across three generations.  In 1987, she played the spirited but careless Anglo-French [[Special Operations Executive]] spy, Matty Firman, in ''[[Wish Me Luck]]'' â an LWT miniseries, this one set in occupied [[France]] during [[World War II]].

She made a striking appearance as the inscrutable [[femme fatale]], Anna Raven, in the 1989 BBC miniseries of ''Never Come Back'', a [[film noir|noirish]] conspiracy thriller based on the celebrated 1941 novel by John Mair, which takes place on the eve of the [[London Blitz]] during the so-called &quot;[[Phony War]]&quot; of 1939â40. Hamilton also acted in the 1990 British television film, ''Small Zones'', as a strong-willed [[Russia]]n [[poetess]] whose subversive writings have led to her indefinite imprisonment in a [[Soviet]] holding cell.

In 1991, she appeared as Amelia, one of the five daughters placed under house arrest by their domineering mother, in the BBC adaptation of Spanish poet [[Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca]]'s play ''[[La casa de Bernarda Alba|The House of Bernarda Alba]]''; [[Glenda Jackson]] starred in the title role.  She also had a supporting role in a 1992 TV film of [[Barbara Cartland]]'s [[English Regency|Regency]]-period bodice-ripper, ''[[Duel of Hearts]]''.

Her next commercial film role came with 1992's low-budget [[Gothic horror]] romance, ''Tale of a Vampire''.  Written and directed by a 27-year-old Japanese-British film student, Shimako Sato, Hamilton made a dual appearance: first as Anne, a librarian in present-day London grieving the untimely death of her boyfriend; then as Anne's nineteenth-century ''[[doppelgÃ¤nger]]'', Virginia Clemm, the real-life wife of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]âwho, in the film, also happens to be the long-lost mistress of a lonely, centuries-old [[vampire]] played by [[Julian Sands]].

In 1993, she had a recurring role as Dr. Karen Goodliffe on the British TV hospital drama series, ''[[Casualty (television)|Casualty]]''. In 1995, she appeared as [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]]'s love interest, Joanna Sparks, on the BBC-TV crime series, ''[[McCallum]]''.

Her last feature film of note was 1997's ''The Island on Bird Street'', a Danish period drama made in the [[Dogme 95]] style, about an 11-year-old Jewish boy who hides from the Nazis in occupied [[Poland]] during World War II before he is reunited with his father.  In this film, Hamilton had a brief cameo as the mother of a girl whom the boy befriends.  Most recently, she appeared as Vivienne in the 2005 short film, ''Benjamin's Struggle'', described as &quot;a compelling story set in 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]], about a nine-year-old Jewish boy who attempts to steal the original manuscript of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', believing that it will topple the [[Third Reich]] and end the suffering of his family&quot;.

In 2006, she appeared as Helen Gillespie in the [[ITV]] series, ''[[Jane Hall (TV series)|Jane Hall]]''.  As of late, she has been cast as Dr. Hillary Slayton in the children's television series, ''[[Dinosapien]]'', which is filmed on location in southern [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], and was first broadcast in 2007.

===Theatre===
Suzanna Hamilton is also an accomplished theatre and radio actress. She made her first [[West End theatre|West End]] appearance on the London stage in 1982 as part of the original cast production of [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play, ''[[The Real Thing (play)|The Real Thing]]''. In 1993, she played the lead as a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] maid who gets in over her head in the [[Bush Theatre]] production of Lucinda Coxon's ''Waiting at the Water's Edge''; in 2002, she was cast as [[Creusa]] in a Gate Theatre production of [[Euripides]]' ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]''; and in early 2005, she appeared as Dora, a woman incarcerated in a 1920s asylum in the [[Salisbury]] Playhouse production of Charlotte Jones' chamber drama, ''[[Airswimming]]''.  She also lent her voice to a 1991 [[audiobook]] recording of [[Julian Barnes]]' novel about a love triangle called ''Talking It Over'', playing the role of Gillian.
