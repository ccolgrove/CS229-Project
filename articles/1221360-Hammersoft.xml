==History==
===Foundation (Light and Power Company, ''Luz y Fuerza'') (1899â1920)===

Necaxa was founded August 21, 1923. Its early history began when Englishman '''William H. Frasser''', an [[engineer]] and owner of the Light and Power Company (''CompaÃ±ia de Luz y Fuerza '') in the state of Puebla, and in which he decided to found a [[Association football|football]] team. Frasser, as a student was a devoted football player in the United Kingdom and was a strong advocate for the sport and admired literature.  Frasser consolidates the teams of the Light and Power Company and the Street Car operators ''CompaÃ±ia de Luz y Fuerza and TranvÃ­as'' in a whole. Frasser economically supported the newly and merged team with company revenue and funds. In addition, the Light and Power Company offered steady employment to players in an era where half of the players were playing at an amateur level.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;La serie Mexico Nuevo Siglo: Rueda de la Fortuna Los Rayos&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[FederaciÃ³n Mexicana de FÃºtbol AsociaciÃ³n|the Mexican football federation]] did not allow teams to be named after private companies, the team was decided to change its name to Necaxa, after the river of the [[Necaxa River|same name]] that was in close proximity to the electrical plant.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Luz y fuerza.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Club in 1923 when they were known as '''Luz y Fuerza''']] --&gt;
Historians assert that the colors and Necaxa's crest came from following the arrival of the Cornish community in Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;^ Logan James (reprint 1976). ''The Scottish Gael Or Celtic Manners''. John Donald Publishers Ltd. pp. 249â250. ISBN 100859760219.&lt;/ref&gt; the Cornish community flourished and stayed in Central Mexico until the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Although the Cornish community in Mexico broadly returned to Cornwall, they left a cultural legacy; Cornish pasties, Cornish mining museums,a Cornish Mexican Cultural Society and of course Football, are all part of the local heritage and tradition in and around Mineral del Monte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/content/articles/2008/09/30/south_west_cornish_miners_s14_w3_feature.shtml &quot;The Cornish in Mexico&quot;], bbc.co.uk, 30 September 2008, retrieved 2009-09-07&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1923, it was also decided Necaxa team would field all players regardless of origin and race and nationality.

Necaxa organization and foundation was cemented on its history as &quot;Football as a sport which is inclusive and open to all regardless of origin, race ,social status and nationality&quot;.

In that era, the team was called &quot;Los Electricistas&quot; (''The Electricians''). The team adopted the colors red and white as their primary team colors, earning them the nickname &quot;Los roji-blancos&quot;.   Also during this period, the oldest rivalry in Mexican football began to form, between Necaxa and [[Atlante]].

On September 14, 1930, having already been a 2-time champion of the amateur [[Copa Mexico|Copa Eliminatoria]], Necaxa inaugurated its stadium named [[Parque Necaxa]], located on the banks of '''La Piedad River''' on land donated by the Frasser Family. The stadium had a maximum capacity for 15,000 fans, and was known for its memorable clock tower displaying the team's emblem.

Necaxa, in the early days of Mexican Football were members of the Mexican League Amateur Football Association '''[[Primera Fuerza|Liga Mexicana de FÃºtbol Amateur Association]]''', composed of '''[[Atlante]]''', '''[[Real Club EspaÃ±a|Club EspaÃ±a]]''', '''[[Germania FV]]''', and seasoned and disciplined team '''[[Asturias F.C.]]'''. Necaxa won championships during the 1932-33, 1934â35, 1936â37, 1937-38. seasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mexhist.html#ama&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season after the stadium's opening, iconic players such as Hilario LÃ³pez and Luis PÃ©rez contributed to the team's success, leading Necaxa all the way to the League final against [[Atlante]], losing 3-2.

But Necaxa would rebound the next season, smashing Atlante by a scandalous 9-0 score. The line-up Necaxa used on that day was the following:

===Late 1930s: Once Hermanos===

Following the aftermath and effects of the Mexican Revolution, The late 1930s represented Necaxa's most successful all Mexican team. The Once Hermanos or &quot;Eleven Brothers&quot; period was coined by many in that era due to that team's ability of working and playing as a team, great communication on the field and the ability to execute perfectly on the field during competition play. This team was composed of many talented individuals. This Necaxa team,by 1936, wins the [[Copa Mexico]] And in that same year, the emergence of a talented individual gained popularity within Necaxa's benches and competitive play.  Even though he was not one of the original &quot;once hermano&quot; or &quot;eleventh brother&quot; '''Horacio CasarÃ¬n''', was a great player in the Mexican league national ranks, Casarin great ability and qualities as a striker, propelled him to succeed and excel on the field, his success even took him to the big screen in [[Mexican Cinema]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===1940s brief hiatus===

Necaxa disappears from competitive play with in the Mexican League in 1943&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/editoriales/carlos-calderon/2009/06/el-necaxa-iii-los-gloriosos-anos-30&lt;/ref&gt; altogether due to the [[Professionalism|professionalization]] of Mexican Football. As new ownership and new heirs of the team attempt to take the team in a new direction, stating its famous phrase '''&quot;the competitive spirit of Club Necaxa is not reasonable with the Commercialization of Football&quot;'''. it would be half a decade were the Necaxa emblem and uniform would be represented on the field again.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===1950-60s resurgence===
Seven years later, Club Necaxa returns to competitive play under the conditions of the commercialization of the Mexican league. Under the new ownership of the '''Union of Electricians''' and '''Juan Jose Rivas Rojas''', Club Necaxa plays their first game on September 25, 1950 in the old district of '''Oblatos''', in a stadium called '''Parque Oblatos''' or &quot;Oblatos Stadium&quot; otherwise called the Municipal Stadium of '''Felipe Martinez Sandoval''' in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]]. This park inaugurated Necaxa's comeback to the Football which would lodge them in the heart of [[Guadalajara]], counting on great facilities for the time which became the great grand stage of [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]].''' Necaxa''' won many supporters in [[Jalisco]] at this time. In the fifties, Necaxa were tenants and played in the Federal District of Mexico City in present day [[Estadio Azul]] (1950â1955).

In the late sixties, Necaxa, becomes a handful of new tenants, plays football in Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. A modern illumination system in Estadio Azetca was inaugurated on June 5, 1966 with the first night game between Valencia C.F. and Necaxa. The first goal of the game was scored by Honduran JosÃ© Cardona. In this game Roberto MartÃ­nez o CaÃ±a Brava scored the first goal made by a Mexican. Estadio Azteca was the largest stadium in Latin America, and the fifth largest stadium in the world. The stadium is the first stadium to host two FIFA World Cup finals, in 1970 and 1986. It is also the home of the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; semi-final match between Italy and Germany at the 1970 FIFA World Cup. The Azteca stadium has also hosted the Summer Olympics, the Panamerican Games. It is also renownedly known throughout North America and South America as the home [[Home]] stadium for the Mexico national football team. 

Throughout the 1950s Necaxa struggled financially to keep afloat
In 1955, large debts obligate Necaxa to sell the majority of its star players. '''Miguel Ramierz Vazquez''' a new owner, contracts the services of the [[Uruguay]]an coach '''Donald Ross''', who eventually took [[Guadalajara]] to a championship 1957, begins a road to stability, yet, not winning championships.

The electricians won the Title cup in 1960 and the following year, in the University Olympic stadium in Brazil, &quot;the electricians&quot; defeated Rey Pele and the talented club and team of the Santos of Brazil in a official match.  This was an impressive feat in that era, &quot;Morocho&quot; Dante Juarez assisted in two victorious goals in Necaxa's win over the Santos de Brazil.

Through the early '60s, Necaxa struggles financially until it is sold and  new ownership,'''Julio OrvaÃ±anos''' purchases the team and brings a championship in 1965&amp;ndash;1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Mexico 68 and Carlos Albert vs Necaxa===
In this decade,the organization was in deep financial trouble, the team poor attendance in Mexico City,due the population unrest and other factors to a precursor to [[Mexico 68]]. The late Sixties Club Necaxa experiences issues internally which placed the players, management and ownership in disagreement. In this  decade in the late '60s and early '70s, The organization had many internal issues.

The case of Carlos Albert begins with a small group of Veteran soccer players in the spring of 1969. Club Necaxa Veteran players petitioned the organization for better wages and argued that as a team and group, they have always responded to the team's performance. Carlos Albert was the face of the disagreement between the players and management.

Under contract, Albert was placed by Necaxa Management as transferable and was retained with half of his salary, although he asked management to be void his contract in order, to avoid loss of income and to be able to continue playing in the League with another team. Necaxa Management did not accept his request.

The courts failed in favor of Necaxa on Thursday 8 October 1971, and  Necaxa was forced to pay 77 thousand pesos to Carlos Albert by the concept of indemnification by his services from 1961. This case motivated several players to request a better treatment and rights of Mexican Soccer players. The Case of Carlos Albert and Necaxa was the first incident an organization and several players organized. Carlos Albert,who had left, set an organized a movement by a labor(Union)collective contract in Mexican Soccer.

===AtlÃ©tico EspaÃ±ol 1971 to 1982===

On September 19, 1971, Club Necaxa experiences financial trouble and becomes in debt with players and Management. Ownership, in the Federal District of Mexico City, decides to sell the club to a group of Capitalist wealthy businessmen from Spain. The ownership handles the player contracts, disputes and the franchises debt. The new Spaniard ownership successfully restructure contracts and make Club Necaxa financially solvent. The new ownership takes the organization with its already rich history to a new directive in order to attract more fans. This Necaxa plays under the name of the Spanish Athletic Bulls or &quot; Toros del [[AtlÃ©tico EspaÃ±ol]] &quot;.  The reason for the name change was due to their nationality and ideology in the world of business.
In this decade of the seventies,Club Necaxa loses many fans within Mexico city due to the Spaniard ownership decision to change its name and unsuccessful attempts in capturing a championship title. In 1975 the organization would win their first and only international title in the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]], they played the final against Transvaal of Suriname defeating them 5-1 in aggregate. In 1973-74 they would reach the final against a strong Cruz Azul. They would play a two legged tie in which the AtlÃ©tico EspaÃ±ol would win the first leg 2-1 but lose the second 3-0, becoming sub champion of the league.
Notable players who distinguished themselves in [[AtlÃ©tico EspaÃ±ol]] were,the Brazilian striker Carlos Eloir Perucci, Ricardo BrandÃ³n, Salvador Plascencia,'Sabanita' Rivera
Juan SantillÃ¡n,and of course TomÃ¡s Boy, under the direction of Miguel MarÃ­n, 'the Witch' GutiÃ©rrez,
Enrique DÃ­az and 'Chucho' Prado and the Chiliean Prieto.&lt;ref&gt;http://necaxa.blogspot.com/search/label/La%20Vieja%20Guardia&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, the Spanish ownership within the Federal District of Mexico city decides to sell the Franchise due to several internal issues.  A new group of Capitalist Mexican businessmen purchase Necaxa by 1982, then Monopoly telecommunications Giant Grupo Televisa, establish the organization's original name from 1971 and opens its training Facilities in CuautitlÃ¡n Izcalli in the state of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elsiglodedurango.com.mx/noticia/6015.necaxa-deja-cuautitlan.html&lt;/ref&gt; This ownership in Mexico City rename the Franchise Necaxa by 1982 after the Cultural and historical importance of the Franchise in Mexican Soccer. While the whole country of Mexico experiences a financial crisis called &quot; the Lost Decade &quot;  or &quot;[[La Decada Perdida]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econlink.com.ar/subdesarrollo/decada-perdida&lt;/ref&gt;  in the 80s' and early '70s, Necaxa in the '80s struggles against two relegation matches. One at the end of the 1982&amp;ndash;1983 season against [[Zacatepec]] and another by the end of the 1984&amp;ndash;1985 season against [[Club Universidad de Guadalajara|Leones U de G]].

===Necaxa (1990â2000)===
In 1988, Futbol Club Necaxa is purchased by Capitalist and monopoly Mexican telecommunications giant '''Grupo Televisa S.A C.V'''.  The now late owner, [[Emilio AzcÃ¡rraga Milmo]] (father of [[Emilio AzcÃ¡rraga Jean]]), and several associates take a new directive in the acquisition of the team. The effort of Management and coaches of football operations showed key and important personnel and financial decisions with respect to the livelihood of the Club in the First Division league or  &quot; La Primera A&quot;.

In the season of 1989 and 1990, then director of football operations [[Anibal Ruiz]] takes on the campaign and renovation of the management decisions in acquiring the services of the then now great Ecuadorian midfielder, [[Alex Aguinaga]], one of the iconic figures of the Necaxa in the 1990s and one of the most talented foreign players, who has ever set foot on Mexican soil.

Necaxa has a great season, previously in the 1980s they battled twice against the First Division's regulations rules of the Mexican League. In that Year Necaxa classified to the finals losing to the well built team of Pumas of the University of Mexico. The following season [[AnÃ­bal Ruiz]] was replaced with new coach, the Argentine ex-defender, [[Eduardo LujÃ¡n Manera]] who contracted the services of the Chilean [[Ivo Basay]], who was an instrumental part of the team in the following season. Under Manera, Necaxa didnât qualify to the finals of the championship, yet, his team did show show a talented offensive line. However, unsatisfied, managements decisions of the team's play, the acquisition of new coach [[Roberto Marcos Saporitti]], marked the beginning of the seriousness of a commitment toward competition excellence a period known to Necaxa fans as &quot;La Epoca Necaxista abajo Capitalismo &quot; or &quot;the new era of Necaxa under Capitalism&quot;.

===Necaxa in the Liga de Ascenso and FMF First Division A (2011 - present)===

In its dÃ©but season 2011, the team won the Liga de Ascenso, before joining the FMF First Division A (see jersey logo) at the start of the 2011 season. Club Necaxa had won back-to-back league championships in la Liga de Ascenso de Mexico with Trainer Omar Arelleno and the team.  Displeased with the early performance of footballer/trainerOmar Arellano performance in First Division A and the team, the Necaxa Management decides to seek a coaching change. This Necaxa management decision favored its decision and services of ESPN television Commentator/Personality/ex-football player Daniel Brailovsky.  Club Necaxa begins its roller coaster season with four losses straight with [[Daniel Brailovsky]]. Necaxa Management [[Professionalism|professional sport]] executive decisions and Necaxa's cumulation of points and performance were the highlights for its loyal fans and supporters.  

On 16 April 2011,  After a draw 1â1 of Atlante F.C., the club's first key game in 2011, Necaxa could not cumulate enough points in order evade regulation. For a second time, Club Necaxa was relegated to the Liga de Ascenso, the second tier, for the 2011&amp;ndash;2012 season.
