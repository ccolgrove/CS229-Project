==Regular season==
===Eric Dickerson===
While he considered going to the [[Los Angeles Express (football team)|Los Angeles Express]] in the [[United States Football League]], Dickerson decided to go into the [[National Football League]] at the advice of his mother because the NFL had been around longer.  He was selected second overall in the [[1983 NFL Draft]] by the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]].  An immediate pro success, he established rookie records for most rushing attempts (390), most rushing yards gained (1,808) and most touchdowns rushing (18), including another two receiving touchdowns.&lt;ref&gt;Eric's Days as a Ram, http://www.ericdickerson29.com/rams.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts earned him All-Pro, [[Pro Bowl]], Player of the Year and [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] honors.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Dickerson: Pro Football  Hall of Fame, http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?PLAYER_ID=55&lt;/ref&gt;
