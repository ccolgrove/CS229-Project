==Career==
Thomson shared her first lead in ''[[Stealing Heaven]]'' (1988) with [[Derek de Lint]] and [[Denholm Elliot]]. In its review, ''Films and filming'' said &quot;Kim Thomson's [[HÃ©loÃ¯se dâArgenteuil|HeloÃ¯se]] moves with delicate poise, a heroine worthy of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] or [[Edward Burne-Jones|Burne-Jones]], with vivacity and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Films and filming'', Issues 413-422 (Hansom Books, 1989), pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, 1989, she played [[Estella Havisham|Estella]] in a film of ''[[Great Expectations (1989 film)|Great Expectations]]'' directed by [[Kevin Connor (director)|Kevin Connor]], with [[Jean Simmons]], who had played Estella in the [[Great Expectations (1946 film)|1946 film]], as [[Miss Havisham]].&lt;ref&gt;John Glavin, ''Dickens on Screen'', p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1989 she was [[Cordelia (King Lear)|Cordelia]] on stage in ''[[King Lear]]'', directed by [[Jonathan Miller]], with the ''British Theatre Yearbook'' commenting &quot;Kim Thomson's Cordelia can rarely have been equalled; she was exquisite in beauty, tender in care, full of youthful integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Lemmon, ''British Theatre Yearbook 1990'', pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992, Thomson was the [[leading lady]] of the TV series ''[[Virtual Murder]]'', and in 1994 played another leading role in a [[costume drama]] series, ''[[The Wanderer (1994 TV series)|The Wanderer]]''. Dozens more appearances in film and on television followed, often as a [[character actor]], such as her role as a society reporter in ''[[The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement]]'' (2004).

In 1997, she took on the part of Lady Chiltern in ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'', of which the ''Theatre Record'' said &quot;Others have played this pure, cool, idealistic, demanding role with more authority and finesse, but she is simply right for it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre Record'', vol. 17, Issues 9-17 (1997), p. 975&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, she was Irina in a new [[West End theatre]] production of ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' directed by [[Peter Gill (playwright)|Peter Gill]].&lt;ref&gt;Plays international, vol. 17 (Chancery Publications Ltd., 2001), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2008 Thomson had a recurring role in ITV's detective show ''[[The Bill]]'', as [[barrister]] Naomi Woods, wife of DC Jacob Banks.

In March 2009, she became a regular cast member of the ITV1 soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', playing the role of [[Faye Lamb]]. At the end of 2009, she signed a new contract with the show. In January 2011, it was reported that she was leaving the show and would make her on-screen departure later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Kilkelly, ''[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a301055/kim-thomson-to-leave-emmerdale.html Kim Thomson to leave 'Emmerdale']'', dated 30 January 2011, at digitalspy.co.uk, accessed 3 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Thomson studied at the [[University of London]] as a mature student for a degree in politics, philosophy and history, and graduated in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref name=express/&gt; She canvassed for [[Barack Obama]] in Nevada during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential election of 2008]] and also supported [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref name=dailyrecord2010 /&gt;

In an interview with ''Inside Soap'', it was reported that she has a long-term boyfriend, but she remained private about her personal life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
