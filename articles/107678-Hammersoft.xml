'''San Gabriel''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], California, [[United States]].  It is named after the [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel]], founded by [[Junipero Serra]].  The city grew outward from the mission and in 1852 became the original  township of [[Los Angeles County]].  San Gabriel was incorporated in 1913. The city's  motto is &quot;A city with a Mission&quot; and it is often called the &quot;Birthplace&quot; of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. At the 2010 census, the population was 39,718.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish to Alta California, the area that is now  San Gabriel was inhabited by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] Native Americans, whom the Spanish called the ''Gabrieleno.''  The Tongva name for the San Gabriel region was ''Shevaa''.&lt;ref&gt;Munro, Pamela, et al. ''Yaara' Shiraaw'ax 'Eyooshiraaw'a. Now You're Speaking Our Language: Gabrielino/Tongva/FernandeÃ±o''. Lulu.com: 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:JarabeTapatio.jpg|frame|left|[[Folk Dance]]rs in traditional Mexican dress.]]
Today a center for culture and art, the Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel, founded by Father [[Junipero Serra]], is the fourth of twenty-one California Missions, and is known as the &quot;Pride of the California Missions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sangabrielcity.com/cityhall/documents/SanGabrielCAFR.pdf |title=City of San Gabriel, California, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, Year ended June 30, 2009 |publisher=sangabrielcity.com |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel]] served a pivotal role in the colonial Spanish society, with many of the area's first Mexican settlers being baptized at the mission, including future governor [[Pio Pico]], who was born in 1801 at the mission and baptized there the same year. He was appointed twice as California's governor twice, serving briefly in 1832 and again from 1845 through the Mexican-American War. Later in life, he was elected as a Los Angeles City councilman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi05s.htm |title=Pio Pico - Last Governor of Mexican California |publisher=laalmanac.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Pico Rivera]] was named to honor him as the last governor of California to be born in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colapublib.org/history/picorivera/faq.html#q4 |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Pico Rivera |publisher=colapublib.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853, a company of Army Engineers, who included the geologist William P. Blake, passed by the mission in search of the best route for a intercontinental railroad. Blake observed that the once great vineyards had fallen into wild disarray. Fences were in disrepair, and animals roamed freely through the property. But, the mission bells were ringing, and the church was still in use.  Blake predicted, &quot;I believe that when the adaptation of that portion of California to the culture of the grape and the manufacture of wine becomes known and appreciated, the state will become celebrated not only for its gold and grain, but (also) for its fruits and wines.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gally |first=Sid |url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_15440867?source=rss |title=Past on Parade: What was the San Gabriel Valley like in 1853? |publisher=Pasadena Star-News |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of General Law Incorporation on April 24, 1913, the city's population had grown to 1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite new |url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_15440867?source=rss |title=Past on Parade: What was the San Gabriel Valley like in 1853? |publisher=Pasadena Star-News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
[[Image:Old PE car at San Gabriel Mission circa 1905.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A [[streetcar]] of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] makes a stop at Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel ''circa'' 1905.]]
In 2008, voters approved the measure, proposition 1A for the California High Speed Rail Project from San Diego to San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;rail&quot;&gt;http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16391198&lt;/ref&gt; The project will be constructed in two segments. The [[San Francisco]] to [[Los Angeles]]/[[Anaheim]] project is scheduled to be built first, at a cost of $43 billion, with a completion date in 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;rail&quot;/&gt; The second phase of the proposed railway, from Los Angeles to stations in [[San Diego]] will not begin construction until after phase one is completed.

Conceptually, the voters were very enthusiastic about a high speed railway. The reality of the possibility that it could impact their neighborhood and their homes is being met with steadfast disapproval.

&lt;ref name=&quot;rail&quot;/&gt; No decisions will be made until environmental impact and evaluation of the various proposed routes are completed in 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;rail&quot;/&gt; Alhambra city councilwoman, Jessica Keating,
maintained  that city representatives, who had appeared to agree with the proposal, admitted they were âcaught asleep at the wheel.â&lt;ref name=&quot;SM&quot;/&gt;
