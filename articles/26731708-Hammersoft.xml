The '''''[[Resident Evil 2|Biohazard 2]] Original Soundtrack''''' was composed by Masami Ueda, Shusaku Uchiyama, and Shun Nishigaki for the video game ''Biohazard 2'', known as [[Resident Evil 2]] outside Japan. It does not contain every track written for the game however. The remaining tracks were included in the subsequent release of the Biohazard 2 Complete Track album on August 21, 1998. Track 22, ''The Underground Laboratory'', receives a new arrangement in the [[Biohazard Outbreak Soundtrack]] in the track ''Into the Unknown''.

In the US the soundtrack was published later that year by [[Viz Media|Viz Music]], and is identical in all respects to the original Japanese version apart from having the first track, 'The Beginning of Story', split into four separate tracks.&lt;ref&gt;http://vgmdb.net/album/6450&lt;/ref&gt; The European edition of the soundtrack, which was published by [[Geneon Universal Entertainment|Pioneer LDCE]], has exactly the same track listing as the Japanese version.

The '''''[[Biohazard Code: Veronica]] Complete Original Soundtrack''''' was composed by Takeshi Miura, [[Hijiri Anze]] and Sanae Kasahara, and was released on March 23, 2001, featuring music from the survival horror game [[Resident Evil: Code Veronica]] (known as ''Biohazard Code: Veronica'' in Japan). It contains not only the tracks from the ''Biohazard Code: Veronica Original Soundtrack'', released the previous year, but also includes music added to the [[Resident Evil Code: Veronica#Code: Veronica X|Code: Veronica X]] version, as well as a few bonus tracks.

The soundtrack was released on August 14, 2001 in the US as the '''''Resident Evil Code Veronica X Official Soundtrack''''' and was published by [[Tokyopop Soundtrax]]. The US version is much shorter than the original Japanese release at nearly half the length, and contains only one disc as opposed to the original's two.&lt;ref&gt;http://vgmdb.net/album/2166&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that the soundtrack does not contain the orchestral tracks produced for the game, instead featuring &quot;Digital Versions&quot; of the tracks, done with synthesizers. The Orchestral tracks were released on a separate disc entitled '''''Biohazard 5 Selection Track''''' with the [[Xbox 360]] version of the game in Japan, and were performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony. Vocals on 'Pray -Theme Song-' were performed by [[Oulimata Niang]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/b/biohazard5promo.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Biohazard Sound Chronicle: Best Track Box''''' (2005), is a limited edition release of music from the '''Biohazard''' game series, known as '''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]''' outside Japan. It includes music from [[Resident Evil Zero]] (2002), [[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]] (2002), [[Resident Evil 2]] (1998), [[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]] (1999), [[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]] (2000), and [[Resident Evil 4]] (2005). The six-CD set includes some previously unreleased music but also lacks some tracks that are included in individual releases.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

As the first three discs are, apart from their shorter track listings, essentially the same as the original soundtracks for each game (with the exception of Disc One - Biohazard 2, which contains tracks from both the ''Biohazard 2 Original Soundtrack'' and the ''Biohazard 2 Complete Soundtrack''), please see their respective above entries for composers and other information. Disc Four contains music from the [[Gamecube]] remake of the original Resident Evil, and was composed by Shusaku Uchiyama, [[Misao Senbongi]] and [[Makoto Tomozawa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/b/biohazardbox.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Disc Five contains music from Resident Evil 0, and was composed by [[Ichiro Kohmoto]], [[Riyou Kinugasa]], [[Ryoue Takagi]], [[Shingo Kataoka]], [[Ayumu Murai]], [[Takashi Honda]] and [[Seiko Kobuchi]].&lt;ref&gt;http://vgmdb.net/album/1227&lt;/ref&gt; Disc Six contains music from Resident Evil 4 and, like the first three discs, is identical to the original soundtrack in all respects besides its much shorter track listing. Both Resident Evil 0 and the Gamecube remake of Resident Evil did not receive official stand-alone soundtracks.
