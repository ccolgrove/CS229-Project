Princeton's [[college basketball|basketball]] team is perhaps the best-known team within the Ivy League. It is nicknamed the &quot;perennial giant killer,&quot; a nickname that it acquired during [[Pete Carril]]'s coaching career from 1967â1996. Its most notable upset was the 1996 defeat of defending NCAA champion [[UCLA]] in the tournament's opening round, Carril's final collegiate victory. In 1989, the team almost became the only #16 seed to win, losing to Georgetown 50-49,&lt;ref&gt;John Branch, &quot;Carril is Yoda to Notion of Perpetual Motion,&quot; ''New York Times'', March 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; after leading 29â21 at the half. During that 29-year span, Pete Carril won thirteen Ivy League championships and received eleven NCAA berths and two NIT bids. Princeton placed third in the 1965 NCAA Tournament and won the NIT championship in 1975. The deliberate &quot;[[Princeton offense]]&quot; is a legacy of his coaching career. It is employed by a number of other collegiate basketball teams.

From 1992â2001, a nine-year span, the men's basketball team entered the NCAA tournament four times. Notably, the Ivy League has never had an [[at-large berths|at-large entry]] in the NCAA tournament. For the last half-century, Princeton and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] have traditionally battled for men's basketball dominance in the Ivy League; Princeton had its first losing season in 50 years of Ivy League basketball in 2005. Princeton tied the record for fewest points in a Division I game since the 3-point line started in 1986â87 when they scored 21 points in a loss against [[Monmouth University]] on December 14, 2005.

Rowing was introduced to Princeton in 1870 by a handful of undergraduates who bought two old boats with their own funds and formed an impromptu &quot;navy&quot; on the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Alexander (1978). ''A Princeton Companion''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of [[Lake Carnegie]] in 1906 enabled the sport to expand and laid the foundation for today's rowing program at Princeton. More recently, an $8 million upgrade and expansion of the existing boathouse in 2000 formed [[Shea Rowing Center]], one of the finest rowing facilities in the country.

With 150 athletes, 60 rowing shells, and 12 coaches, trainers, and boat riggers, crew is the largest varsity sport at Princeton, and one of the most successful. In recent years, from 2000 through 2010, Princeton varsity crews (both men's and women's) won a total of 14 [[Eastern Sprints]], [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association|IRA]] (national), and [[NCAA Rowing Championship|NCAA]] championships, as well as two international events at [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

The Princeton boathouse is often a summer base for U.S. national teams in training, and many Princeton rowers and coaches have gone on to compete at the World Rowing Championships and the Olympics.

{{main|Princeton Tigers football}}
The [[college football|football]] team has competed since 1869 and played in the [[1869 college football season|first game]] against [[Rutgers University]].  They have won 24 [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championships]] when the school competed in what is now known as the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/mel_smith/football_style.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Twenty-one former players have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

The first [[football]] game played between teams representing American colleges was an unfamiliar ancestor of today's [[college football]] because it was played under [[soccer]]-style London Football Association rules. The game, between Rutgers College (now [[Rutgers University]]) and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), took place on November 6, 1869 at College Field (now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium at Rutgers University) in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rutgers won by a score of six &quot;runs&quot; to Princeton's four. The [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|1869 game]] between Rutgers and Princeton is notable because it is the first documented game of any sport called &quot;football&quot; between two American colleges. It is also noteworthy because it occurred two years before a codified rugby game would be played in England. The Princeton/Rutgers game was significantly different from American rules football today but, nonetheless, it was the first inter-collegiate football contest in the United States. Another similar game took place between [[Rutgers]] and [[Columbia University]] in 1870 and a third notable game took place between [[Tufts University]] and [[Harvard University]] in 1875.  The popularity of intercollegiate competition in football would spread throughout the country shortly thereafter. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Though Princeton is no longer a part of [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]], the Tigers have the most overall national championships of any team in major college football history with 24 consensus and non-consensus national championships dating all the way back to their first one, shared with Rutgers, in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_team.php|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|title=Recognized National Championships by Team|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1901, however, they have 4 consensus national championships, which ranks as tied for 11th all time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
