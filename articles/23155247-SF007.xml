'''Full Circle Magazine''' is a free distribution [[Portable Document Format]] magazine that was launched in April 2007. The magazine is an independent publication and is not affiliated with [[Canonical Ltd.]], the sponsors of the [[Ubuntu operating system]]. It is advertising-supported and relies on volunteer writers for much of its editorial content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue25&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue25_en.pdf|title = Full Circle Magazine Issue 25 |accessdate = 2009-06-09|last = Full Circle Magazine|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan22May07&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cybernetnews.com/2007/05/22/full-circle-magazine-for-ubuntu-users/|title = Full Circle Magazine for Ubuntu Users|accessdate = 2009-06-09|last = Ryan|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canonical&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuMagazine|title = Ubuntu Magazine - Full Circle|accessdate = 2009-06-09|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication is aimed at users of the Ubuntu operating system and all its derivatives, including [[Kubuntu]], [[Xubuntu]] and [[Edubuntu]]. It focuses on product reviews, community news, how-to articles, programming and troubleshooting tips. It is available in multiple languages; the first edition was produced in English, Estonian, Romanian, Italian, Russian, Spanish, Galician, Dutch and Indonesian, but more recent issues have been available only in English, Italian, French, and Russian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan22May07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mini02Mar09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ubuntumini.com/2009/03/full-circle-magazine.html|title = Full Circle Magazine|accessdate = 2009-06-09|last = Ubuntu on the Dell Mini 9|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue0download&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://fullcirclemagazine.org/downloads/issue-0/|title = Issue 0|accessdate = 2009-06-15|last = Full Circle Magazine|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue24download&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://fullcirclemagazine.org/issue-24/|title = Issue 24|accessdate = 2009-06-15|last = Full Circle Magazine|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:FullCircleIssue0Cover.png|right|thumb|Issue 0 April 2007]]
Issue 0 of Full Circle Magazine was released in April 2007 and featured stories about Ubuntu's history, features including desktop effects and new [[Linux]] games. This first edition was 17 pages in length, in [[portrait format]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://fullcirclemagazine.org/download-manager.php?id=3|title = Full Circle Magazine Issue 0 |accessdate = 2009-06-09|last = Full Circle Magazine|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ryan22May07&quot; /&gt;

By Issue 25 the magazine had evolved to 28 pages in [[landscape format]], for easier viewing as a PDF document.&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue25&quot; /&gt;

In December 2007, the Full Circle Magazine Podcast started. After two episodes, the podcast stopped production, due to the host unable to dedicate time to the podcast. In March 2010, the podcast was re-established by Robin Catling, along with Ed Hewitt and Dave Wilkins, with an entirely new format. Each episode, the podcast covers news, round up of the latest issue of the magazine, interviews, reviews and feedback from listeners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Podcast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://fullcirclemagazine.org/category/podcast/|title = Podcast|accessdate = 7 June 2010|last = Full Circle Magazine|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;
