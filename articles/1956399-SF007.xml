'''Microsoft Internet Explorer 3''' (abbreviated as '''IE3''') is a graphical [[web browser]] released on August 13, 1996 by [[Microsoft]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and on January 8, 1997 for [[Apple Macintosh|Apple Mac OS]] (see [[Internet Explorer for Mac|IE for Mac]]). It began serious competition against [[Netscape Navigator]] in the first [[Browser war]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;/&gt; It was the first more widely used version of Internet Explorer, although it did not surpass Netscape or become the browser with the most market share. During its tenure, IE market share went from roughly 3-9% in early 1996 to 20-30% by the end of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9810/08/browser.idg/ Behind the numbers: Browser market share]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ews.uiuc.edu/bstats/months/9606-month.html UIUC stats&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/news/browser-wars-high-price-huge-rewards/128738 Browser wars: High price, huge rewards]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Usage share of web browsers]]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1997 it was superseded by Microsoft [[Internet Explorer 4]]. 

Internet Explorer 3 was the first commercial browser with [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) support.&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter20&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 20 - The CSS saga|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=23 June 2010|author=[[HÃ¥kon Wium Lie]]|coauthors=[[Bert Bos]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also introduced support for [[ActiveX]] [[ActiveX control|controls]], [[Java applet]]s, inline multimedia, and the [[Platform for Internet Content Selection]] (PICS) system for content [[metadata]]. Version 3 also came bundled with [[Internet Mail and News]], [[Microsoft NetMeeting|NetMeeting]], and an early version of the [[Windows Address Book]], and was itself included with [[Windows 95]] [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] Service Release 2. There were 16-bit and 32-bit versions depending on the OS.

IE3 was the first version developed without [[Spyglass, Inc.|Spyglass]] [[source code]], but still used Spyglass technology, so the Spyglass licensing information remained in the program's documentation. In 1996 Microsoft said of its new browser ''&quot;Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 adds many new features which are great for HTML authors and demonstrates our accelerating commitment to W3C HTML standards. &quot; ''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citycat.ru/doc/HTML/IExplorer.30/html_toc.htm MS IE3 release document archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 3 is no longer available for download from Microsoft. However, archive 16- and 32-bit versions are publicly available on the Evolt.org browser archive. These include [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win16/3.03-win31/dlful30f.exe Internet Explorer 3.03] (16-bit for Windows 3.1), [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win16/3.03-winnt351/bmnt30f.exe Internet Explorer 3.03] (16-bit for Windows NT 3.51), [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/3.0/ie_dlmin30c.exe Internet Explorer 3.0] (32-bit), [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/3.02/win95full/msie302m95.exe Internet Explorer 3.02 for Windows 95] (32-bit), and [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/3.02/winnt40full/msie302mnt.exe Internet Explorer 3.02 for Windows NT 4.0] (32-bit).

==Overview==
Internet Explorer 3.0 was released free of charge in August 1996 by bundling it with Windows 95 OSR2, another OEM release. Microsoft thus made no direct revenues on IE and was liable to pay Spyglass only the minimum quarterly fee. In 1997, Spyglass threatened Microsoft with a contractual audit, in response to which Microsoft settled for $8 million U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=16683&amp;DisplayTab=Article|title=Microsoft and Spyglass kiss and make up|date=January 22, 1997|accessdate=2007-02-25|author=Paul Thurrott|work=Windows IT Pro|publisher=Penton Media Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 3 included Internet Mail and News 1.0 and the Windows Address Book. It also brought the browser much closer to the bar that had been set by [[Netscape]], including the support of Netscape's [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]] technology ([[NPAPI]]), [[ActiveX]], [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]], and a [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] version of [[JavaScript]] named [[JScript]]. Later, [[Microsoft NetMeeting]] and [[Windows Media Player]] were integrated into the product and thus [[helper application]]s became not as necessary as they once were. CSS were also introduced with version 3 of Internet Explorer.&lt;ref name=&quot;chapter20&quot; /&gt; While IE1 and IE2 were said have &quot;paled&quot; in comparison to Netscape, IE3 &quot;delivers a crushing blow to Netscape&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/2801/internet-explorer-30.html Internet Explorer 3.0]&lt;/ref&gt; The user interface notably changes, with much larger buttons, with more intricate icons, and with a light gray design behind it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.technorhetoric.net/1.3/features/dorwick/navigate.htm IE Nav&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike later IE versions, users who upgraded to IE3 could still use the last IE by converting the previous version to a separate directory.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowsitpro.com&quot;&gt;&quot;By having IE3 rename your previous version, Microsoft gives you a fallback in case IE3 crashes. IE3 also scans for Netscape bookmarks and converts them to IE3 favorites.&quot; http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/2801/internet-explorer-30.html&lt;/ref&gt; It also could import favorites into IE3 from IE1 or 2.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The competition between Netscape and Microsoft heated up, with some saying the Internet community &quot;became polarized on the issue of which web browser had the most features.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwnetworks.com/iehistory.htm IE History]&lt;/ref&gt; Other new features included [[ActiveMovie]] multimedia API, [[HTML Layout Control]], Quick Links toolbar, VRML.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,2063942,00.htm?r=5 Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 3.0 second beta - ZDNet.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Microsoft announced on July 29, 1996 that it would develop a native version of IE for &quot;Solaris and other popular variants of UNIX&quot; to be available &quot;by the end of 1996&quot; which would have &quot;equivalent functionality as that provided in Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0&quot;, thus &quot;delivering on its commitment to provide full-featured Web browser support on all major operating system platforms&quot; as well as &quot;supporting and promoting open standards, including [[HTML]], [[ActiveX]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/jul96/crosspltpr.mspx Best-of-Breed Browsers for Multiple Platforms] - press release from Microsoft (July 29, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 1997 following a dispute which &quot;arose between Microsoft and Bristol concerning each otherâs performance of the 1996 IE Agreement&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ctd.uscourts.gov&quot;/&gt; and likely also because of contract negotiations with Bristol to access Windows source code after September 1997 failing,&lt;ref name=&quot;techlawjournal.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.techlawjournal.com/atr/80930bri.htm Microsoft Files Opposition to Bristol's Motion for Preliminary Injunction] - article from Tech Law Journal (September 30, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft reversed course and decided to directly port the Windows version in-house using the [http://www.mainsoft.com/products/mainwin.aspx MainWin] XDE (eXtended Development Environment) application from [[Mainsoft]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mainsoft.com-1998&quot;&gt;[http://www.mainsoft.com/news/press_releases/1998_3_04_01.aspx Microsoft launches Internet Explorer on Unix] - press release from Mainsoft (March 4, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; the main competitor to Bristol Technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ctd.uscourts.gov&quot;&gt;as previously&lt;/ref&gt; (Microsoft would later also use MainWin to port [[Windows Media Player]] and [[Outlook Express]] to Unix.&lt;ref name=&quot;mainsoft.com-2000&quot;&gt;[http://www.mainsoft.com/news/press_releases/2000_8_14_01.aspx Microsoft to port Internet Explorer technologies to Unix] - press release from Mainsoft (August 14, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;) Now well behind schedule, the 3.0 branch was apparently scrapped in favor of 4.0 (that was released for Windows half a year earlier), which used the new [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident rendering engine]]. A [[Internet Explorer 4]] Beta for Solaris was released by the end of 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;sunsite.uakom.sk&quot;&gt;[http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-11-1997/swol-11-ie4.html Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 for Solaris] ([http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-11-1997/images/ie-unix.gif Screenshot]) - Robert McMillan writing for SunWorld (November 5, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; leading to [[Internet Explorer for UNIX]] versions, which lasted until [[Internet Explorer 5]].

Backwards compatibility was handled by allowing Users who upgraded to IE3 to still use the last IE, because the installation converted the previous version to separate directory.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowsitpro.com&quot;/&gt;

===Security===

The Princeton Word Macro Virus Loophole was discovered on August 22, 1996, nine days after Internet Explorer 3, which could allow [[Webmaster]]s to cause user's computer to initiate downloads without their consent via a backdoor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nwnetworks.com/iehistory.htm The History of Microsoft Internet Explorer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft patched the vulnerability the next day.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; However, researchers went on to find more vulnerabilities and new types of problems, such as the ability to spoof a website (similar to the later [[phishing]] problem). These issues triggered public concern over browser security.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The Microsoft [[Authenticode]] expired on June 30, 1997, after which IE users needed to upgrade to '''Authenticode 2.0''' which required at least IE 3.02  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwnetworks.com/96-02iesecurity.htm IE Security Issues 1996â2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Authenticode is a [[Code signing]] technology.

===Internet Explorer version 3.0 for Macintosh===
{{see also|Internet Explorer for Mac}}
''Internet Explorer 3 for Macintosh'' was released on January 8, 1997 for PPC, and added support for the [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] and [[NTLM]] security protocols and the PICS and [[Recreational Software Advisory Council internet|RSACi]] rating systems that can be used to control access to websites based on content ratings. On November 5, 1996 Microsoft announced the release of a beta version for Mac of Internet Explorer version 3.0. This release added support for [[HTML]] version 3.2, CSS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531570.aspx Migrating from Internet Explorer 3.0 to Internet Explorer 4.0 and Later]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Java applet]]s and ActiveX controls. Keith Mitchell of Macworld noted in November 1996, when discussing the IE mac version, ''&quot;With the near-simultaneous release of Netscape Navigator 3.0 (415/528-2555, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.netscape.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 (206/882-8080, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.microsoft.com&lt;/nowiki&gt;), both companies are tripping over each other to entice Web users to their products.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18734836.html Macworld,  November, 1996  by Mitchell, Keith A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- original link: http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_199611/ai_hibm1G118734836 --&gt; 
A problem with an operating system extension used in the Mac OS called CFM68K Runtime Enabler, led to a delay in the release of the version 3.0 for Macs based on the 68k line of processors. Four months later on May 14, Microsoft released version 3.01 which included a version for 68k-based machines. This version also included features from the Windows version of Internet Explorer 4.0 such as [[AutoComplete]] and Monitoring Favorites that notified users when sites in their Favorites list have been updated. It also included support for JavaScript and introduced a Download Manager and a [[HTTP cookie|Cookie]] Manager. MacUser's review noted ''&quot;While Netscape Navigator 3.0 is more feature-laden and consequently bigger and slower than previous incarnations, Microsoft Internet Explorer has been refined and optimised into a Web browser that has almost as many features, but is both smaller and faster than its rival.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090116062446/http://www.macuser.co.uk/reviews/16100/microsoft-internet-explorer-30.html MacUser IE3 Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- also available here: http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/software/16100/microsoft-internet-explorer-3-0 --&gt;&lt;!-- original link: http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16100/microsoft-internet-explorer-30.html --&gt;

==Bundled and/or integrated software==
IE3 launched with a variety of integrated apps, with some added later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryIE.mspx Windows History: Internet Explorer History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''[[Internet Mail and News]]''' an [[email client|e-mail]] and [[news client]] included with IE3. It was replaced/renamed in IE4 as [[Outlook Express|Outlook Express 4.0]].
*'''[[Windows Address Book]]''' an application that has a local database and user interface that lets users keep a single list of contacts that can be shared by multiple programs. It can query [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] servers or read/write data to a local &lt;tt&gt;.wab&lt;/tt&gt; file. Later versions were no longer bundled with IE, instead with Windows until [[Windows Vista|Vista]].
*'''[[Microsoft Comic Chat]]''' is a text [[Online chat|chatting]] program that used cartoon [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s to display text and emotion. It was updated and renamed '''Microsoft Chat 2.0''' in [[Internet Explorer 4|IE4]] (not to be confused with the later [[Microsoft Chat]](WinChat program).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/broadband/reviews/671/internet-explorer-4.html PC Pro: Focus: Broadband: Product Reviews: Internet Explorer 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Real Player]]''' was a streaming media player made by Progressive Networks (later called [[RealNetworks]]). The first version of RealPlayer was introduced in April 1995 as RealAudio Player and was one of the first media players capable of [[streaming media]] over the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fpp&quot;&gt;[http://www.realnetworks.com/company/press/releases/2006/patent_cts.html Release History]&lt;/ref&gt; Versions 3.0.1 for Windows 3.11 - RealPlayer 2.1.1.10, 3.0.2 for Windows 95 - RealPlayer  2.1.1.9, and 3.0.2 for Windows NT - RealPlayer 2.1.1.9.
Later versions of Internet Explorer 3 also included:
*'''[[Microsoft NetMeeting]]''' is a [[VoIP]] and multi-point [[videoconferencing]] client that uses the [[H.323]] protocol for video and audio conferencing.
*'''[[Windows Media Player]]''' an audio and visual media player playing several formats including [[.avi]]. The browser could play [[MIDI]] files on its own.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

IE3 also included [[Microsoft Java Virtual Machine]], which continued to be included until [[Internet Explorer 5|5.5]] when due to legal battle between Sun and Microsoft, it had to be removed from the product. Microsoft stopped offering it in 2001, although it was supported for several years after this (until the end of 2007).

==Adoption capability overview==
Internet Explorer 3.0 had support for [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]], [[Windows NT 3.51]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/16682/microsoft-delivers-internet-explorer-30a-for-windows-31-and-nt-351.html Microsoft delivers Internet Explorer 3.0a for Windows 3.1 and NT 3.51&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows NT 4.0]]. Version 3.0 was included in [[Windows 95]] OSR2, but [[Windows 98]] launched with IE4. Major MS OS releases after Win 98, switched to supporting [[Internet Explorer 4]] (or higher). Internet Explorer 3 had a Beta supporting Solaris (UNIX). IE4 integration with the OS meant systems that upgraded from IE3 to 4, or came with 4, could not easily revert to IE3 (see [[Removal of Internet Explorer]]). The Mac OS version supported PPC and [[68k]] Macs, superseding IE 2.1. Microsoft released various 16- and 32-bit versions for Windows.

==Encryption==
The last patch versions of Internet Explorer 3 supported 40-bit and 128-bit encryption, using [[Server Gated Cryptography]] (SGC).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195833 KB195833&lt;/ref&gt; 256-bit encryption would not become available in IE for nearly 10 years, with the [[Windows Vista]] version [[Internet Explorer 7]]. 

128-bit encryption was available or included for these versions:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.03 for Windows NT 3.51 SP 1
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 for Macintosh

If it was not possible to upgrade to 128-bit, then 40-bit (SGC) was standard.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Versions==

&lt;code&gt; Shdocvw.dll &lt;/code&gt; version numbers plus related notes.&lt;ref&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164539/ MS Support doc&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike later versions, early IE version numbers were numerically out of sync with the .dll numbers because they were based on the Windows version numbers (due to its beginnings in the Microsoft Plus! pack, which also based on the Windows number). IE 1 started with 4.4 because Windows 95 was version 4 of MS Windows. Version go by major version.minor version.build number.sub-build number and included, 4.70.1155  -Internet Explorer 3.0, 4.70.1158   -Internet Explorer 3.0 (Windows 95 OSR2), 4.70.1215 -Internet Explorer 3.01, 4.70.1300  -Internet Explorer 3.02 and 3.02a. 3.02a was the last IE3 for Windows 3.1 and 3.01 for Mac OS, before [[Internet Explorer 4.0]].
