Emigration has resulted in immigrant communities in a number of other countries.

==History and ethnogenesis==
The Bulgarians have descended from three main tribal groups, which mixed themselves and formed a Slavic-speaking nation and ethnicity in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]: 1) the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] invaders, who gave their language to the Bulgarians; 2) the [[Bulgars]], from whom the [[ethnonym]] and the early statehood were inherited; as well as 3) certain cultural elements taken from the 'indigenous' late Roman provincial peoples ([[Thraco-Roman]]s and [[Thracians|Thraco]]-[[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine]]s).&lt;ref&gt;''The so-called Bulgar inscriptions are, with few exceptions, written in Greek rather than in Turkic runes; they mention officials with late antique titles, and use late Antique terminology and indictional dating.. contemporary Byzantine inscriptions are not obviously similar, implying that this (Bulgar) epigraphic habit was not imported from Constantinople but was a local Bulgar development, or rather, it was an indigenous 'Roman' inheritance''.

The ethnic contribution of pre-Slavic populations (so-called [[Thracians|Thracian]] and [[Daco]]-[[Getae|Getic]] peoples) was determined by some recent genetic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/326027/PaleomtDNA-analysis-and-population-genetic-aspects-of-old-Thracian-populations-from-SouthEast-of-Romania |title=Paleo-MtDNA Analysis and population genetic aspects of old Thracian population from South-Eastern Romania |publisher=Scribd.com |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient languages of the local people had gone nearly extinct before the arrival of the [[Slavs]], mostly due to [[Hellenization]] since the antiquity and to a lesser degree to [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] during Roman rule, accompanied by [[Christianisation]]. Their cultural influence was also highly reduced due to the repeated barbaric invasions on the Balkans during the early [[Middle Ages]] by [[Goths]], [[Celts]], [[Huns]] and [[Sarmatians]] and later [[slavicisation]]. However, some of their linguistic and cultural traces are nevertheless present in modern Bulgarians (and Macedonians).

The Slavs emerged from their original homeland in the early 6th century, and spread to most of the eastern Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, thus forming three main branches â the [[West Slavs]], the [[East Slavs]] and the [[South Slavs]]. The [[Slavs]] became the largest part of the ancestors of the Bulgarians. Similar to the rest of their South Slavic neighbours, the Bulgarians are clearly separated from the tight [[R1a1a]] cluster typical for Western and Eastern Slavs. However, [[Haplogroup I2 (Y-DNA)|I2a1b1]], which is typical of the [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] populations&lt;ref&gt;Pericic et al., High-Resolution Phylogenetic Analysis of Southeastern Europe Traces Major Episodes of Paternal Gene Flow Among Slavic Populations [http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/22/10/1964/FIG3]&lt;/ref&gt; is not older than 2550 years and is probably result of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] invasion from the area north-east of the [[Carpathians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Y-DNA-HAPLOGROUP-I/2010-04/1270925314 |title=Russian I2a2a-Dinaric TMRCA, 2010.04.10 by Ken Nordtwedt |publisher=Archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic origin===
According to some 20th century researchers as [[William Z. Ripley]], [[Carleton S. Coon]] and [[Bertil Lundman]] the Bulgarians are predominantly [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean people]], with unexplained [[Proto-Pontic|Pre-Pontic]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[Nordic race|Nordic]] strains, whose roots go back to the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnby.altervista.org/troe/12-15.htm Races Of Europe, (Chapter XII, section 15)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carnby.altervista.org/lundraces/lundman-races2.htm Lundman, Bertil J. â The Races and Peoples of Europe, (Chapter: The Races and Peoples of Southeast Europe), New York: IAAEE. 1977.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian [[DNA profile]] is congruent with those described for most European populations. Among the prehistoric events marked by the observed haplogroups, the ''greatest contribution'' comes from the range expansion of ''local'' [[Mesolithic]] foragers. The Bulgarian gene pool also bears signals of the recolonization from different glacial refugia and the spread of agriculture (and farmers) from the [[Near East]]. As for the interpopulation analysis of [[Y-DNA]], similarly to [[mtDNA]], Bulgarians belong to the cluster of European populations, still being slightly distant from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=006d5e3a-ea14-49ff-9b39-f0a042d39185&amp;cKey=bfc88c56-5e93-4ee2-89e6-c3ab1bd25f5c&amp;mKey=%7BDFC2C4B1-FBCD-433D-86DD-B15521A77070%7D |title=Y-Chromosome genetic variation of modern Bulgarians, S.

==Demographics==
Most Bulgarians live in [[Bulgaria]], where they are around 6 million,&lt;ref name=2011census/&gt;&lt;ref name=experts/&gt; constituting 85% of the population. There are significant Bulgarian minorities in the [[Bulgarians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bulgarians in Serbia|Serbia]] (see [[Western Outlands]]), [[Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia|Greece]], [[Bulgarians in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Bulgarians in Albania|Albania]], [[Bulgarians in Romania|Romania]] ([[Banat Bulgarians]]), as well as in [[Bulgarians in Ukraine|Ukraine]] and [[Bessarabian Bulgarians]]. Many Bulgarians also live in the diaspora, which is formed by representatives and descendants of the old (before 1989) and new (after 1989) emigration. The old emigration was made up of some 2,470,000 {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} economic and several tens of thousands of political emigrants, and was directed for the most part to the U.S., Canada, [[Argentina]], Brazil and Germany. The new emigration is estimated at some 970,000 people and can be divided into two major subcategories: permanent emigration at the beginning of the 1990s, directed mostly to the U.S., Canada, [[Austria]], and Germany and labour emigration at the end of the 1990s, directed for the most part to [[Greece]], Italy, the UK and Spain. Migrations to the West have been quite steady even in the late 1990s and early 21st century, as people continue moving to countries like the US, Canada and Australia. Most Bulgarians living in the US can be found in Chicago, Illinois. However, according to the 2000 US census most Bulgarians live in the cities of New York and Los Angeles, and the state with most Bulgarians in the US is California. Most Bulgarians living in Canada can be found in Toronto, Ontario, and the provinces with most Bulgarians in Canada are [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. The largest urban populations of Bulgarians are to be found in [[Sofia]] (1,1 million),&lt;ref name=2011census/&gt; [[Plovdiv]] (302,858) and [[Varna]] (300,000+). The total number of Bulgarians stood at over 10 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;dnevnik.bg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maritsa.com&quot;/&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Bulgarian language}}

Bulgarians speak a [[Bulgarian language|Southern Slavic language]] which is [[mutually intelligible]] with the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and with the [[Torlak dialect]]. The Bulgarian language is also, to some degree, mutually intelligible with Russian on account of the influence which Russia has had on the development of Modern Bulgaria since 1878, as well as the earlier effect of [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]] on the development of [[Old East Slavic language|Old Russian]]. Although related, Bulgarian and the Western and Eastern [[Slavic languages]] are not mutually intelligible.

Bulgarian demonstrates some linguistic developments that set it apart from other Slavic languages. These are shared with [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] (see [[Balkan linguistic union]]) with which it is not in any case mutually intelligible. Until 1878 Bulgarian was influenced lexically by medieval and modern [[Greek language|Greek]], and to a much lesser extent, by [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. More recently, the language has borrowed many words from Russian, German, French and English.

Comparatively small are the people of the diaspora who are Bulgarians by ethnic origin or descent but
do not speak the Bulgarian language (mostly representatives of the old emigration in the U.S., Canada, [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]]).

The majority of Bulgarian linguists{{Who|date=December 2009}} consider the officialized [[Macedonian language]] (since 1944) a local variation of Bulgarian, just as the most ethnographers and linguists until the early 20th century considered the local Slavic speech in the Macedonian region. The president of Bulgaria [[Zhelyu Zhelev]], declined to recognize the Macedonian as a separate language when the Republic of Macedonia became a new independent state. The Bulgarian language is written in the [[Cyrillic alphabet]].

==== Cyrillic alphabet ====
[[Image:Ocslavonic.gif|thumb|right|Cyrillic alphabet of the medieval [[Old Bulgarian]] language]]

In the first half of the 10th century, the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] was devised in the [[Preslav Literary School]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], based on the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]], the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet]]s. Modern versions of the alphabet are now used to write five more [[Slavic languages]] such as [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], Russian, [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] as well as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and some other 60 languages spoken in the former [[Soviet Union]]. [[First Bulgarian Empire|Medieval Bulgaria]] was the most important cultural centre of the [[Slavic people]]s at the end of the 9th and throughout the 10th century. The two literary schools of [[Preslav Literary School|Preslav]] and [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]] developed a rich literary and cultural activity with authors of the rank of [[Constantine of Preslav]], [[John Exarch]], [[Chernorizets Hrabar]], [[Clement of Ohrid|Clement]] and [[Naum of Ohrid]].
Bulgaria exerted similar influence on her neighbouring countries in the mid to late 14th century, at the time of the [[Tarnovo Literary School]], with the work of [[Patriarch Evtimiy]], [[Gregory Tsamblak]], [[Constantine of Kostenets]] (Konstantin Kostenechki). Bulgarian cultural influence was especially strong in [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldova]] where the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] was used until 1860, while [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] was the official language of the princely [[chancellor|chancellery]] and of the church until the end of 17th century.

====Name system====
{{Main|Bulgarian name}}

There are several different layers of Bulgarian names. The vast majority of them have either Christian (names like Lazar, [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], Anna, Maria, Ekaterina) or [[Slavs|Slavic]] origin (Vladimir, Svetoslav, Velislava). After the Liberation in 1878, the names of historical [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] rulers like [[Asparuh]], [[Krum]], [[Kubrat]] and [[Tervel]] were resurrected. The old Bulgar name [[Boris (first name)|Boris]] has spread from Bulgaria to a number of countries in the world with Russian [[Tsar]] [[Boris Godunov]], British politician [[Boris Johnson]], and German tennis player [[Boris Becker]] being three of the examples of its use.

Most Bulgarian male surnames have an ''-ov'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] ([[Cyrillic]]: ''-Ð¾Ð²''). This is sometimes [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] as ''-off'' (John Atanasovâ[[John Atanasoff]]), but more often as ''-ov'' (e.g. [[Boyko Borisov]]). The ''-ov'' suffix is the Slavic gender-[[agreement (linguistics)|agreeing]] suffix, thus ''Ivanov'' ({{lang-bg|ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²}}) literally means &quot;Ivan's&quot;. Bulgarian middle names are patronymic and use the gender-[[agreement (linguistics)|agreeing]] suffix as well, thus the middle name of Nikola's son becomes ''Nikolov'', and the middle name of Ivan's son becomes ''Ivanov''. Since names in Bulgarian are gender-based, Bulgarian women have the ''-ova'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] (Cyrillic: ''-Ð¾Ð²a''), for example, ''Maria Ivanova''. The plural form of Bulgarian names ends in ''-ovi'' (Cyrillic: ''-Ð¾Ð²Ð¸''), for example the ''Ivanovi'' family ({{lang|bg|ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸}}).

&lt;!-- too verbose... --&gt;Other common Bulgarian male surnames have the ''-ev'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] (Cyrillic: ''-ÐµÐ²''), for example ''Stoev'', ''Ganchev'', ''Peev'', and so on. The female surname in this case would have the ''-eva'' [[family name affix|surname suffix]] (Cyrillic: ''-ÐµÐ²Ð°''), for example: ''Galina Stoeva''. The last name of the entire family then would have the plural form of ''-evi'' (Cyrillic: ''-ÐµÐ²Ð¸''), for example: the ''Stoevi'' family ({{lang|bg|Ð¡ÑÐ¾ÐµÐ²Ð¸}}).

Another typical Bulgarian surname suffix, though less common, is ''-ski''. This surname ending also gets an ''âa'' when the bearer of the name is female (''Smirnenski'' becomes ''Smirnenska''). The plural form of the surname suffix ''-ski'' is still ''-ski'', e.g. the ''Smirnenski'' family ({{lang-bg|Ð¡Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ½ÐµÐ½ÑÐºÐ¸}}).

The ending ''âin'' (female ''-ina'') also appears rarely. It used to be given to the child of an unmarried woman (for example the son of ''Kuna'' will get the surname ''Kunin'' and the son of ''Gana'' â ''Ganin''). The surname suffix ''-ich'' can be found only occasional, primarily among the [[Roman Catholicism in Bulgaria|Roman Catholic Bulgarians]]. The surname ending ''âich'' does not get an additional ''âa'' if the bearer of the name is female.

===Religion===
{{main|Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Orthodox Church}}

[[Image:Bulgaria-Alexander Nevsky-01.JPG|right|thumb|[[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia]]]]

Most Bulgarians are at least nominally members of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] founded in 870 AD ([[autocephalous]] since 927 AD). The [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] is the independent national church of Bulgaria like the other national branches of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox communion]] and is considered an inseparable{{cn|date=September 2011}} element of Bulgarian national consciousness. The church was abolished once, during the period of Ottoman rule (1396â1878), in 1873 it was revived as [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] and soon after raised again to Bulgarian [[Patriarchate]]. In 2001, the Orthodox Church at least nominally had a total of 6,552,000 members in Bulgaria (82.6% of the population), 6,300,000 of which were Bulgarians, and between one and two million members in the diaspora. The Orthodox Bulgarian minorities in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], Serbia, [[Greece]], Albania, [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]] nowadays hold allegiance to the respective national Orthodox churches.

Despite the position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as a unifying symbol for all Bulgarians, small groups of Bulgarians have converted to other faiths through the course of time. In the 16th and the 17th century Roman Catholic missionaries converted a small number of Bulgarian [[Paulicians]] in the districts of [[Plovdiv]] and [[Svishtov]] to Roman Catholicism. Nowadays there are some 40,000 Roman Catholic Bulgarians in Bulgaria, additional 10,000 in the [[Banat]] in Romania and up to 100,000 people of Bulgarian ancenstry in South America. The Roman Catholic Bulgarians of the Banat are also descendants of [[Paulicians]] who fled there at the end of the 17th century after an unsuccessful uprising against the Ottomans. Protestantism was introduced in Bulgaria by missionaries from the United States in 1857. Missionary work continued throughout the second half of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Nowadays there are some 25,000 Protestant Bulgarians in Bulgaria. Between the 15th and the 19th century, during the Ottoman rule, some Orthodox Bulgarians converted to Islam. At 2001 census, 131,000 declared that are ethnic [[Muslim Bulgarians|Bulgarians with Islamic denomination]] (locally called [[Pomaks]]) in Bulgaria in the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] region, as well as few villages in the [[Teteven]] region in Central North Bulgaria, however nowadays most of the Pomaks live in Turkey where they are at least 270,000.

[[Boris Christoff]], [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Raina Kabaivanska]] and [[Ghena Dimitrova]] made a precious contribution to opera singing with Ghiaurov and Christoff being two of the greatest [[Bass (voice type)|bassos]] in the post-war period. The name of the harpist-[[Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean]] is one of the best-known harpists today.
Bulgarians have made valuable contributions to world culture in modern times as well. [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Tzvetan Todorov]] were among the most influential European philosophers in the second half of the 20th century. The artist [[Christo]] is among the most famous representatives of [[environmental art]] with projects such as the [[Wrapped Reichstag]].

Bulgarians in the diaspora have also been active. American scientists and inventors of Bulgarian descent include [[John Atanasoff]], [[Peter Petroff]], and [[Assen Jordanoff]]. Bulgarian-American [[Stephane Groueff]] wrote the celebrated book &quot;[[Manhattan Project]]&quot;, about the making of the first atomic bomb and also penned &quot;Crown of Thorns&quot;, a biography of [[Tsar]] [[Boris III of Bulgaria]].
According to MENSA International, Bulgaria ranks 2nd in the world in Mensa IQ test-scores and its students rate second in the world in [[SAT (disambiguation)|SAT]] scores.&lt;ref name=&quot;outsourcingmonitor.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web| |url=http://www.outsourcingmonitor.eu/articles/outsourcing-to-bulgaria.html |title=Bulgaria- Eastern Europe's Newest Hot Spot &amp;#124; Offshoring Business Intelligence &amp; Tools &amp;#124; EU Out-Sourcing Specialists Platform &amp;#124; German Market-Entry offshoring Vendor Services |publisher=Outsourcingmonitor.eu |date=6 August 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambsofia.um.dk/da/menu/Eksportraadgivning/Markedsmuligheder/Sektoranalyser/Outsourcing/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous for its rich salads required at every meal, Bulgarian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of [[dairy product]]s and the variety of [[Bulgarian wine|local wines]] and alcoholic beverages such as [[rakia]], [[mastika]] and [[menta]]. Bulgarian cuisine features also a variety of hot and cold soups, an example of a cold soup being [[tarator]]. There are many different Bulgarian pastries as well such as [[banitsa]].

Most Bulgarian dishes are oven baked, steamed, or in the form of stew. Deep-frying is not very typical, but grilling â especially different kinds of meats â is very common. Pork meat is the most common meat in the Bulgarian cuisine. Oriental dishes do exist in Bulgarian cuisine with most common being moussaka, gyuvetch, and baklava. A very popular ingredient in Bulgarian cuisine is the Bulgarian white brine cheese called &quot;sirene&quot; (ÑÐ¸ÑÐµÐ½Ðµ). It is the main ingredient in many salads, as well as in a variety of pastries. Fish and chicken are widely eaten and while beef is less common as most cattle are bred for milk production rather than meat, [[veal]] is a natural byproduct of this process and it is found in many popular recipes. Bulgaria is a net exporter of lamb and its own consumption of the meat is prevalent during its production time in spring.&lt;ref&gt;(April 2006).

=== Customs ===
{{main|Bulgarian customs}}

Bulgarians may wear the [[martenitsa]] (Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐµÐ½Ð¸ÑÐ°) â an adornment made of white and red yarn and worn on the wrist or pinned on the clothes â from 1 March until the end of the month. Alternatively, one can take off the martenitsa earlier if one sees a stork (considered a harbinger of spring). One can then tie the martenitsa to the blossoming branch of a tree. Family-members and friends in Bulgaria customarily exchange martenitsas, which they regard as symbols of health and longevity. The white thread represents peace and tranquility, while the red one stands for the cycles of life. Bulgarians may also refer to the holiday of 1 March as [[Baba Marta]] (ÐÐ°Ð±Ð° ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ°), meaning ''Grandmother March''. It preserves an ancient pagan tradition. Many legends exist regarding the birth of this custom, some of them dating back to the 7th-century times of [[Kubrat|Khan Kubrat]], the ruler of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. Other tales relate the martenitsa to Thracian and Zoroastrian beliefs.

The ancient ritual of [[kukeri]] (ÐºÑÐºÐµÑÐ¸), performed by costumed men, seeks to scare away evil spirits and bring good harvest and health to the community. The costumes, made of animal furs and fleeces, cover the whole of the body. A mask, adorned with horns and decoration, covers the head of each ''kuker'', who also must have bells attached to his waist. The ritual consists of dancing, jumping and shouting in an attempt to banish all evil from the village. Some of the performers impersonate royalty, field-workers and craftsmen. The adornments on the costumes vary from one region to another.

Another characteristic custom called [[nestinarstvo]] (Ð½ÐµÑÑÐ¸Ð½Ð°ÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾), or ''firedancing'', distinguishes the [[Strandzha]] region. This ancient custom involves dancing into fire or over live embers. Women dance into the fire with their bare feet without suffering any injury or pain.

=== Sport ===
{{main|Sport in Bulgaria|Football in Bulgaria}}

As for most European peoples, the [[association football|football]] became by far the most popular sport for the Bulgarians. [[Hristo Stoichkov]] was one of the best football (soccer) players in the second half of the 20th century, having played with the national team and [[FC Barcelona]]. He received a number of awards and was the joint top scorer at the [[1994 World Cup]]. [[Dimitar Berbatov]], currently in [[Manchester United]] and formely in the national team and two domestic clubs, is still the most popular Bulgarian football player of the 21st century.

In the beginning of the 20th century Bulgaria was famous for two of the best wrestlers in the world â [[Dan Kolov]] and [[Nikola Petroff]]. [[Stefka Kostadinova]] is the best female [[high jump]]er, still holding the world record from 1987, one of the oldest unbroken world records for all kind of athletics. [[Ivet Lalova]] along with [[Irina Privalova]] is currently the fastest white woman at [[100 metres]]. [[KotoÅshÅ« Katsunori|Kaloyan Mahlyanov]] has been the first European sumo wrestler to win the Emperor's Cup in Japan. Veselin Topalov won the 2005 [[World Chess Championship]]. He was ranked No. 1 in the world from April 2006 to January 2007, and had the second highest Elo rating of all time (2813). He regained the world No. 1 ranking again in October 2008.

===Symbols===
The national symbols of the Bulgarians are the [[Flag of Bulgaria|Flag]], the [[Coat of Arms of Bulgaria|Coat of Arms]], the [[National anthem of Bulgaria|National anthem]] and the [[National Guards Unit of Bulgaria|National Guard]], as well other unofficial symbols such as the [[Samara flag]].

The national flag of Bulgaria is a rectangle with three colors: white, green, and red, positioned horizontally top to bottom. The color fields are of same form and equal size. It is generally known that the white represents â the sky, the green â the forest and nature and the red â the blood of the people, referencing the strong bond of the nation through all the wars and revolutions that have shaken the country in the past.

The [[Coat of Arms of Bulgaria]] is a state symbol of the sovereignty and independence of the Bulgarian people and state. It represents a crowned rampant golden lion on a dark red background with the shape of a shield. Above the shield there is a crown modeled after the crowns of the emperors of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], with five crosses and an additional cross on top. Two crowned rampant golden lions hold the shield from both sides, facing it. They stand upon two crossed oak branches with acorns, which symbolize the power and the longevity of the Bulgarian state. Under the shield, there is a white band lined with the three national colors. The band is placed across the ends of the branches and the phrase &quot;Unity Makes Strength&quot; is inscribed on it.

Both the Bulgarian flag and the Coat of Arms are also used as symbols of various Bulgarian organisations, political parties and institutions.
