==Founding==
Conceived by the Arab states at the first Arab summit meeting, the [[1964 Arab League summit (Cairo)]], its stated goal was the &quot;liberation of [[Palestine]]&quot; through [[armed struggle]]. The organization was called Palestinian Liberation Organization.&lt;ref name=1964covenant&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/plocov.asp 1964 Palestinian National Covenant]&lt;/ref&gt; The original PLO Charter (issued on 28 May 1964&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Cobban]], ''The Palestinian Liberation Organisation''(Cambridge University Press, 1984) p.30&lt;/ref&gt;) stated that &quot;Palestine with its boundaries that existed at the time of the [[British mandate]] is an integral regional unit&quot; and sought to &quot;prohibit... the existence and activity&quot; of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name=1964covenant&gt; Articles 2 and 23 of the Palestinian National Covenant&lt;/ref&gt; It also called for a [[right of return]] and [[self-determination]] for Palestinians. Palestinian statehood was not mentioned, although in 1974 the PLO called for an independent state in the territory of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Mandate Palestine]].&lt;ref name=plo1974&gt;[http://www.mideastweb.org/plo1974.htm The PNC Program of 1974], 8 June 1974.

==Organization==
[[Image:Orient House.jpg|thumb|[[Orient House]], the former PLO headquarters in Jerusalem]]

The PLO has a nominal legislative body, the [[Palestinian National Council]] (PNC), but most actual political power and decisions are controlled by the [[PLO Executive Committee]], made up of 18 people elected by the PNC. The PLO incorporates a range of generally secular ideologies of different Palestinian movements committed to the struggle for Palestinian independence and liberation, hence the name of the organization. The Palestine Liberation Organization is considered by the Arab League&lt;ref name=&quot;al -Madfai&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esam Shashaa, [http://www.zajel.org/article_view.asp?newsID=1415&amp;cat=6 1974 â PLO representative of the Palestinian people], Zajel, An-Najah National University (Palestine), 26 September 2004.

It has been widely criticized, however, over the lack of [[Hamas]] presence in the Organization, even after Hamas won almost two-thirds of the seats in the 2006 legislative council elections.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[Yasser Arafat]] was the Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee from 1969 until his death in 2004. He was succeeded by [[Mahmoud Abbas]] (also known as Abu Mazen).

Initially, as an armed guerrilla organization, the PLO was responsible for [[Palestine_Liberation_Organization#Terrorist_activities|terrorist activities]] performed against Israel in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1988, however, the PLO officially endorsed a two-state solution, contingent on terms such as making [[East Jerusalem]] capital of the Palestinian state and giving Palestinians the [[right of return]] to land occupied by Palestinians prior to 1948, as well as the right to continue armed struggle until the end of &quot;The [[Zionist Entity]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', Westview Press (2004). ISBN 0813340489.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Yasser Arafat promised on multiple occasions in letters and in speeches to remove the parts of the PLO's charter which called for the destruction of &quot;The Zionist Entity,&quot; the version which contains those articles is the version displayed to the UN, and to other Palestinian bodies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Other institutions are the [[Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the [[Palestinian Central Council]] (PCC) which consists of 124 members from the PLO Executive Committee, PNC, [[Palestinian Legislative Council|PLC]] and other Palestinian organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/pdf/pdf2003/sections2/PLO-CC.pdf PLO Central Council Members]&lt;/ref&gt; The PCC makes policy decisions when PNC is not in session, acting as a link between the PNC and the PLO-EC. The PCC is elected by the PNC and chaired by the PNC speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/orgs1.htm PALESTINIAN ORGANISATIONS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The PLO has no central decision-making or mechanism that enables it to directly control its factions, but they are supposed to follow the PLO charter and Executive Committee decisions. Membership has fluctuated, and some organizations have left the PLO or suspended membership during times of political turbulence, but most often these groups eventually rejoined the organization. Not all PLO activists are members of one of the factions â for example, many PNC delegates are elected as independents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==History==
{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}

===Creation===
The [[1964 Arab League summit (Cairo)|Arab League in Cairo Summit 1964]] initiated the creation of an organization representing the Palestinian people.&lt;ref name=&quot;fundingevil&quot;&gt;[http://eufunding.org.uk/terror/FundingEvil.pdf FUNDING EVIL, How Terrorism Is Financed â and How to Stop It By Rachel Ehrenfeld]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestinian National Council convened in Jerusalem on 28 May 1964. Concluding this meeting the PLO was founded on 2 June 1964. Its ''Statement of Proclamation of the Organization''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.int/palestine/PLO/doc3plo.html Statement of Proclamation of the Organization], Palestine Liberation Organization, Jerusalem, 28 May 1964. Online on the site of the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations. Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; declared &quot;... the right of the Palestinian Arab people to its sacred homeland Palestine and affirming the inevitability of the battle to liberate the usurped part from it, and its determination to bring out its effective revolutionary entity and the mobilization of the capabilities and potentialities and its material, military and spiritual forces&quot;.

Due to the influence of the Egyptian President [[Nasser]], the PLO supported '[[Pan-Arabism]]', as advocated by him â this was the ideology that the Arabs should live in one state. &lt;!-- PROOF PLEASE THEN UNCOMMENT Nonetheless, the core idea of the PLO from the beginning was to represent the Palestinian People under Jordanian and Egyptian Rule and in exile, with the aim of an independent Palestinian State. --&gt; The first executive committee was formed on 9 August, with [[Ahmad Shuqeiri]] as its leader.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In spite of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]], the Arab states remained unreconciled to Israel's creation as they had been to the proposed [[1947 UN Partition Plan|partition of Palestine]] in 1948. Therefore, the [[Palestinian National Charter]] of 1964&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/pid/12363 The Palestinian National Charter], Adopted in 1964 by the 1st Palestinian Conference. Online on the site of the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations. Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; stated: &quot;The claims of historic and spiritual ties between Jews and Palestine are not in agreement with the facts of history or with the true basis of sound statehood... [T]he Jews are not one people with an independent personality because they are citizens to their states.&quot; (Article 18).

Although Egypt and Jordan favored the creation of a Palestinian state on land they considered to be occupied by Israel, they would not grant sovereignty to the Palestinian people in lands under Jordanian and Egyptian military occupation, amounting to 53% of the territory allocated to Arabs under the UN Partition Plan. Hence, Article 24: &quot;This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the [[West Bank]], the Gaza Strip or in the [[Himmah Area]].&quot;

===Executive Committee Chairmen===
* [[Ahmad Shukeiri]] (10 June 1964 â 24 December 1967)
* [[Yahya Hammuda]] (24 December 1967 â  2 February 1969)
* [[Yasser Arafat]] &quot;Abu Amar&quot; (4 February 1969 â 11 November 2004)
::(in exile in Jordan to April 1971; Lebanon 1971 â December 1982; and Tunis December 1982 â May 1994)
* [[Mahmoud Abbas]] &quot;Abu Mazen&quot; (From 29 October 2004 â present)
::(acting [for Arafat] to 11 November 2004)

===Leadership by Yasser Arafat===
The resounding defeat of Syria, Jordan and Egypt in the [[Six Day War]] of 1967 destroyed the credibility of Arab states that had fought to be patrons for the Palestinian people and their nationalist cause. The war radicalized the Palestinians and significantly weakened Nasser's influence. The way was opened, particularly after the [[Battle of Karameh]] in March 1968, for [[Yasser Arafat]] to rise to power.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} He advocated [[guerrilla warfare]] and successfully sought to make the PLO a fully independent organization under the control of the [[fedayeen]] organizations. At the Palestinian National Congress meeting of 1969, [[Fatah]] gained control of the executive bodies of the PLO. Arafat was appointed PLO chairman at the [[Palestinian National Congress]] in [[Cairo]] on 4 February 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HAJIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1f8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2064,4351664&amp;dq=arafat&amp;hl=en Al Fatah Chief To Lead Palestinian Liberation; Associated Press; 6 Feb. 1969]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C14F839541A7493C7A91789D85F4D8685F9 FATAH WINS CONTROL OF PALESTINE GROUP;New York Times; 5 Feb. 1969]&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, the Executive Committee was composed essentially of representatives of the various member organizations.

The PLO at this time did not clearly either accept or refute a two state solution. According to Israeli [[Likud]] leader [[Menachem Begin]], the PLO at this time was 'a Nazi orgranization' and its charter 'an Arabic Mein Kampf'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shindler2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Shindler|title=A history of modern Israel|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u0sD-8r7I5QC&amp;pg=PA155|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-61538-9|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of attrition===
From 1969 to September 1970 the PLO, with passive support from Jordan, fought a [[war of attrition]] with Israel. During this time, the PLO launched artillery attacks on the [[moshav]]im and [[kibbutz]]im of [[Bet Shean Valley Regional Council]], while [[fedayeen]] launched numerous attacks on Israeli forces. Israel raided the PLO camps in Jordan, withdrawing only under Jordanian military pressure.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

This conflict culminated in Jordan's [[Black September in Jordan|expulsion of the PLO in September 1970]].

===Black September in Jordan===
{{Main|Black September in Jordan}}

The PLO suffered a major reversal with the Jordanian assault on its armed groups in the events known as [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] in 1970. The Palestinian groups were expelled from Jordan, and during the 1970s, the PLO was effectively an [[umbrella group]] of eight organizations headquartered in [[Damascus]] and [[Beirut]], all devoted to armed resistance to either [[Zionism]] or Israeli occupation, using methods which included direct clashing and [[guerrilla warfare]] against Israel. After Black September, the [[Cairo Agreement]] led the PLO to establish itself in Lebanon.

===Ten Point Program===
In 1974, the PNC approved the [[PLO's Ten Point Program|Ten Point Program]]&lt;ref name=tenpointprogram&gt;[http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/12354;jsessionid=704B7796CCBC72ACC579828A2197F8B9 Political Program Adopted at the 12th Session of the Palestine National Council], Cairo, 8 June 1974. Online on the site of the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations. Retrieved 18 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; formulated by Fatah's leaders, which calls for the establishment of a national authority over any piece of liberated Palestinian land, and to actively pursue the establishment of a democratic state in Israel/Palestine. The Ten Point Program was considered the first attempt by PLO at a peaceful resolution, though the ultimate goal was &quot;completing the liberation of all Palestinian territory, and as a step along the road to comprehensive Arab unity.&quot;&lt;ref name=tenpointprogram&gt; Point 8th of the Ten Point Program of the PLO&lt;/ref&gt; 

This led to several radical PLO factions (such as the [[PFLP]], [[PFLP-GC]] and others) breaking out to form the [[Rejectionist Front]], which would act independently of PLO over the following years. Suspicion between the Arafat-led mainstream and more hard-line factions, inside and outside the PLO, have continued to dominate the inner workings of the organization ever since, often resulting in paralysis or conflicting courses of action. A temporary closing of ranks came in 1977, as Palestinian factions joined with hard-line Arab governments in the [[Steadfastness and Confrontation Front]] to condemn Egyptian attempts to reach a separate peace with Israel (eventually resulting in the 1979 [[Camp David Accords]]).

Israel claimed to see the Ten Point Program as dangerous, because it allegedly allows the Palestinian leadership to enter negotiations with Israel on issues where Israel can compromise, but under the intention of exploiting the compromises in order to &quot;improve positions&quot; for attacking Israel. The Hebrew term for this is the &quot;Plan of Stages&quot; (''Tokhnit HaSHlabim''). During the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in the 1990s, some Israelis repeated this suspicion, claiming that the Palestinians' willingness to compromise was just a smoke-screen to implement the Ten Point Program. After the [[Oslo Accords]] were signed, Israeli right-wing politicians claimed (and still claim) that this was part of the ploy to implement the Stage Program as Yasser Arafat himself admitted in Arabic many times. The Ten Point Program was never officially cancelled by the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} http://www.nfc.co.il/archive/003-D-6200-00.html?tag=23-15-32 nfc.co.il news site.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Date, Hebrew title, and translated title would be very useful on this reference.--&gt;

===Lebanon and the Lebanese Civil War===
{{Main|Lebanese Civil War}}

In the mid-1970s, Arafat and his Fatah movement found themselves in a tenuous position.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Arafat increasingly called for diplomacy, perhaps best symbolized by his Ten Points Program and his support for a UN Security Council resolution proposed in 1976 calling for a [[two-state solution|two-state settlement]] on the pre-1967 borders. But the [[Rejectionist Front]] denounced the calls for diplomacy, and a diplomatic solution was vetoed by the United States. The population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip saw Arafat as their best hope for a resolution to the conflict.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This was especially so in the aftermath of the [[Camp David Accords]] of 1978 between Israel and Egypt, which the Palestinians saw as a blow to their aspirations to self-determination.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[Abu Nidal]], a sworn enemy of the PLO since 1974,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} assassinated the PLO's diplomatic envoy to the [[European Economic Community]], which in the [[Venice Declaration]] of 1980 had called for the Palestinian right of self-determination to be recognized by Israel.

===As a partner for peace===
Opposition to Arafat was fierce not only among radical Arab groups, but also among many on the Israeli right.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This included [[Menachem Begin]], who had stated on more than one occasion that even if the PLO accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]] and recognized Israel's right to exist, he would never negotiate with the organization (Smith, op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;357).&lt;!-- There is no reference provided with the name Smith--&gt; This contradicted the official United States position that it would negotiate with the PLO if the PLO accepted Resolution 242 and recognized Israel, which the PLO had thus far been unwilling to do. Other Arab voices had recently called for a diplomatic resolution to the hostilities in accord with the international consensus, including Egyptian leader [[Anwar Sadat]] on his visit to Washington, DC in August 1981, and Crown Prince Fahd of Saudi Arabia in his 7 August peace proposal; together with Arafat's diplomatic maneuver, these developments made Israel's argument that it had &quot;no partner for peace&quot; seem increasingly problematic. Thus, in the eyes of Israeli hard-liners, &quot;the Palestinians posed a greater challenge to Israel as a peacemaking organization than as a military one&quot;. (Smith, op. cit., 376)

After the appointment of Ariel Sharon to the post of Minister of defence in 1981, the Israeli government policy of allowing political growth to occur in the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip changed. The Israeli government tried, unsuccessfully, to dictate terms of political growth by replacing local pro-PLO leaders with an Israeli civil administration.&lt;ref&gt;Shaul Mishal, Ranan D. Kuperman, David Boas (2001) Investment in Peace: Politics of Economic Cooperation Between Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority Sussex Academic Press, ISBN 1902210883 p 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tunis===
In 1982, the PLO relocated to [[Tunis, Tunisia|Tunis]], Tunisia after it was driven out of Lebanon by Israel during Israel's [[1982 Lebanon War|six-month invasion]] of Lebanon. Following massive raids by Israeli forces in Beirut, it is estimated that 8,000 PLO fighters evacuated the city and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Cobban]], ''The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: People, Power and Politics'', p3&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1985, in [[Operation Wooden Leg]], [[Israeli Air Force]] [[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15s]] bombed the PLO's Tunis headquarters, killing more than 60 people.

It is suggested that the Tunis period (1982â1991) was a negative point in the PLO's history, leading up to the Oslo negotiations and formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PLO in exile was distant from a concentrated number of Palestinians and became far less effective.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi, The Iron Cage, The Story of the Struffle for Palestinian Statehood, p 180&lt;/ref&gt; There was a significant reduction in centres of research, political debates or journalistic endeavours that had encouraged an energised public presence of the PLO in Beirut. More and more Palestinians were abandoned, and many felt that this was the beginning of the end.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Khalidi, The Iron Cage, The Story of the Struffle for Palestinian Statehood, p164&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Intifada===
{{Main|First Intifada}}

In 1987, the [[First Intifada]] broke out in the [[West Bank]] and Gaza Strip. The Intifada caught the PLO by surprise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistworld.net/eng/2004/11/11arafat.html Yasser Arafat obituary], socialistworld.net (Committee for a Workerâs International) 11 November 2004. Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the leadership abroad could only indirectly influence the events. A new local leadership emerged, the [[Unified National Leadership of the Uprising]] (UNLU), comprising many leading Palestinian factions. After [[King Hussein]] of Jordan proclaimed the administrative and legal separation of the West Bank from Jordan in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;King Hussein, [http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/88_july31.html Address to the Nation], Amman, Jordan, 31 July 1988. On the Royal Hashemit Court's official site in tribute to King Hussein. Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; the Palestine National Council adopted the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] in [[Algiers]], proclaiming an independent [[State of Palestine]]. The declaration made reference to UN resolutions without explicitly mentioning Security Council [[UN Security Council Resolution 242|Resolutions 242]] and [[UN Security Council Resolution 338|338]].

A month later, Arafat declared in [[Geneva]] that the PLO would support a solution of the conflict based on these Resolutions. Effectively, the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist within pre-1967 borders, with the understanding that the Palestinians would be allowed to set up their own state in the West Bank and Gaza. The United States accepted this clarification by Arafat and began to allow diplomatic contacts with PLO officials.&lt;!--While the Intifada many members of PLO organizations take a part at the activities or organized them, especially as &quot;Unified Intifada Leadership&quot; and its branches. At the beginning that activities weren't organized by the PLO itself. But, later the activities (especially the violent ones, like killing Israelis or collaborators) were more and more organized by the PLO. IS THERE A SOURCE FOR THIS? The UIL paid allegiance to the PLO, but how directly influenced it was by the PLO needs to be clarified. That the PLO was responsible for the more violent acts needs a source, please/!--&gt; The Proclamation of Independence did not lead to statehood, although over 100 states [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognised]] the State of Palestine.

===Persian Gulf War===
In 1990, the PLO under Yasser Arafat openly supported [[Saddam Hussein]] in his regime's [[invasion of Kuwait]], leading to a later rupture in Palestinian-Kuwaiti ties and the expulsion of many Palestinians from [[Kuwait]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Oslo Accords===
In 1993, the PLO secretly negotiated the [[Oslo Accords]] with Israel.&lt;ref name=beyer&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=2EzIySCw9VIC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=PLO+secretly+negotiated+1993&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kdl1TuLdA4rdgQflwenEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=PLO%20secretly%20negotiated%201993&amp;f=false Violent globalisms: conflict in response to empire by Cornelia Beyer]&lt;/ref&gt; The accords were signed on 20 August 1993.&lt;ref name=beyer&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There was a subsequent public ceremony in Washington D.C. on 13 September 1993 with Yasser Arafat and [[Yitzhak Rabin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22september+13+1993%22+arafat&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S9V1Tr3JC4bLgQeD9_nODA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22september%2013%201993%22%20arafat&amp;f=false Encyclopedia of the Palestinians; by Philip Mattar; 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The Accords granted the Palestinians right to self-government on the Gaza Strip and the city of [[Jericho]] in the [[West Bank]] through the creation of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. Yasser Arafat was appointed head of the Palestinian Authority and a timetable for elections was laid out which saw Arafat elected president in January 1996, 18 months behind schedule.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Although the PLO and the PA are not formally linked, the PLO dominates the administration. The headquarters of the PLO were moved to [[Ramallah]] on the West Bank.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLOhead1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PLOhead2&quot;/&gt;

On 9 September 1993, Arafat issued a press release stating that &quot;the PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLOletter&quot;&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Israel-PLO+Recognition+-+Exchange+of+Letters+betwe.htm Israel-PLO Recognition â Exchange of Letters between PM Rabin and Chairman Arafat â Sept 9- 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Palestinian officials have stated that the peace treaty must be viewed as permanent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} According to some opinion polls, a majority of Israelis believe Palestinians should have a state of their ownâa major shift in attitude after the Oslo Accordâeven though both [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Shimon Peres]] opposed the creation of a Palestinian state, both before and after the Accord.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} At the same time, a significant portion of the Israeli public and some political leaders (including the current Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]) express doubt over whether a peaceful, coherent state can be founded by the PLO, and call for significant re-organization, including the elimination of all terrorism, before any talk about independence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Second Intifada===
{{Main|Al-Aqsa Intifada}}
The Second or Al-Aqsa Intifada started (when Ariel Sharon accompanied by some bodyguards defiantly visited the Mosques main square against advice to the contrary) concurrent with the breakdown of talks at Camp David with Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]. The Intifada never ended officially, but violence hit relatively low levels during 2005. The death toll both military and civilians of the entire conflict in 2000â2004 is estimated to be 3,223 Palestinians and 950 Israelis, although this number is criticized for not differentiating between combatants and civilians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Members of the PLO have claimed responsibility for a number of attacks against Israelis during the Second Intifada{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

==Palestinian National Charter==
The [[Palestinian National Charter]] as amended in 1968, endorsed the use of armed struggle against Zionist imperialism.
:'''&lt;small&gt;Article 10 of the Palestinian National Charter states &quot;Commando (''Fedayâee'') action constitutes the nucleus of the Palestinian popular liberation war. This requires its escalation, comprehensiveness, and the mobilization of all the Palestinian popular and educational efforts and their organization and involvement in the armed Palestinian revolution. It also requires the achieving of unity for the national ('wanted'') struggle among the different groupings of the Palestinian people, and between the Palestinian people and the Arab masses, so as to secure the continuation of the revolution, its escalation, and victory.&quot;&lt;/small&gt;

The most controversial element of text of the Charter were many clauses declaring the creation of the state of Israel &quot;null and void&quot;, because it was created by force on Palestinian soil.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This is usually interpreted as calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In letters exchanged between Arafat and Rabin in conjunction with the 1993 [[Oslo Accords]], Arafat agreed that those clauses would be removed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} On 24 April 1996, the Palestine National Council held a meeting in camera, after which it was announced that the Council had voted to nullify or amend all such clauses, and called for a new text to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=U3En3Uz5ACQC&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=%22+24+April+1996,+the+Palestine+National+Council&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Rt91Tq_vFIrh0QH04OGoDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%2024%20April%201996%2C%20the%20Palestine%20National%20Council&amp;f=false Historical dictionary of terrorism] by Sean Anderson, Stephen Sloan, Scarecrow Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Israeli political figures and academics expressed doubt that this is what had actually taken place, and continued to claim that controversial clauses were still in force.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A letter from Arafat to US President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1998 listed the clauses concerned, and a meeting of the Palestine Central Committee approved that list.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} To remove all doubt, the vote this time was held in a public meeting of PLO, PNC and PCC members which was televised worldwide, and in the presence of Bill Clinton who traveled to the Gaza Strip for that purpose. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted this as the promised nullification{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. He later wrote, &quot;While the PLO repeatedly committed itself to amend the charter..., no changes have been made despite occasional claims to the contrary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Netanyahu, Benjamin. A Durable Peace: Israel and its Place Among the Nations.  Grand Central Publishing. 2002. Page 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a new text of the Charter has not been produced, and this is the source of a continuing controversy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Critics of the Palestinian organizations claim that failure proves the insincerity of the clause nullifications.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} One of several Palestinian responses is that the proper replacement of the Charter will be the constitution of the forthcoming state of Palestine.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The published draft constitution states that the territory of Palestine &quot;is an indivisible unit based upon its borders on 4 June 1967&quot; â which clearly implies an acceptance of Israel's existence in its 1967 borders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==In the United Nations==
{{See also|List of current Permanent Representatives to the United Nations|Category:Permanent Observers of Palestine to the United Nations}}
The United Nations General Assembly recognized the PLO as the &quot;representative of the Palestinian people&quot; in Resolution 3210 and Resolution 3236, and granted the PLO observer status on 22 November 1974 in Resolution 3237. On 12 January 1976 the [[UN Security Council]] voted 11â1 with 3 abstentions to allow the Palestinian Liberation Organization to participate in a Security Council debate without voting rights, a privilege usually restricted to UN member states. It was admitted as a full member of the [[United Nations Regional Groups|Asia group]] on 2 April 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations|title=Status of Palestine at the United Nations|url=http://www.un.int/wcm/content/site/palestine/cache/offonce/pid/11550;jsessionid=DB37131DB27A165B6398469FFE4DB1FC|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 December 2010}}: &quot;On 2 April 1986, the Asian Group of the U.N. decided to accept the PLO as a full member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|title=Government structures|url= http://www.unctad.org/templates/Page.asp?intItemID=4966&amp;lang=1|publisher=United Nations| date=2002|accessdate=5 December 2010}}: &quot;At present, the PLO is a full member of the Asian Group of the United Nations&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly [http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-52-250.pdf Resolution 52/250: Participation of Palestine in the work of the United Nations] (1998): &quot;Palestine enjoys full membership in the Group of Asian States&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic representation==
{{main|Foreign relations of the Palestine Liberation Organization}}
{{See also|Category:Ambassadors of Palestine}}
The ''Palestine Information Office'' was registered with the Justice Department of the United States as a foreign agent until 1968, when it was closed. It was reopened in 1989 as the ''Palestine Affairs Center.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Palestinian Diaspora: Formation of Identities and Politics of Homeland,'' By Helena Lindholm Schulz, Juliane Hammer, Routledge, 2003 p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; The PLO Mission office, in Washington D.C was opened in 1994, and represented the PLO in the United States. On 20 July 2010, the United States Department of State agreed to upgrade the status of the PLO Mission in the United States to &quot;General Delegation of the PLO&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/u-s-upgrades-status-of-palestinian-mission-in-washington-1.303475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition by Israel and the Oslo Accords==
{{see|Palestinian views on the peace process#Yasser Arafat and the_PLO}}
In 1993, PLO chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] recognized the [[State of Israel]] in an official letter to its prime minister, [[Yitzhak Rabin]]. In response to Arafat's letter, Israel decided to revert its stance toward the PLO and to recognize the organization as the representative of the [[Palestinian people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PLOletter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baltimoresun&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-09-10/news/1993253104_1_israel-and-plo-palestinians-israeli-plo|title=At the threshold of peace Mutual recognition ends 3 decades of strife between Israel and PLO ISRAELI-PLO PEACE TALKS|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993.

==Terrorist activities==
The PLO began their militancy campaign from its inception with an attack on [[National Water Carrier of Israel|Israel's National Water Carrier]] in January 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;fundingevil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The PLO was designated a [[terrorist organization]] by the United States in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Code [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode22/usc_sec_22_00005201----000-.html TITLE 22 &gt; CHAPTER 61 &gt; Â§ 5201.

Retrieved 5 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;, but in 1988 a presidential waiver was issued which permitted contact with the organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;fundingevil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The United States attempted to prosecute Yasser Arafat for his complicity in the [[Attack on the Saudi embassy in Khartoum|assassination of two U.S diplomats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Prosecution Of Arafat Rejected |work=Washington Post | date = 22 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel considered the PLO be a terrorist organization until the [[Madrid Conference]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;fundingevil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rest of the world recognized the PLO as the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people from the mid-1970s onwards (after the PLO's admission to the UN as an observer.)&lt;ref name=Hajjarp53&gt;Hajjar, 2005, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=vTKTj3Uz7iIC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=PLO+Israel+terrorists+%22legitimate+representative%22+%22international+community%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 53].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of what were considered terrorist acts committed by [[Palestine_Liberation_Organization#Membership|member organizations]] of the PLO were:

* The 1970 [[Avivim school bus massacre]] by the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (DFLP), killed nine children, three adults and crippled 19.
* In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], the second-largest PLO faction after [[al-Fatah]], carried out [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine#Armed attacks on Israeli targets|a number of attacks and plane hijackings]] mostly directed at Israel, most infamously the [[Dawson's Field hijackings]], which precipitated the [[Black September in Jordan]] crisis.
* In 1972, the [[Black September Organization]] carried out the [[Munich massacre]] of Israeli Olympic athletes.
* In 1974, members of the DFLP seized a school in Israel and killed a total of 26 students and adults and wounded over 70 in the [[Ma'alot massacre]].
* The 1975, [[Savoy Operation|Savoy Hotel hostage situation]] killing 8 settlers and 3 soldiers, carried out by Fatah.
* The 1978, [[Coastal Road massacre]] killing 37 Israelis and wounding 76, also carried out by Fatah.
