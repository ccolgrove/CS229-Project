'''Rusangu University''', formerly known as '''Zambia Adventist University''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZAMBIA ADVENTIST UNIVERSITY EMBRACES A NEW NAME, âRUSANGU UNIVERSITYâ (RU)|url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=135594963174158|publisher=Zambia Adventist University|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[Private university|private]] [[coeducational]] [[Christian]] university based in Rusangu Mission near [[Monze]] in [[Zambia]]. It is owned and operated by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].

==History==
In 1903 W. H. Anderson, a [[Christian]] [[missionary]] crossed the Zambezi River from Solusi Mission in Zimbabwe to set up the Rusangu Mission in Zambia in 1905. From this mission station, grew the Rusangu Primary School, the Rusangu Secondary School and eventually in 1975 the Rusangu Ministerial School. In 1993, the Rusangu Ministerial School changed its name to Zambia Adventist Seminary. A year later in 1994, the Seminary was closed to pave way for re-organization.

In 1997, plans to re-open the Seminary brought the idea of the Zambia Adventist College that would offer other courses in addition to theology and pastoral training. In 2000, an in-service program for serving church pastors began at Riverside Farm Institute in collaboration with [[Solusi University]]. With the full development of the Zambia Adventist College idea, this pastorsâ program finally moved back to the historic Rusangu Mission site in May 2003. Rapid developments have since given birth to a full fledge Zambia Adventist university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagnet.org/zau/history.htm History of Zambia Adventist University]&lt;/ref&gt;
