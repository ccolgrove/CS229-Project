'''''Calendar''''' is a [[personal organiser]] program that was distributed with [[Microsoft Windows]] from [[Windows 1.0|version 1.01]] until [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]]. It was superseded by the calendar in [[Microsoft Schedule+]], which was included in [[Windows 3.1x|Windows for Workgroups]] and [[Windows NT]]. [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 2000]] and their descendants did not include a calendar program until [[Windows Vista]], but [[Windows XP]] can run Microsoft Calendar.
Note: Some Windows Longhorn betas have a clock app on the sidebar, that when opened, a calendar applet will open.

Saved ''Calendar'' files have the extension ''.cal''. The ''Calendar'' file format was one of those described in Volume 4 of Microsoft's Windows 3.1 Programmer's Reference. &lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Corporation, &quot;Microsoft Windows 3.1 Programmer's Reference.  Volume 4: Resources&quot;, Microsoft Press, 1992, ISBN 1-55615-494-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Two 32-bit versions of Microsoft Calendar were found in the Windows NT/2000 source trees: one was a simple port of Calendar from 16 to 32-bit, and the other was a Unicode-compatible version.  However, the applet did not make the final cut, along with implementations of Microsoft [[Cardfile]], Clock, [[Cruel (solitaire)|Cruel Solitaire]], Golf Solitaire, Pegged (peg solitaire), Reversi, Snake, and Tic-Tac-Toe. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
