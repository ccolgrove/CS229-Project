A person may be described as an unauthorised arrival when they have crossed a [[national border]] with the intention of applying for [[refugee]] status, making them an '''[[asylum seeker]]'''. If a person enters a country without authorisation intending to live and work in that country, then they may be, or may become, an [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]].

Under the [[United Nations]] [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], a person has the right to cross national borders if they are seeking asylum from [[political repression]] or various other forms of persecution.
