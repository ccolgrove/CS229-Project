===Formation, planning and construction===
In 1958 a study commissioned by the [[Michigan Legislature]] demonstrated a need for a four-year college in the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] area, Michigan's second largest metropolitan region. Local businessman [[L. William Seidman|Bill Seidman]] created a committee to study the report and spearhead the planning and promotion to create such an institution. In the following year the Michigan Legislature established the college. A naming contest was held, and out of 2500 submissions, &quot;Grand Valley State College&quot; was chosen. Private donations, including $350,000 to purchase land and $1,000,000 for construction, were secured from 5,000 individuals, organizations, and business throughout [[West Michigan]]. In 1961, the Grand Valley State College Board of Control chose a {{convert|876|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]] near the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] for the new campus, and construction of academic buildings began the following year.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeidmanGRPressObit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/05/bill_seidman_remembered_as_man.html|title=Bill Seidman remembered as man who embraced family, education, banking and his Grand Rapids roots|date=May 14, 2009|publisher=The Grand Rapids Press|accessdate=5 January 2010|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
Grand Valley State College accepted its first class of 226 students in 1963 and held its first graduation of 138 students on June 18, 1967. The middle-late 1960s saw the addition of the first dormitories and construction of new academic buildings, including the Zumberge Library, named for the University's first President [[James Zumberge]]. 

In 1969, the ''Grand Valley Lanthorn'' printed an issue containing several vulgarities and obscenities. After complaints from some at Grand Valley State College and the surrounding communities, the [[Ottawa County, Michigan]], sheriff arrested the editor, and the prosecutor closed down the newspaper office. The university, then a co-ed college, sued the sheriff and prosecutor for closing the Lanthorn offices. Eventually, Michigan's Attorney General settled the case out of court, ruling in favor of Grand Valley State College.&lt;ref name=&quot;ivlubberslanthorn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gvsu.edu/anniversary/history-colleges-history-1964-1969--26.htm|title=IV. The Arrival of Arend Lubbers|publisher=Grand Valley State University|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s Grand Valley used a multiple college concept: &quot;College of Arts and Sciences&quot;, &quot;Thomas Jefferson College&quot;, &quot;William James College&quot;, &quot;Seidman College of Business&quot;, and &quot;College IV&quot;. Former Michigan Governor [[William Milliken]] signed into law for the name to be changed to Grand Valley State Colleges in 1973. However the &quot;s&quot; was dropped and the name was reverted back to Grand Valley State College in 1983 when the academic programs were reorganized into divisions.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

===Continued growth===
In 1987 the Michigan Legislature passed a law renaming the college to &quot;Grand Valley State University.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Act 21&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ypntgp2yhhg4u0mfyrizce45))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&amp;objectName=mcl-390-861|title=Act 21 of 1963|publisher=2009 Legislative Council, State of Michigan|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s and 1990s saw addition of satellite campuses or centers in downtown Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Holland and Traverse City. In 2004, the Board of Control reorganized the University structure again into a college system consisting of College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, College of Interdisciplinary Studies, College of Community and Public Service, College of Education, College of Health Professions, [[Kirkhof College of Nursing]], Seidman College of Business, and Seymour and Esther Padnos College of Engineering and Computing. The fall semester of 2010 began a year-long celebration of the university's first 50 years of history and change.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Grand Valley completed its first 50 years with a comprehensive campaign that raised almost $100 million from over 17,000 donors, making it the university's largest campaign to date. Money raised from the campaign has helped fund many new construction projects on campus, including the Mary Idema Pew Library and L. William Seidman Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mibiz.com/news/education/18162-gvsu-announces-totals-for-record-setting-campaign.html|title=GVSU Announces Totals for Record Setting Campaign|publisher=Michigan Business News and Information|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Interurban Transit Partnership]] operates several ''The Rapid'' bus routes under contract with the university. The public can ride these buses by paying the fare, but rides are free to Grand Valley students, faculty and staff on all Rapid routes with a valid I.D. card.&lt;ref name=&quot;gvsubus&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvsu.edu/bus/index.cfm?id=58363307-A68A-0616-9725CE578F9B5F08|title=Grand Valley State University Shuttle Services|publisher=Grand Valley State University|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GVSU Student Services Building.JPG|thumb|Student Services Building at Grand Valley State University-Allendale campus]]
===Funding and financial===
GVSU's general fund budget is $265.9 million, of which $198.5 million is from tuition, and $64 million is from state appropriations. As of fall 2010, Grand Valley's amount of university-based student financial aid was $23.1 million.&lt;ref name=quickfacts/&gt; Also, during the 2009â2010 academic year, full time dependent students received an average award of $9,050 totaling more than $200 million in total assistance including $55 million of that in scholarships, grants, and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gvsu.edu/financialaid/index.cfm?id=F6C777FA-B9DB-749D-6328B043619C8068 |title=Prospective Freshmen - Financial Aid |publisher=Grand Valley State University |work= |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public safety ===
The Department of Public Safety provides law enforcement services for the Allendale Campus. While the department is self-empowered to enforce its jurisdiction, officers are also deputized by the [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]] [[Sheriff]]'s Department. Because [[Allendale Charter Township, Michigan|Allendale]] doesn't have its own police department, the Grand Valley State University Police can handle cases anywhere in Ottawa County, mainly in Allendale and the area surrounding the campus. The department handles other security issues, such as parking and driving violations, community policing, and lost and found. Allendale's volunteer fire department serves the campus. The Department of Public Safety also employs several students who assist the department by performing a variety of clerical and security based duties and services.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubsafe&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvsu.edu/publicsafety/index.cfm?id=FDE17056-A541-D77A-DABF4C832D6A82E4|title=GVSU Public Safety, About our Department|publisher=Grand Valley State University|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Campus Security and Regional Centers is an entity distinct from the Department of Public safety, and handles security and public safety issues for the Grand Rapids Pew Campus and all Regional Centers including the Holland (MI) Meijer Campus, the Muskegon (MI) campus and the Traverse City (MI) campus. This department is not sworn or certified and relies on the Grand Rapids Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies for official law enforcement when necessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;pewsec&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvsu.edu/pewsecurity/index.cfm?id=6666FEEC-B4C6-4BA8-072B50AABD29E9F0|title=Pew Campus Security|publisher=Grand Valley State University|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
