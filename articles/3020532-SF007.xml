<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3020532" ns="0" title="Corneal reflex"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''corneal reflex''', also known as the '''blink reflex''', is an involuntary [[blink]]ing of the [[eyelid]]s elicited by stimulation of the [[cornea]] (such as by touching or by a foreign body), or bright light, though could result from any peripheral stimulus. Stimulation should elicit both a direct and consensual response (response of the opposite eye).  The reflex consumes a rapid rate of 0.1 second.  The [[evolution]]ary purpose of this reflex is to protect the [[human eye|eye]]s from foreign bodies and bright lights (the latter known as the optical reflex).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica from [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The blink reflex also occurs when sounds greater than 40-60 [[Decibel|dB]] are made.&lt;ref&gt;Garde, M.M., &amp; Cowey, A. (2000). ''&quot;Deaf hearing&quot;: Unacknowledged detection of auditory stimuli in a patient with cerebral deafness. Cortex 36''(1), 71-80&lt;/ref&gt;

The reflex is mediated by:
* the nasociliary branch of the [[ophthalmic nerve|ophthalmic branch]] (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of the 5th [[Cranial nerves|cranial nerve]] ([[trigeminal nerve]]) sensing the stimulus on the cornea, lid, or conjunctiva (i.e. it is the afferent). 
* the 7th cranial nerve ([[Facial nerve]]) initiating the motor response (i.e. it is the efferent). 
* possibly mediated by a medullary center.

Use of [[contact lens]]es may diminish or abolish the testing of this reflex.

The optical reflex, on the other hand, is slower and is mediated by the [[visual cortex]], which resides in the [[occipital lobe]] of the brain.  The reflex is absent in infants under 9 months.

The examination of the corneal reflex is a part of some [[Neurology|neurological]] exams, [[coma]]. Damage to the ophthalmic branch (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) of the 5th cranial nerve results in absent corneal reflex when the affected eye is stimulated. Stimulation of one cornea normally has a consensual response, with both eyelids normally closing.

==Rates==

When awake, the lids spread the tear secretions over the corneal surface, on a typical basis of 2 to 10 seconds (though this may vary individually).  But blinking is not only dependent on dryness and/or irritation.  A brain area, the globus pallidus of the basal ganglia contains a blinking center that controls blinking. Nonetheless, the external stimuli are still involved.  Blinking is linked with the extraocular muscles.  Blinking is often concurrent with a shift in gaze, and it is believed that this helps the movement of the eye.
