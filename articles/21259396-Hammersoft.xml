'''Ross Miner''' (born January 24, 1991) is an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]]. He is the 2011 [[2011 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national bronze medalist]], 2009 [[2009-2010 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix Final bronze medalist]] and 2009 [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Junior National Champion]].

== Personal life ==
Miner was born in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. In addition to figure skating, he also played hockey until the age of 12.&lt;ref name=mining/&gt; He takes on-line courses from the [[University of Missouri]].&lt;ref name=leap/&gt;

== Career ==
Miner began skating at the age of three.&lt;ref name=mining/&gt; When he was 12, he moved with his family from [[Williston, Vermont]] to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to train at the [[Skating Club of Boston]].&lt;ref name=leap/&gt; He had to relearn much from scratch as his jump technique was poor at the beginning â underrotating even single axels; nevertheless, [[Mark Mitchell]] and [[Peter Johansson]] agreed to coach him.&lt;ref name=leap/&gt; 

In the 2004â2005 season, Miner competed on the Intermediate level. He won the bronze medal at his regional championship to qualify for the U.S. Junior Championships, where he placed 8th. He remained on the intermediate level during the following season. He won the silver medal at his regional championship to qualify for the U.S. Junior Championships, where he won the gold medal.

In the 2006â2007 season, Miner moved up to the Novice level. He won his regional championship and then placed 5th at his sectional championship, missing qualifying for the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]] by one position.

In the 2007â2008 season, Miner remained on the Novice level. He won his sectional championship to qualify for the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]], where he won the silver medal. Following the U.S. Championships, Miner was assigned to the 2008 [[Gardena Spring Trophy]], where he won the silver medal on the Junior level.

In the 2008â2009 season, Miner moved up to the Junior level nationally. He won his sectional championships to qualify for the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]]. At Nationals, Miner won the short program&lt;ref name=juniorshort/&gt; and placed second in the free skate to win the gold medal overall.&lt;ref name=juniortitle/&gt;&lt;ref name=surprise/&gt;

Following the event, Miner was named to the team to the [[2009 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Junior Championships]],&lt;ref name=09wjch/&gt; where he placed 10th.

Miner won the bronze medal at the [[2009â2010 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2009â2010 Junior Grand Prix Final]]. He had qualified to compete at the senior level at the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Nationals]] but suffered a high ankle sprain while practicing a triple axel.&lt;ref name=leap/&gt;&lt;ref name=wd10usn/&gt; He was forced to withdraw from the event and also missed Junior Worlds. 

During the 2010â11 season, Miner finished 9th at [[2010 NHK Trophy]] and 7th at [[2010 Cup of China]]. He made his senior national debut at the [[2011 United States Figure Skating Championships|2011 U.S. Championships]] where he won the bronze medal.&lt;ref name=majorstep/&gt; He was selected to compete at the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 World Championships]], where he finished 11th. During the off-season, he worked on a quad salchow and shortening the lead time into his jumps.&lt;ref name=champscamp11/&gt;
