|&quot;Bob was arguing the point but Dick was having none of it. 'Look, I'm telling you. There'll be no fucking religion - not Christian, not Jewish, not Muslim. Nothing. For God's sake, man - you were born Jewish, which makes your religion money, doesn't it? So stick with it, for Christ's sake. I'm giving you 20 million bucks - it's like baptising you, like sending you to heaven. So what are you fucking moaning about? You want 20 million bucks from us? Well, you gotta do what we tell you. And what we're telling you is... No Torah! No Bible! No Koran! No Jesus! No God! No Allah! No fucking religion. It's going in the contract.' As a devout atheist, I could hardly object, though it seemed tough that a contract should include such specific restrictions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Napier-Bell, 'The life and crimes of the music biz', ''The Observer'' (England), 20 January 2008, Observer Music Magazine, Pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

|âAs far back as I can remember, I have been an atheist. I probably stopped believing in God around the same time - and for the same reasons - as I stopped believing in Santa Claus. It seemed to me to be just another fictional story. Atheist Ireland stands for two things. The first is promoting atheism and reason over superstition and supernaturalism, and the second is promoting an ethical and secular Ireland in which the state doesnât fund or favour any particular religion.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=AGENDA-qqqs=agenda-qqqid=42648-qqqx=1.asp Interview with Michael Nugent] ''[[Sunday Business Post]]'', 28 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a cynical eye and he was very aware of the sub-structure of society, the unusual alliances, the way people weren't always what they seemed. He was an atheist and a Marxist, liable to start spouting Hegel if you gave him a chance. He used to say, my enemy's enemy is my friend.

They still don't talk about it. His mother, he says, is also very religious but in an emotional way: 'She believes that in heaven she will be reunited with every spaniel she has ever owned.' While O'Hanlon was away in Africa, his older brother, a book rep, took Belinda and the children to communion. O'Hanlon was shocked, but 'I decided not to be angry about it.

|Q: &quot;I noticed that nobody uses the &quot;A-word&quot;-- atheist--for you. Perhaps it is a step beyond nontheist or humanist. Do you identify as an atheist?
Oates: &quot;That's a good question. I have met Christopher Hitchens once or twice, and he has a book that I'm sure you've either read or are aware of titled ''God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything''. He is very adversarial, very eloquent, and very funny in his interviews. And, of course, he is very much a self-declared atheist.
&quot;I'm not averse to acknowledging it, but as a novelist and a writer, I really don't want to confront and be antagonistic toward people. As soon as you declare that you are an atheist, it's like somebody declaring that he is the son of God; it arouses a lot antagonism. I'm wondering whether it might be better to avoid arousing this antagonism in order to find--not compromise--some common ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Carol Oates, [http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/JoyceCarolOates.html Humanism and Its Discontents], ''The Humanist'', November/December 2007 (accessed 9 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

|&quot;Not since 1964 had Pasolini created such a stir, and even then it was not the content of his ''The Gospel According to St. Matthew'' that stunned people. It was the discovery that a director who was both a communist and an atheist could bring such fervor and insight to a religious subject. [...] There are times when Pasolini sounds remarkably religious for a self-acknowledged atheist. &quot;I suffer from the nostalgia of a peasant-type religion, and that is why I am on the side of the servant,&quot; he says. &quot;But I do not believe in a metaphysical god. I am religious because I have a natural identification between reality and God. Reality is divine. That is why my films are never naturalistic. The motivation that unites all of my films is to give back to reality its original sacred significance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Flatley, [http://www.moviecrazed.com/outpast/pasolini.html The Atheist who was Obsessed with God], 1969, located at Moviecrazed.com (accessed 25 April 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Werner Heisenberg]] recollects a friendly conversation among young participants at the 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] about Einstein's and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg and Dirac took part in it. Among other things, Dirac said: &quot;I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest â and as scientists honesty is our precise duty â we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God is a product of human imagination.[...] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another.[...]&quot; Pauli jokingly said: &quot;Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is: God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = | title = Physics and Beyond: Encounters and Conversations | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = New York | isbn=0061316229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
