'''University of Nevada-Las Vegas''' ('''UNLV''') is a [[state university (U.S.)|public]], [[co-education|coeducational]] [[university]] located in the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] suburb of [[Paradise, Nevada]], [[United States of America|USA]]. The {{convert|337|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[campus]] is located approximately {{convert|1.5|mi}} east of the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. The institution includes a Shadow Lane Campus, located just east of the [[University Medical Center of Southern Nevada]]. The [[university]] has been deemed a &quot;research-intensive university&quot; by [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]].

==History==
The first [[college]] classes which would eventually become the classes of UNLV were offered as the southern regional extension division of the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] in 1951 in a classroom at [[Las Vegas High School]]. Groundbreaking on the original{{convert|60|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} site was in April 1956, and the university purchased a {{convert|640|acre|km2|abbr=on|sing=on}} site in [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]] for future expansion. UNLV was officially founded by the [[Nevada System of Higher Education|Nevada Board of Regents]] as the Southern Division of the  [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]]  in 1957. The first classes were held on the current campus in the [[post and beam]] [[Mid Century Modern]] [[Maude Frazier]] Hall designed by the [[award]] winning local [[architectural]] firm, [http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/architects/zickandsharpresources.html Zick and Sharp]. Twenty-nine [[students]] [[graduated]] in the first commencement ceremonies in 1964.&lt;ref name=sawyer&gt;{{cite news|title=Sawyer Lauds Local Campus At Graduation|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1964/jun/04/sawyer-lauds-local-campus-graduation/?framing=history|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=4 June 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://go.unlv.edu/history/timeline|work=UNLV history|publisher=UNLV|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Nevada Legislature named the school '''Nevada Southern University''', and the Board of Regents hired the campus's first [[president]], Donald C. Moyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past presidents &amp; campus leaders|url=http://go.unlv.edu/history/presidents|work=UNLV|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Nevada Southern was given equal status with its parent institution in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and the present name was approved by the Regents in January 1969, during a winter session and without input by representatives from the  [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] . During this time Nevada Southern University also adopted the southern &quot;Rebel&quot; athletics moniker and a mascot dressed in a southern Confederate uniform named Beauregard. The popular reasoning behind such a controversial moniker and mascot is that they did it to oppose the northern Union traditions and symbols of their northern rival, the University of Nevada. It was not long, however, before protests from NSU/UNLV students forced a slight change to their Confederate mascot, but the &quot;Rebels&quot; moniker remains to this day. Since its founding, the university has grown rapidly, expanding both its academic programs and campus facilities.

In 1969, the Board of Regents approved the new name of University of Nevada at Las Vegas and the abbreviation UNLV.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; 

In 1973 [[Jerry Tarkanian]] was hired as the men's basketball coach by UNLV's second president, Roman Zorn.&lt;ref name=zorn&gt;{{cite news|title=UNLVâs pioneering second president, Zorn, dies at 85|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2002/aug/20/unlvs-pioneering-second-president-zorn-dies-at-85/|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=20 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1981 [[Claes Oldenburg]]'s Flashlight sculpture was installed on the plaza between Artemus Ham Hall and Judy Bayley Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arin|first=Naomi|title=High beam: Using a flashlight to illuminate the public art struggles of âPaintbrushesâ|url=http://weeklyseven.com/ae/2011/march/17/high-beam|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=Vegas Seven|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, UNLV opened its first regional campus on Shadow Lane, near the University Medical Center.  The School of Dental Medicine is located on the Shadow Lane Campus.&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt; 

===New initiatives===

In 2005, the university received over $95 million in extramural research funding, about a 30 percent increase over the previous year. Its fund raising campaign, &quot;Invent the Future&quot;, reached its $500 million goal in 2009.&lt;ref name=richmond&gt;{{cite news|last=Richmond|first=Emily|title=Success: UNLV hits mark of $500 million in cash and pledges|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/nov/05/unlv-celebrates-500-million-goal-reached-fundraisi/|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2009, a $59.7 million Advanced Clinical and Research Training Center was constructed under architect Carpenter Sellers. This LEED equivalent building is expected to be completed by summer 2010. It will serve to consolidate the University of Nevada Health Sciences System programs through the shared use of classrooms, teaching labs, and simulated patient lab space.&lt;ref&gt;http://csdarchitecture.com/project/unlv-advanced-clinical-training-and-research-center&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The University of Nevada, Las Vegas has created an Urban Sustainability Initiative that strives to implement sustainable practices both on campus and in the larger Las Vegas community.&lt;ref name=&quot; Urban Sustainability Initiative Home &quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Sustainability Initiative|publisher=University of Nevada - Las Vegas|url=http://urban21.unlv.edu/|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having two campus buildings in the process of [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Certification and one building in the process of LEED Gold Certification, UNLV has reduced its use of electricity and natural gas by 38 percent per square foot since 2001 by retrofitting older campus buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot; Urban Sustainability Initiative Campus Efforts &quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban Sustainability Initiative Campus Efforts|publisher=University of  Nevada - Las Vegas|url=http://urban21.unlv.edu/about/efforts.html|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 edition of the Sustainable Endowment Instituteâs College Sustainability Report Card, University of Nevada-Las Vegas received a grade of &quot;C&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=College Sustainability Report Card 2008|publisher=Sustainable Endowments Institute|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2009/schools/university-of-nevadalas-vegas|accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to stop or at least reduce the budget cuts to UNLV and the rest of the [[Nevada System of Higher Education]] (NSHE), rallies were held early 2009 to protest the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;savenevadastudents.org&quot;&gt;http://savenevadastudents.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  Tuition will be raised by 10% for fall 2009 as a partial measure to alleviate Nevada's financial hardship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgj.com/article/20090620/NEWS/906200339/1321/news&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and amenities aiding students in their research and learning may be cut.&lt;ref name=&quot;savenevadastudents.org&quot;/&gt; Faculty and staff are also affected by Nevada's budget shortfalls.  They remain worried about pay cuts, lost benefits, and job security.&lt;ref&gt;http://system.nevada.edu/Initiative/Proposed-B/Budget-Cut/04.28.09_Faculty-Recruitment---Reten.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|UNLV Rebels}}
UNLV supports varsity teams in 17 different sports. The men's basketball team is referred to as the [[UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball|Runnin' Rebels]] and the men's baseball team is referred to as the Hustlin' Rebels. The Rebels are a founding member of the [[Mountain West Conference]], in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I. The only exception is the UNLV men's soccer team, which competes in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]].

The school's official colors of scarlet and gray can be traced to the late-1950s when UNLV adopted as mascot a wolf wearing a Confederate uniform. Scarlet and Gray were traditional colors of the Confederacy with its gray uniforms and red-based flag. UNLV's mascot is Hey Reb, the toned down version of the original mascot named Beauregard, which was a wolf character dressed in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hat and uniform. UNLV's Hey Reb mascot made his debut in 1983. He received his first makeover in 1997 and second in 2009. Named one of 12 All-American Mascots, he competed for the title of 2004 Capital One Mascot of the Year and made a strong showing by coming in second in online voting. No stranger to national television, Hey Reb has also appeared in two memorable ESPN SportsCenter commercials.

UNLV has many traditions in its athletic programs. Each year the men's football team plays the [[Nevada Wolf Pack]] in a football game called the [[Battle for Nevada]]. The trophy for that game is the [[Fremont Cannon]]. Built by the [[Kennecott Copper]] Corp., Nevada Mines Division, the cannon is valued at more than $10,000 and is considered one of the best, and loudest, symbols of rivalry in college football.&lt;ref&gt;http://unlvrebels.cstv.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.htmlhttp://unlvrebels.cstv.com/trads/unlv-trads-cannon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

UNLV is most known for its men's basketball program. Made famous by Coach [[Jerry Tarkanian]] in the 1970s&amp;ndash;1990s, the Runnin' Rebels are the third most winning team in Division I basketball history by percentage, only behind Kentucky and North Carolina.(.713, 1037-418 through 2008)&lt;ref&gt;http://basketball.about.com/od/recordbook/a/winning-percent.htm&lt;/ref&gt; UNLV is well known for their 1990 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] by defeating [[Duke University]] 103-73, which was and still is the largest margin of victory in a championship game. In that same game, UNLV became the first team to ever break 100 points in a championship game.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Tournament&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unlvrebels.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/102909aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

UNLV is also well known for its golf program. Led by coach Dwaine Knight, the UNLV Golf program has turned out PGA Tour pros such as [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]], [[Chris Riley (golfer)|Chris Riley]], [[Chad Campbell]], [[Ryan Moore (golfer)|Ryan Moore]], [[Skip Kendall]], [[Charlie Hoffman]], [[Bill Lunde]], and [[Andres Gonzales]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pgatour.com/players/02/97/20/ Andres Gonzales PGA Profile&lt;/ref&gt; They won the NCAA National golf team championship in 1998.
In February 2011, the Rebel men's swimming and diving team won their seventh straight Mountain West Conference titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wollard|first=Jeff|title=Expectations still high for UNLV swim team|url=http://www.lvrj.com/sports/expectations-still-high-132224383.html|accessdate=14 November 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three Rebel swimmers competed in the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]]; Joe Bartoch and Richard Hortness represented Canada and Jonas Anderson represented Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevell|first=Shane|title=Back from Beijing: Rebel swimmers compete on the world's biggest sporting stage|url=http://magazine.unlv.edu/Issues/Fall08/12beijing.html|work=UNLV Magazine|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
