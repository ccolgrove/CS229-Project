'''Arab Christians''' are ethnic Arabs of [[Christian]] faith,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm] &quot;First, they are not recognized as distinct ethnic identities, but rather as segments from the wide &quot;Arab nation&quot; who are &quot;of Christian faith.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also including those, who are identified with [[Arab people|Arab]] [[panethnicity]]. They are the remnants of ancient Arab Christian clans or Arabized Christians. Many of the modern Arab Christians are descendants of pre-Islamic Christian Arabian tribes, namely the [[Kahlani]] [[Qahtanite|Qahtani]] tribes of ancient [[Yemen]] (i.e. [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]], [[Banu Judham]] and [[Hamadan]]). During the 5th and 6th centuries the Ghassanids, who adopted Monophosyte Christianity, formed one of the most powerful Arab confederations allied to Christian Byzantium. being a buffer against the pagan tribes of Arabia. The last king of the Lakhmids, Nu'man III, a client of the Sasanian (Iranian) Empire in the late sixth century C.E., also converted to Christianity (in this case, to the Nestorian sect).&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti. ''History of the Arabs''. 6th ed.; Macmillan and St. Martin's Press, 1967, pp. 78-84 (on the Ghassanids and Lakhmids) and pp. 87-108 (on Yemen and the Hijaz).&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=December 2011}}

Arab Christians, forming [[Greek Orthodox]] (including [[Arab Orthodox]]) and [[Latin]] Christian communities, are estimated to be 200,000 in Syria, a hundred thousand in Jordan and an equal number or more among the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]] population and within the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab-Israeli population]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; with a sizeable community in Lebanon, and marginal communities in Iraq and Egypt. Emigrants from Arab Christian communities make up a significant proportion of the Middle Eastern diaspora, with sizeable population concentrations across the [[Americas]], most notably in Chile and the US. Arab Christians term is also generally applied to Arabized [[Melkite]] societies in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the West Bank, who trace their roots to Greek and Aramaic-speaking Byzantine Christians.{{cn|date=November 2011}} Some Arab Christians are a more recent end result of Evangelization. 

Arab Christians are not the only [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christian group in the Middle East]], with significant ''non-Arab'' indigenous Christian communities of ethnic [[Armenian people|Armenians]], [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Greek people|Greeks]] and large ethno-religious Christian groups of Copts, Maronites and Syriacs, who are being argued whether their ethnic identity is Arab or not. Even though sometimes classified as Arab Christians, the largest Middle Eastern Christian groups of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[Maronites]] and [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Copts]] often claim a ''non-Arab'' ethnicity. Significant proportion of the [[Maronites]] claim descent from ancient [[Phoenicians]], while some [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts]] also eschew an Arab identity, preferring an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian one. However, both Maronites and Copts had lost their linguistic differentiation during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period in favor of the Arabic language. 

The [[Syriac Christian]] groups, composed largely of [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people|Chaldo-Assyrians]], form the majority of Christians in [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], south-east [[Turkey]] and north-west [[Iran]]. They are generally defined as ''non-Arab'' ethnic groups, including by the governments of Iraq, Iran and Turkey. Those ethno-religious groups are practicing their own native dialects of [[Syriac]]-[[Aramaic]] language, in addition to sometimes also speaking local Arabic dialects. Despite their ancient pre-Arabic roots and distinct linguo-cultural identities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambriapress.com/abi/9781604975833abi.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Assyro-Chaldeans are sometimes related by Western sources as &quot;Christians of the Arab World&quot; or &quot;Arabic Christians&quot;, creating confusion about their identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf] &quot;In spite of the widespread geographical imaginations of the Middle East as an Arabic and Islamic monolith, supported by Western mass media and some Middle Eastern states high politicians, the Middle East is quite a heterogeneous region. This region comprises numerous ethnic national, religious, linguistic or ethno-religious groups.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Syriac Christians were also related as &quot;Arab Christians&quot; by pan-Arab movements and Arab-Islamic regimes against their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicbible.com/christian/intro_arab_christians.htm] &quot;Arab-Islamic regimes in the region assert that all those Christians who live within the confines of 'Arab borders' are 'Arab'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://conference.osu.eu/globalization/publ/08-bohac.pdf] &quot;Assyrians are an ethnically, linguistically and religiously distinct minority in the Middle Eastern region.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Classic antiquity===
[[Image:Isaac_the_Syrian.jpg|thumb|[[Isaac of Nineveh]] a [[Bahrani people|Bahrani]]  [[bishop]] and [[theologian]], 7th century (ortodox [[icon]]).]]
Arab Christians are [[indigenous people|indigenous]] to the [[Middle East]], with a presence there predating the 7th century [[Islamic]] expansion into the [[Fertile Crescent]]. There were many Arab tribes which adhered to Christianity beginning with the 1st century, including the [[Nabateans]] (who incorporated elements of both Arabs and [[Arameans]]), the [[Ghassanids]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melkite.com/origins.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Lakhmids]]. The latter were of [[Qahtanite|Qahtani]] origin and spoke Yemeni-Arabic as well as Greek, and who protected the south-eastern frontiers of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s in north Arabia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Nabateans were possibly among the first Arab tribes to arrive to Southern Levant in the first millennium BCE. At first, they were converted to Judaism, during the expansion campaigns of the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] at the first and second centuries BCE. However, by the fourth century Nabateans had converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rimon|first=Ofra|title=The Nabateans in the Negev |url=http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/archeology/ExhibitionC_eng.aspx?id=9|publisher=[[Hecht Museum]]|accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Arab invaders, who soon pressed forward into their seats found the remnants of the Nabataeans transformed into [[peasant]]s. Their lands were divided between the new [[Qahtanite]] Arab tribal kingdoms of the [[Byzantine]] vassals the [[Ghassanid]] Arabs and the [[Himyarite]] vassals the [[Kindah]] Arab Kingdom in North Arabia.

The tribes of [[Tayy]], [[Abd Al-Qais]], and [[Taghlib]] are also known to have included many Christians in the pre-Islamic period. The Yemenite city of [[Najran]] was a center of Arabian Christianity, made famous by the persecution by one of the kings of Yemen, Dhu Nawas, who was himself an enthusiastic convert to [[Judaism]]. The leader of the Arabs of Najran during the period of persecution, Al-Harith, was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church as [[St. Aretas]].
Some modern scholars suggest that [[Philip the Arab]] was the first Christian emperor of Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry 1999 37&quot; /&gt; By the 4th century a significant number of Christians occupied the Sinai peninsula, Mesopotamia and Arabia.

The New Testament has a biblical account of Arab conversion to Christianity recorded in the book of Acts. When [[St. Peter]] preaches to the people of Jerusalem, they ask, &quot;And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? [. . .] both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabiansâwe hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.&quot; (Acts 2:8, 11, [[English Standard Version]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemites.org/jerusalem/christianity/2.htm |title=Arab Christians: An Endangered Species |publisher=Jerusalemites.org |date=1999-03-18 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2011}} Arab Christians are thus one of the oldest Christian communities.

The first mention of Christianity in Arabia occurs in the New Testament as the Apostle Paul refers to his journey in Arabia following his conversion (Galatians 1: 15-17). Later, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] discusses a bishop named Beryllus in the see of Bostra, the site of a [[synod]] c. 240 and two [[Councils of Arabia]]. Christians existed in Arab lands from the 3rd century onward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry 1999 37&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Also, there were Christian influences coming from Ethiopia in particular in pre-Islamic times, and some Hijazis (including a cousin of Muhammad's wife Khadijah, according to some sources) adopted this faith, while some Ethiopian Christians may have lived in Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Philip K. Hitti, History of the Arabs, 6th ed. (Macmillan and St. Martin's Press, 1967, pp. 78-84 (on the Ghassanids and Lakhmids) and pp. 87-108 (on Yemen and the Hijaz).&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Islamic conquest===
Throughout many eras of history, Christians have co-existed fairly peacefully with their fellow non-Christian Arab neighbours, principally Muslims and Jews.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Even after the rapid expansion of Islam from the 7th century onwards through the Islamic conquests, many Christians chose not to convert to Islam. Many scholars and intellectuals like [[Edward Said]] believed Christians in the Arab world have made significant contributions to the Arab civilization and still do. Some of the top poets at certain times were Arab Christians, and many Arab Christians were physicians, writers, government officials, and people of literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://thechristianarabs.com&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been many periods of persecution also,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} and Christians were often subject to [[Jizyah]], a discriminatory tax.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} As &quot;[[People of the Book]]&quot;, Christians in the region are accorded certain rights under Islamic law (Shari'ah) to practice their religion, strictly conditioned, however, on paying a tax required from non-Muslims called '[[Jizyah]]' (pronounced Jiz-ya), in form of either cash or goods. The tax was not levied on slaves, women, children, monks, the old, the sick,&lt;ref&gt;Shahid Alam, Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms, Journal of Science and Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seed, Patricia.

The Holy Quran. Medina: King Fahd Holy Qur-an Printing Complex.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, non-Muslim citizens were permitted to practice their faith, to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy, to be entitled to Muslim state's protection from outside aggression, to be exempted from [[military service]] and the ''[[zakat]]'', a form of [[tax]] which is obligatory upon Muslim citizens.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;[[John Esposito|John Louis Esposito]], ''Islam the Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, Jan 15, 1998, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 10, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Abdullah Yusuf (1991).

===In the post-Ottoman era===
Some of the most influential Arab nationalists were [[Arab]] Christians, like [[George Habash]], founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and [[Syrian]] intellectual
[[Constantin Zureiq]]. Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] since 1992. THe suicide bomber [[Jules  Jammal]], a Syrian military officer who blew himself up while ramming a French ship, was also an Arab Christian.

==Arab Christians today==
===Egypt===
Most Egyptian Christians are [[Copts]] and are mainly members of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]]. Although Copts in Egypt speak [[Egyptian Arabic]], many of them do not consider themselves to be ethnically Arabs, but rather descendants of the [[Ancient Egyptians]]. The Copts constitute the largest population of Christians in the [[Middle East]], numbering between 4,000,000 and 19,000,000.&lt;ref name=EgyptCoptNumbers&gt;Official population counts put the number of Copts at around 16â18% of the population, while some Coptic voices claim figures as high as 23%. While some scholars defend the soundness of the official population census (cf. E.J.Chitham, The Coptic Community in Egypt. Spatial and Social Change, Durham 1986), other scholars and international observers assume that the Christian share of Egypt's population is higher than stated by the Egyptian government. Most independent estimates fall in a range between 5% and 20%, for example the BBC {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/subdivisions/coptic_1.shtml|title=Coptic Orthodox Church|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 February 2011}} (&quot;estimates [for the Coptic Orthodox Church] ranged from 6 to 11 million; 6% (official estimate) to 20% (Church estimate)&quot;), the CIA World Factbook {{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html |title=Egypt |author= |date= |work=The World Factbook |publisher=[[CIA]] |accessdate=27 August 2010}} (9%), {{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2386 |title=The Copts and Their Political Implications in Egypt  |author=Khairi Abaza and Mark Nakhla |date=25 October 2005 |work= |publisher=The Washington Institute |accessdate=27 August 2010}} (10-20%), EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (1985), or MacropÃ¦dia (15th ed., Chicago) (up to 20%).  For a projected 83,000,000+ Egyptians in 2009, a range of 5-20% implies a population of 4 to 17 million.&lt;br/&gt;In 2008, [[Pope Shenouda III]] and Bishop Morkos, bishop of [[Shubra]], declared that the number of Copts in Egypt is more than 12 million. In the same year, father Morkos Aziz the prominent priest in Cairo declared that the number of Copts (inside Egypt) exceeds 16&amp;nbsp;million. {{cite web |url=http://www.unitedcopts.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3073&amp;Itemid=71 |title=? |author= |date=29 October 2008 |work= |publisher=United Copts of Great Britain |accessdate=27 August 2010}} and {{cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/08/28/55639.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ©.ÙØª | Ø§ÙØµÙØ­Ø© Ø§ÙØ±Ø¦ÙØ³ÙØ© |accessdate=27 August 2010}} Furthermore, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy {{cite web |url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2386 |title=The Copts and Their Political Implications in Egypt  |author=Khairi Abaza and Mark Nakhla |date=25 October 2005 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=27 August 2010}} EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (1985), and MacropÃ¦dia (15th ed., Chicago) estimate the percentage of Copts in Egypt to be up to 20% of the Egyptian population.&lt;/ref&gt; The liturgical language of the Copts, the [[Coptic language]], is a direct descendant of the [[Ancient Egyptian language]]. [[Coptic language|Coptic]] remains the liturgical language of all Coptic churches inside and outside of Egypt.

It is estimated that a further 1% (approx 810,000) of Egypt's population are Christians but not Copts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIA World Factbook: Egypt|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/eg.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=4 May 2011|quote=Population: 82,079,636 (July 2011 est.)... Muslim (mostly Sunni) 90%, Coptic 9%, other Christian 1%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
If excluding Syriac groups, the Arab Christian community in Iraq is relatively small, and further dwindled due to the Iraq War to just several thousands. Most Arab Christians in Iraq belong traditionally to Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches and are concentrated in major cities such as [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Mosul]].

The vast majority of the 400,000 Christians in Iraq are ethnic [[Assyrians]] (also called Chaldeans and Syriacs), who follow [[Syriac Christian]] churches, most notably the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholic]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guide: Christians in the Middle East|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15239529|accessdate=16 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers of Syriac Churches may also self-identify as Arabs in the pan-ethnic sense.

===Israel===
{{further|[[Christianity in Israel]]}}
Some 122,000 Arab Christians live in [[Israel]] as [[Arab citizens of Israel]]. Some self-identify as Palestinian Arab Christians. Those form an 80% majority of the Christians in Israel, with smaller Christian communities of ethnic Russians, Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, Ukrainians and Assyrians. The majority of Arab Christians in Israel belong to the Greek Orthodox Church, with a sizeable minority belonging to the Greek Catholic (Melkite) and Latin Churches. 

===Jordan===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}
[[Image:John-of-Damascus 01.jpg|thumb|[[John of Damascus]] a Syrian [[monk]] and [[presbyter]], 7th century (Greek [[icon]]).]]
In Jordan, Christians constitute about 7% of the population (about 400,000 people), though the percentage dropped sharply from 18% in the early beginning of the 20th century. This drop is largely due to influx of Muslim Arabs from Hijaz after the First World War, the low birth rates in comparison with Muslims and the large numbers of majorly Muslim Palestinian Arabs (85-90% Muslim), who fled to Jordan after 1948. Nearly 70-75% of Jordanian Christians belong to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The rest are Catholics, with a small minority adhering to Protestantism.

Christians are well integrated in the Jordanian society and have a high level of freedom. Nearly all Christians belong to the middle or upper classes. Moreover, Christians enjoy more economic and social opportunity in the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] than elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa. They have a disproportionately large representation in the Jordanian parliament (10% of the Parliament) and hold important government portfolios, ambassadorial appointments abroad, and positions of high military rank. Jordanian Christians are allowed by the public and private sectors to leave work to attend Divine Liturgy or Mass on Sundays. All Christian religious ceremonies are publicly celebrated.  Christians have established good relations with the royal family and the various Jordanian government officials and they have their own ecclesiastic courts for matters of personal status.

Most native Christians in Jordan identify themselves as [[Arab]], though there are also significant non-Arab [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people|Assyro-Chaldean, Syriac]] and Armenian ethnic groups in the country.

===Lebanon===
The earliest indisputable tradition of [[Christianity in Lebanon]] can be traced back to [[Saint Maron]] in the 4th century, the founder of national and ecclesiastical Maronitism. Saint Maron adopted an ascetic, reclusive life on the banks of the Orontes river near [[Homs]]â[[Syria]] and founded a community of monks who preached the Gospel in the surrounding area. The Saint Maron Monastery was too close to Antioch, making the monks vulnerable to emperor [[Justinian II]]âs persecution. To escape persecution, [[John Maron|Saint John Maron]], the first Maronite patriarch-elect, led his monks into the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanese mountains]]; the Maronite monks finally settled in the [[Kadisha Valley|Qadisha valley]]. During the Muslim conquest, Muslims persecuted the Christians, particularly the Maronites, with the persecution reaching a peak during the Umayyad caliphate. Nevertheless, the influence of the Maronite establishment spread throughout the Lebanese mountains and became a considerable [[Feudalism|feudal]] force{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.   After the Muslim Conquest, the [[Maronite Church]] became isolated and did not reestablish contact with the Church of Rome until the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salibi, Kamal 1988. p. 89&quot;&gt;Salibi, Kamal., A house of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered., University of California Press., Berkeley, 1988. p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kamal Salibi]] some Maronites may have been descended from an Arabian tribe, who immigrated thousands of years ago from the Southern [[Arabian peninsula]]. Salibi maintains &quot;It is very possible that the Maronites, as a community of Arabian origin, were among the last Arabian Christian tribes to arrive in Syria before Islam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salibi, Kamal 1988. p. 89&quot;/&gt; Many Lebanese Christians reject this, however, seeing themselves instead as being of non-Arab origin.

Lebanon holds the largest number of Christians in the Arab world proportionally and falls just behind Egypt in absolute numbers. It is known that Christians made up between 65%-85%{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} of Lebanon's population before the [[Lebanese Civil War]], if not more, and they still form 48%-50%{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} of the population today (if all refugees and immigrants of the Muslim faith are excluded); if one counts the estimated 10-15&amp;nbsp;million strong [[Lebanese diaspora|diaspora]], they form more than the majority of the population. The exact number of Christians is uncertain because no official census has been made in Lebanon since 1932. Lebanese Christians belong mostly to the [[Maronite Church|Maronite Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]], with sizable minorities belonging to the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholics]]. Lebanese Christians are the only Christians in the Middle East with a sizeable political role in the country. The Lebanese president, half of the cabinet, and half of the parliament follow one of the various Lebanese Christian rites.

=== Palestinian Territories ===
{{See also|Palestinian Christians}}
In 2009, about 173,000 [[Palestinian Christian]]s lived under the Palestinian National Authority across the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ngm.nationalgeographic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/06/arab-christians/belt-text |title=Arab Christians â National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state much lower numbers of actual Christian residents, as a result of inreasing immigration of Christians outside of the Palestinian Authority controlled territories. While many Palestinian Arab Christians hold high ranked positions in the Palestinian society, there are also cases of religious persecution by radical Muslim elements. The situation in the West Bank however is considerably better compared with the Gaza strip, where since the Hamas take-over in 2007, the Arab Christian community of several thousand has almost all fled.

Both the founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], [[George Habash]], and the founder if its offshoot the [[DFLP]], [[Nayif Hawatmeh]], were Christians, as is prominent Palestinian activist and former [[Palestinian Authority]] minister [[Hanan Ashrawi]].
Israeli historian [[Benny Morris]] writes that Christian-Muslim relations constitute a divisive element in Palestinian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.il/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Shafa+%27Amr%22+benny+morris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6MXk4hSlRw&amp;sig=yGHZFPlCyprxtMl5QWk6p7qf638&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nvPDTpiXKMXKsgau-_jzCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited,'' [[Benny Morris]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
[[Image:Sednaya Mary.jpg|thumb|right|Mosaic depicting Mary holding an Arabic text, Convent of Our Lady, a Greek Orthodox Church in [[Sednaya]], Syria]]
In Syria, according to the 1960 census, Christians formed just under 15% of the population (about 1.2&amp;nbsp;million people)Due to political reasons, no newer census has been taken since. Current estimates suggest that overall Christians comprise about 10% of the overall population (2,000,000), due to having lower birth rates and higher emigration rates than their Muslim compatriots. The Arab Christians in Syria are [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Greek Catholic]], with some [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].The largest Christian denomination in Syria is the Greek Orthodox church, formerly known as the [[Melkite church]] after the 5-6th centuries Christian split, in which they stayed loyal to [[Constantinople]] (&quot;melek&quot; = king, is the Aramaic denomination for the [[Byzantine Emperor]]). The appellation &quot;Greek&quot; refers to the [[liturgy]] they use, sometimes used to refer to the ancestry and ethnicity of the members, however not all members are of Greek ancestry; in fact the Arabic word used is &quot;Rum&quot;, which means &quot;Byzantines&quot;, or Eastern Romans. Overall, the term is generally used to refer mostly to the Greek liturgy, and the Greek Orthodox denomination in Syria. Arabic is now its main liturgical language. Today, a minority of Syrian Christians hold on to their ethnic [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people|Syriac]] (also called Assyrians or Chaldo-Assyrians) and [[Armenians|Armenian]] origins, with a major influx of Iraqi Christian refugees into these communities.

===North Africa===
There are tiny communities of [[Roman Catholics]] in [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], and [[Morocco]] due to colonial rule - French rule for Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, Spanish rule for Morocco, and Italian rule for Libya. Most Christians in [[North Africa]] are foreign missionaries, immigrant workers, and people of French, Spanish, and Italian colonial descent. These mostly converted during the modern era or under [[France|French]] [[colonialism]].  Arguably, many more North African Christians of Berber or Arab descent live in [[France]] than in North Africa, due to the exodus of the ''[[pieds-noirs]]'' in the 1960s.  [[Charles de Foucauld]] was renowned for his missions in North Africa among Muslims, including African Arabs.

===Diaspora===
Hundreds of thousands of Arab Christians also live in the [[diaspora]], outside of the Middle East. These are residing in such countries as [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Mexico]], the [[United States]] and [[Venezuela]] among them. There are also many Arab Christians in [[Europe]], especially in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] (due to its historical connections with [[Lebanon]] and North Africa), and [[Spain]] (due to its historical connections with northern Morocco), and to a lesser extent in [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Among those, across Europe and the Americas, an estimated 400,000 Arab Christians are living in the [[Palestinian diaspora]].

==Religion==
The Arab Christians largely belong to the [[Greek Orthodox]] or [[Antiochian Orthodox]] Churches, though there are also adherents to other churches: [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]], [[Latin Catholic Church]], and [[Protestant Church]]es.

==Doctrine==
Like Arab Muslims, Arab Christians refer to God as [[Allah]], as an Arabic word for &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=Georgep70&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=1L7sx_pR3_EC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=allah+god+christians+arabic&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=allah%20god%20christians%20arabic&amp;f=false|title=Is the Father of Jesus the God of Muhammad?: understanding the differences between Christianity and Islam|author=Timothy George|publisher=Zondervan|year=2002|ISBN=0310247489, 9780310247487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kayep9&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=K392AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=allah+%22arab+jews%22+arabic&amp;dq=allah+%22arab+jews%22+arabic&amp;cd=7|title=The colors of Jews: racial politics and radical diasporism|author=Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz|edition=Illustrated, annotated|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2007|ISBN=0253219272, 9780253219275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term Allah in Arab Christian churches predates [[Islam]] by several centuries.&lt;ref name=Georgep70/&gt; In more recent times (especially since the mid-19th century), some Arab speaking Christians from the Levant region have been converted from these native, traditional churches to more recent [[Protestant]] ones, most notably [[Baptist]] and [[Methodist]] churches{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. This is mostly due to an influx of [[Western world|Western]], predominantly [[United States|American]] Evangelical, [[missionaries]].

==Genetic Studies==
===Relation of Levantine populations to Phoenicians===
[[Image:Mirjam von Abellin.jpg|thumb|[[Mariam of Abellin]]]]
A study in the genetic marker of the Phoenicians led by [[Pierre Zalloua]], showed that the Phoenician genetic marker was found in 1 out of 17 males in the region surrounding the Mediterranean and Phoenician trading centers such as the [[Levant]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Malta]]. The study focused on the male [[Y-chromosome]] of a sample of 1,330 males from the [[Mediterranean]]. [[Colin Groves]], biological anthropologist of the Australia National University in Canberra says that the study does not suggest that the Phoenicians were restricted to a certain place, but that their [[DNA]] still lingers 3,000 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/89591997.html |title=Photo: Phoenician Blood Endures 3,000 Years, DNA Study Shows |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7700356.stm | work=BBC News | title=DNA legacy of ancient seafarers | date=October 31, 2008 | accessdate=April 25, 2010 | first=Paul | last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lebanon, almost 1 in 3 of Lebanese carry the Phoenician gene in their DNA. This Phoenician signature is distributed equally among different groups (both Christians and Muslims) in Lebanon and that the overall genetic makeup of the Lebanese was found to be similar across various backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7791389.stm | work=BBC News | title=Divided Lebanon's common genes | date=December 20, 2008 | accessdate=April 25, 2010 | first=Natalia | last=Antelava}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phoenician gene in this study refers to [[haplogroup J2]] plus the [[haplotypes]] PCS1+ to PCS6+, however the study also states that the Phoenicians also likely had other [[haplogroups]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Haplogroup J2, in general, and haplotypes PCS1+ through PCS6+ therefore represent lineages that might have been spread by the Phoenicians... We do not suggest that the Phoenicians spread only or predominantly J2 and PCS1+ through PCS6+ lineages. They are likely to have spread many lineages from multiple haplogroups&quot; [http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297(08)00547-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the study found that the J2 (&quot;old levantine haplogroup&quot;) was found in an &quot;unusually high proportion&quot; (about 20-30%) among Levantine people such as the Syrians, Lebanese, and the Palestinians. The ancestor [[Haplogroup J (Y-DNA)|haplogroup J]] is common to about 50% of the Arabic-speaking people of the Southwest Asian portion of the Middle East. A Lebanese Christian who was tested as having the J2 haplogroup stated that &quot;It carries no big meaning,&quot; and added he views himself as &quot;Lebanese, Arab and Christian -- in that order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL0559096520070912?sp=true |title=In Lebanon DNA may yet heal rifts &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date= 10 September 2007|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Lebanese citizen tested stated he would be &quot;very proud&quot; to discover he had Phoenician roots.&quot;I will be more than happy to have Phoenician roots,&quot; said Nabil. Phoenicians started the civilization, they are the ones who invented the alphabet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Phoenicians%20did%20not%20invent%20the%20alphabet%22&amp;f=false &quot;Phoenicians did not invent the alphabet&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; I would be very proud to be a Phoenician,&quot; he adds. Dr [[Pierre Zalloua]] says the project's discovery is a &quot;truly unifying message&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk | work=BBC News | title=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- invisible comment: is this paragraph even necessary, doesn't contribute and obvious --&gt;He explained,&quot;I think it's a truly unifying message, and for me its very gratifying. Lebanon has been hammered by so many divides, and now a piece of heritage has been unravelled in this project which reminds us that maybe we should forget about differences and pay attention to our common heritage,&quot; stated Dr. Pierre Zalloua.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Question of Identity==
Arab Christians include descendants of ancient Arab tribes, who were among the first Christian converts, as well as some recent adherents of Christianity. Sometimes, however the issue of self-identification arises regarding specific Christian communities across the Arab world.

=== Assyrians ===
{{main|Assyrians}}
After the ascend of the nationalist [[Ba'ath party]] in Iraq in [[1963]] Assyrian Christians were referred to as &quot;Arab Christians&quot; by Arab nationalists who deny the existence of a distinct Assyrian identity. In 1972 a law was passed to use [[Syriac language]] in public schools and in media, shortly afterwards however Syriac was banned and Arabic was imposed on Syriac language magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;fred&quot;&gt;[http://www.nineveh.com/IndigenousPeopleinDistress.html Indigenous People in Distress], Fred Aprim&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the 1977 census, Assyrians were being referred to as either Arabs or [[Kurds]]. Christians were forced to deny their identity as [[Assyrian nationalism]] was harshly punished. One example of this &quot;[[Arabization]]&quot; program was Iraqi deputy prime minister, [[Tariq Aziz]], a [[Chaldean Christian]] who changed his surname from Youkhana upon joining the Baath.&lt;ref name=assyrianbar&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=J. L.|title=Iraqi Assyrians: Barometer of Pluralism|journal=Middle East Quarterly|date=Summer 2003|pages=49-57|url=http://www.meforum.org/558/iraqi-assyrians-barometer-of-pluralism|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s those Christians who still referred to themselves as &quot;Assyrians&quot; were exempt from the [[Oil-for-Food program]] and did not receive their monthly food rations.&lt;ref name=&quot;assyrianbar&quot;/&gt; Many Assyrians were expelled from their villages in northern Iraq, others were forced to replaced their names with Arab ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq: Information on treatment of Assyrian and Chaldean Christians|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,IRQ,,3f520de14,0.html|publisher=United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They likewise pointed out that Arab nationalist groups have wrongly included Assyrian-Americans in their head count of Arab Americans, in order to bolster their political clout in Washington.
Some [[Arab American]] groups have imported this denial of Assyrian identity to the United States. In [[2001]], a coalition of Assyrian, Chaldean  and Maronite organizations, wrote to the [[Arab-American Institute]], to reprimand them for claiming that Assyrians were Arabs. The asked the Arab-American Institute &quot;to cease and desist from portraying Assyrians and Maronites of past and present as Arabs, and from speaking on behalf of Assyrians and Maronites.&quot;&lt;ref name=assyrianbar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sFbJCtnpgUsJ:www.aina.org/releases/caamletter.htm Coalition of American Assyrians and Maronites Rebukes Arab American Institute], AINA.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copts ===
{{main|Copts}}
The Copts are the native [[Christianity in Egypt|Egyptian Christians]], a  major [[ethnoreligious group]] in [[Egypt]].
Christianity was the majority religion in [[Roman Egypt]] during the 4th to 6th centuries and until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Muslim conquest]]&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Bill Has Egypt's Copts Squirming&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Ibrahim | first = Youssef M. | title= U.S. Bill Has Egypt's Copts Squirming | work= [[The New York Times]] | date=April 18, 1998 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E5DC103DF931A25757C0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1| accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and remains the faith of a significant minority population.
Their [[Coptic language]] is the direct descendant of the [[Demotic Egyptian]] spoken in the Roman era, but it has been near-extinct and mostly limited to liturgical use since the 18th century. In current times the spoken language of Copts is Arabic.

Copts in Egypt constitute the largest [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christian community in the Middle East]], as well as the largest religious minority in the region, accounting for an estimated 10% of Egyptian population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christian-Muslim Gap&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Cole | first = Ethan| title=Egypt's Christian-Muslim Gap Growing Bigger | publisher= [[The Christian Post]] | date=July 8, 2008 | url = http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080708/egypt-s-christian-muslim-gap-growing-bigger.htm | accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most Copts adhere to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S.Dept of State/Egypt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm|title= Egypt from âU.S. Department of State/Bureau of Near Eastern Affairsâ|date=September 30, 2008 |publisher= [[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCO/Egypt/&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|title=Egypt from âForeign and Commonwealth Officeâ|date=August 15, 2008|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office -UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xrGL7o69KBIC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=coptic+orthodox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0ROIHZ4FFm&amp;sig=DcEAaveJzQsCeS1tQK-liQc54cM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=es46SqsUiP61A9ufrOUK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1|title=Who are the Christians in the Middle East?|date=June 18, 2009|publisher=Betty Jane Bailey | isbn=978-0-8028-1020-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining (around 800,000) are divided between the [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and various [[Protestantism in Egypt|Coptic Protestant]] churches.

As a religious minority, the Copts are subject to  [[Persecution of Copts|significant discrimination]] in modern Egypt, and the target of [[Terrorism in Egypt|attacks]] by militant Islamic extremist groups.

=== Maronites ===
{{see|Maronites}}
At the March 1936 Congress of the Coast and Four Districts, the Muslim leadership at this conference made the declaration that Lebanon was an Arab country, indistinguishable from its Arab neighbors. In the April 1936 Beirut municipal elections, Christian Maronite and Muslim Politicians were divided along Phoenician and Arab lines in concern of whether the Lebanese coast should be claimed by Syria or given to Lebanon, increasing the already mounting tensions between the two communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Christian%20and%20Muslim&amp;f=false |title=Reviving Phoenicia: in search of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese nationalism, which rejects Arab identity, has found a strong support among some Maronites and even other Orthodox Christians. However, this form of nationalism, nicknamed [[Phoenicianism]], never developed into an integrated ideology led by key thinkers, but there are a few who stood out more than others: [[Charles Corm]], [[Michel Chiha]], and [[Said Aql]] in their promotion of Phoenicianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Phoenician%20narrative&amp;f=false |title=Reviving Phoenicia: in search of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In post civil-war Lebanon, since the [[Taif agreement]], politically Phoenicianism, as an alternate to Arabism, has been restricted to a small group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0d1SnaKLQ9QC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Maronites+and+Phoenicianism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WnKO0psjqM&amp;sig=yB1CN6LDofTukRZLO8eZkc22pbA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=okV9S8C0Koay0gTIk5jLBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=restricted%20to%20a%20small%20group&amp;f=false |title=Reviving Phoenicia: in search of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Phoeniciansm is deeply disputed by some scholars, who have on occasion tried to convince these claims are false and to embrace and accept the Arab identity instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=oak3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Said+Aql&amp;ei=X_BzSJffLoHIigHs-s31Bw&amp;sig=ACfU3U1ILWYsistac9QAr9Y4WQoAT_Yutw The Middle East: From Transition to Development By Sami G. Hajjar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemal Salibi, A House of Many Mansions.&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict of ideas of an identity is believed to be one of the main pivotal disputes between the Muslim and Maronite Christian populations of Lebanon and what mainly divides the country from national unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;mountlebanon.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountlebanon.org/theidentityoflebanon.htm |title=The Identity of Lebanon |publisher=Mountlebanon.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;americanchronicle.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/58949 |title=Lebanon: The Arab Village Idiot |publisher=American Chronicle |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's generalized that Muslims focus more on the Arab identity of Lebanese history and culture whereas Christians focus on the pre-arabized &amp; non-Arab spectrum of the Lebanese identity and rather refrain from the Arab specification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountlebanon.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanchronicle.com&lt;/ref&gt;

During a final session of the Lebanese Parliament, a [[Marada]] Maronite MP states his identity as an Arab: &quot;I, the Maronite Christian Lebanese Arab, grandson of Patriarch Estefan Doueihy, declare my pride to be a part of our peopleâs resistance in the South. Can one renounce what guarantees his rights?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2009/12/11/the-vote-of-confidence-debate-final-session/ |title=The vote of confidence debate â final session &amp;#124; Ya Libnan &amp;#124; World News Live from Lebanon |location=LB |publisher=Ya Libnan |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pan-Syrian identity ===
{{main|Arab Orthodox}}
Although the majority of the followers of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Catholic]] Churches in the Levant adhere to Arab nationalism, some  politicians reject [[Arabism]], such as the [[secular]] Greek Orthodox [[Antun Saadeh]], founder of the [[Syrian Social Nationalist Party|SSNP]], who was executed for advocating the abolition of the Lebanese state by the [[Kataeb]] led government in the 1940s. Saadeh rejected [[Arab Nationalism]] (the idea that the speakers of the [[Arabic language]] form a single, unified nation), and argued instead for the creation of the state of [[United Syrian Nation or Natural Syria]] encompassing the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Saadeh rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation, and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He was thus a strong opponent of both Arab nationalism and [[Pan-Islamism]]. He argued that Syria was historically, culturally, and geographically distinct from the rest of the Arab world, which he divided into four parts.  He traced Syrian history as a distinct entity back to the [[Phoenicians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Arameans]], [[Babylonians]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssnp.org/new/library/saadeh/principles/ |title=Ø§ÙÙÙØªØ¨Ø© Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ±ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙÙÙÙØ© Ø§ÙØ§Ø¬ØªÙØ§Ø¹ÙØ© |publisher=Ssnp.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
