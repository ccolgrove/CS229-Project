Her portrayal as Grace in ''Doctor Who'' caused consternation among some of that show's fans because she was the first character to romantically kiss [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], setting a precedent for the more sexually charged nature of the new ''Doctor Who'' series that began in 2005.

A 2004 trip to the United Kingdom was filmed for the 2005 documentary ''Daphne Ashbrook in the UK''. This DVD documentary followed her work with ''Doctor Who'', including her role as Perfection in the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio play ''[[The Next Life]]''.

She was featured in extensive interviews on the ''Doctor Who'' podcast [[Doctor Who: DWO Whocast]] and ''Doctor Who'' podcast [[Doctor Who: Podshock]]. Additionally, she featured in other Doctor Who podcasts

She was notable as being one of only ten actorsâand the only womanâto be credited in both the ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''Doctor Who'' franchises.&lt;ref&gt;http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Daphne_Ashbrook&lt;/ref&gt; until the appearance of [[Nana Visitor]] on [[Torchwood: Miracle Day]] in 2011, 15 years later. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000684/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her past TV work includes Cold Case, CSI, Crossing Jordan, JAG, Murder She Wrote, Judging Amy, the Profiler, Guardian, [[The O.C.]] and Cupid.
