'''Jigdo''' ([[portmanteau]] of &quot;Jigsaw&quot; and &quot;download&quot;) is a [[download]] utility initially designed around the [[Debian]] distribution of [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] that downloads files from several mirrors in order to build an [[disk image|optical disk image]]. Jigdo is [[free software]], released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Currently [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]],&lt;ref name=Ubuntu-JigdoDownloadHowto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/JigdoDownloadHowto |title=Ubuntu Community Documentation JigdoDownloadHowto  |work=Community Documentation |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]],&lt;ref name=fedora-9-available&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f9/en_US/sn-OverView.html#id3103303 |title=Release Highlights#Jigdo |work=Fedora 9 Release Notes |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and [[FreeBSD]],&lt;ref name=FreeBSD Jigdo package&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/net-p2p/jigdo/ |title=ports/net-p2p/jigdo/ |work=FreeBSD Packages |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2010-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also available through Jigdo.

A typical application of Jigdo is with its &lt;code&gt;jigdo-file&lt;/code&gt; utility. A user that wishes to assemble a disk image downloads a relatively small file called ''imagename.jigdo''. The jigdo-file utility invoked with this file as an argument then proceeds to fetch additional files from the Internet: ''imagename.template'' and a series of [[.deb]] files that are listed in the .jigdo file. It then uses the [[mkisofs]] utility to build the ISO image.

Jigdo was implemented in Debian in order to reduce the need to have many CD image [[mirror (computing)|mirror sites]], locations with sufficient disk space and bandwidth to serve numerous 650 MB files (and in more recent times, 4.7 GB files for [[DVD]] images and 25 GB files for [[Blue-ray Disc|BD]] images). Instead, Jigdo files allow mirrors to carry the regular Debian archive, where packages are not grouped together in image files and instead kept separately where they are also accessible through [[apt-get]] and still allow for the making of optical disk images.

A second benefit is that if files on the CD image change, Jigdo only downloads the changed files and assembles a new CD image. In this way upgrading of CD images requires much less downloading.

==Fedora==
Since the release of [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 9 Alpha,&lt;ref name=fedora-9-available/&gt; all future release of Fedora will provide Jigdo as an alternative download method for people without BitTorrent access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/JigdoRelease |title=Features/JigdoRelease |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |publisher=Fedora Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Jigdo versions of Fedora 8 discs are available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fedoraunity.org/news-archives/fedora-8-cd-sets-released |publisher=Fedora Unity |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |title=Fedora 8 CD Sets Released! |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731023126/http://fedoraunity.org/news-archives/fedora-8-cd-sets-released &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as many other variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spins.fedoraunity.org/spins |title=Unity Spins |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |publisher=Fedora Unity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==pyJigdo==
Due to the unmaintained state of the original Jigdo codeâthe GUI client does not support multi-image templates, meaning the command-line tools are requiredâFedora has been developing a Python-based GUI, called pyJigdo.&lt;!-- lists,fedoraunity.org is down right now, but release information should be in http://lists.fedoraunity.org/pipermail/pyjigdo-devel/ somewhere. --&gt;
