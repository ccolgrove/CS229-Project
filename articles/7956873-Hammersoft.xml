The '''Boston College Eagles football''' team is the [[college football|collegiate football]] program of [[Boston College]]. The team is a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], a Division I Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A) [[athletic conference|league]] governed by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Within the ACC, the Eagles are one of six teams in the [[Atlantic_Coast_Conference#Football|Atlantic Division]]. Begun in 1892, Boston College was one of six &quot;Major College&quot; football programs in [[New England]] as designated by NCAA classifications, starting in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;The NCAA classified Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard and Yale as NCAA University Division (Major College) in 1937. Boston College and Holy Cross were added in 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981, and for the remainder of the twentieth century, BC was New England's sole Division I-A program.&lt;ref&gt;In 1980, the [[Ivy League]] schools were reclassified as Division I-AA. Holy Cross followed suit in 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; It has amassed a 601-419-36 record and is 71-30-0 since the turn of the 21st century. In 2007, the Eagles captured the ACC's Atlantic Division Championship and finished the season ranked in the AP Top 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?pollId=1&amp;seasonYear=2007|title=Associated Press 2007 NCAA Football Rankings - Final|accessdate=2008-08-03|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time since 1984. They also achieved a mid-season #2 ranking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankingsindex?seasonYear=2007&amp;weekNumber=9&amp;seasonType=2|title=2007 NCAA Football Rankings - Week 8|accessdate=2008-08-03|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; their highest since being ranked #1 in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/colleges/football/articles/2007/10/15/eagles_still_are_on_rise/|title=Eagles still are on rise|accessdate=2008-08-03|publisher=Boston Globe | date=October 15, 2007 | first1=Mark | last1=Blaudschun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eagles are coached by [[Frank Spaziani]], commonly referred to as &quot;Coach Spaz.&quot;  Before Spaziani, the team was coached by [[Jeff Jagodzinski]], however he was fired on January 7, 2009, after interviewing for the head coaching job with the [[New York Jets]].  Boston College is one of only two [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] universities that field a team in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the other being [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. The Eagles' home games are played at [[Alumni Stadium]] on the Boston College campus in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]]. In addition to success on the gridiron, Boston College football teams are consistently ranked among the nation's best for academic achievement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bceagles.cstv.com/genrel/081307aac.html|title=Duke, BC Lead Academic Honor Roll|accessdate=2008-02-18|publisher=Boston College Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bceagles.cstv.com/genrel/100307aaa.html|title=Eagles Among Nation's Elite in Graduation Success Rate: Football rated third-best in the country; 16 BC teams receive 100% GSR score|accessdate=2008-02-18|publisher=Boston College Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, 2006 and 2007, the football team's [[Academic Progress Rate]] was the highest of any school that finished the season ranked in the [[AP Poll|AP]] or [[Coaches' Poll|ESPN/''USA Today'' Coaches']] polls.

==History==
===Early history===
[[Image:BC1893.gif|left|thumb|300px|Boston College football team, 1893]]
In 1892, Boston College President Edward Ignatius Devitt, [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], grudgingly agreed to the requests of two undergraduates, [[Joseph F. O'Connell]] of the class of 1893 and [[Joseph Drum]] of the class of 1894, to start a [[varsity team|varsity]] football team. Drum would become the first head [[coach (sport)|coach]], albeit an unpaid position and O'Connell was [[captain (sports)|captain]]. On October 26, 1893, BC played its first official game against the St. John's Literary Institute of Cambridge followed by its first intercollegiate game against [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. BC won the first game 4-0, but lost 6-0 to MIT. Some of the original team's alumni had particularly significant careers: captain [[Joseph Drum]] became the first BC graduate to be elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]],  [[Joseph F. O'Connell]] was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and running back James Carlin became president of the [[College of the Holy Cross]].[[Image:BCfootballbanquet1929.jpg|left|thumb|Eastern Champions, 1928]]

===Holy Cross rivalry===
[[Image:BCalumnifield.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Alumni Field, precursor to Alumni Stadium, ca. 1920]]
In 1896, Boston College and Holy Cross began what was to become one of the most storied rivalries in college football.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For much of the early to mid 20th century, BC and The Cross drew some of [[New England]]'s largest sports crowds. In 1913, BC began playing home games at [[Alumni Stadium|Alumni Field]].

To accommodate larger crowds, the Holy Cross game was routinely held at larger venues off campus, with the 1916 matchup taking place at the newly constructed [[Fenway Park]]. A record 54,000 attended the 1922 game at [[Braves Field]], home of the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] baseball team. On November 28, 1942, BC lost in a huge upset to the [[Holy Cross Crusaders]] by a score of 55-12. This led to the BC players not attending their scheduled victory celebration at the [[Cocoanut Grove fire|Cocoanut Grove]] nightclub, which burned down that night. By the late 1970s the Holy Cross game had become more of a tradition than a rivalry, as Holy Cross football had long since ceased being a major power. By 1980, the game was no longer part of the student ticket package, and was mostly attended by alumni. In 1986 Holy Cross changed the direction of its football program, joining the Division 1-AA [[Patriot League]], and terminated the series. BC had won 17 of the last 20 games.

===1940 - &quot;Team of Destiny&quot;===
[[Image:Boston College National Championship 1940.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1940 banner]]
The 1940 season can arguably be called the greatest year in the history of Boston College football. BC's undefeated (11-0) and untied team captured the 1941 [[Sugar Bowl]] championship and earned the nickname &quot;Team of Destiny&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;teamofdestiny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bceagles.cstv.com/genrel/071000aac.html|title=1940 Football 'Team of Destiny' - National Champions |accessdate=2008-02-18|publisher=Boston College Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/ulib/Burns/1940team.html|title=1940 Team of Destiny|date=Fall 2001|accessdate=2008-02-18|publisher=John J. Burns Library |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611135404/http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/ulib/Burns/1940team.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five members of that storied team have been inducted into the National Football Foundationâs College Football Hall of Fame: end Eugene Goodreault (50); guard George Kerr (47); center Chet Gladchuk, Sr. (45); fullback [[Mike Holovak]] (12); and halfback Charles OâRourke (13). It included a 19-18 victory over [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] before 41,700 fans at sold-out Fenway Park, that was called one of the greatest games ever by famed sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]]. Going into the game, the Hoyas had twenty-two consecutive victories spanning three seasons. BC trailed until the third quarter, when a 43 yard touchdown pass from [[Charlie O'Rourke]] to Monk Maznicki put the Eagles ahead. With just seconds remaining, BC had the ball on their own nine, fourth down and 18 to go. Georgetown set up to return the Eaglesâ punt. Instead of punting, OâRourke scrambled in his own end zone for 45 seconds then took a safety. BC used the free kick to boot the ball far downfield and dashed the Hoyas' three-season unbeaten record. Legendary Coach [[Frank Leahy]] took his undefeated Eagles on to the Sugar Bowl in [[New Orleans]] where they beat [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]]. A banner on BC's campus commemorating the team uses the phrase &quot;national champions,&quot; but Boston College was not awarded a national championship by any of the national polls at the time of the 1940 season. Although BC's claim to a title is not recognized by the NCAA or college football historians in general, one website, the [[College Football Data Warehouse]], claims that selectors named Cliff Morgan and Ray Bryne rated BC #1 in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/acc/boston_college/all_national_champs.php&lt;/ref&gt; This web site states that BC's historic 1940 run resulted in a split championship with the University of Minnesota, but it's not clear whether the selectors awarded BC a title at the time of the 1940 season, or if they did so retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_year.php&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA lists only Minnesota as the national champion in 1940, and does not credit BC with any national championships in football.&lt;ref&gt;NCAA list of recognized national champions http://www.ncaa.com/history/football-fbs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Flutie years===
The early 1980s are sometimes referred to as &quot;The Flutie Era&quot;, and are often credited with putting BC football firmly into the big time. Quarterback [[Doug Flutie]] played for Boston College from 1981 to 1984, and won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in his senior year. He gained national attention on November 23, 1984, when he led the Eagles to victory in a high-scoring, back-and-forth game against incumbent national champion [[University of Miami|Miami Hurricanes]] (led by star QB [[Bernie Kosar]]). The game was nationally televised on [[CBS]] the day after [[Thanksgiving]], and had a huge audience. Miami staged a dramatic drive to take the lead, 45-41, in the closing minute of the game. Boston College then took possession at their own 22-yard line with 28 seconds to go. After two passes moved the ball another 30 yards, only six seconds remained on the clock. On the last play of the game, Flutie rolled out right away from the defense and threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] that was caught in the end zone by senior wideout [[Gerard Phelan]], giving BC an insanely miraculous 47-45 win. A persistent [[urban legend]] holds that this play essentially clinched the Heisman Trophy, the award given to the best player in college football that year, for Flutie; in fact, the Heisman voting was already complete by the day of the game. It has been called &quot;the greatest moment in college football.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;greatest&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2002-11-19-memorable-moments_x.htm &quot;College football's best of the last 20 years.&quot;] ''[[USA Today]]''. November 19, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Doug Flutie was honored by Boston College with a statue of his famous â[[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]]â pass to [[Gerard Phelan]] to beat [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/wps/ncaa?ContentID=40940  BC unveils life-sized tribute to Flutie], November 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holy War===
{{main|Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)}}
{{see also|Frank Leahy Memorial Bowl|Ireland Trophy|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries#Boston College}}
In recent years, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] has become one of BC's football rivals. Today, ND is the only other [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] [[university]] playing [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] football. The match up was dubbed the &quot;[[Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)|Holy War]]&quot; in 1975, and has acquired a number of other nicknames over the years. The two teams battle for the [[Frank Leahy Memorial Bowl]] and the [[Ireland Trophy]].

On November 2, 2005, Notre Dame announced that because it had agreed to a request from the [[Big East Conference|Big East]] to play teams from that conference each season, it would suspend the Boston College series following the 2010 season. Big East Commissioner [[Mike Tranghese]] said the conference made the request after Boston College, Miami, and Virginia Tech withdrew from the Big East to join the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. However, on February 6, 2007, BC Director of Athletics [[Gene DeFilippo]] stated &quot;The Notre Dame contract calls for two games in South Bend [sic], in 2007 and 2009, and two games in Boston, in 2008 and 2010. We have been in discussions with Notre Dame concerning additional games, and I am very hopeful that we will be able to announce something in the near future.&quot;

====Memorable moments in the BC-ND rivalry====
{{see also|Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)#Notable moments}}
The series produced one of the top moments in college football history&lt;ref name=&quot;greatest&quot; /&gt; when in 1993, David Gordon kicked a wobbly 41-yard field goal as time expired to beat top-ranked and undefeated Notre Dame 41-39, ending Irish hopes for a national championship. During the 2002 matchup in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Notre Dame came into the game undefeated at 8-0, wearing their celebrated green jerseys (which since 1981 had only been worn against archrival USC or in bowl games). BC won the game 14-7, putting an end â again â to Notre Dame's dreams of an undefeated season. The series was played annually from 1992 to 2004 and from 2007 to present. Boston College and Notre Dame recently agreed to extend the series, with the Eagles hosting the Irish in 2012, 2015 and 2019, and the Eagles traveling to Notre Dame in 2011, 2016 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Boston College, Notre Dame Agree To Extend Rivalry, http://www.bcinterruption.com/2010/6/8/1507767/boston-college-notre-dame-agree-to&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''1992''' - The beginning of the current &quot;Holy War&quot;. In a move he would later regret, ND coach [[Lou Holtz]] called a successful fake punt with a 37-0 lead on the way to running up a 54-7 score. While the game was a blowout in Notre Dame's favor, [[halftime]] brought the filming of the game scenes used in the film ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]''. Watch closely on the sideline and you can see Boston College paraphernalia.
*'''1993''' - A week after Notre Dame's &quot;[[1993 Florida State vs. Notre Dame football game|Game of the Century]]&quot; win over then #1-ranked [[1993 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]], BC dominated for three quarters then fell behind after ND scored three touchdowns in 11 minutes. In the end, BC won on a last second field goal to knock the Irish out of the #1 ranking, a 41-39 loss that would keep ND from winning the national championship.
*'''1998''' - Deke Cooper's tackle on Mike Cloud at the one yard line completed a dramatic goal line stand in the game's closing moments and preserved a 31-26 victory for Notre Dame in Chestnut Hill. Despite a first and goal from the four yard line, Boston College was unable to score in four plays.
*'''2002''' - BC's 14-7 win in Notre Dame, Indiana over the green-jerseyed and previously 8-0 Irish is the first loss for then head coach [[Tyrone Willingham]].
*'''2007''' - BC's 27-14 win not only marked the first 7-0 record for the Eagles since 1942, but also marked the first time either team won five consecutive games in the match up between these teams.
*'''2008''' - BC's 17-0 win was the first time that either team was able to shut out its opponent. BC joins [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] and [[USC Trojans football|USC]] in the ranks of teams that have shut out the Irish under coach [[Charlie Weis]].
*'''2009''' - ND's 20-16 win ended their six game winless streak.  [[Dave Shinskie]] threw for 279 yards, but the Eagles' rally fell short with an interception late in the fourth quarter.[http://www.kfsm.com/sports/sns-200910242319mctnewsservbc-fbc-bostonc-notredam,0,6951810.story McClatchy Tribune News Service]

===Gambling scandal===
Boston College's Cody Williams earned some negative press in 1996 when news broke that some football players had bet against BC in a bad loss on October 26 to [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]]. After the 45-17 beating by the Orangemen, word leaked out to Head Coach [[Dan Henning]] that several players may have bet against the team in the game, and the coach subsequently told the university administration. Following an investigation by the university and law enforcement officials, 13 players would be suspended from the team for the season for placing illegal bets â six permanently from the football program.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} As a result of the scandal and a mediocre 16-19-1 record as coach, Henning resigned at the end of the 1996 season.

===Tom O'Brien era===
In December 1996 BC hired a 1971 [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] graduate and the former [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] offensive coordinator [[Tom O'Brien (football coach)|Tom O'Brien]]. O'Brien arrived at [[Boston College|The Heights]] with plans to revive the program after the team had been tarnished in the wake of the scandal. With good recruiting skills and a strong coaching staff around him, notably offensive coordinator Dana Bible and defensive coordinator [[Frank Spaziani]], O'Brien turned the program into a consistent top-25 team. The team was also helped by increased exposure on the national stage due to the move to the ACC and, later, improved facilities in the form of the [[Yawkey Center]].

Following two mediocre seasons in 1997 (4-7) and 1998 (4-7), O'Brien's vision of a re-built football program began to take shape. In 1999, the Eagles finished the regular season 8-3 including a 31-29 win at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] on November 20. BC had earned itself its first bowl berth since being ensnarled in the 1996 gambling scandal. Despite the excitement of its first postseason game in five years, Boston College laid an egg at the [[Insight.com Bowl]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], getting squashed by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], 62-28. In 2000 BC finished the regular season at 6-5 with just enough wins to be bowl-eligible and found themselves in [[Honolulu]] for the [[Aloha Bowl]] where they downed [[Arizona State]] 31-17, giving O'Brien his first bowl victory as head coach.

The year 2001 saw Boston College end a 21-game losing streak to ranked opponents when, in the [[Music City Bowl]], the Eagles beat No. 16 [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] 20-16 to finish at 8-5. But the most memorable moment of the year came in another thrilling game against then-No. 1 Miami at Alumni Stadium. Trailing 12-7 BC stood at the Hurricanes 9-yard-line, poised to win with just over 20 seconds left in the contest, but an interception thrown by Eagles [[quarterback]] [[Brian St. Pierre]] cost the game. St. Pierre threw too low for receiver Ryan Read, and the pass ricocheted off a Miami defender's leg and fell into the hands of [[defensive back]] [[Ed Reed]], who returned it 80 yards for a touchdown â preserving a win for the Hurricanes and keeping its hopes alive for a national championship, which they would eventually win. Despite the heartbreaking loss, the season had several highs including [[running back]] [[William Green (football player)|William Green]] rushing for 1,559 yards and being the top RB taken in the 2002 [[NFL Draft]]; eight wins for the first time since 1993; and finishing the season ranked (No. 21) for the first time since 1994.

Over the next few years the team posted respectable win-loss records and continued to win bowl games. In 2002, BC went 9-4 and won the [[Motor City Bowl]], in 2003 they were 8-5 with a victory in the [[San Francisco Bowl]] and finished 9-3 in 2004 with a win in the [[Continental Tire Bowl]]. The year 2004 would be the Eagles final campaign in the Big East, and it finished the season in a four-way tie atop the league after losing the home finale to Syracuse (thus costing the Eagles a coverted berth in a [[BCS]] bowl) â a year in which they closed the season ranked No. 21 in both major polls.

===Post-O'Brien===
On December 6, 2006, O'Brien decided to leave the Eagles and replace [[Chuck Amato]] as head coach at [[NC State]]. He was replaced by then [[Green Bay Packers]]' offensive coordinator [[Jeff Jagodzinski]].
{{Clr}}

BC won eight straight postseason bowl games from 2000-2008. BC footballers routinely rank at or near the top in Division 1-A for best graduation rate and were ranked sixth nationally in Student-Athlete GPA for 2004-05. As of June 2005, 20 Boston College football players were on NFL rosters. Among the more notable: [[Marc Colombo]] '02 ([[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]]), [[Doug Flutie]] '85 ([[New England Patriots|Patriots]]), [[William Green (football player)|William Green]] '02 ([[Cleveland Browns|Browns]]), [[Matt Hasselbeck]] '98 ([[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]]), [[Chris Hovan]] '00 ([[Tampa Bay Bucs|Bucs]]), [[Dan Koppen]] '03 ([[New England Patriots|Patriots]]), [[Tom Nalen]] '94 ([[Denver Broncos|Broncos]]), and [[Damien Woody]] '99 ([[Detroit Lions|Lions]]).

[[Mathias Kiwanuka]], BC [[defensive end]] who earned Big East Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2004, was drafted by the [[New York Giants]] in the April [[2006 NFL Draft]]. The Giants are coached by former BC Head Football Coach [[Tom Coughlin]].
[[BJ Raji]] and [[Anthony Castonzo]] were drafted in 2010 and 2011 in the first round.
Boston College was also the college of New York Giants linebacker and cancer survivor [[Mark Herzlich]] who was diagnosed with [[Ewing's Sarcoma]], a form of bone cancer, after his junior year at the school.

It was announced on December 1, 2009, that the Boston College football team, along with 29 other athletic programs on campus, would officially switch its athletic outfitter from [[Reebok]] to [[Under Armour]]. On July 1, 2010, BC became the tenth [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] team to wear uniforms from the Baltimore-based outfitter, joining Auburn, Hawaii, Maryland, North Texas, South Carolina, South Florida, Texas Tech and Utah.&lt;ref&gt;BC Announces Deal With Under Armour: We Must Protect This House?, http://www.bcinterruption.com/2009/12/1/1180865/bc-announces-deal-with-under&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent seasons==
===2004===

In Boston College's final year as a member of the [[Big East Conference]], the Eagles finished the regular season at 8-3 including a 4-2 conference record. The Eagles tied [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] and [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] - all at 4-2 - for a share of the Big East regular season title. Pittsburgh was selected as the conference's BCS representative, heading to the Fiesta Bowl only to lose to Utah 35-7. The Eagles were invited to the [[Continental Tire Bowl]] where they defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]]. BC ended final season in the Big East ranked in the Top 25 of both major polls (No. 21 in the [[USA Today/Coaches' Poll]] and No. 21 in the [[AP Poll]]). Boston College reached the 9 win mark for the second time in three years.

===2005===
Boston College moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in time for the 2005 season and the football team faced a new schedule of opponents. BC football earned its first ACC win at [[2005 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] on September 24 and finished the year at 8-3 including a 5-3 conference record, tied for the Atlantic Division title with [[2005 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]], and the Eagles were invited to the {{Alternate links|2005 MPC Computers Bowl|MPC Computers Bowl|title=MPC Computers Bowl}} where they defeated [[2005 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] on the Broncos' home blue turf. As of the start of the 2010-11 season, BC remains the last team to beat Boise State on the Broncos' home field. BC ended the 2005-06 campaign at No. 17 in the coaches' poll and at No. 18 in the [[Associated Press|AP]] poll. Boston College won nine games for the second straight year and the third time in four years, while the senior class tied the school record for most wins in a four-year period with 35 (1939â42).

The Eagles, under first year coach [[Jeff Jagodzinski]], the Boston College Eagles started their season 8-0, featuring a dramatic last-minute win engineered by QB Matt Ryan against [[2007 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]]. They rose to Number 2, a position not held by a BC football team since the 1940s. [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] upset the Eagles in the 9th week, ending Boston College's hopes of contending for a National Championship. After a second consecutive loss, this time to [[2007 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]], they beat [[2007 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] to clinch a position in the ACC Championship Game. The next week they beat [[2007 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]] for the first time since &quot;[[Hail Flutie]]&quot; in 1984, and sent Miami to their first bowl-ineligible season in 9 years. A loss to Virginia Tech in the {{year event|2007|ACC Championship Game}}, however, dashed Boston College's hopes of its first BCS bowl bid.

Despite their #2 conference ranking, #14 BCS ranking and 10-3 record the Eagles were the 4th overall bowl selection in their conference and were chosen by the {{year event|2007|Champs Sports Bowl}}. Due to loopholes in the ACC bowl selection process the {{year event|2007|Chick-fil-A Bowl}} used its #2 pick to select Clemson, a team BC had beaten on the road. With the third choice the {{year event|2008|Gator Bowl}} selected [[2007 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]]. Both Clemson and Virginia had 9-3 records and only 1 win each over ranked teams to BC's 3 wins (over ranked opponents). This made Boston College and its former conference rival [[2007 Connecticut Huskies football team|Connecticut]] the only bowl-eligible teams in 2007 that received a bowl bid lower than its conference ranking. At one point they were number 1 in the BCS rankings.  ESPN had it wrong they changed it 15 minutes before they lost.

Following the 2008 season star linebacker and NFL prospect Mark Herzlich was diagnosed with [[Ewing's sarcoma]], a rare form of bone cancer. Although the chances of him living were not good, Mark tackled the disease with a positive attitude, and attended every BC game that year. Boston College redshirted him and he was back on the field in for the 2010 season opener, registering five tackles (three solo) in a 38-20 win over Football Championship Subdivision school Weber State.

After learning that their fellow Eagle, Mark Herzlich, had been diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma during the summer before the 2009 season, the Boston College football team started the BC Chapter of [http://upliftingathletes.org/chapters/chapter-bc Uplifting Athletes] in order to raise money for research of the disease.
&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/11106/herzlich-a-highlight-at-bcs-second-lift-for-life&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chapter is led by current president Ryan Lindsey.&lt;ref&gt;http://upliftingathletes.org/chapters/bc-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;
