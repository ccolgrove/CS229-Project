'''Bootsplash''' is a term for a graphical representation of the [[Booting|boot process]] of the [[operating system]].

Bootsplash can be a simple visualisation of the scrolling boot messages in the [[Computer console|console]], but it can also present graphics or some combinations of both.

Unlike [[splash screen]]s, bootsplash is not necessarily designed for marketing purposes, but can be to enhance the experience of the user as [[eye candy]], or provide the user with messages (with an added advantage of color coding facility) to diagnose the state of the system.

==Windows boot screen==
All versions of Microsoft Windows feature a boot screen, which is loaded during the startup process. With extra, third-party utilities, it is possible to replace the default Windows boot screen with custom images, text, and/or animations. In Windows Vista, it is also possible to replace the default boot screen with the alternative &quot;Aurora&quot; boot screen (which does not feature graphical animation)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winvistatips.com/secret-vista-boot-screen-a33.php HowTo - Enable Vista's hidden &quot;Aurora&quot; bootscreen]&lt;/ref&gt; or a scrolling text information about files being loaded.&lt;br /&gt;
In Windows 7, the change of the boot screen, although possible through third-party utilities, is extremely risky and may cause the system to be unable to boot. Also the hidden &quot;Aurora&quot; bootscreen was removed.
