'''Windows Photo Viewer''' is an [[image viewer]] developed by [[Microsoft]] that is included with [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WPV&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been reinstated in Windows 7. This program succeeds [[Imaging for Windows]].

Windows Photo Viewer can show pictures, display all pictures in a folder as a [[slide show]], reorient them in in 90Â° increments, print them either directly or via an online print service, send them in e-mail or [[Optical disc authoring|burn]] them to a disc.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPV&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/pl-PL/w7itpromedia/thread/bc88984a-df40-4fc6-b353-0c6f34c8fc59 |title=Windows Photo Viewer slideshow turns secondary monitor black |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |work=[[Microsoft TechNet]] Forums |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=04:47 AM |url=http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/27314-windows-photo-viewer-slide-show-secondary-monitor.html |title=How to Run the Windows Photo Viewer Slide Show on a Secondary Monitor |work = WindowsSevenForums Tutorials |publisher = Designer Media Ltd |date=2 October 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Photo Viewer supports images in [[BMP file format|BMP]], [[JPEG]], [[JPEG XR]] (formerly HD Photo), [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[ICO (file format)|ICO]] and [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]] file formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft&quot;&gt;[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-picture-file-types Understanding Picture File Types]&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared to its previous version (Windows Fax and Picture Viewer), there have been several changes. The first and most noticeable change is seen in their user graphical user interfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;WPFW&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/image_toolbar.mspx?mfr=true
  |title = Standard toolbar overview
  |work = Windows XP Professional Product Documentation
  |publisher = Microsoft Corporation
  |accessdate = 23 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second change is their file format support: Although [[Animated GIF]] files were supported in Windows Picture and Fax Viewer, they are no longer supported in Windows Photo Viewer. Starting with Windows Vista, Microsoft withdrew the support for this format from this application and left the job of displaying them to Internet Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Picture and Fax Viewer was also capable of viewing multi-page TIFF files, (except those that employed JPEG compression)&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329270 You Cannot View TIFF Images Using Windows Picture and Fax Viewer]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as annotating the TIFF files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Photo Viewer, on the other hand, has added support for JPEG XR file format&lt;ref name=&quot;ft&quot; /&gt; and [[ICC profile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydigitallife.info/2010/01/24/delete-calibrated-display-profile-to-increase-speed-of-windows-7-photo-viewer/ |title=Delete Calibrated Display Profile to Increase Speed of Windows 7 Photo Viewer |work = My Digital Life |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/07/11/windows-vista-photo-gallery-yellow-tint-background-problem/ |title=Windows Vista Photo Gallery Yellow Tint Background Problem |work = My Digital Life |date=11 July 2007 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Windows Photo Gallery is not included in Windows 7, it did affect Windows Photo Viewer: Whereas Windows Picture and Fax Viewer used [[GDI+]], Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Photo Gallery both use [[Windows Imaging Component]] (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee719885(v=vs.85).aspx |title=Introduction (How to Write a WIC-Enabled Codec) (Windows) |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |work=[[Microsoft Developer Network]] |date=22 November 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both take advantage of [[Windows Display Driver Model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480220.aspx#winvistadisplaydrivermodel_topic1 |title=Windows Vista Display Driver Model |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |work=Microsoft Developer Network |year=2006 |month=July |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
The user interface includes buttons to rotate counterclockwise and clockwise (keyboard shortcuts ctrl+, and ctrl+. respectively).  Clicking these buttons overwrites the image file without warning and without an option to &quot;undo&quot; the action.  If performed on a device-dependent image file (e.g., an image file on the SD card from a digital camera), the new file will not necessarily be readable by the device (e.g., through the lack of an embedded thumbnail).

On some systems, scroll bars are not visible at all or, if a zoom operation is performed (e.g., using a mouse wheel), no subsequent scroll down or up is possible.
