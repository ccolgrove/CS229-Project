The '''Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers''' ('''ICANN''', {{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|aÉª|k|Ã¦|n}} {{respell|EYE|kan}}) is a [[non-profit]] [[corporation]] headquartered in [[Marina del Rey, California]], [[United States]], that was created&lt;!--this term is misleading at best, in light of the next phrase--&gt; on September 18, 1998, and incorporated on September 30, 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;kepler.ss.ca.gov&quot;&gt;California Secretary of State, [http://kepler.ss.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C2121683 Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers].  Accessed 2009.09.18.&lt;/ref&gt; to oversee a number of [[Internet]]-related tasks previously performed directly on behalf of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] by other organizations, notably the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) which ICANN now operates.

ICANN is responsible for the coordination of the global Internet's systems of unique identifiers and, in particular, ensuring its stable and secure operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/general/archive-bylaws/bylaws-18mar11-en.htm|title=ICANN Bylaws|18 March 2011|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work includes coordination of the [[Internet Protocol]] address spaces ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) and assignment of address blocks to [[Regional Internet Registry|regional Internet registries]], for maintaining registries of Internet protocol identifiers, and for the management of the [[top-level domain name]] space ([[DNS root zone]]), which includes the operation of [[root nameserver]]s. Most visibly, much of its work has concerned the DNS policy development for internationalization of the DNS system and introduction of new generic top-level domains (TLDs).  The actual technical maintenance work of maintenance of the central Internet address pools and DNS root registries ICANN performs pursuant to the &quot;[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function&quot; contract.

ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational stability of the Internet; to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and to develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up, consensus-based processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/general/icann-mou-25nov98.htm|title=Memorandum of understanding between the U.S. Department of Commerce and Internet Corporation for assigned names and numbers |date=25 November 98|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2006, ICANN signed a new agreement with the [[United States Department of Commerce]] (DOC) that moves the private organization towards full management of the Internet's system of centrally coordinated identifiers through the multi-stakeholder model of consultation that ICANN represents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/agreements/jpa/ICANNJPA_09292006.htm ICANN-DOC JPA 09-29-2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the establishment of ICANN, the [[Government of the United States]] controlled the domain name system of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Brito, Jerry. &quot;[http://techland.time.com/2011/03/05/icann-vs-the-world/ ICANN vs. the World].&quot; ''[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]''. March 5, 2011. Retrieved on March 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original mandate for ICANN came from the United States government, spanning the presidential administrations of both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]].  On January 30, 1998, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA), an agency of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], issued for comment, &quot;A Proposal to Improve the Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses.&quot; The proposed rule making, or &quot;[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/domainname/domainname130.htm Green Paper]&quot;, was published in the Federal Register on February 20, 1998, providing opportunity for public comment. NTIA received more than 650 comments as of March 23, 1998, when the comment period closed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The Green Paper proposed certain actions designed to privatize the management of Internet names and addresses in a manner that allows for the development of robust competition and facilitates global participation in Internet management. The Green Paper proposed for discussion a variety of issues relating to [[Domain name system|DNS]] management including private sector creation of a new not-for-profit corporation (the &quot;new corporation&quot;) managed by a globally and functionally representative Board of Directors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  ICANN was formed in response to this policy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function currently exists under an agreement with the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

ICANN was incorporated in California on September 30, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;kepler.ss.ca.gov&quot;/&gt;  It is qualified to do business in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, [http://mblr.dc.gov/corp/lookup/status.asp?id=259200 Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]. Accessed 2009.09.18.&lt;/ref&gt; ICANN was established in California due to the presence of [[Jon Postel]], who was a founder of ICANN and was set to be its first [[Chief Technology Officer|CTO]] prior to his unexpected death. ICANN remains in the same building where he worked, which is home to an office of the [[Information Sciences Institute]] at the [[University of Southern California]].

On July 26, 2006, the United States government renewed the contract with ICANN for performance of the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] function for an additional one to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=United States cedes control of the Internet - but what now? | date=July 27, 2006 | publisher=The Register | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/27/ntia_icann_meeting/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context of ICANN's relationship with the U.S. government was clarified on September 29, 2006 when ICANN signed a new [[Memorandum of Understanding]] with the [[United States Department of Commerce]] (DOC).

In July 2008, the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] reiterated an earlier statement&lt;ref name=&quot;2005-07-us&quot; /&gt; that it has &quot;no plans to transition management of the authoritative [[root zone file]] to ICANN&quot;. The letter also stresses the separate roles of the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] and [[VeriSign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=2008-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
At present, ICANN is formally organized as a non-profit corporation &quot;for charitable and public purposes&quot; under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law. It is managed by a 16 member Board of Directors, which is composed of eight members selected by a Nominating Committee on which all the constituencies of ICANN are represented; six representatives of its Supporting Organizations, sub-groups that deal with specific sections of the policies under ICANN's purview; an At-Large seat filled by an At-Large Organization; and the President / CEO, appointed by the Board. [http://www.icann.org/en/general/bylaws.htm#VI]

There are currently three Supporting Organizations. The [[Generic Names Supporting Organization]] (GNSO) deals with policy making on [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). The [[Country Code Names Supporting Organization]] (ccNSO) deals with policy making on [[country-code top-level domain]]s (ccTLDs). The [[Address Supporting Organization]] (ASO) deals with policy making on IP addresses.

ICANN also relies on some advisory committees to receive advice on the interests and needs of stakeholders that do not directly participate in the Supporting Organizations. These include the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which is composed of representatives of a large number of national governments from all over the world; the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC) which is composed of representatives of organizations of individual Internet users from around the world; the Root Server System Advisory Committee which provides advice on the operation of the DNS root server system; the Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) which is composed of Internet experts who study security issues pertaining to ICANN's mandate; and the Technical Liaison Group (TLG) which is composed of representatives of other international technical organizations that focus, at least in part, on the Internet.

===Democratic input===
In the [[Memorandum of Understanding]] that set up the relationship between ICANN and the U.S. government, ICANN was given a mandate requiring that it operate &quot;in a bottom up, consensus driven, democratic manner.&quot; However, the attempts that ICANN have made to set up an [[organizational structure]] that would allow wide input from the global Internet community did not produce results amenable to the current Board. As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;ICANN decided to reduce direct public (&quot;at large&quot;) participation on March 14, 2002, at a public meeting in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]].&lt;/ref&gt;

ICANN holds periodic public meetings rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Critics{{Who|date=February 2011}} argue that these public meetings are often held in countries with lower Internet usage and far away from locations that the majority of the Internet-using public can afford to reach.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This makes public input or participation from traditional Internet users less likely. Supporters{{Who|date=February 2011}} reply that ICANN has a worldwide presence, and a key part of its mission is to build Internet use where it is weak. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time.  However there are criticisms from ICANN constituencies including the [[Noncommercial Users Constituency]] (NCUC) and the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC) that there is not enough [[Freedom of information legislation|public disclosure]] and that too many discussions and decisions take place out of sight of the public.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In the early 2000s, there had been speculation that the [[United Nations]] might signal a takeover of ICANN,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=U.N. Summit to Focus on Internet | date=December 5, 2003 | publisher=Washington Post | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A36852-2003Dec4?language=printer}}
&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a negative reaction from the US government&lt;ref name=&quot;2005-07-us&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title=Bush administration annexes Internet | date=July 1, 2005 | publisher=The Register| url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/01/bush_net_policy/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worries about a division of the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Power grab could split the net | date=October 3, 2005 | publisher=CNET | url=http://news.com.com/2010-1071_3-5886556.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in [[Tunisia]] in November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to set up an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet.  ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently set up to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;icann_gac&quot;&gt;[http://gac.icann.org/about-gac/ ICANN Government Advisory Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued{{By whom|date=February 2011}} that ICANN was never given the authority to decide [[policy]], e.g., choose new TLDs or shut out other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's  US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{Who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come-first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

A member of the European Parliament, [[William Newton-Dunn]], has recently been addressing questions to the European Commission which asks whether ICANN is engaging in restraint of European free trade laws by imposing restrictions on who can operate a TLD and sell domain names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=CRE&amp;reference=20070315&amp;secondRef=ANN-01&amp;language=EN&amp;detail=H-2007-0126&amp;query=QUESTION  Question no 78 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0126/07 ) Subject: ICANN's levy from price increases imposed on Europeans ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some restrictions are considered insurmountable by many small business owners and individuals, such as the perhaps partially refundable $185,000 application fee.

==Activities==
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
One task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, a domain registrant must agree to be bound by the UDRP â they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.

A look at the UDRP decision patterns has led some&lt;ref&gt;Hannibal Travis, The Battle for Mindshare: the Emerging Consensus that the First Amendment Protects Corporate Criticism and Parody on the Internet, 10 Virginia Journal of Law and Technology 3, 32-34 (2005), [http://www.vjolt.net/vol10/issue1/v10i1_a3-Travis.pdf Vjolt.net]&lt;/ref&gt; to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the First Amendment and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.

==Notable events==
On March 18, 2002, publicly elected At-Large Representative for North America board member [[Karl Auerbach]] sued ICANN in Superior Court in [[California]] to gain access to ICANN's accounting records without restriction.  Auerbach won.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.eff.org/Infrastructure/DNS_control/ICANN_IANA_IAHC/Auerbach_v_ICANN/20020729_eff_icann_pr.html EFF.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September and October 2003, ICANN played a crucial role in the conflict over [[VeriSign]]'s &quot;wild card&quot; DNS service [[Site Finder]]. After an open letter from ICANN issuing an ultimatum to VeriSign, later supported by the [[Internet Architecture Board|IAB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company voluntarily shut down the service on October 4, 2003. Following this action, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN on February 27, 2004, claiming that ICANN had overstepped its authority. In this lawsuit, VeriSign sought to reduce ambiguity about ICANN's authority. The antitrust component of VeriSign's claim was dismissed in August 2004.  VeriSign's broader challenge that ICANN overstepped its contractual rights is currently outstanding. A proposed settlement already approved by ICANN's board would resolve VeriSign's challenge to ICANN in exchange for the right to increase pricing on .com domains. At the meeting of ICANN in [[Rome]] which took place from March 2 to March 6, 2004, ICANN agreed to ask approval of the [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]] for the [[Waiting List Service]] of VeriSign.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On May 17, 2004, ICANN published a proposed budget for the year 2004-05. It included proposals to increase the openness and professionalism of its operations, and greatly increased its proposed spending from US $8.27 million to $15.83 million. The increase was to be funded by the introduction of new [[top-level domain]]s, charges to [[Domain name registry|domain registries]], and a fee for some domain name registrations, renewals and transfers (initially USD 0.20 for all domains within a country-code top-level domain, and USD 0.25 for all others).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The [[Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries]] (CENTR), which represents the [[Internet registry|Internet registries]] of 39 countries, rejected the increase, accusing ICANN of a lack of financial prudence and criticizing what it describes as ICANN's &quot;''unrealistic political and operational targets''&quot;. Despite the criticism, the registry agreement for the top-level domains &lt;tt&gt;jobs&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;travel&lt;/tt&gt; includes a US $2 fee on every domain the licensed companies sell or renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After a second round of negotiations in 2004, the TLDs &lt;tt&gt;[[.eu|eu]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.asia|asia]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.travel|travel]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.jobs|jobs]]&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;[[.mobi|mobi]]&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;[[.cat|cat]]&lt;/tt&gt; were introduced in 2005.

On February 28, 2006, ICANN's board approved a settlement with VeriSign in the lawsuit resulting from SiteFinder that involved allowing VeriSign (the registry) to raise its registration fees by up to 7% a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/announcements/announcement-28feb06.htm ICANN announcement] retrieved November 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This was criticised by some people in the [[US House of Representatives]]' [[United States Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship|Small Business committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/Domain+name+price+hikes+come+under+fire/2100-1030_3-6081336.html?tag=nefd.top CNET: Domain name price hikes come under fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, ICANN began the steps to remove accreditation of one of their registrars, [[RegisterFly]] amid charges and lawsuits involving fraud, and criticism of ICANN's handling of the situation. ICANN has been the subject of criticism as a result of its handling of RegisterFly, and the harm caused to thousands of clients due to what has been called ICANN's ''&quot;laissez faire attitude toward customer allegations of fraud''&quot;.&lt;ref name=TheRegisterICANNCriticism1&gt;The Register, Burke Hansen [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/03/icann_registerfly_domain/ Of ICANN and the Registerfly meltdown], March 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2008, ICANN issued  Enforcement Notices against 10 Accredited Registrars and announced this through a press release entitled: &quot;Worst Spam Offenders&quot; Notified by ICANN, Compliance system working to correct Whois and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-23may08-en.htm ICANN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely in response to a report issued by [[KnujOn]] called The 10 Worst Registrars in terms of spam advertised junk product sites and compliance failure.&lt;ref name=knujon&gt;[http://www.knujon.com/registrars/#may08RegistrarReport Knujon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The mention of the word [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] in the title of the ICANN memo is somewhat misleading since ICANN does not address issues of spam or email abuse. Website content and usage are not within ICANN's mandate. However the [[KnujOn]] Report details how various registrars have not complied with their contractual obligations under the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/ra-agreement-17may01.htm ICANN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of the KnujOn research was to demonstrate the relationships between compliance failure, illicit product traffic, and spam. The report demonstrated that out of 900 ICANN accredited Registrars fewer than 20 held 90% of the web domains advertised in spam. These same Registrars were also most frequently cited by KnujOn as failing to resolve complaints made through the Whois Data Problem Reporting System (WDPRS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdprs.internic.net/ WDPRS.internic.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 Registrars cited were [[Xin Net]], [[Beijing Networks]], [[Todaynic]], [[Joker (domain registrar)|Joker]], [[eNom]], [[Monkier]], [[Dynamic Dolphin]], [[The Nameit Co]], [[Directi]], and [[Intercosmos (domain registrar)|Intercosmos]].&lt;ref name=knujon/&gt;

On June 26, 2008, the ICANN Board started a [[Generic top-level domain#New top-level domains|new process of TLD naming policy]] to take a ''&quot;significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.&quot;'' This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well a new application and implementation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On October 1, 2008, ICANN issued Breach Notices against Joker and Beijing Innovative Linkage Technology Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-01oct08-en.htm ICANN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; after further researching reports and complaints issued by [[KnujOn]]. These notices gave the Registrars 15 days to fix their Whois investigation efforts.

In 2010, ICANN approved a major review of its policies with respect to accountability, transparency, and public participation by the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-10aug10-en.htm ICANN Approves Contract with Berkman Center, 10 August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  This external review was in support of the work of ICANN's Accountability and Transparency Review team.&lt;ref&gt;[https://community.icann.org/display/atrt/The+Accountability+and+Transparency+Review+Team;jsessionid=20B32EA76A0A674F629A8D72132CBF19 The Accountability and Transparency Review Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 3, 2011, ICANN announced that it had distributed the last batch of its remaining IPv4 addresses to the worldâs five Regional Internet Registries, the organizations that manage IP addresses in different regions. These Registries will begin assigning the final IPv4 addresses within their regions until they run out completely, which could come as soon as early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icann.org/en/news/releases/release-03feb11-en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2011 the ICANN board voted to end most restrictions on the names of [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLD).&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA&quot;&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/news/science-technology/New-Internet-Name-Rule-Opens-Door-to-Huge-Changes-124180874.html New Internet Name Rule Opens Door to Huge Changes.] [[Voice of America]], June 20, 2011.
