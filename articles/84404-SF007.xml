'''Xenix''' is a version of the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], licensed to [[Microsoft]] from [[AT&amp;T]] in the late 1970s. The [[Santa Cruz Operation]] (SCO) later acquired exclusive rights to the software, and eventually superseded it with SCO UNIX (now known as [[SCO OpenServer]]).

==History==
Xenix was Microsoft's version of Unix intended for use on microcomputers; because Microsoft was not able to license the &quot;UNIX&quot; name itself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/unix/xenix.htm|title=Xenix variant information|date=2010-02-26|quote=In the late 1970's Microsoft licensed Unix source code from AT&amp;T, which at the time was not licensing the name Unix.}}&lt;/ref&gt; they gave it an original name.

Microsoft purchased a license for [[Version 7 Unix]] from AT&amp;T in 1979, and announced on August 25, 1980 that it would make it available for the then-current [[16-bit]] microcomputer market. The initial [[Porting|port]] of Xenix was to the [[Zilog Z8000]] series and subsequently to the [[x86|Intel 8086/8088 architecture]] ported by The Santa Cruz Operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = John Bruno | last = Hare | authorlink = Internet Sacred Text Archive | coauthors = Thomas Dean Thomas | title = Porting Xenix to the Unmapped 8086 | booktitle = Proceedings of the USENIX Winter Conference | pages = | publisher = USENIX Association| date = 1984 | location = Washington, D.C. | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SCO Company History | publisher = Operating System Documentation Project | date = | url = http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/fa-sco.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bader | first = William | authorlink = | title = SCO History | publisher = | date = | url = http://williambader.com/museum/dell/xenixhistory.html | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Demblon | first = Simone | authorlink = | title = Linux Internals | publisher = The Shuttleworth Foundation | date = | url = http://learnlinux.tsf.org.za/courses/build/internals/ch01s02.html | accessdate = 2008-05-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080203073225/http://learnlinux.tsf.org.za/courses/build/internals/ch01s02.html |archivedate = 2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Barger | first = Jorn | authorlink = Jorn Barger | title = Timeline of GNU/Linux and Unix | publisher = | date = | url = http://laurel.datsi.fi.upm.es/~ssoo/IG/download/timeline.html | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenix varied from its 7th Edition origins by incorporating elements from [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], and soon (for a time) possessed the most widely installed base of any Unix flavor due to the popularity of the inexpensive [[x86]] processor.

Microsoft did not sell Xenix directly to end users; instead, they licensed it to software [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]] such as Intel, [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]], Altos and SCO, who then [[Porting|ported]] it to their own proprietary [[computer architecture]]s. Microsoft Xenix originally ran on the [[PDP-11]]; the first [[Porting|port]] was for the [[Zilog]] [[Z8001]] 16-bit [[Central processing unit|processor]]. [[Acer (company)|Altos]] shipped a version for their [[Intel 8086]] based computers early in 1982, Tandy Corporation shipped '''TRS-XENIX''' for their [[Motorola 68000|68000]]-based systems in January 1983, and SCO released their port to the [[IBM PC]] in September 1983.
[[Image:Ms xenix.png|thumb|250px|right|IBM/Microsoft Xenix 1.00 on 5Â¼-inch [[floppy disk]]]]
A port to the 68000-based [[Apple Lisa]] also existed. At the time, Xenix was based on AT&amp;T's [[UNIX System III]].

Version 2.0 of Xenix was released in 1985 and was based on [[UNIX System V]]. An update numbered 2.1.1 added support for the [[Intel 80286]] processor. The Sperry PC/IT, an IBM PC AT clone, was advertised as capable of supporting eight users under this version. Subsequent releases improved System V compatibility.

In 1987, [[The Santa Cruz Operation|SCO]] ported Xenix to the [[Intel 80386|386]] processor, a [[32-bit]] chip. Xenix 2.3.1 introduced support for i386, [[SCSI]] and [[TCP/IP]]. SCO's Xenix System V/386 was the first 32-bit operating system available on the market for the x86 CPU Architecture.

When Microsoft entered an agreement with [[International Business Machines|IBM]] to develop [[OS/2]], it lost interest in promoting Xenix. In 1987 Microsoft transferred ownership of Xenix to SCO in an agreement that left Microsoft owning 25% of SCO. When Microsoft eventually lost interest in OS/2 as well, it based its further high-end strategy on [[Windows NT]].

Microsoft continued to use Xenix internally, submitting a patch to support functionality in UNIX to AT&amp;T in 1987, which trickled down to the code base of both Xenix and SCO UNIX. Microsoft is said to have used Xenix on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations and [[VAX]] [[minicomputer]]s extensively within their company as late as 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title = Re: Microsoft Source (fwd) | author = Terry Lambert | date = 2000-11-07 | newsgroup = sol.lists.freebsd.chat | id = 200011062350.QAA25774_usr08.primenet.com@ns.sol.net | url = http://groups.google.com/group/sol.lists.freebsd.chat/msg/96c45193263f1698 | accessdate = 2006-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All internal Microsoft email transport was done on Xenix-based 68000 systems until 1993. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In the late 1980s, Xenix was, according to ''The Design and Implementation of the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.3BSD UNIX]] Operating System'', &quot;probably the most widespread version of the UNIX operating system, according to the number of machines on which it runs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

SCO first released [[SCO UNIX]] as a higher-end product, based on [[UNIX System V#SVR3|System V Release 3]] and offering a number of technical advances over Xenix; Xenix remained in the product line. In the meantime, AT&amp;T and [[Sun Microsystems]] completed the merge of Xenix, BSD, [[SunOS]] and [[System V]] into [[UNIX System V#SVR4|System V Release 4]]. SCO UNIX was still based on SVR3, but had most features of Release 4. The last version of Xenix itself was 2.3.4.

==Trusted Xenix==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
'''Trusted Xenix''' was a variant developed by [[Trusted Information Systems]] which incorporated the [[Bell-La Padula model]] of multilevel security, and had a multilevel secure interface for the [[STU-III]] secure communications device (that is, an STU-III connection would only be made available to applications running at the same privilege level as the key loaded in the STU-III).&lt;ref&gt;
