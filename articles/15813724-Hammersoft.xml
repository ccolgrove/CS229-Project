Licensed to the suburb of [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], it serves the [[Athens, Georgia]] metropolitan area.  It first began broadcasting in [[1978 in radio|1978]] under the [[callsign (radio)|call sign]] '''WLOV-FM'''.  The station is currently owned by [[Cox Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WXKT|title=WXKT Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The station went on the air as WLOV-FM on 1978-12-01, on 1984-10-01 to [[WGPL]], and on 1998-12-01 to WXKT.&lt;ref name=Call&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=51120&amp;Callsign=WXKT |title=WXKT Call Sign History |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, 1998, [[Cumulus Media]] purchased [[WLOV (AM)|WLOV-AM]] and WLOV-FM from P&amp;T Broadcasting for $533,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sec.edgar-online.com/cumulus-media-inc/10-k-annual-report/1999/04/15/section3.aspx|title=Cumulus Media Inc. CMLS Annual Report (10-K)|publisher=[[EDGAR Online]]|date=1998-12-31|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008,  WPUP was sold (along with sister stations [[WGMG]], [[WNGC]], [[WRFC (AM)|WRFC]] and [[WGAU]]) to Cox Radio in Atlanta,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Deals,&quot; ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', January 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/43870/cox-closes-on-athens-cluster|title=Cox Closes On Athens Cluster
|work=allaccess.com|date=2008-08-01|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; who then swapped call signs moving WXKT calls to 103.7 and changing 100.1 FM to the current call sign '''WPUP'''.&lt;ref name=Call/&gt; The two stations began simulcasting the &quot;Bulldog&quot; classic-rock format; WXKT 100.1 had previously been licensed to [[Washington, Georgia|Washington]] and programmed a &quot;Real [[Country music|Country]]&quot; format. 

On September 30, 2009, WPUP dopped the &quot;Bulldog&quot; classic rock format and began stunting as &quot;Obama Government Controlled Radio at 100.1 FM.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/obama-radio-is-the-temporary-stunt-format-at-wpup-fm-athens-ga |title=&quot;Obama Radio&quot; is the temporary stunt format at WPUP-FM, Athens, GA |date=October 1, 2009 |work=Radio-Info.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station identifiers claim (jokingly) that the station has been taken over by the government. The station is intermittently simulcasting the Hawaiian music format of sister station KCCN-FM in Honolulu, playing clips from speeches by President Obama, and playing other music President Obama might enjoy, such as the theme song to Shaft. 

The [[WXKT]] calls remain on 103.7 FM, which changed its city of license to [[Maysville, Georgia]] and now programs a [[talk radio|talk]] format serving the [[Gainesville, Georgia|Gainesville]] market.
