The '''University of Cincinnati''' (commonly referred to as '''UC''', '''Cincinnati''', or '''Cincy''') is a comprehensive [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and a part of the [[University System of Ohio]].

UC was founded in 1819, and has an annual enrollment of over 40,000 students, making it one of the largest universities in the U.S. In the 2010 survey by ''Times Higher Education (UK)'', the university was ranked in the top 100 universities in North America and as one of the top 200 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/north-america.html |title=Top Universities in North America 2010â2011|publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/top-200.html|title=Top 200 â The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2010â11|publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=September 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2012 edition of ''US News and World Report'', the University of Cincinnati was ranked as a Tier One university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings|title=Best Colleges 2011 â National Universities Rankings|publisher=http://www.usnews.com/rankings|date=September 19, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university garners nearly $500 million per annum in research funding, ranking 22nd among public universities in the US.  Numerous programs across the university are nationally ranked, including: aerospace engineering, anthropology, architecture, classics, composition, conducting, cooperative education, criminal justice, design, environmental science, law, medicine, music, musical theater, neurology, opera, otolaryngology, paleontology, pediatrics and pharmacy.

The school offers over 100 bachelor degrees, over 300 degree granting programs, and over 600 total programs of study, ranging from certificates to doctoral and first professional education. With an economic impact of over $3.5 billion per year, it is the largest single employer in [[Greater Cincinnati]]. After extensive renovations through the implementation of the 1989 Master Plan, the university has been recognized by campus planners and architects as one of the most distinguished campus settings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pascale Le Draoulec|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/01/most-beautiful-campus-lifestyle-college_slide.html|title=The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses|publisher=Forbes.com|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?ID=3884|title=University of Cincinnati Master Plan|publisher=UC.edu|date=April 27, 2006|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ratha Tep|url=http://travel.yahoo.com/p-interests-40718209|title=America's Most Beautiful College Campuses|publisher=Travel Magazine|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=October 7,2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pt3 3a.jpg|thumb|left|Original Cincinnati College building, 1874]]

===Cincinnati College===
In 1819, Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio were founded in Cincinnati. Local benefactor Dr. [[Daniel Drake]]
founded and funded the Medical College of Ohio. William Lytle of the [[Lytle family]] donated the land, funded the Cincinnati College and Law College, and served as its first president. The college survived only six years before financial difficulties forced it to close. In 1835, Daniel Drake reestablished the institution, which eventually joined with the [[Cincinnati Law School]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===McMicken University===
In 1858 Charles McMicken died of pneumonia and in his will he allocated $1 million to the City of [[Cincinnati]] to found a university, and after several controversies and delays, the University of Cincinnati was officially chartered by the Ohio legislature in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.uc.edu/liblog/2010/05/13/mcmicken-will-notice-found-in-cincinnati-german-newspaper|title=McMicken Will Notice Found in Cincinnati German Newspaper â LiBLOG |publisher=Libraries.uc.edu|date=May 13, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally known as McMicken University, a month after the college's founding, the university's board of directors changed the institution's name to the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=813|title=University of Cincinnati â Ohio History Central â A product of the Ohio Historical Society|publisher=Ohio History Central|date=July 1, 2005|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move up the hill===
[[File:University of Cincinnati, Ohio c. 1904.jpg|thumb|University of Cincinnati, Ohio, ca. 1904]]
By 1893 the University had outgrown its old home on Clifton Ave. and moved to its current location in the [[CUF, Cincinnati|Heights]] neighborhood, which was formally part [[Burnet Woods]]. As the university continued to grow it merged with the Cincinnati Law School which become the [[University of Cincinnati College of Law]] in 1896 and while the Medical College of Ohio was loosely affiliated with UC from about 1896, it joined with a splinter medical school, Miami Medical College, to form the Ohio-Miami Medical Department of the University of Cincinnati in 1909. As the need for higher education grew, the university also created colleges such as a Teacher's College in 1905 and a Graduate School in the College of Arts and Sciences in 1906. In 1962 the [[University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music|Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music]] joined the university as well. UC became a &quot;municipally-sponsored, state-affiliated&quot; institution in 1968. During this time, UC was the second oldest and second-largest municipal university in the country. It became one of Ohio's [[state universities]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=813|title=University of Cincinnati History |publisher=Libraries.uc.edu|date=June 19, 2011|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus Master Plan and UC|21===
In 1989 university president [[Joseph A. Steger]] and Hargreaves Associates unveiled a Master Plan for the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://carlsterner.com/files/research/Main_Street_and_the_Urban_Campus.pdf carlsterner.com (PDF)]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over this time the university invested nearly $2 billion in campus construction, renovation, and expansion ranging from the student union to a new recreation center to the medical school. This has been amended in both 2000 and 2005 but has helped create one of the most beautiful university campuses in the world. [[File:UC MainStreet.jpg|thumb|left|MainStreet looking past the Steger Student Life Center towards the student union and McMicken Hall]]It included renovation and construction of multiple buildings, adding dozens of acres of green-space to the campus, and adding MainStreet, which is a central path through campus highlighting all of the most frequented buildings on campus. After becoming president of the university in 2005, [[Nancy L. Zimpher]] implemented a plan named UC|21. This was designed to help redefine UC as the &quot;new urban research university&quot; for the 21st century. This included putting students at the center, increasing research funding, expanded involvement in the surrounding city, and making UC the &quot;premier&quot; urban research university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uc.edu/president25/uc21/ataglance.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===UC2019===
As the university approaches its [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] and after Dr. Zimpher left in 2009, [[Gregory H. Williams]] was named the 27th president of the University of Cincinnati. He has begun an aggressive plan to increase outside validation of the university. The plan was designed to catapult UC into its bicentennial and continue increasing academic profile and the size and academic quality of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/president/media/StrategicPlan_2010.pdf |title=2010 Strategic Plan for UC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He and Provost [[Santa J. Ono]] are focusing on the academic master plan for the university, placing the academic programs of UC at the core of the strategic plan.  They have invested in scholarships, funding for study abroad experiences, the university's highly regarded Honors Program and the advising program. Additionally, the university has begun work on an academic master plan slated for completion in fall of 2011 that will outline the next generation of programs at UC.

==Campuses==
===Uptown campus===
The Uptown campus includes the West (main), Medical, and Victory Parkway campuses.[[File:Outside 040-edit.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to main campus at UC]]
*West (main) Campus:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common/docs/maps/campus_map_west.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This campus includes 62 buildings on {{convert|137|acre|km2}}. The university moved to this location in 1893. Most of the undergraduate colleges at the university are located on main campus. The exceptions are part of the [[University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center]] on the Medical campus. In spring of 2010 the University of Cincinnati was honored by being one of only 13 colleges and universities named by [[Forbes]] as one of &quot;The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pascale Le Draoulec|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/08/31/beautiful-campuses-lifestyle-education-colleges-10-university-architecture_slide_12.html|title=The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses|publisher=Forbes.com|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Medical Campus:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/common/docs/maps/campus_map_medical.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; this campus contains nineteen buildings on {{convert|57|acre|m2}}. It is caddy corner to West campus on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. The undergraduate colleges of Allied Health Sciences and Nursing and graduate colleges of Medicine and the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy are located there. The hospitals located there include University Hospital, [[Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center]], Cincinnati VA Medical Center, and the Shriners Hospital for Children.
*Victory Parkway Campus: this campus was formally home to the [[University of Cincinnati College of Applied Science|College of Applied Science]]. It is roughly {{convert|3|mi|km}} from main campus in the [[Walnut Hills]] neighborhood of Cincinnati and overlooks the [[Ohio River]]. When it merged with the College of Engineering to become the College of Engineering and Applied Science many of the classes were moved to main campus, however limited courses are still taught there. There is a shuttle that runs between this and main campus throughout the day.

===Branch campuses===

[[File:Engineering Research Center.jpg|thumb|The Engineering Research Center, designed by UC Alumnus [[Michael Graves]], was designed to look like a 4-cylinder engine.]]
The university has had a strategic plan for the last decade for new architecture to be built by &quot;signature architects.&quot; UC itself has an outstanding architecture and design program, and the efforts to have these famous architects design new campus buildings have encouraged students to attend the [[University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning|College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning]] (DAAP). In recent years, the university has received attention from architects and campus planners as one of the most beautiful in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pascale Le Draoulec|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/03/01/most-beautiful-campus-lifestyle-college_slide.html|title=In Pictures: The World's Most Beautiful Campuses|publisher=Forbes.com|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In recent years the University of Cincinnati has made significant strides to include more green initiatives and encourage sustainability among students, faculty, and staff. In autumn of 2010 the University of Cincinnati maintained its position in green and sustainability initiatives by being named one of only 286 &quot;Green Colleges&quot; by [[The Princeton Review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/green-schools-by-state.aspx|title=286 Green Colleges (by State) |publisher=Princetonreview.com|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; UC was the only public university in Ohio and the only university in the Southern Ohio region included on this list. Some of the programs that helped achieve this distinction include a bike share program where UC students can rent bikes from the university, an expanded recycling program, improved and expanded campus transportation options, greatly decreased energy and water use throughout campus, and the addition of 6 [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certified buildings since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC Sustainability gets high marks|url=http://www.newsrecord.org/news/uc-sustainability-gets-high-marks-1.2393670|publisher=Newsrecord.org |date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, former university president Nancy Zimpher signed the [[The American College &amp; University Presidents' Climate Commitment]] which confirms the university's dedication to reducing its environmental impact and take the necessary steps to become climate neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/af/pdc/sustainability/campus_initiatives.html|title=President signs charter to join 'The American College &amp; University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC)|publisher=UC.edu|date=April 2007|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 UC opened up a new $14 million privately funded athletic practice facility and Women's Lacrosse stadium named the Sheakley Athletic Complex. As a continued effort to go green, a chilled water [[thermal energy storage]] tank will be placed under the fields and at night the water will be chilled and then used to air-condition buildings on campus. The storage tank will help the university to reach annual energy savings of about $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/w-lacros/spec-rel/031610aaa.html|title=UC Breaks Ground On Jefferson Avenue Sports Complex â University of Cincinnati Official Athletics Site|publisher=Gobearcats.com|date=March 16, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Autumn of 2010, the university began placing ''All Recycling'' containers throughout campus. This expansion of recycling efforts and receptacles provides a greater opportunity for students, staff, and visitors to participate in recycling a broader range of materials. In 2010 UC recycled just over 4,600 tons of material, which was a 23 percent increase over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uc.edu/News/NR.aspx?id=13485|title=Recycling Grows at UC â By Tons at a Time|publisher=UC.edu|date=May 2, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Practice Program==
[[File:Steger.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph A. Steger Student Life Center]]

UC is the originator of the [[co-operative education]] (co-op) model. The concept was invented at UC in 1906 by [[Herman Schneider]], Dean of the College of Engineering at the time. The program generally consists of alternating quarters of coursework on campus and outside work at a host firm, giving students over one year of relevant work experience by the time they graduate. All programs in the College of Engineering and Applied Science, as well as Architecture and all design programs in the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, require co-operative education experience to graduate. Programs in the McMicken College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, and other colleges offer optional co-op opportunities. For a number of years, this system was referred to as &quot;The Cincinnati Plan.&quot; Ranked fourth in the U.S., UC's Professional Practice (Co-op) Program is the largest co-op program at a public institution in the United States with over 3,000 participating students at over 1,500 companies in 25 countries. The office of Professional Practice is housed in the Steger Student Life Center. The Division of Professional Practice is broken up into three units:

===Cooperative Education Program===
For over 100 years the Division lead has provided students with the opportunity to alternate full-time classroom time and work to provide them with a solid base of experience and professional development. This unit is the largest and modern successor of the original &quot;Cincinnati Plan&quot;.

===Academic Internship Program===
In 2010, the Division launched the Academic Internship Program, which provides access to opportunities for part time internships to students.

===The Center for Cooperative Education Research and Innovation===
This unit seeks to drive the development and implementation of cooperative education at UC as well as serve as an incubator for research and new thinking about approaches to experiential education. An example of this in action is the &quot;Live Well Collaborative&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1663402/na-ve-innovation-college-students-show-mega-corporations-like-pg-how-to-design-for-the-elder|title=To Innovate for Boomers, P&amp;G and LG Are Tapping... College Kids?!|publisher=Fast Company Magazine|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in 2008, this is a collaborative effort between private companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Boeing, General Mills, LG Electronics, and Kraft and the colleges of Business, DAAP, and Engineering and Applied Science at UC to help create living solutions for the U.S.'s aging population.

The average credentials for an UC Honors students is an ACT score of 32 or higher, an SAT score of 1400 or higher (critical reading and math combined), a class rank in the top 10%, and an unweighted high school GPA of 3.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/honors/prospective/freshmen.html|title=Page Title |publisher=uc.edu/honors|date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program emphasizes experiential learning and engages students in curricular and co-curricular learning opportunities. The program enriches the UC experience of academically talented and motivated students through coursework and out-of-class experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/honors/abouthonors.html|title=Page Title |publisher=uc.edu/honors|date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honors Program focuses on the four pillars of honors:

*Community Engagement
*Global studies
*Leadership
*Research &amp; Creative Arts

'''Curriculum &amp; Seminars'''
*Honors courses mesh with major and general education requirements so students can graduate from University Honors without completing extra courses and provide students with priority registration, smaller class sizes, and more academically strenuous expectations from professors. Honors seminars allow honors students to broaden their intellectual horizons regardless of the discipline in which they are majoring. Students may also fulfill honors requirements through experiential learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/honors/academics.html|title=Page Title |publisher=uc.edu/honors|date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways to get involved in the Honors Program are the University Honors Association (UHA), Honor Societies, Mid-East Honors Association (MEHA), and the [[National Collegiate Honors Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/honors/activities.html|title=Page Title |publisher=uc.edu/honors|date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International activities==
The university has a large, diverse international student body, with approximately 2,500 students drawn from over 110 countries. The largest number of foreign students are from India and China with a significant number from France as well. Most international students study at the graduate level, although the university is now aggressively recruiting more talented students into undergraduate fields. To this end, UC is now creating a network of official representatives to assist interested students throughout the world.

A number of new international activities are positioning UC as a leading international innovator among US universities. UC is the first American university to benchmark its international student services, using an instrument known as the International Student Barometer (ISB). In the Fall 2006 survey, UC benchmarked with the highest overall international student satisfaction score among the 40 participating institutions. UC is also among the first universities to pilot the new Standards of Good Practice for Education Abroad, created by the [[Forum on education abroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forumea.org|title=Forum on Education Abroad|publisher=Forumea.org|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International collaboration===
UC recently initiated a strategy of &quot;comprehensive engagement&quot; with key foreign institutions. The first of these with which a formal agreement was signed was Shandong University, of Jinan, China. In addition to developing a range of activities across their many colleges, the two universities have agreed to create a Joint Center for Urban Research, with offices on both campuses. UC's new COSMIC database (Cincinnati Online System for Managing International Collaboration) provides a view of its international relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/international/cosmic|title=UCosmic: UC Online System for Managing International Collaboration|publisher=UC.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study and co-op abroad===
UC has offered the opportunity to study or work abroad in over 80 countries since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/webapps/ucosmic/students/abroad.aspx|title=UC Students Abroad|publisher=UC.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four types of study abroad opportunities at UC:

*Exchange programs: These are run in collaboration with UC's partner institutions. They offer short-term and long-term options and they cost the same amount of tuition as UC.
*External programs: These offer packaged costs, meaning students pay a general fee that typically includes; housing, tuition, meals, excursions, books, health insurance, on-site advising, and a host of other services.
*UC Faculty-Led programs: These are organized and led by the university's very own professors.
*College-specific programs: These offer students the opportunity to study abroad with their cohort. For example, the College of Business has a program in Nantes, France and the College of Nursing has a clinical program in Honduras.

The university offers additional opportunities such as international co-op, internships, research, and service learning abroad and can last anywhere from a week over spring break to a full academic year spent abroad. UC International is the office that oversees these programs and offers several scholarships and grants to help fund international experience as well. The programs offered can be program or college specific and apply directly towards degree completion, or used to satisfy area studies or minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/international/programs/students/programs.html|title=UC Students Abroad|publisher=UC.edu|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

==Athletics==
{{main|Cincinnati Bearcats}}
[[Image:Cincinnati Bearcats.svg|left|The current University of Cincinnati Bearcats logo.]]
The university competes in 18 [[Division I (NCAA)]] sports and its athletics teams are known as the &quot;[[Binturong|Bearcat]]s&quot;. Since July 1, 2005, they have been members of the [[Big East Conference]]. They were previously members of [[Conference USA]], of which they were a founding member, the [[Great Midwest Conference]], the Metro Conference, and the [[Mid-American Conference]], among others.

The university's most well-known rivalries are with [[Miami RedHawks|Miami University]], the [[Louisville Cardinals|University of Louisville]] and [[Xavier Musketeers|Xavier University]]. The Bearcats lost to their arch rival, the Musketeers, in 2010 but defeated them in 2011 and now hold a 48 to 30 lead in their annual contest, the [[Crosstown Shootout]]. UC is known for its rich tradition in basketball, but have enjoyed recent a successful decade in football which is the fifth oldest program in college football, having started collegiate play in 1885 in the first collegiate football game in the State of Ohio. Besides its varsity sports, the university also has a diverse number of intercollegiate club sports teams and has recently passed legislation to distinguish some clubs as Club Varsity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/sald/club_sports.html|title=Club Sports Board, University of Cincinnati|publisher=UC.edu|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some include the Wrestling club and the club Rowing team, which produced 2004 Olympian Kelly Salchow.

===Student athletes===
In May 2006, Athletic Director (AD) Thomas introduced his vision for Bearcat Athletics, aptly titled CATAPULT. Thomas's five-year vision for UC's 18-sport intercollegiate program was launched six months after his hiring as AD. The plan focuses on three main initiatives: winning BIG EAST team championships, high-level academic achievement, and a comprehensive integration with the greater Cincinnati community. This action initiative tracks UC's 18 teams towards BIG EAST Championships in every sport within the next five years, encourages continued leadership by UC student-athletes in academics, and stresses community engagement. CATAPULT âan acronym for Championships, Academics, and Togetherâ sets the goal that in the next five years UC will win a BIG EAST championship in every sport; UC's student-athletes will lead the general student body in graduation rate and grade point average; and UC's student-athletes and coaches will engage the Cincinnati community in service.
During the 2006 Fall Quarter, the first under the CATAPULT plan, UC's sports teams made major improvements in academics, achieving an overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.938. Additionally, 11 of the 17 squads posted team GPAs higher than the general UC student body GPA of 2.965.
*The Bearcat men's basketball team made the greatest improvement in the classroom, as its 2.875 team GPA a half a grade point better than that of last year's squad for Fall Quarter. Five Bearcats had GPAs of 3.0 or above with two student-athletes making the Dean's List.
*The Bearcat women's soccer team also earned a national Team Academic Award from the National Soccer Coaches Association of America for having a team GPA of at least 3.2 for the 2005â06 school year.
*A total of 247 student-athletes from UC's athletic squads were named to either the Bearcat or the Topcat Honor Roll. To qualify for the Bearcat Honor Roll, a student-athlete must have earned a grade point average between 3.0 and 3.49 for the quarter, while Topcat honorees must maintain between a 3.5 and a 4.0 GPA.

In 2006, four of the six UC fall sports teams improved their finish in the final BIG EAST conference standings over that of Fall 2005. The Bearcat teams collectively posted an improvement of three places. UC's men's soccer team became the first Bearcat squad to claim a BIG EAST title, winning the Red Division of the league's regular season race. Most recently, football won the Big East Championship in 2008 and 2009 and women's volleyball won the Big East regular season title in 2010.

In December 2007 [[ESPN]] stated that if academics and athletics Achievement were factored in, that Cincinnati team would be playing in the BCS Championship game. UC finished the season with a 10â3 record and a #17 national ranking. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Center for First-Year Experience provides leadership for each student's first-year experience and related academic program. The center serves as a resource for all the universityâs undergraduate colleges and programs. This collaboration between UC colleges, academic programs, and students groups allow freshman to continue the transition from high school to college. The program is designed to help freshmen and their faculty to develop relationships that will continue and grow throughout their time at the University of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uc.edu/fye.html|title=Center for First Year Experience|accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning communities===
Many students at the University of Cincinnati have the opportunity to participate in learning communities. These are diverse groups of students and faculty in which 20â25 students have at least two classes together throughout their first year on campus. Students have the opportunity to join these based on their major or area of study. There are nearly 120 learning communities to chose from. They are offered in the following colleges: College of Allied Health Sciences, College of Business, College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, College of Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences, College of Nursing, and the McMicken College of Arts &amp; Sciences. Many of these groups have specialized courses taught by their academic adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/fye/Learning_Communities/default.html|title=Learning Communities|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
Student Activities &amp; Leadership Development (SALD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/sald.html|title=SALD, University of Cincinnati|publisher=UC.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; oversees over 300 registered student organizations ranging from student government to religious organizations to student government. Housed in the Steger Student Life Center, the divisions overseeing these groups include Club Sports Board, Diversity Education, Greek Life, Leadership Development, Programming, RAPP, and Student Government. Additionally, there are several other Student Life Offices on campus, such as the African American Cultural &amp; Resource Center, Bearcat Bands (the largest and oldest student group at UC), Early Learning Center, Ethnic Programs &amp; Services, University Judicial Affairs, Resident Education &amp; Development, Wellness Center, and the Women's Center.

===Service learning===
Each year students at the University of Cincinnati log tens thousands of hours of community service on campus and in the surrounding city and communities. The University of Cincinnati was one of the first universities in the country to be classified by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] as a [[Community Engagement]] focused university and was one of only 35 research universities on this list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/descriptions/community_engagement.php?key=1213 |title=Community Engagement Elective Classification |publisher=carnegiefoundation.org |date= |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the hundreds of events that take place annually, two of the largest and most successful student run community service events are the 18-hour Relay for Life and the 24-hour Cincinnati Dance Marathon. In support of the American Cancer Societyâs education, advocacy and research programs, UCâs Relay for Life raised more than $126,000 in 2010 when over 1,800 students and 170+ teams participated by collecting pledges and walking the relay route through McMicken Commons on main campus. The event was recognized as one of the top 10 collegiate Relay for Life events in the nation and the largest Relay for Life in their region, which includes Ohio and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/issues/0411/philanthropy.html|title=Student philanthropy after hours ... way after hours|publisher=UC Magazine|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Cincinnati Dance Marathon at UC has only been taking place in the Campus Recreation Center for a few years, in 2010 500 students danced all night to raise $13,500 in donations and then in 2011 raised nearly $24,000 for Cincinnati Childrenâs Hospital Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatidm.org/?page_id=4|title=CDM Raises $23,300 for Cincinnati Children's medical Center|publisher=Cincinnatidm.org|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraternity and sorority life===
Fraternities and Sororities have been a part of the university since 1870. Currently, there are over 1,400 students participating in fraternities and sororities, which represents approximately 6% of the undergraduate population. 50 chapters have called UC home over the years, and currently includes 36 social [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]]: 19 Interfraternity Council fraternities, 8 Panhellenic Council sororities, 7 National Pan-Hellenic Council (3 fraternities and 4 sororities), and 2 non-affiliated (Delta Phi Lambda and Phi Sigma Rho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/greeklife |title=Greek Life, University of Cincinnati |publisher=Uc.edu |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) organizations.

===Student media===
There are several media outlets for university students. The student newspaper is ''The News Record'' and has been in production for more than 130 years, taking its current name in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libraries/arb/archives/collections/newsrecord.html|title=News Record|publisher=Libraries.uc.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an independent, student run newspaper and not attached to any academic program and therefore any student, regardless of program, is able to apply and work for the newspaper. There is a student-run radio station, named ''Bearcast'' that is housed in the College-Conservatory of Music on campus. The programming streams online as opposed to a traditional radio station and, like the News Record, is open to any student attending the university. There is also a television station called ''UCast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccm.uc.edu/emedia/major/activities/ucast.html|title=News Record|publisher=ccm.uc.edu|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dining===
UC Housing &amp; Food Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/food.html|title=Food, University of Cincinnati|publisher=UC.edu|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs three award winning dining centers: Center Court, MarketPointe, and Stadium View CafÃ©. Meal plans are purchased at the beginning of each year and students living in residence halls are required to purchase one. There are also independent meal plans that students not living in residence halls may purchase. There is also a food court in the Tangeman University Center (student union) and many other restaurants and cafes are also available on campus.

UC is regularly recognized for excellent dining centers and restaurants and they have been awarded multiple awards since 2005. CenterCourt has received the greatest acclaims for UC dining, winning for best concept in 2007 and Grand Prize in 2006 [[National Association of College and University Food Services']] awards. CenterCourt and Market Pointe Dining Program received the honorable mention award in 2009 and Market Pointe@Siddal received an honorable mention in 2008 and a Silver Award in 2005. In 2011, UC's Mick and Mack's Contemporary CafÃ©, one of the full service restaurants on campus, received the bronze award with Brown University's Blue room. UC placed third in the category of 'Retail sales â Single concept'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsrecord.org/news/mick-and-mack-s-wins-national-award-1.2608948|title=Mick and Mack's wins national award|publisher=UC.edu|accessdate=August, 5 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
[[Image:UC Rec Center.jpg|thumb|Campus Recreation Center Housing, designed by [[Thom Mayne]], opened in 2006.]]
Nearly 4,000 students live on campus in eight residence halls that offer both traditional and suite style options. Students also have the option to live in themed housing which include (among others) honors, business, engineering, etc. specific floors. UC Housing &amp; Food Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/uchousing.html |title=UC Housing, University of Cincinnati |publisher=Uc.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; manages eight undergraduate [[residence halls]]:
* Calhoun Hall
* Campus Recreation Center Housing (CRC is only available to students who are sophomores or older)
* Dabney Hall
* Daniels Hall
* Siddall Hall
* Jefferson Complex which consists of Schneider Hall and Turner Hall. (JCSH, JSTH)
* Stratford Heights (as of Summer 2009)
* Morgens Hall (after renovation, re-opening as undergraduate housing in Autumn 2013)
* Scioto Hall (scheduled to re-open in the future as undergraduate housing)

Two off-campus university-affiliated (but not university-managed) housing options were introduced in 2005: Stratford Heights and University Park Apartments. All leases in the Stratford Heights housing area have been terminated, and control of the housing complex reverted to University control as residence hall in Summer 2009.
