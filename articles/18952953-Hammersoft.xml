'''''Lophophora williamsii''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|l|oÊ|Ë|f|É|f|Ér|É|_|w|Éª|l|Ë|j|Ã¦|m|s|i|aÉª}}), better known by its common name '''Peyote''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|p|É|Ë|j|oÊ|t|i}}; from the [[Nahuatl]] word '''''peyotl'''''), is a small, spineless [[cactus]] with [[psychoactive]] [[alkaloid]]s, particularly [[mescaline]].&lt;ref name=SalakHuicholIndians&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Peyote.html |title=National Geographic article about Peyote |last=Salak |first=Kira |publisher=National Geographic Adventure }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is native to southwestern [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]]. It is found primarily in the [[Chihuahuan desert]] and in the states of [[Tamaulipas]] and [[San Luis Potosi]] among scrub, especially where there is limestone.

Known for its psychoactive properties when ingested, it is used world wide as an [[entheogen]] and supplement to various [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] practices, including [[meditation]], [[psychonautics]], and [[psychedelic psychotherapy]]. Peyote has a long history of ritualistic and medicinal use by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous Americans]]. It flowers from March through May, and sometimes as late as September. The flowers are pink, with [[thigmotactic]] anthers (like ''[[Opuntia]]'').

==Description==
[[File:Flowering peyote cactus.jpg|thumb|left|A flowering peyote, in cultivation.]]
The cactus flowers sporadically and produces small edible pink fruit. The seeds are small and black, requiring hot and humid conditions to germinate. Peyote contains a large spectrum of [[phenethylamine]] alkaloids, of which the principal one is mescaline. The mescaline content of ''Lophophora williamsii'' is about 0.4% fresh&lt;ref name=&quot;erowid&quot;&gt;. [http://www.erowid.org/plants/cacti/cacti_guide/cacti_guide_lophopho.shtml Erowid.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (undried) and 3-6% dried.&lt;ref name=&quot;erowid&quot;/&gt; Peyote is extremely slow growing. Cultivated specimens grow considerably faster, sometimes taking less than three years to go from seedling to mature flowering adult. More rapid growth can be achieved by grafting Peyote onto mature San Pedro root stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 | publisher=The Lophophora Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the cactus that grows above ground, also referred to as the crown, consists of disc-shaped buttons that are cut above the roots and sometimes dried. When done properly, the top of the root will form a callus and the root will not rot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title=Proper peyote harvesting technique
| accessdate=30 December 2008
| publisher=The Lophophora Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; When poor harvesting techniques are used, however, the entire plant dies. Currently in South Texas, peyote grows naturally but has been over-harvested, to the point that the state has listed it as an [[endangered species]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The buttons are generally chewed, or boiled in water to produce a psychoactive tea. Peyote is extremely bitter and most people are [[nausea]]ted before they feel the onset of the psychoactive effects.

==Distribution and habitat==
''L. williamsi'' is native to southern [[North America]], mainly distributed in [[Mexico]]. In the United States it grows in southern [[Texas]]. In Mexico it grows in the [[States of Mexico|states]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo LeÃ³n]], and [[Tamaulipas]] in the north to [[San Luis Potosi]] and [[Zacatecas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.2985/0007-9367-80.6.310. bioone.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily found at elevations of 100 to 1500 m and exceptionally up to 1900 metres in the [[Chihuahuan desert]], but is also present in the more mild climate of the state of [[Tamaulipas]]. Its habitat is primarily in desert scrub, particularly thorn scrub in Tamaulipas. It is common on or near [[limestone]] hills.&lt;ref name=flora&gt;{{Cite book

==Uses==
[[File:Peyote buttons seized by Arcata CA Police.jpg|thumb|150px|Dried ''Lophophora williamsii '' slices (&quot;Peyote Buttons&quot;)]]
[[File:Mescaline chemical structure.png|thumb|150px|[[Chemical structure]] of [[mescaline]], the primary psychoactive compound in peyote]]
Common doses for pure mescaline range from roughly 200 to 400[[milligram|mg]]. This translates to a dose of roughly 10 to 20[[gram|g]] of dried buttons of average potency; however, potency varies considerably between samples, making it difficult to measure doses accurately without first extracting the mescaline. The effects last about 10 to 12 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{CitePiHKAL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peyote is reported to trigger states of &quot;deep introspection and insight&quot; that have been described as being of a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] nature. At times, these can be accompanied by rich visual or auditory effects (see [[synesthesia]]).

In addition to psychoactive use, some Native American tribes use the plant for its curative properties. They employ peyote to treat such varied ailments as toothache, pain in childbirth, [[fever]], breast pain, skin diseases, [[rheumatism]], [[diabetes]], colds, and blindness. The US Dispensatory lists peyote under the name ''Anhalonium'', and states it can be used in various preparations for [[neurasthenia]], [[hysteria]] and asthma. Screening for antimicrobial activity of peyote extracts in various solvents showed positive microbial inhibition. The principal antibiotic agent, a water-soluble crystalline substance separated from an ethanol extract of the plant, was given the name [[peyocactin]].&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{Cite journal| last=McCleary| first=J.A.; Sypherd, P.S.; Walkington, D.L.| title=Antibiotic Activity of an Extract Of Peyote [Lophophora williamsii (Lemaire) Coulter]| journal=Economic Botany| volume=14| pages=247â249|year=1960| postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same study, mice were used for preliminary animal toxicity tests and protection studies to determine the degree of the inhibitory action of peyocactin against normally fatal infections with the bacterium ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. In every case, the mice that had been given a peyocactin extract survived, while those in the control group died within 60 hours after infection. Peyocactin proved effective against 18 strains of penicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', several other bacteria, and a fungus.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

The flesh may also be applied topically to promote milk production (see [[galactogogue]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Long-term use==
A 2005 paper published in ''[[Biological Psychiatry]]'' found that &quot;...compared to [[Navajo people|Navajos]] with minimal substance use, the peyote group showed no significant deficits on the [[Rand Mental Health Inventory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/mos_mentalhealth.html rand.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (RMHI) or any neuropsychological measures...&quot;, and that they scored significantly better than non-users on the &quot;general positive affect&quot; and &quot;psychological well-being&quot; measures of the RMHI, a standard instrument used to diagnose psychological problems and determine overall mental health. By contrast, alcohol abusers did significantly worse than the control group (non-users) in all measures of the RMHI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016.2Fj.biopsych.2005.06.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peyote is known to have been used since the middle of the [[Archaic period in the Americas]] by the people of the [[Oshara Tradition]] in the Southwest. In 2005 researchers used [[radiocarbon dating]] and alkaloid analysis to study two specimens of peyote buttons found in [[archaeological]] digs from a site called Shumla Cave No. 5 on the Rio Grande in [[Texas]]. The results dated the specimens to between 3780 and 3660 [[Before Christ|B.C.]]. Alkaloid extraction yielded approximately 2% of the alkaloids including mescaline in both samples. This indicates that native North Americans were likely to have used peyote since at least five and a half thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=El-Seedi HR, De Smet PA, Beck O, Possnert G, Bruhn JG |title=Prehistoric peyote use: alkaloid analysis and radiocarbon dating of archaeological specimens of Lophophora from Texas |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=101 |issue=1â3 |pages=238â42 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=15990261 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2005.04.022 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specimens from a burial cave in west central [[Coahuila]], Mexico have been similarly analysed and dated to 810 to 1070 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bruhn JG, Lindgren JE, Holmstedt B, Adovasio JM |title=Peyote Alkaloids: Identification in a Prehistoric Specimen of Lophophora from Coahuila, Mexico |journal=Science |volume=199 |issue=4336 |pages=1437â1438 |year=1978 |month=March |pmid=17796678 |doi=10.1126/science.199.4336.1437 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From earliest recorded time, peyote has been used by indigenous peoples, such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]]&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz, Carl, ''Unknown Mexico'', New York: Scribners, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; of northern Mexico and by various Native American tribes, native to or relocated to the Southern Plains states of present-day [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]]. Its usage was also recorded among various Southwestern [[Athabaskan]]-language tribal groups. The [[Tonkawa]], the [[Mescalero]] and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]] were the source or first practitioners of peyote religion in the regions north of present-day Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also the principal group to introduce peyote to newly arrived migrants, such as the [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] from the Northern Plains. Documented evidence of the religious, ceremonial, and healing uses of peyote dates back over 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Under the auspices of what came to be known as the [[Native American Church]], in the 19th century, American Indians in more widespread regions to the north began to use peyote in religious practices, as part of a revival of native spirituality. Its members refer to peyote as &quot;the sacred medicine&quot;, and use it to combat spiritual, physical, and other social ills. Concerned about the drug's psychoactive effects, between the 1880s and 1930s, U.S. authorities attempted to ban Native American religious rituals involving peyote, including the [[Ghost Dance]]. Today the Native American Church is one among several religious organizations to use peyote as part of its religious practice.

Peyote and its associated religion are fairly recent arrivals among the Navajo in the Southwestern United States, and can be firmly dated to the early 20th century. {{Citation needed|date=January 2007}} Traditional Navajo belief or ceremonial practice did not mention the use of peyote before its introduction by the neighboring [[Ute tribe|Utes]]. The Navajo Nation now has the most members of the Native American Church. According to some estimates, 20 percent or more of the Navajo population are practitioners.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}}

Bruhn and Bo Holmstedt, &quot;Early peyote research: an interdisciplinary study&quot;], ''Economic Botany'',
Volume 28, Number 4, October 1973, accessed 15 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Heffter]] conducted self experiments on its effects in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heffter.org/review/Review2/chap2.pdf Daniel Perrine, &quot;Visions of the Night: Western Medicine Meets Peyote, 1887-1899&quot;], in ''The Heffter Review of Psychedelic Research'', Vol. 2, 2001, p.42, accessed 15 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, pioneering [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[ethnographer]] [[Carl Sofus Lumholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz, Carl, ''Unknown Mexico'', New York: Scribners (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; studied and wrote about the use of peyote among the Indians of Mexico. Lumholtz also reported that, lacking other intoxicants, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] captured by Union forces during the [[American Civil War]] soaked peyote buttons in water and became &quot;intoxicated with the liquid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lumholtz, Carl, ''Unknown Mexico'', New York: Scribners (1902), p.358&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably, this is the first documented use of peyote by non-native Americans.

==Cultural significance==
===Huichol culture===
The [[Huichol people|Huichol]] religion consists of four principal [[deities]], the trinity of Corn, Blue Deer and Peyote, and the eagle, all descended from their Sun God, &quot;Tao Jreeku&quot;. Peyote's importance can sometimes supersede other deities as in ethnographer, Stacy B Schaeferâs, documentation of a conversation with a San Andres Shaman, &quot;Peyote is everything, it is the crossing of the souls, it is everything there is. Without peyote nothing would exist&quot;. Schefuer has interpreted this to mean that peyote is the soul of their religious culture and a [[visionary]] [[sacrament]] that opens a pathway to the other deities.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy B. Schaefer, Peter T. Furst. People of the Peyote: Huichol Indian History, Religion, and Survival. UNM Press, 1997. Pg 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
Many authors, especially those of the [[Beat Generation]], wrote about their experiences with peyote, or were otherwise influenced by the plant.  [[Ken Kesey]], while working as a night watchman at a psychiatric ward, was peyote-inspired to write his novel, ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]''. &quot;'Peyote... inspired my chief narrator, because it was after choking down eight of the little cactus plants that I wrote the first three pages.' (As quoted in John Clark Pratt's &quot;Introduction to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, The Viking Critical Library, ed. John Clark Pratt, expanded edition, 1996).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/archives/olv5n2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael McClure]] wrote his great &quot;Peyote Poem&quot; after experimenting with peyote and other psychedelic drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Charters, Ann. &quot;Michael McClure.&quot; ''The Portable Beat Reader,'' 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s poem, &quot;[[Howl]]&quot;, was partly inspired by his use of peyote on October 17, 1954 in his apartment at 755 Pine Street in San Francisco, when he had a vision of the [[Sir Francis Drake]] Hotel and the Medical Arts buildings being transformed into the ancient Phoenician god [[Moloch]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Howl on Trial: The Battle for Free Expression.&quot; Edited by Bill Morgan and Nancy J. Peters&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the early writings of [[Carlos Castaneda]], sparked a resurgence of interest in using peyote as a psychoactive drug.&lt;ref name=SalakHuicholIndians /&gt;

==Legality==
===United States===
Where there is exclusive federal jurisdiction or state law is not &quot;racially&quot; limited, peyote use by [[Native American Church]] members is legal and &quot;racially&quot; neutral in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1307/1307_31.htm deadiversion.usdoj.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; This exemption from federal criminalization is as old as creation of federal law creating peyote related offenses.

This law has been codified as a [[statute]] in The American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978, 92 U.S.C.A. Â§ 469, and made part of the [[common law]] in ''Peyote Way Church of God v. Thornburgh'', (5th Cir. 1991);&lt;ref&gt;James W.H. McCord, Sandra McCord, and C. Suzanne Bailey, ''Criminal and Procedure for the Paralegal: A Systems Approach'', p. 178-179 (4th ed. Delmar Cengage 2012) ISBN 978-1-4354-4015-6.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also in [[administrative law]] at the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Â§ 1307.31.  The C.F.R. part dealing with &quot;SPECIAL EXEMPT PERSONS&quot; states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Section 1307.31 Native American Church.
The listing of peyote as a controlled substance in Schedule I does not apply to the nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church, and members of the Native American Church so using peyote are exempt from registration. Any person who manufactures peyote for or distributes peyote to the Native American Church, however, is required to obtain registration annually and to comply with all other requirements of law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''U.S. v. Boyll'', 774 F.Supp. 1333 (D.N.M. 1991)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.druglibrary.org/olsen/religion/boyll.html&lt;/ref&gt; addresses this racial issue specifically and concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the reasons set out in this Memorandum Opinion and
Order, the Court holds that, pursuant to 21 C.F.R. Â§ 1307.31
(1990), the classification of peyote as a Schedule I controlled
substance, see 21 U.S.C. Â§ 812(c), Schedule I(c)(12), does not
apply to the importation, possession or use of peyote for 'bona
fide' ceremonial use by members of the Native American Church,
regardless of race.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

United States [[federal law]] (and many [[state law]]s) protects the [[harvest]], [[Possession (law)|possession]], [[ingestion|consumption]] and [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] of peyote as part of &quot;[[bonafide]] religious ceremonies&quot; (the federal statute is [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/search/display.html?terms=1996a&amp;url=/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001996---a000-.html 42 USC Â§1996a], &quot;Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament,&quot; exempting only use by Native American persons, while some state laws exempt any general &quot;bonafide religious activity&quot;). American jurisdictions enacted these specific statutory exemptions in reaction to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'', {{ussc|494|872|1990}}, which held that laws prohibiting the use of peyote that do not specifically exempt religious use nevertheless do not violate the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Peyote is listed by the United States DEA as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] controlled substance.

[[File:Baby Peyote.jpg|thumb|200px|Seedling Peyote [[cactus]] which has been growing for roughly one year.]]

Although many American jurisdictions specifically allow religious use of peyote, religious or therapeutic use not under the aegis of the [[Native American Church]] has often been targeted by local law enforcement agencies.  Non-Natives attempting to establish spiritual centers based on the consumption of peyote as a sacrament or as medicine, such as the [[Peyote Foundation]] in [[Arizona]], have been prosecuted.

Native Americans are allowed to answer &quot;no&quot; on the armed forces application question, &quot;Have you ever used illegal drugs?&quot;, with respect to peyote.

===Canada===
Mescaline is listed as a Schedule III controlled substance under the Canadian [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]], but peyote is specifically exempt. [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-38.8/sc:3//en#anchorsc:3]

===International===
[[Wikisource:Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Article 32: RESERVATIONS|Article 32]] of the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] allows nations to exempt certain traditional uses of peyote from prohibition:
:''A State on whose territory there are plants growing wild which contain psychotropic substances from among those in Schedule I and which are traditionally used by certain small, clearly determined groups in magical or religious rites, may, at the time of signature, ratification or accession, make reservations concerning these plants, in respect of the provisions of article 7, except for the provisions relating to international trade.''
However, this exemption would apply only if the peyote cactus were ever explicitly added to the Schedules of the Psychotropic Convention. Currently the Convention applies only to chemicals. Peyote and other psychedelic plants are neither listed nor regulated by the Convention. See [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Psychedelic plants and fungi]].
