The '''1995â1996 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team''' represented [[Syracuse University]]. The Head Coach was [[Jim Boeheim]], serving for his 20th year. The team played its home games at the [[Carrier Dome]] in [[Syracuse, NY|Syracuse]], [[New York]].  The team finished with a 29â9 (12â6) record, while making it to the Championship Game of the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]].

The team was led by seniors [[John Wallace (basketball)|John Wallace]] and Lazarus Sims. Fellow senior J.B. Reafsnyder, juniors Jason Cipolla and [[Otis Hill]], sophomore Todd Burgan and Marius Janulis played key roles. Walk-on and future NFL star [[Donovan McNabb]] also appeared in five games.

== Season Recap ==

Syracuse was aided by the return of John Wallace, who had declared for the NBA draft, but chose to withdraw his early entry. Wallace would lead Syracuse in scoring for 30-of-38 games, leading Syracuse to an early 11â0 record. 

With the Orangemen hitting a bump in mid-season losing five of eight Big East games, Boeheim chose to insert Jason Cipolla into the starting lineup in favor of Marius Janulis. The move worked as Syracuse would go 8â1 to finish the regular season with a record of 22â7. Syracuse would advance to the Big East Championship semi-finals, where it was knocked off by Connecticut, 85â67.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D71F39F93AA35750C0A960958260 BASKETBALL;A Battle of the Big East's Best: It's UConn vs. Georgetown â New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Syracuse was named a No. 4 seed for the tournament, and played one of its most memorable games in the Sweet 16 against [[Georgia Bulldogs|Georgia]]. Cipolla hit a jumper as time expired in regulation to send the game to overtime, and John Wallace sealed the victory with a 3-pointer with 2 seconds remaining to propel Syracuse to an 83â81 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E2DD1439F930A15750C0A960958260 N.C.A.A.

Syracuse would knock off the [[Paul Pierce]], [[Raef LaFrentz]] and [[Jacques Vaughn]]-led [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] in the Elite 8, and [[Erick Dampier]] and the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs]] in the National Semifinal game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/final4/articles/semi96a.htm Washingtonpost.com: Syracuse's Defense Tops 'Dogs, 77â69&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This set up a matchup between [[Jim Boeheim]] and former assistant [[Rick Pitino]], who was now head coach of the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] in the National Championship game. 

Syracuse, a heavy underdog, nearly overcame a 13-point second-half deficit, closing to within to 2, but Kentucky held on for a 76â67 victory. Kentucky featured a deep team, including future NBA stars [[Derek Anderson (basketball)|Derek Anderson]], [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Ron Mercer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E6D81239F931A35757C0A960958260 BASKETBALL;Relentless Kentucky Captures Championship â New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
