'''Evolution''' or '''Novell Evolution''' (formerly '''Ximian Evolution''', prior to [[Novell]]'s 2003 acquisition of [[Ximian]]) is the official [[personal information manager]] and workgroup information management tool for [[GNOME]]. It combines [[e-mail]], [[calendar]], [[address book]], and [[task list]] management functions. It has been an official part of GNOME since version 2.8 in September 2004. Evolution development is sponsored primarily by Novell.

Its [[user interface]] and functionality are similar to [[Microsoft Outlook]]. Features include [[iCalendar]] support, full-text indexing of all incoming mail, powerful [[E-mail filtering|email filters]] writable in [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]],&lt;ref name=&quot;scheme&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Getting Really Organized with vFolders | url=http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/doc/x2279.html| accessdate=21 August 2007|publisher=Ximian, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a âSearch Foldersâ feature (i.e., saved searches that look like normal mail folders).

Evolution can be connected to older versions of [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] (i.e. not Exchange 2007 and 2010; partial work arounds are available for these versions) using their web interfaces and an Evolution add-on formerly called [[Ximian Connector]]. Using [[gnome-pilot]], it may be synchronized with [[Palm Pilot]] devices, and [[OpenSync (software)|OpenSync]] enables it to be synchronized with [[mobile phone]]s and other [[personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

Licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]], Evolution is [[free software]].

==Evolution 2==
Evolution 2, which has been available since September 2004, delivers these features:{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* integrated connectivity to [[Novell GroupWise]]
* integrated connectivity to [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]
* integrated support for [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]] email encryption
* improved offline support for [[IMAP]] accounts
* numerous [[calendar]] improvements
* support for [[S/MIME]], enhanced contact management

==Evolution Express==
Evolution Express&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/evolution-express-for-meego.html Evolution Express for MeeGo]&lt;/ref&gt; is a new user interface which is being built on top of Evolution, targeted for mobile and small-screen devices.  It is included as part of Evolution 2.30 and can be enabled by passing the &lt;code&gt;--express&lt;/code&gt; command-line option.

==Distribution==
Evolution is released as part of GNOME. GNOME is the default desktop environment for several Linux distributions, most notably [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] prior to version 11.04&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Foresight Linux]] showcases the latest releases of GNOME. Novell distributes Evolution with [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop]] and the [[openSUSE]] community project.

Evolution is also available as [[source code]]. Some pre-built install packages are available for other operating systems, but only for older versions.

===Evolution for Mac OS X===
In 2006, Novell provided an installer for Evolution on Mac OS X. This outdated version was downloadable for quite a while but the link no longer works.&lt;ref&gt;{{wayback|url=http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfcontent/downloads.php/evolution/builds/Evolution%202.6%20for%20Mac%20OS%20X%20/|title=Forge.novell.com|date=20070528161309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.gnome.org/Evolution/FAQ#Does_a_version_for_Apple.28R.2CTM.2CC.2Cwhatever.29_Mac_OS.28R.2CTM.2CC.2Cwhatever.29_exist.3F Evolution FAQ: Does a version for Apple Mac OS exist?]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution for Windows===
In January 2005, Novell's [[Nat Friedman]] announced in his blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://nat.org/blog/2005/01/17-january-2005/
 | title = Evolution for Windows
 | author = Nat Friedman
 | work = Nat Friedman' Blog
 | date = 2005-01-17
 | accessdate = 2010-02-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the company had hired [[Tor Lillqvist]], the programmer who ported
[[GIMP]] to Microsoft Windows, to do the same with Evolution.  Before
this announcement, several projects with the same goal had been
started but none of them reached alpha status.

As of November 11, 2009, DIP Consultants, LLC provides Evolution 2.28.2-1 with Windows Installer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.dipconsultants.com/evolution/
 | title = Evolution for Windows
 | accessdate = 2011-05-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which runs on [[Windows XP]] and newer.

An experimental installer for Evolution 2.32 also exists for Windows. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
