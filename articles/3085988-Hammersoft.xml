The '''history of BBC television idents''' begins in the early 1950s, when the [[BBC]] first displayed a logo between programmes to identify its service. As new technology has become available, these devices have evolved from simple still black and white images to the sophisticated full colour short films seen today. With the arrival of digital services in the United Kingdom, and with them many more new channels, branding is perceived by broadcasters to be much more important, meaning that idents need to stand out from the competition.

This article describes the development of the BBC's main television channels' identities.

==BBC Television Service/BBC One==
=== Pre-1969 ===
{{main|BBC One Pre-1969 Idents}}
The original BBC Television Service was launched in November 1936 and was taken off the air at the outbreak of war in September 1939, returning in June 1946. As the only public television service in Britain, and initially in the world, there was no need for a station ident in the early days. However, with the imminent arrival of commercial television in Britain, 2 December 1953 saw the arrival of the first ident, nicknamed the &quot;Bat's Wings&quot;. This was an elaborate mechanical contraption constructed by Abram Games, which featured a tiny spinning globe in the centre, surrounded by two spinning &quot;eyes&quot;, with lightning flashes to either side.
Unlike later idents, this was filmed, rather than live. The model was temperamental, and broke down shortly after it was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/symbol.php |title= Oh, that Symbol... |accessdate= |last= Elen |first= Richard G. |publisher= Baird |date= 1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the early 1960s the &quot;Bat's Wings&quot; had been superseded by the &quot;BBC tv&quot; logo within a circle, beneath which would appear a map of Britain split into the BBC's broadcast regions.
The channel's most famous emblem, the globe, appeared in its first guise on 30 September 1963. The first such ident featured the continuity announcer speaking over a rotating globe while a &quot;BBC tv&quot; caption would appear with the announcement, &quot;This is BBC Television&quot; being made.

The launch of sister channel [[BBC Two|BBC2]] saw the channel renamed [[BBC One|BBC1]] on 20 April 1964, although the name was not changed on-screen until the introduction of the &quot;watch-strap&quot; globe in 1966. The reason the change was delayed was due to coverage of BBC2 being limited; BBC1 remained &quot;BBC tv&quot; in the meantime.

===The Mechanical Globe (1969-1985)===
{{main|NODD (Nexus Orthicon Display Device)}}
On 15 November 1969, BBC1 began transmitting in colour, and introduced the first version of the &quot;mirror globe&quot; ident. The inclusion of the word &quot;colour&quot; in the station ident could be viewed as a subtle reminder to the vast majority of viewers, still watching in black and white, to buy a [[colour TV]] set and the much more expensive colour [[television licence]] which financed the BBC. Originally, the mirror globe was coloured black with blue logo and landmasses so that those still watching on black and white televisions would not have their viewing experience disrupted too much. The &quot;mirror globe&quot; ident was revised in 1974 to use a Futura Bold BBC1, despite the fact that for trailers and holding slides the double striped BBC1 was still in use. The &quot;colour&quot; identification was also removed from the name, and the colours changed to yellow on a navy blue background. The globe was changed once again in 1981 to the double striped BBC1 logo, sitting below a green globe on navy blue background. Also, the globe was repainted about this time, which resulted in South Africa having a pointed tip. The idents were generated by the Nexus Orthicon Display Device (abbreviated to NODD and pronounced &quot;noddy&quot;), which worked by filming an image in black and white and electronically adding colour before the image was aired. This made it very easy for technical crew to manipulate the colours of the image for whatever reason (like a logo revamp). This technique was also used on the clock and schools idents, which were also filmed in black and white by the same camera and had colour added later on. The camera would be set up looking at a bank of clocks, idents, globes and breakdown captions, and the camera could be turned to look at any of these idents. This particular ident was recreated to introduce the second series of [[Life on Mars (TV series)|Life on Mars]].
Up until now, a mechanical clock had always accompanied the globe.&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of the 1969 BBC1 clock can be seen at the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation0.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of the 1974 BBC1 clock can be seen at the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation1.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of the Original 1981 BBC1 clock can be seen at the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation2.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when BBC2 introduced their computerised ident, the technicians started working on an electronic clock to accompany the new looks. This was completed in 1982, and the design of the clock was changed for the first time in many years. The mechanical clocks had a &quot;[[Polo (mint)|polo]]&quot; mint centre with points around the clock face that increased in thickness as you went around the clock. The new electronic clocks had double line markers at 12, 3, 6 and 9, with single line markers everywhere else. The new clocks also had a single centre dot.&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of the electronic 1981 BBC1 clock can be seen at [http://625.uk.com/tv_logos/flash/bbc1_clock_84.asp 625.com Flash Files]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Computer Originated World (1985-1991)===
{{main|Computer Originated World}}
By 1985, computer graphics technology had progressed sufficiently that on 18 February the mechanical mirror globe was retired in favour of the new &quot;Computer Originated World&quot;, or 'COW', which showed a semi-transparent blue globe with golden continents and gold &quot;BBC1&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbc1national/bbc1national1985.html | title= BBC1 â Idents 1985 | first=Simon | last = Luxton | publisher = TV Ark}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by the BBC graphics and computer departments with work starting on it in 1983, following the success of the electronic BBC2 ident and the clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.625.uk.com/tv_logos/bbc1_85.htm | title = BBC 1 1985 â A Computer Originated World | first = Andrew | last = Wiseman | date = 3 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globe was originally planned to launch on 1 January 1985 but was delayed until 18 February that year by the then controller of BBC One, [[Michael Grade]], in order to make part of a new look for the channel and a new evening lineup, including [[Wogan]] and [[Eastenders]], as ratings began to slide. From start-up until 6:00pm that evening, the older NODD mirror globe was used. From 7:00pm until [[closedown]] that night, the newer COW globe was used. The first ever programme to be introduced by this new globe was ''Wogan'', a chat show presented by [[Terry Wogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thetvroom.com/bbcuk/bbc-1-20-01.html | title = BBC One February 1985-February 1991 | publisher = The TV Room}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COW globe went down well with the public, and changed the perception of the channel. Also, for the first time, Holding slides, trailers and promotions included the BBC1 golden logo, bringing the brand together. The COW globe also used the same clock face as before, with some changes.&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of the 1985 BBC1 clock can be seen at the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation3.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The colours had changed to a black background with blue counters and gold hands. The BBC1 was also included in the bottom. However, the centre dot was removed for some unknown reason.

===The Virtual Globe (1991-1997)===
{{main|BBC One 'Virtual Globe' ident}}
The Computer Originated World was replaced on 16 February 1991 by a new virtual globe, designed by [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]]'s branding agency, [[Lambie-Nairn]], who had first made an impact with [[Channel 4]]'s original 1982 ident. The idents were [[computer generated]] and were played from modified [[Laserdisc]] players and had no soundtrack. The ident consisted of a figure &quot;1&quot; inside a rotating transparent globe surrounded by a swirling smokey atmosphere above the BBC's corporate logo â the bold italic letters B B C within three [[rhomboid]]s, above blue red and green flashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbc1national/bbc1national1991.html | title= BBC1 â Idents 1991 | first=Simon | last = Luxton | publisher = TV Ark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The globe doesn't look instantly like one, but land masses can be seen in the globe and their shadows can be seen on the background of the ident. The idents were &quot;unveiled&quot; on that week's ''[[Going Live!]]'', the Saturday morning magazine show on [[CBBC|Children's BBC]] at the time, by [[Phillip Schofield]] and [[Sarah Greene]], although the globe already officially debuted before then. There was also a new clock that accompanied the new look which used GNAT (Generated Network Analogue Time). This clock mimicked the movement of an analogue clock, as the minute hand moved every second. The counters on the clock also changed, with alternating dashes and dots. The clock had no reference that it was BBC1, instead it had the BBC logo below the clock. The clock was modified in 1992 to a smaller size, so that the clock was the same size as the virtual globe ident. This made it easier at [[Sign-off#United Kingdom|closedown]].

===The Balloon (1997-2002)===
{{main|BBC One 'Balloon' idents}}
On 4 October 1997 the globe was dramatically updated when it left the computer to take the form of a [[BBC One 'Balloon' idents|hot-air balloon]] filmed over various landmarks throughout the UK (and occasionally in other countries e.g. over Sydney Harbour during the 2000 Summer Olympics). The idents featured the new name of the channel: BBC One, renaming which continued across the rest of the BBC's channels, and also featured the new BBC corporate logo. Over the next two and a half years, no fewer than 59 different variations of the BBC One balloon ident were produced. From June 2000, the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the BBC's website, then known as BBC Online, was included in all BBC One and BBC Two idents. The globe idents also saw the introduction of Widescreen, including the first widescreen idents.

===Rhythm &amp; Movement (2002-2006)===
{{main|BBC One 'Rhythm &amp; Movement' idents}}
A change in controller at BBC One saw the balloon globe icon become the shortest-lived ident package of the colour television era. The new controller, Lorainne Heggessey, made no secret of her hate for the Balloon idents, as she believed them to be slow, dull and boring and believed that they said nothing about a channel. Because of this opinion, she ordered a review of the current branding. Because of this review, after 39 years, the globe style was replaced on 29 March 2002 by new idents featuring a new multicultural theme. The relaunch also saw a new logo for the channel based upon that of BBC Two, though the logo was instead the BBC logo and the word &quot;ONE&quot; below it within a red box. The box style later became a common style for the BBC's channels.

The new idents were collaboratively called the [[BBC One 'Rhythm &amp; Movement' idents|'Rhythm and Movement' idents]] and featured dancers at various locations dancing to different musical styles. These proved to be hugely unpopular; some{{who|date=September 2011}} accused the BBC of being politically correct regarding some of the dancers involved (disabled dancers in wheelchairs on a basketball court) while fans of the globe and traditionalists were dismayed that the longstanding motif had left the BBC after 39 years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This was also the first new presentation package not to include a clock though one had been designed â it had become difficult to transmit the time accurately, given the delay introduced by satellites and digital transmission.

===Circles (2006-present)===
{{main|BBC One 'Circle' idents}}
After four years, the idents were replaced themselves by [[BBC One 'Circle' idents|a new set]] introduced on 7 October 2006, abandoning the overtly red colour scheme yet retaining the colour slightly less obviously as the main colour. The relaunch brought about a new channel logo once more with the box replaced in favour of a lowercase name, effectively appearing as &quot;&lt;sup&gt;BBC&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;one&quot;.

A circle motif now features as the main theme of the idents, while the content is much more diverse than previous: swimming [[hippopotamus|hippos]], motorcycle stunt riders, children playing &quot;[[Ring a Ring O'Roses|ring a roses]]&quot;, lit windows, surfers, football players, the moon, kites, and a red arc circling the logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/09_september/26/idents.shtml | title = BBC ONE launches new channel identity | author = BBC Press Office | date = 26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the new idents shown was 'Kites', appearing at 10:00 BST on 7 October. According to former channel controller [[Peter Fincham]], the new circle motif is both a 'nod' to the channel's heritage, the old globe logo used for 39 years, as well as a symbol of people coming together, in the way the channel brings people together. On 2 May 2009, the circle idents were edited with shorter video sequences, new soundtracks (except &quot;Hippos&quot; and &quot;Surfers&quot;)  and two idents (&quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;) being withdrawn.

==BBC Two==
===Launch Ident (1964-1967)===
[[File:BBC Two 1964 ident.jpg|thumb|The BBC Two ident from the channel's launch in 1964]]
{{main|BBC Two Launch ident}}

BBC Two is the second BBC channel and the third channel to air in the UK. Following the success of [[BBC One|{{Not a typo|BBC tv}}]], the third channel was awarded to the BBC. Following this, the BBC planned a brilliant nights entertainment for their opening night. However, the opening extravaganza was forced to reschedule from 20 April 1964 to the following evening, as the result of a massive power failure in west London.

The channel's first logo was an animation where white and grey stripes flew in from the left and right before a &quot;2&quot; and the BBC corporate logo flew in from the top and bottom. The jingle that accompanied the ident was a fanfare based on the morsecode translation of 'BBC TWO', composed by Freddie Philips. This logo lasted 3 years until the introduction of colour to BBC2. Along with the ident, there was also a flip card with a larger 2 on it that was used as a sting in many ways. Continuity was also frequently recorded in vision, with the announcer in a studio with BBC2 branding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbctwo/1964_idents.html TVARK BBC Two 1964 Pages] Includes a video of the idents, images of the in vision set and a video of (the second!) opening night.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cube (1967-1974)===
[[File:BBC2 colour logo 1967.jpg|thumb|First BBC Two in colour ident from 1967]]
{{main|BBC Two 'Cube' ident}}

For the introduction of the first British colour broadcasting service in 1967 there was no new ident, but a new logo: a 2 with a dot inside the figure. There was originally a test period where the original presentation was used with possible electronic colour added. However, it was rejected and a new ident used. This ident was formed from the 3 light spots that come together to make the central dot. From there, a 2 is drawn around the dot. Once complete, the colour legend appears below before the 2 starts rotating slowly. The blue 2 rotates to reveal a red 2, green 2 and a white 2. The ident would continually spin after this. In 1969, when BBC1 launched its own colour service, the ident was updated to match BBC1's presentation. The 2 was now all white an a blue background, with the BBC2 logo underneath the 2. The clock that went alongdside this look was originally a traditional clock face with roman numerals&lt;ref&gt;A Flash recreation of this clock can be seen at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation4.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt; before it was changed to a light blue clockface on a dark blue background with BBC2 legend below. This clock also had the 'polo' mint centre and was filmed on BBC2's NODD, black and white camera filming the clock with colour added later on.&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of this clock can be sen at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation5.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stripes (1974-1979)===
{{main|BBC Two 'Striped' ident}}

A facelift occurred in time for the channel's tenth anniversary in 1974, with the &quot;2&quot; being formed of blue and white lines, the different colours leaving and entering from opposite sides of the screen. This was formed from a mechanical model of 23 discs, each with an alternating colour line on them. The model was then run so that each disc spun a different way to the disc above and below it. This was the last mechanical model used on BBC2. The clock for this era was the same as the last era.

===The Computer Generated 2 (1979-1986)===
[[File:BBC2 logo 1979.jpg|thumb|The first ever [[computer generated]] ident and used from 1979 until 1986]]
{{main|BBC Two 'Computer Generated 2' ident}}

In 1979, BBC2 adopted the world's first computer-generated ident, with the logo being drawn live every time it was played.&lt;ref&gt;The BBC2 network logo was derived from a box called a Run Length Video Generator [http://www.bbceng.info/Designs/RDCE/part_I/101to200/ipage_41.htm ipage_41.htm] designed by BBC engineers.&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the 2 had orange double lines either side and the 2 itelf was orange double lined. This stripy 2 had been used on promotions and holding slides for years prior to its launch, and now it was part of a bigger branding package. For the first few years of the ident, it would be accompanied by a fanfare as it scrolled onto the screen. There were versions of the ident where the ident scrolled on, scrolled off and remained static. The clock used alongside this high tec 3D ident, was anything but. The old clock filmed from the NODD room survived, with a new 2D logo and sporting black and orange colours.&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of this clock can be seen at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/testcards/animation6.shtml BBC Cult Website]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1980, BBC2 got its own electronic clock including 3D legend and centre dot.&lt;ref&gt;A flash recreation of this clock can be seen at [http://625.uk.com/tv_logos/flash/bbc2_clock.asp 625.com Flash Files]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The TWO (1986-1991)===
{{main|BBC Two 'TWO' ident}}

In 1986, the electronically generated 2 was replaced with the letters T W O. The letters were on a white background, and themselves were more 3D versions of the white background. However, the T had some red on it and the W had green and blue on the diagonal parts. These colours are reminiscent of the light spots and the colours of the dotted 2 in 1967. As with the previous ident, the TWO would fade into and out of the white background. All of this was an effort to make the channel appear more &quot;highbrow&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thetvroom.com/bbcuk/bbc-2-09-01.html | title = BBC Two April 1986-February 1991 | publisher = The TV Room}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni9rP4U3B_Q&amp;t=1m45s&amp;amp | title = BBC Two January 1989 | publisher = ajs41 on YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1991 2s (1991-2001)===
[[File:BBC Two Paint ident.jpg|thumb|''Paint'' was used from 1991 to 2001 where a two-part era would take place. The first part of this era (1991 - 1997) would have a sans-serif &quot;2&quot; and the new BBC corporate logo at the time]]
{{main|BBC Two '1991-2001' idents}}
The channel's association with the [[Lambie-Nairn]] branding agency began in  1991 following on from when Alan Yentob became controller of BBC2 in 1987. Upon taking up office, Alan realised that a review needed to be carried out of the TWO. The research carried out a start of the review found that viewers saw the TWO as &quot;dull&quot; and &quot;Old Fashioned&quot;. Because of this, Lambie Nairn was hired to create a new identity. The 1986 ident was replaced by the start of the highly successful&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thetvroom.com/bbcuk/bbc-2-11-01.html | title = BBC Two February 1991-October 1997 | publisher = The TV Room}}&lt;/ref&gt; series of idents involving a sans serif '2'. The idents themselves were very simple, such as Paint or Water and this changed peoples perception of the channel, despite the fact that only the idents had changed. These new 2's had corporate branding on BBC2 for the first time, allowing cross channel continuity to be easily done. It also brought a unified feel to the channel. These new idents also changed the style of idents. Previously the ident was a single scene that would introduce all types of programmes. The fact there were multiple idents allowed variation (at one point, there were 40), and for different idents to introduce different genre of programme. Also, special idents were created for themed nights and for special events such as Christmas. A sure sign of success for these idents is that they survived the rebrand following the new BBC corporate logo in 1997. The idents simply displayed the new logo, while more idents were added to the batch.

The clock that accompanied both of these looks was a slick circular clock face on a fading white and [[Viridian]] background, with a combination of dots and dashes as its counters. It was never edited throughout the entire run of this series of idents.

===The Personality 2s (2001-2007)===
{{main|BBC Two 'Personality' idents}}
After nearly eleven years, the channel received a new look in 2001 with a set of robotic figure 2s, each displaying individual personalities. This set was also produced by Lambie-Nairn, and American visual effects technician Mic Graves served as a co-creator along with [[Martin Lambie-Nairn]], who also created the previous set. BBC Two also became the first BBC channel to receive the new style of logo, in its case this was a purple box with the BBC logo stacked above 'TWO'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thetvroom.com/bbcuk/bbc-2-17-01.html | title = BBC Two November 2001-February 2007 | publisher = The TV Room}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the channel stuck out as being different, because all the other channels still had their 1997 branding. Also, rather than a variety of backgrounds seen in the previous presentation package, idents now had a universal yellow background while the figure 2 became 3D and white. In addition to this, only 4 were originally produced, limiting the different options. Also, no clock was produced for this look, the first look not to have one. The general style of white 2 and yellow background was occasionally replaced by previously withdrawn idents from the 1991â2001 package, but also by some specially produced idents to highlight particular shows or programming strands.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodbyeyellow&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thetvroom.com/bbcuk/bbc-2-17-10.html | title = BBC Two November 2001-February 2007 â Special Idents | publisher = The TV Room}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples included an updated dog 2 to advertise the channel's &quot;pedigree comedy&quot; trailers while previously withdrawn idents have included &quot;Predator/Venus Fly Trap&quot; used to introduce the Chelsea Flower Show, as well as the Christmas 2000 ident which resurfaced to introduce coverage of the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;goodbyeyellow&quot; /&gt;  In celebration of the channel's 40th anniversary in 2004, a special ident combining glimpses of previous BBC2 idents was used. The [[BBC Radio 4]] logo introduced in 2001 was quite similar to what could be seen in these idents, with a white 3D number, this time being a 4. The background was blue and purple, however, and not white. This Radio 4 logo was in use in the same peroid as the Personality idents.

===The Window On The World (2007-present)===
[[File:BBC Two Seascape 2009.jpg|thumb|The latest idents ''Seascape'' feature the &quot;2&quot; as a window in numerous surfaces, and make less use of the box logo.]]
{{main|BBC Two 'Window on the World' idents}}
The most recent relaunch of the channel's presentation package came on 18 February 2007, with the introduction of idents designed by advertising agency [[Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO]] and produced by [[Red Bee Media]], costing Â£700,000 in total. Controller of BBC Two Roly Keating said, &quot;These new idents embody all of BBC Two's distinctive humour, creativity, playfulness and surprise â and they're also beautifully-executed pieces of film-making in their own right&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/02_february/13/two.shtml | title = BBC Two's new &quot;Window on the World&quot; | author = BBC Press Office | date = 13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;windowontheworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://idents.tv/blog/?p=456 | title = TV on the television: The new BBC Two idents | date = 19 February 2007 | publisher = idents.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled &quot;Window on the World&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;windowontheworld&quot; /&gt; these new idents feature a cut-out '2' made from various materials behind which different scenes can be seen. In addition, the on-screen presentation system and the [http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo BBC Two website] have also been altered to reflect the new theme. This new look was also the first time that the 2 was altered from Lambie Nairn's original 2, however, the difference is minor and to many unnoticeable.

==BBC Choice/BBC Three==
===BBC Choice===

BBC Choice was launched in 1998 as part of the BBC's aim of expanding into Digital TV. BBC choice started out as being the home for programmes that would compliment those being shown on BBC One and BBC Two. As a result of this, Lambie-Nairn - the branding agency who designed the all the BBC Choice looks - used three different objects which were different takes on the same idea. Five idents were initially produced; a football fan, a handheld fan and an electric fa n; Punch, as in [[Punch and Judy]], a boxing glove and punch the drink; a clockwork mouse, a real mouse and a computer mouse; a trumpet, the trumpet of a daffodil and an elephant trumpeting; and a stone heart, a burning heart (Heartburn) and a heart shaped electrical current (Light heart). These idents featured the [[Logo of the BBC#1997|BBC logo]] with the word 'Choice' proceeding it as the channel logo, and was used at the bottom of the ident. Promotion and continuity style matched that other BBC channels, with the channel logo present on screen at the bottom of the screen.

In July 2000, BBC Choice's remit was altered by the BBC to be aimed towards the young adult audience, and as a result the idents were changed. The new package featured one of the heart shapes (most commonly the stone heart) at the centre of a brightly coloured screen, from which other heart shapes may form with different background colours inside. This look lasted a year however.

In mid-2001, later on in the channels life, the channel adopted the 3 orange boxes that would become infamous with the channel. These three orange boxes would be seen moving around an initially green, becoming blue a few months into the look, background. 

At the time of the closure of [[BBC Choice]], and the adoption of [[BBC Three]], the idents were adapted once more. At first, the familiar orange boxes could be seen being demolished by a [[wrecking ball]] in the final months, and come December 2002, the whole identity was changed to a [[building site]]. The idents featured two builders against a background of scaffolding and sheeting, distorting a large uppercase blue ''THREE'' as well as a countdown in weeks to completion that was added from 19 January 2003. This was supplemented by a christmas ident featuring the two builders.

BBC Choice also carried a [[Digital on-screen graphic|DOG]] of the channels logo in the top left of the screen. This was occasionally supplemented by the website address.

===BBC Three===
[[File:BBC Choice ident.jpg|thumb|A former BBC Choice ident]]

The young-adult oriented [[BBC Three]] was launched on 9 February 2003, as the successor to [[BBC Choice]]. The official launch night revealed the towering three-dimensional figure &quot;THREE&quot; populated by small [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] &quot;blobs&quot; designed and created by Stefan Marjoram at [[Aardman Animations]]. Marjoram's &quot;blobs&quot; were given voices from sound clips from the BBC's vast archive while the launch theme music &quot;Three Is the Magic Number&quot;, based (only the lyrics are copied) upon [[Schoolhouse Rock!]] played in the background.

The blobs were brown in colour against a blue background and were intended to mirror those in use by [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] at the time, which both featured 2D animated blobs of colour green and yellow respectively. As a result, these blobs were seen as a form of evolution from the existing blobs and making programming for younger audiences stand out. Channel trailer animations showed one blob standing in front of the figure 'THREE' shouting &quot;Three!&quot;, before another 'THREE' rises up from underneath the original, toppling it.

[[File:BBC Three blobs.jpg|thumb|left|One of the channel's &quot;blobs&quot;]]
The channel logo featured a BBC logo above a large slanted Three inside a box. The box was originally white with the letters being the colour as the background, however this was reversed to a blue box and white lettering in 2005 alongside a new DOG and new promotional style.

In 2008, BBC Three controller Danny Cohen unveiled a new brand for the channel designed to emphasise its new focus on cross-platform programming. The revamped BBC Three identity can be seen as a continuous link between the TV, the internet and the mobile connections of the BBC Three channel. This ties in with the ability to watch live streaming of BBC Three on the internet, making it a multi-platform channel

&quot;The thinking behind this re-brand of the channel is that we have, in effect, created a BBC Three world in which our content can move seamlessly between TV, online and mobile&quot;, he explained. &quot;We have a fantastic line-up of programmes and we are going to make them available wherever young people want them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC press office bbc3 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Three Winter/Spring 2008 Press Pack|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/01_january/22/bbcthree.shtml|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BBC Three 2008 ident.jpg|thumb|One of the channel's new idents]]
The current idents were introduced on 22 January 2008. They feature a fantasy place called Three World, and the &quot;three&quot; is a pipe with pink liquid passing through it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theidentgallery.com/bbc3-2008.php theidentgallery.com: BBC Three 2008 relaunch]&lt;/ref&gt; These pipes, or pools of liquid are present in most of the idents, as are large objects that appeal to the young adult audience, or features technology such as television screens. The whole package, as with the channel programming, is designed to be surreal and to take a different look on life. 

The look was carried out by [[Red Bee Media]], along with agencies MPG and [[Agency Republic]] with music and sound design by creative audio company Koink.

The channel DOG was originally a BBC logo with an uppercase THREE to the right in line with the design previously used for channel logos, but was altered in 2005 to the BBC Three logo. In 2008, the logo was changed to the current logo and, controversially, to a full colour version of the logo. Despite the change to widescreen near the channels beginnings, the DOG always remained near the centre of the screen, so viewers without widescreen television's could still identify the channel. This decision was finally indone in 2011, when the channel DOGs of all the BBC's channels were switched to the top left corner of a widescreen picture.

==BBC Knowledge/BBC Four==
===BBC Knowledge===
[[File:BBC Knowledge ident.jpg|thumb|Former ident of BBC Knowledge]]

[[BBC Knowledge]] was launched in 1999 with the intent of creating a multimedia learning channel. The idea was that computers, interactive TV via the [[BBC Red Button|Red Button]] and television could come together to make a new, factual, learning channel for kids and adults alike. However, this service didn't last long, and so it was difficult for BBC Knowledge to continue in their current manner. BBC Knowledge was closed on 2 March 2002, and BBC Four took over its broadcast slot.

The launch identity consisted of cartoon characters climbing 'ladders of learning' between clouds against an orange background. Michael Sheeny illustrated the idents. A white, BBC logo with 'Knowledge' after it in capital letters was located at the bottom of the screen and was the station logo for its existence. 

In addition to this, the channel would  utilise the now common practice of shrinking the credits to include extra information and promotions, as well as including viewer videos. These promotions also featured the ladders of learning background. In addition to this, a DOG was used on the channel, located in the top left of the screen, which displayed the web address for the channel, linking in with the interactive learning element, however this was replaced with the BBC Knowledge logo before too long.

Later on, the idents changed to follow a strand layout, with different idents for each strand. These featured an object, before a fact about it related to the strand appears and ends on an image with the strand name shown clearly on screen, with a letter encircled at the centre of the screen. It is unclear wether these idents were replacements of the animated idents, or complimentory to them, however it appears they complemented them, with these idents being used in the stranded sections, with the animated idents used for general interest programming.

Following the relaunch in 2001, all different idents were dropped in favour of a single ident, featuring numerous circles made out of different structures reflecting the new strands.

===BBC Four===
[[File:BBC Four 2002 ident.jpg|thumb|left|One of the improvised idents, used between 2002 and 2005]]
The BBC's &quot;cultural&quot; channel [[BBC Four]] was launched on 2 March 2002 as a successor to [[BBC Knowledge]]. The channel's first series of idents were [[Music visualization|dynamic and reacted to the frequencies of continuity announcers' voices or background music]]. As a result no idents were ever the same, however variations were produced featuring different visualisations, such as semi circles, vibrating lines or shafts extending from the bottom surface. Lambie-Nairn designed the idents, and also designed the presentational package around it. The channel also utilised a box logo of the colour black with a white BBC logo and the name ''Four'' beneath, which was placed in the bottom right corner of the screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVARK bbc4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Four Idents|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/otherchannels/bbcfour.html|publisher=TVARK|accessdate=31 July 2011}} Contains videos of the idents.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:BBC Four Pool.jpg|thumb|One of the idents introduced in 2005]]
A new set of idents designed by [[Red Bee Media]] were introduced in September 2005. These would begin with one apparently normal image that would break into four quarters, each showing a different view or reflection of the other. The music used is almost exactly the same in all idents. The box logo was kept, but moved to the centre of the screen to divide up the four sections. These idents featured scenes of Bees collecting [[pollen]], a child returning a library book to its shelves, a child paddling in a pool, a droplet against a mountain-side lake and seagulls in the sky. The screen were divided, so the child at the library may climb up a ladder from the bottom left section, and end up in the top right segment.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVARK bbc4&quot;/&gt;

The channel uses a DOG, which consists of a BBC logo with an uppercase ''Four'' to the right of it. This style of channel logo was used upon the channels launch and still is used to this day. Despite widescreen presentation introduced since the channels launch, the DOG has been placed for [[4:3]] screen sizes and was only changed in 2011 when it was switched to widescreen [[16:9]].

==BBC News==
===BBC News 24/BBC News Channel===
[[File:BBC News 24 1997.jpg|thumb|left|The original BBC News 24 ident incorporated fictional flags]]
The [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]] was launched as BBC News 24 at 5.30pm on 9 November 1997 as the BBC's domestic 24-hour news channel and sister to BBC World. Between 1997 and 1999, the channel used idents based upon fictional flags designed by Lambie-Nairn, and as also used by BBC World albeit with different music. Both channels used the simple logo, featuring the [[Logo of the BBC#1997|BBC logo]] and the brand name, at the bottom of the screen with the ident emphasis on the flags. The Countdown sequence used was various bits of information such as news and weather over a fictitious flag background.

[[File:BBC News 24 1999.jpg|thumb|All BBC News content shared a uniform style in 1999]]
A problem with BBC News output at the time, was that it was very much fragmented with different brands. BBC News bulletins, [[BBC Breakfast News]] and BBC News 24 all had separate identities. To solve this, a major relaunch of all [[BBC News]] television output, with the exception of Breakfast News, in 1999 saw the channel adopt a common theme with the rest of the BBC's main [[news bulletin]]s. The redesign involved a new cream and red [[colour scheme]] designed by Lambie-Nairn together with a large numeral, representing the time of the bulletin on the domestic bulletins, but replaced with '24' for the channel, as well as a variation on the new musical composition by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]. The music incorporated the [[BBC Pips]], used on [[BBC Radio 4]], and were vastly different to the standard orchestral accompaniments to most television news programmes at that time. The music itself received a reputation for being bold and different.

[[File:BBC News 24 2003.jpg|thumb|left|Between 2003 and 2007 the top of the hour sequence included the first news headline]]
In 2003 the channel was again relaunched with a new common BBC News style designed by an in-house production team featuring a deep red and black globe and background with bright white lettering. The top of the hour sequence incorporated the first news headline into ribbons that formed part of the BBC News ident style. The first look featured a '24' numeral made out of lines bending in on screen, and was more of a cream colour than the white used by other bulletins: this was rectified in 2004. Accompanying this look was a new designed countdown sequence, featuring videos of life around the UK, a small countdown clock, and also a small menu displaying the schedule of upcoming programmes. This was later altered in 2005 to the current theme of the elements involved in bringing the news to the air. It included specially filmed footage of journalists, cameramen and production staff around the UK and the world.

[[File:BBC News channel 2008.jpg|thumb|Following the name change in 2008 the graphics were also relaunched]]
An update to the BBC's graphics and playout systems in January 2007 also introduced new graphics for BBC News 24 and the news bulletins on BBC One. The new titles had the same look, feel and background reasoning as the previous but had been filmed again with new effects, while the graphics used maintained the previously introduced colour scheme. The new idents featured glossier graphics and rendering, with the ribbons being seen formed from different angles on the globe. 

Following a major new reorganisation of the BBC News department in April 2008 at a cost of Â£550,000, the channel was renamed BBC News, with other BBC channels referring to the channel as the BBC News Channel. New graphics and title sequences were introduced, similar to those from 1999 and created by Lambie-Nairn in partnership with BBC graphic designers. The design was based on a predominantly white and red colour scheme with a virtual surreal world made out of red ribbons, similar to the data streams used in the countdown sequences previously. The channel also moved into [[BBC Television Centre|studio N8 at Television Centre]], with the newly named [[BBC World News]] moving into their former home of N9.

===BBC Parliament===
[[File:BBC Parliament ident.jpg|thumb|left|The BBC Parliament ident, used between 2002 and 2009]]
[[BBC Parliament]] took over from the cable-only ''Parliamentary Channel'' on September 23, 1998. BBC Parliament transmits sessions of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], [[House of Lords]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[Welsh National Assembly]], and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], together with various other programmes of political interest during Parliamentary recesses which include occasional archive programming of past election results programmes and documentaries about past political events. BBC Parliament is a somewhat unusual channel in that for several years after it was founded the [[digital terrestrial television]] platform had insufficient bandwidth to allow the channel to transmit pictures, and it was restricted to sound-only transmissions with a fixed caption and from 2002 to 2006, only broadcasting a quarter-screen picture. Other platforms were unaffected.

[[File:BBCParliament Apr 2009.jpg|thumb|The current BBC Parliament ident used since 20 April 2009]]
The channels first on-screen branding featured the single line BBC Parliament logo over a background similar in style to water and accompanied by a orchestral musical score. This branding lasted until 2002, when it was replaced by a rotating spiral with regular teeth on the outside. As part of the sequence, occasional pulsating rings are emitted and the soundtrack is in a similar style to the David Lowe BBC News theme. During both these branding periods, a DOG was used in the top left of the screen, however was removed for live commons programming, with the [[Lower third|Aston]], a graphic added to the bottom of the screen, usually used to identify the channel or programme. Channel promotions were mainly unused by the channel, but when used featured the design introduced to BBC channels in 1997. 

The channel took on a variation of the corporate BBC News theme in 2008 with a new ident designed by Lambie-Nairn and accompanied by music by David Lowe. The ident features a series of cogs moving about in place of the world in the BBC News look. The cogs have a predominantly red look to them and was designed to be an interpretation of the inner workings of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. It mirrors elements of the BBC News presentation, indicating it is similar to, but not part of BBc News output. The DOG was also moved to the [[lower third]] of the screen as part of the change, in a similar style to the BBC News graphics.

===BBC World News===
[[File:BBC World 1995.jpg|thumb|BBC World in 1995 had a completely different style of presentation to BBC News in the UK]]
[[BBC World News]], the BBC's international 24-hour news and current affairs channel was launched in 16 January 1995 at 8.00pm, following the split of the former international channel [[BBC World Service Television]]. BBC World Service Television became two different channels, [[BBC Prime]] dedicated to entertainment and [[BBC World]] dedicated to the latest News and current affairs programmes, including such programmes such as [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]].

[[File:BBCworldident1999.jpg|thumb|left|The channel adopted the BBC News style in 1999]]
The channel has shared a common appearance with domestic news channel [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News 24]] since 1997, when both used the fictitious flags idents with different music. The channels, based within the News Centre at [[BBC Television Centre]] in West London, swapped studios in 1999 and remained in their studios until 2008.

Following the major BBC News relaunch in 1999 across all output, the channel received an individual style based upon the theme introduced with graphics created by the Lambie-Nairn branding agency and music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]. These idents featured similar music, and a red ident using the rotational element, and also included rings in the design.

A subsequent relaunch of BBC News bulletins came in 2003 with new graphics and titles, produced by designers within the BBC itself. This design was subsequently updated in 2007. In both of these cases the design was the same as the idents and titles used by their counterparts in BBC News 24 and in BBC News as a whole.

In April 2008 as part of a major Â£550,000 relaunch of BBC News output by Lambie-Nairn, BBC World became 'BBC World News' and was updated in its look to match that used by all BBC news output, the BBC News Channel as well as other international BBC channels like [[BBC World News America]], and [[BBC Persian Television]]

==CBBC==
{{main|BBC Children's idents}}
[[CBBC]], originally Children's BBC, can trace its roots back to the &quot;Children's Hour&quot; of the original BBC Television Service. As a strand of programming for children aged 6â13 with distinctive programme presentation on BBC1, &quot;Children's BBC&quot; first appeared in September 1985. These first idents consisted of Children's on top of a large BBC is the a similar style to a rushed scribble. The original idents were generated live on air by a [[BBC Micro]] computer. However, 2 years after launch, the Idents were replaced by an animated sequence of the letters spelling out Children's with an outline of an object corresponding to that letter, such as Elephant, Rocket, Ice Cream etc. This animated sequence was used because of the limited abilities of the BBC Micro Computer. However, computer generated idents returned in 1990 as computer generated idents had become more flexible.

In 1991, the BBC corporate revamp meant that Children's BBC was given a makeover. The result was a logo centred on a stylised Children's with a corporate BBC logo at the bottom of the screen. The Children's was arranged so that every other letter was larger than normal and in the style of a neon sign. This logo remained with Children's BBC for 6 years. In 1994, the Children's BBC idents changed in style. Many featured cartoons or computer generated graphics where the stylised Children's and the BBC corporate logo would feature somewhere. There was also a general Children's BBC ident which was a 3D version of the former.

Children's BBC was officially renamed CBBC in October 1997, with the production of appropriate idents. The idents all had a yellow background, with the black outlines of the various cartoons. Many idents were created up to 2002: 'Snail', 'Cat and Mouse', 'Octopus', 'Dragon', 'Fish' and 'Mouse', to name a few.

When CBBC was given its own channel on the digital terrestrial platform on 11 February 2002, the CBBC &quot;blob&quot; ident was created. These animated 'bugs' were designed by Lambie-Nairn, and were always green in colour. Idents included 'Karate', 'Multiply', 'Dance' and 'Splat'. The blob was later refreshed and given a 3D appearance in 2005. The blob idents are still airing on [[BBC Kids]] in Canada (the blob idents were first aired on that channel), but the blobs are yellow instead of green.

In December 2006, CBBC moved from Studio TC9, its home since 1997, to TC12 within BBC Television Centre. The use of a set was replaced by a new virtual set consisting of presenter standing in front of a [[bluescreen]] while only a fixed camera is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/idents/cbbc.htm | title = CBBC | publisher = TV &amp; Radio Bits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBBC relaunched again in the autumn of 2007, with a new logo revolving around the letters of CBBC, each in a different style. A new set of idents followed these up, revolving around scenes including each of the 4 letters before coming together at the end. These scenes could involve cartoon figures, or stars of current CBBC programmes.  More idents of the same style were added in March and October 2008 with two more being released in early 2009 relating to the third series of [[M.I.High]] and new series [[Richard Hammond's Blast Lab]]. In 2010, the logo was updated to look more 3D, and the idents and promotions were updated to include this new 3D logo ending.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==CBeebies==
{{main|BBC Children's idents}}
[[File:CBeebies.svg|200px|thumb|right|The channel's logo, in use since 2002-2011]]
[[CBeebies]] was launched on the same day as the CBBC Channel: 11 February 2002, with an original age range of pre-school children only. Following changes within the [[BBC Children's]] department, this changed to ages up to 8, with CBBC targeting ages 8 to 12.

The idents for the channel, designed by Lambie-Nairn, are the same as at launch and consist of yellow blobs, the opposite to the green blobs launched with the CBBC Channel with a much younger feel, as befits the target audience. The yellow blobs were also seen in BBC Kids' current idents. They directly oppose the CBBC blobs, as these blobs are gentle in their actions and to look at, whereas the green CBBC blobs looked more outgoing and violent - one of the CBBC idents at the time involved karate.

Continuity links are not presented by the CBeebies directors, but are recorded rather than broadcast live.
