'''UNIX System III''' (sometimes called '''System 3''') was a version of the [[Unix]] operating system released by [[AT&amp;T]]'s Unix Support Group (USG). It was first released outside of [[Bell Labs]] in 1982. UNIX System III was a mix of various AT&amp;T Unixes: [[PWB/UNIX]] 2.0, [[CB UNIX]] 3.0, [[UNIX/TS]] 3.0.1 and [[UNIX/32V]]. System III supported the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] and [[VAX]] computers.

The system was apparently called System III because it was considered the outside release of UNIX/TS 3.0.1 and CB UNIX 3 which were internally supported Bell Labs Unices. Its documentation calls it '''UNIX Edition 3.0''' and there were no Unix versions called System I or System II. There was no official release of UNIX/TS 4.0 (which would have been ''System IV'') either, so System III was succeeded by [[UNIX System V|System V]], based on UNIX/TS 5.0.

System III introduced new features such as [[named pipes]], the [[uname]] system call and command, and the [[run queue]]. It also combined various improvements to [[Version 7]] by outside organizations. However, it did not include notable improvements made in [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] such as the [[C shell]] (csh) and screen editing.

Third-party variants of System III include (early versions of) [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[Interactive Systems Corporation|IS/3]], [[PC-UX]], [[PERQ|PNX]], [[SINIX]], [[Venix]] and [[Xenix]].
