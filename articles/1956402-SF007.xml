'''Microsoft Internet Explorer 2''' (abbreviated as '''IE2''') is a graphical [[web browser]] released on November 22, 1995 by [[Microsoft]] for [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows NT]] and in April 1996 for [[Apple Macintosh]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/comp1996.htm|title=Chronology of Personal Computers|accessdate=14 February 2011|date=1 January 2011|first=Ken|last=Polsson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2011}} and [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]].

Version 2 launched with twelve languages including English but this expanded to 24 for Windows 95, 20 for Windows 3.1, and 9 for the Macintosh by April 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;apr96ms&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=14 February 2011|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/apr96/iemompr.mspx|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer Web Browser Available on All Major Platforms, Offers Broadest International Support|date=30 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lacked many features that became common in later IE versions, including the Blue 'e' logo, integration with [[Windows Explorer]], and bundled programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Its market share was also much lower than later versions. During its tenure, IE market share only went up to about roughly 3-9% by mid 1996, before IE3 came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9810/08/browser.idg/|title=Behind the numbers: Browser market share|date=8 October 1998|accessdate=15 February 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|first=Maryann Jones|last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ews.uiuc.edu/bstats/months/9606-month.html|title=Browser Statistics for June 1996|accessdate=15 February 2011|first=Ed|last=Kubaitis|publisher=[[University of Illinois at UrbanaâChampaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 2 is no longer available for download from Microsoft. However, [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/2.0/msie20.exe the archive 32-bit version] is publicly available on the Evolt.org browser archive.

==History==
IE replicated many of the quirks of [[Netscape Navigator]], and allowed importing bookmarks from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;macuser&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|issue=12 18|month=September|year=1996|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050325180847/http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16110/microsoft-internet-explorer-21.html|archivedate=25 March 2005|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.1|url=http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16110/microsoft-internet-explorer-21.html|accessdate=15 February 2011|publisher=[[MacUser]]|first=Jack|last=Weber}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1996 [[FTP Software]] announced it was providing Microsoft with various technology for [[Internet Explorer]] 2.0 for [[Windows 3.1]], including a PPP network, 16-bit email client, and other technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftpsoftware&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_May_1/ai_18237333/|title=FTP Software to provide key technology for Microsoft's Internet Explorer Version 2.0 for Windows 3.1|date=1 May 1996|accessdate=15 February 2011|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Availability===
Internet Explorer version 2 was released in beta in October 1995, only 2 months after version 1 came out in [[Microsoft Plus!]] for 95 that August. It was released for Windows 95 and [[Windows NT 3.5]] in November 1995 and was bundled with [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]] in July 1996. The Beta for Mac on [[PowerPC]] came out in January, and the finalized version in April for [[68k]] and PowerPC. Version 2 was also the first release for [[Windows 3.1]] and Macintosh [[System 7|System 7.0.1]](PPC or 68k), although the Mac version was not released until January 1996 for PPC, and April for 68k.&lt;ref name=&quot;Computer History&quot;/&gt; Version 2 was included in Windows 95 [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] Service Release (OSR 1) and Microsoft's ''Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95'' in early 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;apr96ms&quot; /&gt; It launched with twelve languages including English but this expanded to 24, 20, and 9 for Win 95, Win 3.1 and Mac respectively by April 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;apr96ms&quot;/&gt; The 2.0i version supported [[DBCS|double-byte character-sets]] for supporting Japanese, Korean, Polish or Russian characters in [[web pages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;apr96ms&quot;/&gt; Version 2.1 for the Mac came out in August 1996, the same month version 2 for Windows was superseded by Microsoft [[Internet Explorer 3]], which was heavily changed from version 2.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} There were [[16-bit application|16-bit]] and [[32-bit application|32-bit]] versions depending on the OS.

===Mac version===
The Mac version, especially version 2.1, was praised for being economic with resources and for new features.&lt;ref name=&quot;macuser&quot; /&gt; Internet Explorer supported the embedding of a number of multimedia formats into web pages, including [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] and [[QuickTime]] formatted video and [[AIFF]], [[Midi]] and [[WAV]] formatted audio.&lt;ref name=&quot;macuser&quot; /&gt; The non-beta final version was released three months later on April 23, 1996.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Version 2.1 fixed bugs and improving stability, but also added a few features such as support for the [[NPAPI]] (the first version of Internet Explorer on any platform to do so) and support for [[QuickTime VR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;macuser&quot; /&gt; [[AOL]] 3.0 for Macintosh used the IE 2.1 rendering engine in its built-in web browser. The various 16 and 32 bit versions largely depended on the OS although Windows NT would use the 16 bit versions for Windows 3.1.
{{quote|Netscape has enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the browser market (about 90% according to some estimates), and this has allowed it to consolidate its position still further by introducing unofficial or 'extended' HTML tags. As a result, the Web is littered with pages that only work effectively if viewed in Navigator. By the time other browsers catch up, Netscape has made even more additions.|Jack Weber|MacUser 1996&lt;ref name=&quot;macuser&quot; /&gt;}}

==Features==
IE2 introduced new or improved features for its time period. Many soon became ubiquitous (such as cookies) while other features became obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;winhist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryIE.mspx|accessdate=10 February 2011|title=Windows History|publisher=Microsoft|date=30 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iehist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/community/columns/historyofie.mspx|title=The History of Internet Explorer |publisher=Microsoft|first=Sandi|last=Hardmeier|date=25 August 2005|accessdate=9 February 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090418194454/http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/community/columns/historyofie.mspx |archivedate=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
