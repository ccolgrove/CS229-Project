The '''University of Rhode Island (URI)''' is the principal public research university in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Rhode Island]]. Its main campus is located in [[Kingston, Rhode Island|Kingston]]. Additional campuses include the Feinstein Campus in Providence, the Narragansett Bay Campus in Narragansett, and the W. Alton Jones Campus in West Greenwich. URI currently enrolls 14,546 undergraduate and 4,549 graduate students. It is a [[Land-grant university|land grant]], [[Sea Grant Colleges|sea grant]], and urban grant institution. [[US News and World Report]] classifies URI as a tier 1 national university, ranking it 160th overall.

== History ==
The University was first chartered as the state's agricultural school and agricultural experiment station in 1888. The site of the school was originally the Oliver Watson Farm, the original farmhouse of which is still maintained as a small museum. In 1892, the school became known as the '''Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts'''. The first class had only seventeen students, each completing their course of study in two years. In 1909, the school's name was again changed to '''Rhode Island State College''' as the school's programs were expanded beyond its original agricultural education mandate. In 1951 the school was given its current title through an act of the General Assembly following the addition of the College of Arts and Sciences and the offering of doctoral degrees. The Board of Governors for Higher Education, appointed by the governor, became the governing body of the University in 1981. The current president is David Dooley.[http://www.uri.edu/home/about/history_timeline.html]

== Academics ==
Located in a traditional New England college town, URI offers students a land, sea and urban experience. Students can choose from over 80 majors within ten different colleges. Among the most popular majors at URI are Nursing, Communication Studies, Psychology, Kinesiology and Human Development &amp; Family Studies.  URI is well known for its nursing and engineering programs, the latter of which includes the internationally recognized{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} International Engineering Program. The University also boasts nationally ranked programs in Pharmacy, Landscape Architecture and Oceanography. 

The University of Rhode Island Department of [[Environmental economics|Environmental]] and [[Natural resource economics|Natural Resource Economics]] has been ranked the fourth most productive research department in the country in the field of agricultural economics by the 2005 [[Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index]]. Only [[Colorado State University]], [[Iowa State University]] and the [[University of California at Berkeley]] ranked ahead of URI. Of the top 10 universities in the field, URIâs program has the fewest faculty members with 10.The URI program was the first in the nation to offer a graduate degree in natural resource economics (in 1969), and the department publishes an internationally recognized research journal, Marine Resource Economics. Agricultural and natural resource economists study the interactions between economic and natural systems, with the goal of developing a sustainable and efficient economy. Faculty in the URI department focus on issues related to the spectrum of natural resource and environmental management, with particular strengths in [[fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]], the [[marine environment]], coastal [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] and [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, [[ecosystem valuation]] and [[international trade]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;URI1&quot; /&gt;
