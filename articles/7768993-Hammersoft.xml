The '''Virginia Cavaliers football''' team represents the [[University of Virginia]] in the sport of [[American football]].  The Cavaliers compete in the [[Division I (NCAA)#Division I-Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Atlantic Coast Conference#Divisions|Coastal Division]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC).  Established in 1888, and playing local [[YMCA]] teams and other state teams without pads, the Virginia football program has evolved into a multimillion dollar operation that plays in front of 61,500 fans at [[Scott Stadium]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].

The Cavaliers have three major rivals in football: [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]], [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]], and [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]].  The ACC's longest series is the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]] between Virginia and North Carolina.  The Cavaliers also compete for the [[Commonwealth Cup]] against Virginia Tech and play in the [[Beltway Brawl]] against Maryland.  While Virginia has played North Carolina more times (116) than any other rival, all of these programsâMaryland, North Carolina, and Virginia Techâconsider Virginia to be their longest-standing rival.

==History==
===Beginnings===
[[Image:Edwin E Alderman.jpg|right|thumb|Former University of Virginia President Edwin Alderman]]

The story of football at UVA actually begins in the fall of 1886, when two graduate students at the University, former Yale student Charles Willcox who was attending medical school at UVA, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Outing/Volume_25/outXXV03/outXXV03p.pdf 1893-Football in the South]&lt;/ref&gt; and former Princeton student, Richard Reid Rogers &lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |title= University of Virginia Football Vault |last= Ratcliffe |first= Jerry |year=2008 |publisher= Whitman Publishing, LLC|location= Atlanta, Ga.|isbn= 9780794826475|page= 7 |url= http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u4812190|}}&lt;/ref&gt; who matriculated to the law school, introduced the sport at Mr. Jefferson's University. After seeing the success of Princeton and Yale during their undergraduate careers, these two men brought a wealth of knowledge about this burgeoning sport to an area of the country that had no college football teams: the South.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= University of Virginia Football Vault |last= Ratcliffe |first= Jerry |year=2008 |publisher= Whitman Publishing, LLC|location= Atlanta, Ga.|isbn= 9780794826475|page= 7 |url= http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u4812190|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at UVA were playing pickup games of the kicking-style of football as early as 1870, and some accounts even claim that some industrious ones organized a game against Washington and Lee College in 1871, just two years after Rutgers and Princeton's historic first game in 1869.  But no record has been found of the score of this contest. In 1874, University students were introduced to the sport of rugby when they played to a scoreless tie against a team of Englishmen from Albemarle County. Eight years later, in November, 1883, a football club was reorganized, a constitution drawn up, and officers elected. 75 men competed against one another, but not against another collegiate club. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= University of Virginia Football Vault |last= Ratcliffe |first= Jerry |year=2008 |publisher= Whitman Publishing, LLC|location= Atlanta, Ga.|isbn= 9780794826475|page= 7 |url= http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u4812190|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Magazine describes how &quot;pluck is cultivated by throttling one's competitor and violently throwing him to the ground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u1968212 1870, University Literary Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in the fall of 1887, Willcox and Reid, after garnering interest in their fellow students throughout the year, helped Virginia put its first regularly organized team in the field. But, being the first, and only, collegiate team in the South, they had had no one to play. Fortunately, Pantops Academy, a boys' school founded just up the road from the UVA Grounds, agreed to a game on November 13, 1887. After playing to a scoreless tie, a rematch was scheduled for March of 1888. The historic first touchdown was scored by quarterback Herbert Barry and the University won 26â0. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= University of Virginia Football Vault |last= Ratcliffe |first= Jerry |year=2008 |publisher= Whitman Publishing, LLC|location= Atlanta, Ga.|isbn= 9780794826475|page= 8 |url= http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u4812190|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, on December 8, 1888, UVa would play their first intercollegiate game, a 26â0 loss to Johns Hopkins. The loss did not dampen their enthusiasm for the sport. Virginia returned the favor with a 58â0 drubbing of Hopkins the following season when they went 4â2, with a 180â4 margin in its victories and two close losses to an eight-win Lehigh team and Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginiasports.com//pdf1/136226.pdf 2008 UVa Football Media Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lambeth Field===
Work began in 1901 on {{convert|21|acre|m2|sing=on}} Lambeth Field, propelling sports development at UVA. Lambeth Field was named after William Lambeth, a professor at the University of Virginia, and one of the participants in the major rules committees that were enacted to make football a safer sport. The trend was not welcome in all corners, however, according to University historian [[Philip Alexander Bruce]], who wrote disparagingly of the arrival of &quot;professional athletes in disguise&quot; from all over the country. School President [[Edwin Alderman]], though a tireless proponent of college football, was significantly alarmed to appoint an investigating committee in 1904, and a strict athletic code was written in 1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;bruce-athletic-code&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ia350633.us.archive.org/2/items/historyofunivers05brucuoft/historyofunivers05brucuoft_djvu.txt |last=Bruce |first=Philip Alexander |authorlink=Philip Alexander Bruce |title=History of the University of Virginia: The Lengthening Shadow of One Man |location=New York |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing|Macmillan]] |year=1921 |volume=V |pages=293â296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coaching Carousel===
Between 1900 and 1915 saw Virginia change coaches 10 times and achieve 10 winning seasons with help from a quarterback named [[Bobby Gooch|Robert K. &quot;Bobby&quot; Gooch]] and a Walter Camp [[All-America]] [[running back|halfback]] named [[Eugene N. &quot;Buck&quot; Mayer]]. Season tickets were $7.50 for students and $9.50 for alumni when 8,000-seat Lambeth Stadium opened in 1913, with a price tag of $35,000. The season began with three home shutout victories for Virginia, followed later in the season by a home game with [[Vanderbilt Commodores|Vanderbilt]] that was billed as ''The Football Classic of the South''. Trainloads of alumni rolled into [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] to watch Virginia crush the Commodores, 34â0, at Lambeth's dedication.

===1900â1920===
For years hence, it was traditional to designate &quot;a greatest home game&quot; each season. In 1914, it was [[Georgia Bulldogs|Georgia]]âa &quot;Rally 'Round [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|the Rotunda]]&quot; won by UVA, 28â0, in a drizzle, as [[Bobby Gooch]] &quot;general-led his men with rare ability,&quot; the Alumni News gushed.

[[Image:University of Virginia Rotunda.jpg|right|thumb|The Rotunda]]
Betting was heavy on [[Yale]] for a 1915 game that ranked as the biggest all-time win at that stage of Virginia's history. No Southern team had ever defeated the [[Ivy League]] power until Virginiaâled by quarterback Norborne Berkeley and Buck Mayerâwon 10â0 in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Headlines in the Charlottesville Daily Progress read, &quot;Yale Bowl a Soup TureenâVirginia Eleven Serves Dish of Bulldog Stew!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyprogress.com Charlottesville Daily Progress]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University's first-ever losing football season occurred the next year, including a 61â3 payback at [[Yale]]. &quot;Played them too early in the season,&quot; moaned a 1916 Alumni News. Questions about the role of athletics were cast aside in 1917, dwarfed by a larger battlefront now known as World War I. Athletics were curtailed in 1917 and 1918 &quot;in an effort to adapt this University to the stern necessities of a people at war,&quot; according to the [[Corks &amp; Curls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://corksandcurls.com/index.htm Corks and Curls Yearbook web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The war ended, enrollment began to rebuild, and football practice resumed in 1919 with only two lettermen. &quot;All Trains Lead to Charlottesville!&quot; proclaimed posters promoting the &quot;Great Post War Gathering of Virginia Alumni&quot; for the November 15, 1919, home game with [[Vanderbilt Commodores|Vanderbilt]]. UVA lost, 10â6, and dropped the traditional Thanksgiving Day game with [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] to finish the &quot;start-up&quot; season at 2â5â2.

In December 1919, Dr. [[Rice Warren]] was hired as coach in 1920. Warren led the 1920 squad to a 5â2â2 record. UVA also joined the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] in 1920, but left with many SIAA teams to form the [[Southern Conference]] in 1921. Rice Warren's tenure ended before the 1922 season, and new coach [[Thomas Campbell (coach)|Thomas Campbell]] guided the team to a 4â4â1 recordânot so mediocre considering the '21 team had managed only three points in its final four games.

===Beginning of the Cavaliers===
University teams became the [[Virginia Cavaliers]] around 1923, and the leader of the first &quot;official Cavs&quot; was [[Earle &quot;Greasy&quot; Neale]]. Although his 1923 record was 3â5â1, his teams enjoyed winning records from 1924â27 before falling to 2â6â1 in 1928. Student indifference ran high, participation ran low, and Neale resigned after the [[1928|'28]] season.

[[Earl Abell]] took the football reins for two years in the midst of another athletic department reshuffle. The position of athletic director was created, and [[James G. Driver]]âa three-year letterman at UVaâwas named Athletic Director.

Lambeth Field was outgrown by the spring of 1930, as varsity and first-year teams in [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[lacrosse]] attempted to practice there. UVA historian [[Virginius Dabney]] related that spring football workouts were stopped due to the javelins and discus throwers.&lt;ref name=&quot;dabney-javelins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dabney |first=Virginius |authorlink=Virginius Dabney |url=http://repo.lib.virginia.edu:18080/fedora/get/uva-lib:178665/uva-lib-bdef:100/getFullView |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=[[Charlottesville]] |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=081390904X |pages=191â192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New stadium===
[[Image:Scott Stadium.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Scott Stadium]]
The University began negotiating to obtain land for a new sports site, and plans were finalized for [[Scott Stadium]] to open in October 1931. Land for practice fields between Ivy Road and the [[C&amp;O Railroad]] tracks also was acquired.

Support for UVA football had become spasmodicâeven fraternity brothers were betting openly against the Cavaliersâaround 1930, but in 1931, a dynamic new coach named [[Fred Dawson]] buoyed spirits. Losing seasons and a lack of athletic scholarships took a toll on Dawson's enthusiasm, however, and he quit after [[1933|'33]] and was succeeded by [[Gus Tebell]].

Just as frustrated at the dearth of notable wins was University President [[Edwin Alderman|Edwin Anderson Alderman]], who impaneled a committee to study the situation. Virginia decided in 1936 to resign from the [[Southern Conference]], which prohibited players from being paid, in order to be able to offer sports scholarships.

Tebell bowed out after three losing seasons, succeeded in 1937 by [[Frank Murray]]. Although the Cavaliers went 2â7 during Murray's first year, the team produced a state championship and near hysteria in the student body in 1938 with a 4â4â1 record.

===WWII years===
The 1940s were a time of mixed success for the Cavaliersâlargely thanks to the large numbers of students who served in the armed forcesâbut it was also known as the era of &quot;Bullet Bill.&quot;
[[William McGarvey Dudley]], a 168-pounder from [[Bluefield, Virginia]], is often called the best ever to wear a Virginia uniform. Dudley, who wore jersey number 35, ran, passed, kicked, blocked, tackled, and intercepted his way to [[All America]] honors.

Under Murray, the 1940 teamârunning out of a T-formationâwent 4â5, but improved to 8â1 in 1941, the only loss a 21â19 upset at [[Yale]]. In his final game as a Cavalier, Dudley scored 22 points at [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]] in a [[Thanksgiving]] classic broadcast nationally. After a 28â7 UVA win, his teammates carried him off the field. Dudley finished fifth in the 1941 [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting. Murray's 1942 squad dropped to 2â6â1, having lost 29 players to graduation and &quot;scholarshipping for Uncle Sam.&quot;

Until the war ended in 1945, UVA football functioned with makeshift teamsâguest stars from other schools enrolled in the University's military units and were thus eligible to play. In spite of a 7â2 season, Frank Murray left, succeeded in 1946 by [[Art Guepe]], who coached seven years with a winning record.

===Post-war years===
In 1947, Virginia defeated [[Harvard]], 47â0, with a team that featured [[John Papit]], [[George Neff]], and [[Bob &quot;Rock&quot; Weir]]. The game was significant because UVA was facing its first-ever black playerâHarvard's Chester Pierce.&lt;ref name=&quot;rt-pierce&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcps.org/ss/5thgrade/gamethree.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=Game Three: October 11, 1947, UVA vs Harvard |last=Hudson |first=Mike |work=[[Roanoke Times]] |date=1997-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gridiron success of the late '40s continued into the early '50s, as Guepe teamsâwith Papit, [[Joe Palumbo]], and [[Tom Scott (NFL player)|Tom Scott]] winning All-America honorsâlost only five games from 1950 through 1952. Virginia routinely finished ranked in the top ten schools in the country.

The Guepe years ended after the 1952 season, when the coach was wooed away by [[Vanderbilt Commodores|Vanderbilt]] in the wake of University President Colgate Darden's refusal to allow Virginia to participate in any postseason football play. Virginia had just escaped being banned permanently from the NCAA for granting athletic scholarships to student athletes, which was illegal at that time. The NCAA's &quot;Sanity Rules&quot; mandated that college athletes were required to work for their tuition, though this rule was often openly flouted (for instance, prior to the 1950 Rose Bowl, it was revealed that at least 16 Ohio State Buckeye football players had cushy jobs with the state of Ohio, including a running back on the payroll of the stateâs transportation department as a tire inspector&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watterson|first=John|title=University of Virginia Football 1951-1961: A Perfect Gridiron Storm|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2007/JSH3403/jsh3403f.pdf|work=Journal of Sports History|publisher=James Madison University}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

President Darden made a principled argument against the statute, noting the example of teams such as Ohio State, and stated unequivocally that his school had no intention of following the Code as it enabled the powerhouse schools of the Big Ten and SEC to ignore academics and essentially pay to retain football talent. While UVA (along with traditional UVA rivals Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Maryland, and Boston College) escaped being banned from NCAA play, President Darden was concerned about the effect of &quot;big time football&quot; on the academical status of the University. After the 1951 football season, in which UVA only lost one game, the Virginia Cavaliers found themselves invited to the Cotton Bowl, which President Darden promptly declined, setting a precedent not broken for thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watterson|first=John|title=University of Virginia Football 1951-1961: A Perfect Gridiron Storm|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2007/JSH3403/jsh3403f.pdf|work=Journal of Sports History|publisher=James Madison University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1951, professor Miles Gooch wrote the &quot;Gooch Report&quot;, which requested that UVA abolish its football program and discontinue giving athletic scholarships. While President Darden was opposed to entirely abolishing the football program or athletic scholarships, he did diminish the number of athletic scholarships given by 80%. The next year, the Cavaliers' record plunged to 1â8.

===Joining the ACC===
Heated arguments ensued about whether Virginia should join the Atlantic Coast Conference. Athletic Director and former football coach Gus Tebell and President Darden differed sharplyâTebell in favor, Darden worried about the league's academic standards and the belief that Virginia should only align with other Virginia schoolsâand the Board of Visitors backed Tebell. Virginia was admitted into the ACC on December 4, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacc.com/this-is/acc-this-is.html This Is the ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference site)]&lt;/ref&gt; The first 9 years in the ACC brought 9 losing seasons and a 28-game losing streak (the second worst in NCAA FBS history), lasting from the third game of 1958 until the opening game of 1961. The streak ended in front of 18,000 fans in [[Scott Stadium]] on opening day of the 1961 season. Virginia beat [[College of William and Mary|William &amp; Mary]] 21â6.

===Integration===
In 1970, [[George Blackburn]]'s last year, UVA's football program was integrated for the first time, with the signing of Harrison Davis, Stanley Land, Kent Merritt, and John Rainey.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Their Growing Role in History: U.Va. players first, trailblazers later, even 40 years later,&quot; ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'', 24 Nov. 2011, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn was replaced by [[Don Lawrence]], who suffered through three consecutive losing seasons between 1971 and 1973. Lawrence was succeeded by [[Ulmo Shannon &quot;Sonny&quot; Randle]], UVa '59. [[Astroturf]] was laid at Scott Stadium in May 1974 and the team still had a losing season, going 4â7.

After a disastrous 1â10 season in 1975, Athletic Director [[Eugene Corrigan]] fired Randle and hired [[Dick Bestwick]] in 1976. Bestwick proved to be popular with players, alumni, and faculty until the team suffered five losing seasons in six years. Bestwick was dismissed by Athletic Director [[Dick Schultz]] after the 1981 season.

===The George Welsh era===
Head Coach [[George Welsh (American football)|George Welsh]] was hired for the start of the 1982 season, leaving the same position at the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. He spent years as an assistant coach under [[Joe Paterno]] and brought a winning tradition in his 19 years at the helm.

After going 2â9 and 6â5 in his first two campaigns, Welsh guided the Cavaliers to an 8â2-2 season in 1984 with a 27â24 [[Peach Bowl]] win over [[Purdue Boilermakers|Purdue]] representing UVA's first-ever bowl appearance and win.

Many UVA firsts continued under George Welsh:
* First-ever unanimous All-America choiceâ1985, [[offensive tackle]] [[Jim Dombrowski]]
* First 10-win seasonâ1989, 10â3
* First ACC Championshipâ1989
* First time ranked #1â1990, 4 weeks
* First team to beat Florida State in ACC playâ1995

In 1985 and 1986 the Cavs did not go to bowl games. In 1987 they started 3â4 but would win the last five games to finish 8â4 with an All-American Bowl win over BYU. In 1988 the Cavs started 2â4 but would win their last five games to finish 7â4 with no bowl game. The 1989 season was the greatest season in school history, with a record of 10â3 overall, and the winning of the program's first ACC championship.  Virginia would go on to lose the Florida Citrus Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl in school history.

Virginia, wearing new uniforms for the first time in 10 years and only the second time in head coach George Welsh's tenure, enjoyed one of the finest seasons in their history in 1994.
Most noticeably, the team switched from white helmets with orange and blue stripes down the middle to dark blue helmets with a &quot;V&quot; over two crossed sabres on the sides.  The V-Sabre logo was designed by Coach Welsh's son Matt. The rest of the uniform changed from predominantly orange and white to predominantly blue and white.

Representing a major athletic facility improvement, the [[artificial turf]] at [[Scott Stadium]] was removed and replaced with natural grass before the start of the 1995 season. Artificial turf was first installed at Scott Stadium in 1974. David A. Harrison III Field was dedicated September 2, 1995, at Virginia's home opener against William &amp; Mary. In 1995, the Cavaliers won their second ACC title.

Citing concerns about his health as a primary reason for his decision, Welsh announced his retirement in a press conference on December 11, 2000, where he said simply &quot;I am now, and forever will be, a Wahoo.&quot; Welsh stepped down at Virginia at the age of 67 after establishing himself as the winningest coach in UVA and ACC history. He compiled a 19-year record of 134â86â3 at Virginia, including a conference-record 80 ACC wins. Welsh led the Cavaliers to 12 bowl games and 14 consecutive years of winning at least 7 games.

===The Al Groh era===
With the retirement of a UVA legend, the Virginia faithful were looking for a new coach who could bring the same success to the team that George Welsh maintained throughout his tenure. On December 30, 2000, Virginia hired [[New York Jets]] head coach and former Virginia player [[Al Groh]]. His first year was a rebuilding year with the team going 5â7.  Groh then led the Cavaliers to four consecutive winning seasons from 2002 to 2005, including a 3â1 record in bowl games.  The 2002 squad saw the breakout season of quarterback [[Matt Schaub]], who led the Cavaliers to a 9â5 season capped by a 48â22 blowout of [[West Virginia Mountaineers|West Virginia]] in the [[2002 Continental Tire Bowl|Continental Tire Bowl]]. The 2003 team faced adversity with an early season injury to Schaub, but the team rallied to finish the year 8â5, including a victory over [[Pitt Panthers|Pittsburgh]] in the [[2003 Continental Tire Bowl]]. The 2004 team reached #6 in national polls after a 5â0 start, the Cavaliers' highest ranking since 1990, but they lost 36â3 at #7 Florida State and finished 8â4 after an upset loss to [[Fresno State]] in the [[MPC Computers Bowl]]. The 2005 team finished with a 7â5 record, but included Virginia's second-ever victory over Florida State and a win over [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]] in the [[2005 Music City Bowl|Music City Bowl]]. The [[2006 Virginia Cavaliers football team|2006 squad's]] record slipped to 5â7. In 2007 the [[2007 Virginia Cavaliers football team|team]] went 9â3 for the season, including a 48â0 shutout of the [[Miami Orange Bowl#Final year and demolition|University of Miami]] in the Hurricanes' last home game in the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl Stadium]], as well as setting an [[NCAA]] record for wins by two points or fewer (five).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/08-acc-football-12days-va.html Official ACC Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining an invitation to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], for the [[2008 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]], they subsequently lost 28â31 to [[2007 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech]].  For 2008, the [[2008 Virginia Cavaliers football team|team]] started with several big losses, but went on to win four games in a row before losing the last four of the season, finishing 5â7. Virginia's 2009 campaign under Groh started with a stunning 26â14 loss to [[2009 William &amp; Mary Tribe football team|William &amp; Mary]] of the FCS (formerly I-AA). It was UVA's first loss to a I-AA team since losing to William &amp; Mary 41â37 in 1986.

==Memorable games==
===Virginia 20 â Clemson 7===
Prior to the arrival of George Welsh, Clemson dominated the series against Virginia. The Tigers had not lost a single game to the Cavaliers and most games were blowouts. Former Clemson coach [[Frank Howard (football coach)|Frank Howard]] had referred to the Cavaliers as &quot;White Meat&quot; back in the 1960s and they hadn't lost to Virginia since. Despite Welsh's success, the Tigers' record against the Cavaliers stood at 29â0 after Clemson defeated the 1989 Virginia team that captured the ACC championship. Behind a high-powered offense with [[Shawn Moore]], [[Herman Moore]], and [[Terry Kirby]] and a strong defensive effort led by Chris Slade, the Cavaliers finally defeated Clemson, which was ranked in the top ten at the time, in the second game of the 1990 season. The win propelled the Cavaliers' rise in the polls, which culminated in a number-one ranking in late October.

===Virginia 33 â Florida State 28===
UVa managed to win its share of close games as the 1995 season unfolded, including a 33â28 upset victory over second-ranked and previously unbeaten [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]]. Playing on national television in the first-ever Thursday night game in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia stopped the Seminoles at the goal line on the game's final play to preserve the win. With the victory, the Cavaliers ended FSU's four-year, 29-game winning streak against ACC teams since joining the conference in 1992. Florida State became the highest-ranked team to ever fall to the Cavaliers. Virginia and Florida State were later crowned co-ACC champions after finishing the season with identical 7â1 conference records.

===Virginia 20 â North Carolina 17===
During a generally disappointing 1996 season, the Cavaliers upset the top tenâranked Tar Heels at Scott Stadium. In the fourth quarter, North Carolina led Virginia 17â3 and, having advanced within the Cavaliers' five-yard line, were about to put the game away. However, Virginia cornerback [[Antwan Harris]] intercepted a Tar Heel pass in the end zone and returned it 100 yards for a touchdown. Quarterback Tim Sherman then led the Cavaliers to another ten points, capped by Rafael Garcia's late game field goal, and the defense shut down the demoralized Tar Heels for a stunning 20â17 comeback victory. The defeat cost North Carolina a bid to the [[Bowl Alliance]]; coach [[Mack Brown]] left UNC for [[Texas Longhorns|Texas]] after another highly-ranked Tar Heel team in 1997 also failed to receive a Bowl Alliance bid.

===Virginia 36 â Virginia Tech 32===
Virginia ended the 1998 regular season with a 36â32 victory at [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]] in the greatest comeback in school history. Down 29â7 at the half, the Cavaliers outscored the Hokies 29â3 in the final two quarters. UVA capped its historic rally with a game-winning 47-yard touchdown pass from [[Aaron Brooks (American football)|Aaron Brooks]] to [[wide receiver]] [[Ahmad Hawkins]] with 2:01 left to play.
