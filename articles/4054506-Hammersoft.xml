'''Frontier North, Inc.''' is a [[Frontier Communications]] local telephone operating company serving a former [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] region.
 
==History==
Frontier North was originally founded as '''Contel North, Inc.''', incorporated in [[Wisconsin]] in [[1992]]. 

===GTE acquisition of Contel===
Contel was acquired by GTE in 1993. Following its acquisition by [[GTE]], Contel North was renamed '''GTE North, Inc.'''.

In 1993, [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Nebraska]] were split off from GTE North into a new company called [[GTE Midwest|GTE Midwest, Inc.]] ConTel of Illinois, ConTel of Indiana, ConTel of Pennsylvania, and ConTel Quaker State were all merged into GTE North.

===Acquisition by Verizon===
In [[2000]], parent company [[GTE]] was purchased by Bell Atlantic, becoming [[Verizon Communications]]. At this point the company's name was legally changed to '''Verizon North, Inc.'''

===Sale to Frontier===
In [[2009]], [[Verizon Communications]] created a company, [[Frontier Communications ILEC Holdings|New Communications ILEC Holdings]], to be sold to [[Frontier Communications]]. Verizon North was included with the new company. Frontier purchased the company in [[2010]]. Verizon North's operations in [[Pennsylvania]] were spun off into a separate company called [[Verizon North Retain]] since those operations were not included in the sale to Frontier&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol39/39-49/2258.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. That company was merged into a new company named [[Verizon North]] in [[2010]]. The sale became final [[July 1]], [[2010]], and the company's name was changed to '''Frontier North, Inc.'''

Frontier North, Inc. is a current operating company serving [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], and [[Wisconsin]].
