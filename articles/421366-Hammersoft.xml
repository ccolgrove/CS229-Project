A '''Mars rover''' is an [[automated]] [[motor vehicle]] which propels itself across the surface of the planet [[Mars]] after [[Mars landing|landing]].

[[Rover (space exploration)|Rovers]] have several advantages over stationary [[Lander (spacecraft)|landers]]: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months and  they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote [[robot]]ic vehicle control.

There have been three successful Mars rovers, all of which were robotically operated. The [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] managed the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission with its Sojourner rover and currently manages the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] mission with its two rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, for [[NASA]]âs Office of Space Science, Washington, DC. (There have also been two successful non-Martian robotic rovers: in the 1970s the [[USSR]] sent two [[Lunokhod programme|''Lunokhod'']] rovers to the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Rover synopsis==
[[File:MarsSunset.jpg|thumb|right||A Martian sunset at Gusev Crater. Spirit rover, May 19, 2005.]]
Six [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]] have been sent to Mars:

* [[File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg|22px]] ''[[Mars 2]]'', ''Prop-M'' rover, 1971, failed.
* [[File:Flag of the Soviet Union.svg|22px]] ''[[Mars 3]]'', ''Prop-M'' rover, 1971, failed.
The ''Mars 2'' and ''3'' spacecraft from the USSR, had identical 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg ''Prop-M'' rovers. They were to move on [[ski]]s while connected to the landers with cables. The ''Mars 2'' rover crashed into the Martian surface.&lt;ref name=Mars2_NSSDC&gt;

The ''Mars 3'' rover failed less than a minute after landing and never moved.&lt;ref name=Mars2_NSSDC/&gt;
''Mars 2'' and ''Mars 3'' both had companion orbiters which were successful.

* [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|22px]] [[Sojourner (rover)|''Sojourner'']] rover, [[Mars Pathfinder]], landed successfully on July 4, 1997. Communications were lost on September 27, 1997.
* [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|22px]] [[Spirit rover|''Spirit'']]  (MER-A), [[Mars Exploration Rover]], landed successfully on January 4, 2004. Nearly 6 years after the original mission limit, Spirit had covered a total distance of {{convert|7.73|km|mi|abbr=on}} but its wheels were trapped in sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Alan | last=Boyle | title=Good moves on Mars | date= |  publisher=MSNBC |  url =http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2010/01/21/2181157.aspx  | accessdate = 2010-01-22 | language =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around January 26, 2010, NASA admitted defeat in its efforts to free the rover and stated that it would now function as a stationary science platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=International Business | last=Times | title=NASA concedes defeat in effort to free rover | date=January 26, 2010 | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20100126/nasa-concedes-defeat-effort-free-rover.htm | accessdate=2010-01-26 | language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 22, 2010 there has been no communication from the rover, and as of May 25, 2011 NASA will no longer attempt to re-establish communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://marsrover.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20110524a.html| title=NASA Concludes Attempts To Contact Mars Rover Spirit|date=May 24, 2011 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|22px]] [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'']] (MER-B), Mars Exploration Rover, landed successfully on January 25, 2004.  Rover was still operating as of October 2011, having surpassed the previous record for longevity of a surface mission to Mars on May 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100519.html |title=NASA's Mars Rovers Set Surface Longevity Record |date=May 19, 2010 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/01/03/mars-rover-celebrates-seven-years-red-planet-stuck/ Spirit Rover Marks Seven Years On Mars, Still Stuck (Fox News, 03 January 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA rover mission goals==
[[File:h rover-comp wheels 02.jpg|thumb|right|Wheel size comparison: [[Mars Pathfinder]], [[Mars Exploration Rover]], [[Mars Science Laboratory]].]]
NASA distinguishes between &quot;mission&quot; objectives and &quot;science&quot; objectives. Mission objectives are related to progress in space technology and development processes. Science objectives are met by the instruments during their mission in space.

The details of rover science vary according to equipment carried. The primary goal of the ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' rovers is to discover
&quot;the history of water on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Overview
|publisher=marsrovers.nasa.gov
|accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The presence of usable water would greatly reduce manned mission cost.)

The four science goals of NASA's long-term Mars Exploration Program are:
* Determine whether life ever arose on Mars
* Characterize the climate of Mars
* Characterize the geology of Mars
* Prepare for human exploration&lt;ref&gt;
