'''Lakewood''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 80,048 at the 2010 census. It is bordered by [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] on the west and south, [[Bellflower, California|Bellflower]] on the north, [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]] on the northeast, [[Cypress, California|Cypress]] on the east, and [[Hawaiian Gardens, California|Hawaiian Gardens]] on the southeast. Major thoroughfares include Lakewood ([[California State Route 19|SR 19]]), Bellflower, and Del Amo Boulevards and Carson and South Streets. The [[San Gabriel River Freeway]] ([[Interstate 605 (California)|I-605]]) runs through the city's eastern regions.

Sometimes called &quot;an instant city&quot; because of its originsâgoing from [[lima bean]] fields in 1950 to a well-developed city by 1960âLakewood is, along with [[Levittown, New York]], the archetypal post-[[World War II]] American [[suburb]]. The vast majority of its housing stock is small, mass-produced single-story houses on tree-lined streets, sold initially to World War II and Korean War veterans who worked in the aerospace factories of Long Beach and the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]].

==History, notable features==
Lakewood is a planned, post-World War II community.&lt;ref name=Rethink&gt;{{cite book|last=Dear|first=Michael J.|coauthors= H. Eric Schockman, Greg Hise|title=Rethinking Los Angeles|publisher=SAGE|year=1996|pages=99|isbn= 9780803972872}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers Louis Boyar, [[Mark Taper]] and Ben Weingart are credited with &quot;altering forever the map of Southern California&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rethink/&gt; Begun in late 1949, the completion of the developers' plan in 1953 helped in the transformation of mass-produced working-class housing from its early phases in the 1930s and 1940s to the reality of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Rethink/&gt; The feel of this transformation from the point of view of a resident growing up in Lakewood was captured by [[D. J. Waldie]] in his award-winning memoir, {{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NtgEEDGqn9cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:DJ+inauthor:Waldie&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false| title=Holy Land: A Suburban Memoir}}

Lakewood's primary thoroughfares are mostly [[boulevard]]s with landscaped medians, with [[frontage road]]s on either side in residential districts. Unlike in most similar configurations, however, access to the main road from the frontage road is only possible from infrequently spaced collector streets. This arrangement, hailed by [[urban planning|urban planners]] of the day, is a compromise between the traditional urban grid and the arrangement of winding &quot;drives&quot; and [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]] that dominates contemporary suburban and [[Commuter town|exurban]] design.

Lakewood is credited as a pioneer among California cities in services provision. Although it is an incorporated city, Lakewood contracts for most municipal services, with most of these provided by Los Angeles County and, to a lesser extent, by other public agencies and private industry. Lakewood was the first city in the nation to contract for all of its municipal services when it incorporated as a municipality in 1954, making it the nation's first &quot;[[contract city]].&quot; Many other Los Angeles suburbs, such as Cerritos and [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]], have adopted the &quot;Lakewood Plan.&quot; 

Lakewood is the home of the first [[Denny's]] Restaurant. In 1953 Harold Butler founded Dannyâs Donuts, which was renamed Denny's Restaurant in 1959.

Lakewood was named ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'''s &quot;Sportstown USA&quot; in 2005 for the State of California.
