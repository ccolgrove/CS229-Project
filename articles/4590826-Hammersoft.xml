}}'''Mount Aloysius College''' is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[private university|private]] [[college]] in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  It is a liberal arts college that awards bachelorâs, associateâs, and masterâs degrees in the arts and sciences fields.  The undergraduate enrollment totals approximately 2000 students.

Mount Aloysius College was established in 1853 by a small community of sisters from the [[Sisters of Mercy]], during which time St. Aloysius Academy was constructed.  The Academy became Mount Aloysius Junior College in 1939, and later became Mount Aloysius College in 1991 after amending its charter to allow the conferment of bachelor degrees.

Mount Aloysius is located on a rural 193 acre (0.78 km2) campus in the Allegheny Mountains region of west-central Pennsylvania.  Mount Aloysiusâ 12 sports teams compete in the Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference of the NCAA Division III. 

==History &amp; Tradition==
The history of the College is rooted in the life of the Religious Sisters of Mercy who founded and sponsor Mount Aloysius College. [[Catherine McAuley]] founded the Religious Sisters of Mercy in Dublin, Ireland, in 1831 as a congregation devoted to service.

Mount Aloysius College traces its heritage to the small community of sisters who were sent to Pittsburgh in 1843. From Pittsburgh, they established a community in Chicago in 1845 and by 1848 they settled in nearby Loretto. On St. Mary's Street in Loretto, the Sisters built a school in a tinner's shop, which was to be the forerunner of St. Aloysius Academy. The Academy, built in 1853, was moved to its present site in 1897. In 1939 Mount Aloysius Junior College was founded through the initiative of Sister M. de Sales Farley, R.S.M. In 1991, Mount Aloysius amended its charter and scope of programs to include bachelor degrees. In the Spring of 2000, the College's charter was again amended to include master's degrees. The U.S. News &amp; World Report college guide ranks Mount Aloysius as one of the top comprehensive colleges in the northern U.S.

==The College==

Mount Aloysius College is a small, private, comprehensive, Catholic liberal arts college sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy.

The College recognizes that student activities play a distinctive role in the total campus educational program. There are approximately 100 organized clubs, groups, honor societies, and intramural sports programs, including a newspaper, residence hall associations, student government, cheerleading, dance team, step team, scholarship-funded theater and choir programs, and a student activities planning board.
