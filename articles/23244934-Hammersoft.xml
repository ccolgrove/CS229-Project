'''Wilentz, Goldman &amp; Spitzer''' is a [[law firm]] in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States with headquarters in [[Woodbridge, New Jersey]], and other offices in [[New Jersey]], New York and [[Pennsylvania]]. The firm presently has approximately 150 attorneys in various business and personal practice areas.

The firm traces its origins to the law office founded in 1919 in [[Perth Amboy]] by [[David T. Wilentz]], G. George Goldman and Henry Spitzer. Founder David Wilentz is best remembered as the [[Attorney General of New Jersey]] who in 1935 prosecuted [[Bruno Hauptmann]] for the [[kidnap]] and murder of the son of aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]. His son, [[Robert Wilentz]], who also was a partner in the firm, was [[Chief Justice]] of the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] from 1979 to 1996.

The Wilentz firm has gained a reputation for its representation of [[plaintiff]]s in mass [[tort]] and [[product liability]] cases, including a lawsuit against a large [[tobacco company]] that led in 1988 to a [[jury]] awarding $400,000 in damages to the heirs of [[Rose Cipollone]], a heavy smoker who had died of lung cancer. This was first time a U.S. court granted a monetary award in a case involving death from smoking. The ruling was reversed on appeal by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1992 (see [[Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.]]), and in 1993 the firm stopped representing consumers in tobacco cases.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Gottlieb, [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1128503111201 Trailblazing Anti-Tobacco Litigator Agrees to Disbarment; Wilentz Goldman mass tort lawyer admits improperly charging personal expenses to firm], ''New Jersey Law Journal'', October 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/settlement/timelines/cipollone.html Frontline: Inside the tobacco deal: Rose Cipollone and Judge Lee Sarokin], PBS website&lt;/ref&gt;
