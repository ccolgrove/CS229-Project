'''Comodo Internet Security''' ('''CIS'''), developed by [[Comodo Group]], is an Internet security suite available for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It offers [[Antivirus software|anti-malware protection]], a [[personal firewall]], a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] and a [[Intrusion Prevention System#Host-based|Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)]] called ''Defense+''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cis-free-download&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Features ==
===Editions===
Comodo Internet Security (CIS) is available in four editions: ''Comodo Internet Security'' (the standard edition), ''Comodo Internet Security Plus'', ''Comodo Internet Security Pro'' and ''Comodo Internet Security Complete''. All editions contain a personal firewall which prevents unauthorized connections from/to the Internet, an antivirus that seeks and eliminates [[malicious software]] and the ''Defense+'' monitors software for suspicious behavior and can &quot;sandbox&quot; certain programs, thus preventing them from making permanent changes to the system.

However, Comodo Internet Security, the standard edition, is the only [[freeware]] edition. It has no more than 60 days of technical support (dubbed &quot;GeekBuddy&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;CIS-free-prod&quot; /&gt; The Plus, Pro, and Complete editions, on the other hand are [[commercial software]] and have unlimited technical support.

===Components===
Comodo Internet Security was designed around the concept of [[layered security]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

;Antivirus: Comodo's Antivirus Software was publicly released along with the Comodo Internet Security Suite on October 23, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In CIS 5.0, it offers cloud antivirus protection and spyware scanning capabilities. The antivirus had great detection but its cleaning capabilities weren't that great. For that purpose, Comodo developed Comodo Cleaning Essentials to supplement CIS.

;Firewall: Comodo's Firewall, ''Comodo Firewall Pro'', generally wins high scores on Firewall testing sites, such as [[Matousec]], and has regularly been included in the top three firewalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

;HIPS (Defense+): Comodo's [[Intrusion prevention system|Host-based intrusion prevention system]] (HIPS), known as Defense+, is designed to provide protection against unknown malware. It is designed to restrict the actions of unknown applications, and restrict access to important files, folders, settings and the [[Windows Registry]].  Defense+ employs Default Deny Protection, by default refusing any unknown file permission to install or execute except when specifically allowed by the user or when the file appears on Comodo's whitelist. In CIS 4.0, a sandbox was added to Defense+ to isolate and run unknown applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Comodo Cleaning Essentials==
Cleaning Essentials is a separate product that has the same antivirus engine and database as CIS. It was created in response to the criticism of Antivirus's cleaning power which was mediocre. Cleaning Essentials can be run from a USB device and updated as long as there is an internet connection. There is the standard full scan which requires a reboot to scan for malware and rootkits, a custom scan, and KillSwitch. KillSwitch is a task manager-like program that can determine if a process in safe, unknown, or dangerous. It allows for the termination of stubborn processes that normally cannot be closed with Task Manager. In the new Killswitch 2.0, it has been improved to wipe out more types of files. An autorun analyzer has also been added as well as a smart scan option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Critical reception ==
{{expand-section|date=May 2011}}
Comodo Internet Security is currently ranked number 1 in Matousec's Proactive Security Challenge, and passing 100% of the 148 software firewall tests, and is the only firewall and host intrusion prevention system to consistently score number 1 or tie for number one (usually with Online Armor) in all independent tests; it has never left first place since version 3.14.13009 released in June 2008, and as a firewall and HIPS application, even this nearly three-year old software still passes 100% of the latest security tests, the only software of that era to pass more than 70% (Zone Alarm Pro v7 from the same time passes only 27%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matousec.com/projects/proactive-security-challenge/results.php Proactive Security Challenge Results]&lt;/ref&gt;
