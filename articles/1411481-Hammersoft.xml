'''Allen Mulherin Steele, Jr.''' (born January 19, 1958) is an American [[science fiction author]].

Steele began publishing short stories in 1988. His early novels formed a [[future history]] beginning with ''Orbital Decay'' and continuing through ''Labyrinth of Night''. Some of his early novels such as ''Orbital Decay'' and ''Lunar Descent'' were about [[blue-collar worker]]s working on future construction projects in space. Since 1992, he has tended to focus on stand-alone projects and short stories, although he has written four novels about the moon Coyote.

Steele was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. He received a Bachelor's from [[New England College]] and a Master's from the [[University of Missouri]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Before he established himself as a science fiction author, he spent several years working as a journalist.
