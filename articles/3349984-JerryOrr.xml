'''Dave Brian Rimington''' (born May 22, 1960 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]) is a former [[American football]] [[center (American football)|center]].  He is considered by many to be the greatest center in the history of [[college football]].

==College career==
Rimington attended the [[University of Nebraska]] where he was a consensus First-Team [[All-America]] in 1981 and 1982. In 1981, he was named the [[UPI]] [[Big_Eight_Conference|Big Eight]] Player-of-the-Year and the [[Associated_Press|AP]] Big Eight Offensive Player of the Year, the only time in Big Eight Conference history that a [[offensive lineman|lineman]] was so honored. In 1982, he was the Big Eight (all sports) Athlete of the Year, the UPI National Lineman of the year, and an [[NCAA_Division_I|NCAA]] [[Today's_Top_VIII_Award|Top Five winner]]. 

Rimington won the [[Outland Trophy]], given to the nation's top interior offensive or defensive lineman, in 1981 and 1982, and is its only two-time winner. He also won the [[Lombardi Award]] in 1982 and placed fifth in the balloting for the [[Heisman Trophy]] that same year.  He and [[Orlando Pace]] are the only three-time winners in the Outland/Lombardi category.  He is one of eight [[Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football|Nebraska Cornhusker]] players to win the Outland Trophy and one of five Nebraska winners of the Lombardi Award.  Nebraska players have won nine Outland Trophys overall, by far the most in the nation. Oklahoma has the second most with four.  Rimington, along with fellow Cornhuskers [[Rich Glover]], [[Dean Steinkuhler]] and [[Ndamukong Suh]], won both the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Awards.  Only thirteen players in NCAA history have won both of these prestigious awards.

Rimington's #50 jersey was retired by the team in 1982, one of only sixteen Cornhuskers ever so honored. In 1994 he was named to the [[FWAA]] [[Football_Writers_Association_of_America#1969-1994_All-America_Team|1969-1994 All-America Team]], one of just twenty-five athletes and one of three Cornhuskers named to that team, along with Steinkuhler and [[Johnny Rodgers]].  In 1997, he was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. In 1999 he was selected to the Nebraska All-Century Football Team via fan poll and named to the All-Century Nebraska football team by [[Gannett News Service]]. In 2002, he was named to the Athlon Sports Nebraska All-Time Team.  In 2008, he was named to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl's]] 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.  

Rimington was a first-team academic All-American in 1981 and 1982. In 2004, Rimington was inducted into the CoSIDA Academic All-America Hall of Fame.  Other Class of 2004 inductees were: [[Terry Hoage]], [[Georgia_Bulldogs_football|Georgia]] '84, [[Rolf Benirschke]], [[UC_Davis_Aggies|UC Davis]] '77*, Dylann Duncan Ceriani, [[Brigham_Young_University_Cougars_football|Brigham Young]] '88 and Gill Beck, [[Appalachian_State_Mountaineers_football|Appalachian State]] '78.  He is one of three [[Huskers]] to have been inducted into the CoSIDA Academic All-America Hall of Fame, the others being 2008 inductee Karen Jennings '93 and 2009 inductee Pat Tyrance '90.

==Collegiate all-century teams==

The second and third team centers were [[Alex Wojciechowicz]] ([[Fordham_University|Fordham]], 1934-37) and [[Dwight Stephenson]] ([[Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football|Alabama]], 1977-79).  Rimington is one of six Nebraska Cornhuskers on ''SI's'' All-Century Team 85 man roster; the others being Rodgers, Glover, Steinkuhler, [[Tommie Frazier]] and [[Aaron Taylor (born 1975)|Aaron Taylor]]. 

In 1999, Rimington was selected as the starting offensive center to the [[Walter Camp Football Foundation]] All Century Team.  The other centers selected were [[Jim Ritcher]], ([[North Carolina State]] 1976-79) and [[Mel Hein]], ([[Washington State University]] 1927-30).  Rimington is one of six Nebraska Cornhuskers on the Walter Camp 83 man roster; the others being Rodgers, Steinkuhler, [[Will Shields]], Frazier and Taylor.

==Rimington Trophy==
The [[Dave Rimington Trophy|Rimington Trophy]] is named in his honor and since 2000 has been given annually to the nation's top collegiate center.  Since 2003, a Rimington Trophy has been awarded to the top center in each division of college football.
