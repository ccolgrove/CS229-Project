'''Altadena''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]]&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles County publication: âUnincorporated Areas within the County of Los Angelesâ, [http://ceo.lacounty.gov/forms/Unincorp%20Alpha%20Web.pdf Altadena listed by Los Angeles County government office, as an unincorporated area], âLos Angeles County publication: âUnincorporated Areas within the County of Los Angelesââ, verified September 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; area&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles County Office of Unincorporated Area Services, [http://ceo.lacounty.gov/OUAS/ Altadena listed by Los Angeles County government office, as an unincorporated area], âLos Angeles County Office of Unincorporated Area Servicesâ, verified September 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and [[census-designated place]] in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]], approximately {{convert|14|mi|km}} from the [[downtown Los Angeles]] Civic Center, and directly north of the city of [[Pasadena, California]].  The population was 42,777 at the 2010 census, up from 42,610 at the 2000 census.

==History==
[[Benjamin Eaton]] first developed water sources from the [[Arroyo Seco]] and [[Eaton Canyon]] from the mid-1860s from his vineyard near the edge of Eaton Canyon. This made development of Altadena, Pasadena, and South Pasadena possible. He did the work for [[Benjamin Davis Wilson|B.D. Wilson]] and Dr. John Griffin, who jointly owned the Mexican land grant of the [[Rancho San Pascual]], about {{convert|14000|acre|km2}} that comprised the future sites of the three communities. They hoped to develop and sell part of this in a real estate scheme called the San Pasqual Plantation. It failed by 1870 despite the irrigation ditch Eaton engineered for the partners that drew water from around the site of present day [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in the Arroyo Seco. The failure had two main causes: few believed citrus or other crops could thrive so close to the mountains, and the land was relatively inaccessible.

Eaton then tried to sell the land for the partners, and in late 1873 helped broker a deal with [[Daniel Berry]], who represented a group of investors from Indiana to purchase {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of the rancho. Although this included the land of present day Altadena, they developed the {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} section further south into Pasadena. In 1881, the land that became Altadena was sold to the Woodbury brothers, John and Fred, who launched the subdivision of Altadena in 1887 just as Southern California's great land boom busted. The land remained mostly agricultural. However, several millionaires (mainly from Chicago) built mansions along [[Mariposa Street]], and a small community slowly developed through the 1890s and into the new century.

[[Image:woodburys.jpg|frame|right|[[Woodbury-Story House|Home of Capt. John Woodbury, built 1882, still standing and occupied]].]]

In 1880, Capt. Frederick Woodbury and his brother John Woodbury of [[Marshalltown, Iowa]], purchased {{convert|937|acre|km2}} known as the Woodbury Ranch.  John Woodbury established the Pasadena Improvement Company in 1887 with a plot plan of residential development referred to as the Woodbury Subdivision.  They contacted Byron O. Clark who established a nursery in the foothills in 1875 and had since moved away.  He called his nursery &quot;Altadena Nursery&quot;, a name he coined from the Spanish &quot;alta&quot; meaning &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;dena&quot; from Pasadena.  Woodbury asked if he could use the name &quot;Altadena&quot; for his subdivision and Clark agreed.

The newly sprouted community of Altadena immediately began to attract millionaires from the East. In 1887 [[Andrew McNally]], the printing magnate from Chicago and his good friend Col. [[George Gill Green|G. G. Green]] had built mansions on what was to become Millionaire's Row, Mariposa Street near Santa Rosa. Newspaper moguls William Armiger Scripps and William Kellogg built side by side just east of [[Fair Oaks Avenue]]. The grandson of Andrew McNally, [[Wallace Neff]], became a famous Southern California architect. He started his career in Altadena with the design and construction of St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church ( parish est.1918) which was dedicated in October 1926.

Over the years Altadena has been subject to attempted annexation by Pasadena. Annexation was stopped in 1956 by community campaigns though it has been resurrected several times since by Pasadena without success. Had the annexation succeeded, Pasadena would be the [[Largest cities in the US|108th largest city]] in the United States.

While Altadena long refused wholesale annexation by neighboring [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], the larger community nibbled at its edges in several small annexations of neighborhoods through the 1940s. With early 1960s redevelopment in Pasadena, the routing of extensions of 134 and 210 freeways, and lawsuits over the desegregation of Pasadena Unified School District, there was white flight and convulsive racial change in Altadena. In 1960, its black population was under four percent; over the next 15 years, half the Caucasian population left and was replaced by people of color â many of whom settled on the west side of town after being displaced by Pasadena's redevelopment and freeway projects.

The name Altadena derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''alta'', meaning &quot;upper&quot;, and ''dena'' from Pasadena; the area is adjacent to, but at a higher elevation than, Pasadena.&lt;ref name=&quot;naming&quot;&gt;Manning, Mike. The word Altadena was first used by Byron Clark, who coined it for his nursery located south of present-day Woodbury on the west side of town. When he moved his nursery to Linda Vista, he agreed to let the Woodburys take the name for their new subdivision. &quot;[http://www.altadenatowncouncil.org/altadenahistory/ald_history.html ALTADENA, CALIFORNIA: an abbreviated history for the internet].&quot; ''[http://www.altadenatowncouncil.org/ Altadena Town Council].''

In 1975, a  group of Altadenans formed [http://www.altadenatowncouncil.org The Altadena Town Council] with the help of Los Angeles County Supervisor [[Baxter Ward]] and the Pasadena Chapter of the [[League of Women Voters]].

The Altadena Town Council acts as an [[ombudsman]] group to express to county, state and federal agencies the will and wishes of the Altadena community.  Altadena is identified collectively by eight census tract, ([[U.S. Census Bureau]]) from each of which two resident census tract representatives are elected.  The Altadena Town Council meets monthly at the Altadena Community Center to provide a forum for residents and government officials to convene.  The council has no legislative powers and makes no legal decisions for the community; it only operates to express consensus to governmental officials.

[[Image:California poppy.jpg|thumb|right|Golden poppy ''(Eschscholzia californica)'']]

'''Official tree:''' The [[Deodar Cedar]] (Cedrus deodara). Indigenous to the Himalayas, the deodar was brought as seeds to Altadena in 1883 by Founder John Woodbury who saw the beautiful trees in Italy.  After growing the trees for two years, the trees were transplanted to Santa Rosa Avenue where they now stand majestically as [[Christmas Tree Lane]].

'''Official flower:''' The [[California Poppy|California Golden Poppy]] (Eschscholzia californica). Indigenous to the southland, the golden poppy was a landmark to Spanish sailors who recognized the area by a sweeping gold carpet.  The sailors referred to the marvelous vision as ''sabanilla de oro,'' or, &quot;altar cloth of gold.&quot;

[[File:Christmas Tree Lane.jpg|thumb|right|[[Christmas Tree Lane]]]]
[[Christmas Tree Lane]] is a {{convert|0.7|mi|km|sing=on}} stretch of Santa Rosa Avenue from Woodbury Road to [[Altadena Drive (California)|Altadena Drive]].  It has been a holiday attraction since 1920 and it is the oldest large-scale outdoor Christmas lighting venue in the world.  Each December, members of the Christmas Tree Lane Association [http://www.christmastreelane.net/] festoon the 110 still standing giant [[Deodar Cedar|deodars]] that line the street with thousands of Christmas lights.  Christmas Tree Lane was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1990, and is a [[California Historical Landmark]].

Among Altadena's Christmas lighting attractions is the Balian Mansion, which collects worldwide tours for its Christmas lighting display.  The Balian Mansion has been lighted since 1955 and is arguably the pioneer of home holiday lighting.  The Balian Mansion is located at the 5-point junction of Mendocino Street, Mendocino Lane, Allen Avenue, and East Glenview Terrace.

The historic [[Mount Lowe Railway]] was once a scenic railway that carried passengers to any four resort hotels high in the San Gabriel Mountains above Altadena and Pasadena.  Although the mountains and the remains of the railway are not strictly in Altadena, the most direct trail to the sites, the [[Sam Merrill Trail]], starts in Altadena at the top of [[Lake Avenue (Pasadena)|Lake Avenue]] and leads to Mount Echo, about {{convert|3|mi|km}}.  Chaney Trail, just west of the intersection at Fair Oaks Avenue and Loma Alta Street, is a forestry service road leading to the old right of way.  The Mount Lowe Railway was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1993.

The Cobb Estate at the top of Lake Avenue is now a free [[botanical garden]] of the [[United States Forest Service]].  It is guarded by its historic gates which are easily bypassed to allow visitors and hikers to ascend its long and winding paved driveway to the site of what was once one of Altadena's premier mansions. This is found alongside the Sam Merrill Trail which accesses Las Flores Canyon on the way to [[Echo Mountain]].

[[Farnsworth Park]] located on Lake Avenue is a large county park that offers picnic grounds, play areas, and a club house and amphitheater. It was placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

==Education==
Residents are zoned to [[Pasadena Unified School District]] schools. Zoned elementary schools include Altadena Elementary School, [[Burbank Elementary School (Altadena, California)|Burbank Elementary School]], Edison Elementary School, Franklin Elementary School, Jackson Elementary School, Loma Alta Elementary School, Webster Elementary School, [http://aveson.org Aveson School of Leaders], [[Charles W.
