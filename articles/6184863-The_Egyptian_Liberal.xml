The state of '''human rights in Egypt''' remains poor due to repressive government policies and brutal government crackdowns.

==Rights and liberties ratings==
[[Freedom House]], the &quot;independent watchdog organization that supports the expansion of freedom around the world,&quot; and rates countries &quot;levels&quot; of freedom on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0 (1.0 being lowest and 5.0 being most free), places Egypt's &quot;Political Rights and Civic Voice&quot; at 2.7  (, &quot;Autonomy, Security, and Freedom of the Person&quot; at 2.8, and &quot;Social and Cultural Rights&quot; at 2.4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=172 Egypt], freedomhouse.org&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations in North African and the Mideast they place at 5.5 are [[Algeria]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], and [[Tunisia]]. They gave them a press freedom score of 68 but a country like Lebanon has complete freedom of press. They gave the following nations a 68 as well: [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cameroon]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Maldives]], and [[Russia]]. In 2000 the related '''Center for Religious Freedom''' placed Egypt as partly free at 5; this put them in line with Muslim nations like [[Turkey]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://freedomhouse.org/religion/publications/rfiw/fig2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters Without Borders placed [[Egypt]] between [[Bhutan]] and the [[CÃ´te d'Ivoire]] in press freedom.

See [[List of indices of freedom]] for more information on these ratings and how they are determined.

==Freedom of speech and freedom of the press==

The Press Law, Publications Law, and the penal code regulate and govern the press. According to these, criticism of the president can be punished by fines or imprisonment. [[Freedom House]] deems [[Egypt]] to have an unfree press, although mentions they have a diversity of sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=16&amp;year=2005&amp;country=6730 freedomhouse.org: Freedom of the Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] 2006 report indicates continued harassment and, in three cases, imprisonment, of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=17186&amp;var_recherche=Egypt Reporters sans frontiÃ¨res - Egypt - Annual report 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They place Egypt 143rd out of 167 nations on press freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=554 Reporters sans frontiÃ¨res - Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index - 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The two sources agree that promised reforms on the subject have been disappointingly slow or uneven in implementation. Freedomhouse had a slightly more positive assessment indicating that an increased freedom to discuss controversial issues has occurred.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&amp;year=2005&amp;country=6730 freedomhouse.org: Country Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Al Jazeera.net, &quot;in the past few years, independent Egyptian newspapers have emerged that have proved willing to hold the rich and powerful elite to account, right up to the presidency. The old state-owned newspapers are beginning to lose their readership.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt approves tough press law|date=Monday 10 July 2006|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1A586C21-55FA-4148-BB32-A832178E13C2.htm|publisher=AlJazeera.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, the Egyptian parliament passed a new press law. The new law no longer allows journalists to be imprisoned for comments against the government, but continues to allow fines to be levied against such journalists. The independent press and the Muslim Brotherhood protested this law as repressive.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Although the Egyptian Government rarely bans foreign newspapers, in September 2006, Egypt banned editions of [[Le Figaro]] and [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], because of their publication of articles deemed insulting to Islam. According to Al Jazeera, the German newspaper contained an article authored by the German historian [[Egon Flaig]], &quot;looking at how the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, was a successful military leader during his lifetime&quot;. Al Jazeera quotes the Egyptian minister of information as saying that he, &quot;would not allow any publication that insults the Islamic religion or calls for hatred or contempt of any religion to be distributed inside Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two European papers face Egypt ban|date=Sunday 24 September 2006|publisher=AlJazeera.net|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D796D2B5-4285-49D2-B0CC-0B782049C977.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of religion==
{{Modern persecution of Coptic Christians}}
:''See also: [[Persecution of BahÃ¡'Ã­s#Egypt|Persecution of BahÃ¡'Ã­s in Egypt]] and [[Egyptian identification card controversy]]''
[[Islam]] is the official state religion of Egypt. According to a 2003 US State Department report, &quot;members of the non-Muslim minority worship without harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/13994.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2002: Egypt&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The government has made efforts toward greater religious pluralism and [[Christianity|Christians]] are a significant minority who have served in government. Coptic Christmas (January 7) has been a national holiday since 2002.

That said, intolerance at a cultural and political level remains according to two [[United States|US]]-based sources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/events/cong_testimony/2005/november/11162005_EgyptHRCaucus.html United States Commission on International Religious Freedom: USCIRF Events: 2005 Testimony: Remarks by Commissioner Prodromou Briefing on &quot;Religious Freedom in Egypt&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] is the state religion and the government controls the major [[mosque]]s. There have been disputes between [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] and the government. Christians have found the building and repair of churches, however, to be problematic. Government regulations dating from Ottoman times require non-Muslims to obtain presidential decrees before building or repair a place of worship. Although in 1999 President [[Mubarak]] issued a decree making repairs of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code, in practice Christians report difficulty obtaining permits. Once permits have been obtained, Christians report being prevented from performing repairs or building by local authorities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] also indicates issues of concern. For example they discuss how the law does not recognize conversion from [[Islam]] to other religions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/01/13/egypt9802.htm Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in Egypt (Human Rights Watch, 31-12-2004)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a poll by the PewResearchCenter in 2010, 84 percent of all Egyptian Muslims (75 percent of the entire population) is in favor of imposing the death sentence for leaving Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also mentions strict laws against insulting [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] or [[Judaism]] and detention for unorthodox sects of Islam, such as [[Ahmadiyya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gz0txMsTCCfV4e0BI1Slg2yYOxFg|accessdate=30 August 2010|title=Egypt Ahmadis detained under emergency law: rights group|publisher=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|BahÃ¡'Ã­]] institutions and community activities were banned by Presidential decree of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. All BahÃ¡'Ã­ community properties, including BahÃ¡'Ã­ centers, libraries, and cemeteries, were subsequently confiscated. BahÃ¡'Ã­s are also not allowed to hold identity cards, and are thus, among other things, not able to own property, attend university, have a business, obtain birth, marriage and death certificates. This ban had not been rescinded as of 2003. In 2001 18 Egyptian BahÃ¡'Ã­s were arrested on &quot;suspicion of insulting religion&quot; and detained several months without being formally charged.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On 6 April 2006, the Administrative Court ruled in favour of recognising the right of Egyptian BahÃ¡'Ã­s to have their religion acknowledged on official documents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IRIN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rights activists welcome ruling recognising BahÃ¡'Ã­ rights|author=Integrated Regional Information Networks|date=2006-04-06|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=52652&amp;SelectRegion=Middle_East&amp;SelectCountry=EGYPT | publisher=IRINNews.org|accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 May 2006, after a government appeal, the ruling was suspended by the Supreme Administrative Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26887 | title = EGYPT: Court suspends ruling recognising Bahai rights | date = 2006-05-16 | publisher = Reuters | author = IRIN | accessdate = 2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 2006, only after one hearing, the Supreme Administrative Council of Egypt ruled against the BahÃ¡'Ã­s and stating that the government may not recognize the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith in official identification numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eipr2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Must Find Solution for BahÃ¡'Ã­ Egyptians|date=2006-12-16|accessdate=2006-12-16|author=Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights|publisher=eipr.org|url=http://www.eipr.org/en/press/06/1612.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070209221817/http://www.eipr.org/en/press/06/1612.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling left BahÃ¡'Ã­s unable to obtain the necessary government documents to have rights in their country unless they lie about their religion, which conflicts with BahÃ¡'Ã­ religious principle.&lt;ref name=&quot;hor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Human Rights Caucus, House of Representatives|accessdate=2006-12-29|date=2005-11-16|url=http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/11-17-05+Testimony+of+Kit+Bigelow+Egypt+Briefing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; BahÃ¡'Ã­s cannot obtain identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports.&lt;ref name=&quot;eipr2&quot;/&gt; Without those documents, they cannot be employed, educated, treated in hospitals, or vote, among other things.&lt;ref name=&quot;hor&quot;/&gt; In 2008, a Cairo court ruled that BahÃ¡'Ã­s may obtain birth certificates and identification documents, so long as they omit their religion on court documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Cynthia |last= Johnston |title= Egypt Baha'is win court fight over identity papers|url=http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL29677385.html |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2008-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Egyptian convert from Islam to Christianity, [[Mohammed Beshoy Hegazy]] has recently sued the Egyptian government to change his religion from Islam to Christianity on his official ID card. Earlier this year, Egyptian courts rejected an attempt by a group of Christians who had previously converted to Islam but then returned to Christianity and then sought to restore their original religion on their ID cards. The case is currently before an appeals court.&lt;ref&gt;Threats force Egyptian convert to hide, MAGGIE MICHAEL, Associated Press Writer
Sat August 11, [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/egypt_muslim_convert]&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent violations of human rights towards Christians include the [[Nag Hammadi massacre]] which occurred in January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8444851.stm | work=BBC News | title=Egypt church attack kills Copts | date=7 January 2010 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2011 Alexandria bombing]] which occurred on January 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12101748 | work=BBC News | title=Egypt bomb kills 21 at Alexandria Coptic church | date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions between Egypt's Muslims and Christian minority have occasionally erupted due to disputes over conversions and sites of worship. That is why, Christian activists claim that [[Camilia Shehata Zakher]], the wife of Tadros Samaan, Bishop of the Church of Saint Mark, Mowas Cathedral, Minya, has been abducted and killed by Muslims when she disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prlog.org/10823532-us-policy-toward-egypt-must-change-more-crime-against-christian-women.html&lt;/ref&gt; While, in fact, the Egyptian security agencies handed her to her family. Camilia told that she has gone to her cousin, who has converted to [[Islam]], and She has embraced [[Islam]]. In this the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] keep her in a parish in Deir Mwas in [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] claiming that she was 'brain-washed'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egyptiangazette.net/news-10865-Police%20find%20Coptic%20priest's%20missing%20wife.html&lt;/ref&gt; The matter that rouse the anger of Muslims. As a result, dozens of lawyers protested in front of the Lawyers Syndicate calling for the immediate release of Camilia Shehata saying she should state whether or not she wishes to proclaim her conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/protesters-call-release-bishops-wife&lt;/ref&gt; As a respond, [[Pope Shenouda III]] has decided to block the media appearance of Shehata indefinitely, and has also decided to place her in a church guest house located in Ain Shams for the time being. Mowas Cathedral sources have said she is undergoing a rehabilitation process. The Muslim protesters called on the authorities to intervene and release Camilia, raising banners calling for [[Al-Azhar]] to protect those who convert to Islam from the punishment of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egyptiangazette.net/news-12020-court%20hearing%20over%20alleged%20conversion%20on%20Nov.%202%20.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Ramadan, Hundreds of Muslim worshippers and activists from the social networking website [[Facebook]] protested Sunday night outside [[Amr Ibn el-Aas Mosque]] and [[Al-Nour Mosque]] in [[Old Cairo]], calling for the release of Camilia Shehata, the wife of a priest who has allegedly converted to [[Islam]] and then disappeared around a month,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egyptiangazette.net/news-12288-Protest%20over%20alleged%20Coptic%20convert.html&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] has declined to comment on the protests. Sources from the church, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the church will not allow Camilia to appear in the media, adding that the matter should be entirely left to the church.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/hundreds-rally-solidarity-converted-priest%E2%80%99s-wife&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 31, 1999 to January 2, 2000, 21 [[Coptic Christianity|Coptic Christians]] were killed by an [[angry mob]] in [[Kosheh Martyrs|Al-Kosheh]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomhouse.org/religion/publications/massacre/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ahram]] in part cites economic resentment as the cause,&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/467/eg7.htm Al-Ahram Weekly | Home News | The meanings of Al-Kosheh&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but discusses Muslims who condemned the action.

In 2005 a [[2005 Alexandria riot|riot against Copts]] occurred in [[Alexandria]].

Egypt has been accused of practicing apartheid against the ancient Coptic Christian community. The Baptist Press describes Egypt of practicing a form of &quot;religious apartheid&quot; under which indigenous Christians &quot;can be terrorized, robbed and killed with impunity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Kelly, Baptist Press, &quot;Police Allow Attack on Christians,&quot; Jun 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Arab journalist [[Khaled Abu Toameh]] describes the Egyptian treatment of Christians, which forces &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; to emigrate &quot;many of those who are left behind are forced to convert to Islam every year to escape persecution&quot; and where crimes against Christians often go unprosecuted, as a system of &quot;apartheid.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abu Toameh, &quot;What About The Arab Apartheid?

==Status of women==
The Ministry of Health issued a decree in 1996 declaring [[Female genital mutilation|female circumcision]] unlawful and punishable under the Penal Code,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crlp.org/pub_fac_fgmicpd.html Female Genital Mutilation (FGM): Legal Prohibitions Worldwide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[UNICEF]] the prevalence of women who have had this procedure has slowly declined from a baseline of 97% of women aged 15â49 since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_29994.html|title=Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: A statistical exploration|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|date=November 2005|accessdate=2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in the ''British Medical Journal'' [[BMJ]], &quot;[t]he issue came to prominence...when the CNN television news channel broadcast a programme featuring a young girl being circumcised by a barber in Cairo. ...Shocked at the images shown worldwide, the Egyptian president was forced to agree to push legislation through the People's Assembly to ban the operation.&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/310/6971/12|title=Egypt sees U turn on female circumcision |author=Peter Kandela|publisher=bmj.com|date=7 January 1995|accessdate =2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ban, the procedure continues to be practiced in Egypt&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/egypt/report-2008 Amnesty International 2008 report]: &quot;...female genital mutilation (FGM) ... [is] still carried out on most girls.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and remains controversial. In 2006, [[Al-Azhar University]] lecturers Dr. Muhammad Wahdan and Dr. Malika Zarrar debated the topic in a televised debate. Dr. Zarrar, who objected to the procedure, said...&quot;Circumcision is always brutal...I consider this to be a crime, in terms of both religious and civil law&quot;. Dr. Wahdan defended the partial removal of the clitoris for girls who Muslim doctors determine require it, saying it prevents sexual arousal in women in whom it would be inappropriate such as unmarried girls and spinsters. He cited Muslim custom, Islamic law, and a study reporting that the procedure is a determinant of chastity in Egyptian girls. He also blamed the controversy about the procedure on the fact that the, &quot;West wants to impose its culture and philosophy on us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=1090| title=Egyptian Experts on Islamic Religious Law Debate Female Circumcision|publisher=Kuwaiti Al-Rai TV translated into English by memritv.org|date=28 March 2006|accessdate =2 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was controversial in the medical community as well. In the debates leading up to the ban, a gynecologist at [[Cairo University]], said that &quot;Female circumcision is entrenched in Islamic life and teaching,&quot; and, &quot;called on the government to implement training programmes for doctors to carry out the operation under anaesthesia. Another doctor reportedly said, &quot;If my daughter is not circumcised no man is going to marry her.&quot; Other MDs opposed the ban stating that the, &quot;trauma of the operation remains with the girl for the rest of her life,...&quot;[disputing] the argument that the procedure prevents women from &quot;moral deviation,&quot; and argued that it is not, &quot;a legitimate medical practice, and when it is conducted by untrained people it frequently results in infection and other medical problems...&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Status of homosexuals==
{{Main|LGBT rights in Egypt}}
Homosexuality is not technically illegal in Egypt, but is considered [[taboo]]. Until recently, the government denied that homosexuality existed in Egypt, but recently official crackdowns have occurred for reasons felt to include the desire to appease Islamic clerics, to distract from economic issues, or as a cover-up for closet homosexuals in high places. In 2002, 52 men were rounded up on the [[Queen Boat]], a floating nightclub, by police, where they were beaten and tortured. Eventually 29 were acquitted and 23 were convicted for &quot;debauchery and defaming Islam&quot; and sentenced for up to five years in prison with hard labor. Since the trial was held in a state security court, no appeal was allowed. A spokesman for the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], a political party rising in popularity in Egypt, condemns homosexuality, saying, &quot;From my religious view, all the religious people, in Christianity, in Judaism, condemn homosexuality,&quot; he says. &quot;It is against the whole sense in Egypt. The temper in Egypt is against homosexuality.&quot; A government spokesman said the Queen Boat incident was not a violation of human rights but, &quot;actually an interpretation of the norms of our society, the family values of our society. And no one should judge us by their own values. And some of these values in the West are actually in decay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/1858469.stm | work=BBC News | title=Egypt crackdown on homosexuals | date=6 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Human Rights Watch]] released a 144-page report called [http://hrw.org/reports/2004/egypt0304/ ''In a Time of Torture: The Assault on Justice in Egypt's Crackdown on Homosexual Conduct'']. The report stated that &quot;The detention and torture of hundreds of men reveals the fragility of legal protections for individual privacy and due process for all Egyptians.&quot; Egyptian human rights organizations including the [[Hisham Mubarak Law Centre]], the [[Egyptian Association Against Torture]], the [[Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights]], the [[Nadim Centre for the Psychological Management and Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence]], and the [[Arabic Network for Human Rights Information]] also helped HRW to launch the report. A spokesman for Human Rights Watch stated, &quot;when we talk about the situation of homosexuals in Egypt, we don't describe the Queen Boat Case, but we describe a continuing practice of arresting and torturing gay men.&quot; A Cairo court sentenced 21 men to prison in 2003 after it found them guilty of &quot;habitual debauchery&quot;, in a case named after the nightclub they were arrested in, the Queen Boat. He also pointed out that, under the pretext of medical exams, the Forensic Medical Authority contributed to the torture of the defendants.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/680/eg9.htm Not just the Queen Boat: HRW is asking the Egyptian government to stop persecuting homosexuals and commit to reform]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report in the Egyptian press, &quot;the government accuses human rights groups of importing a Western agenda that offends local religious and cultural values. Rights groups deny this claim, but independent critics argue that it's not void of some truth. Citing the failure of these groups to create a grass-roots movement, critics point to &quot;imported&quot; issues such as female genital mutilation and gay rights as proof that many human rights groups have a Western agenda that seems more important than pressing issues that matter to ordinary Egyptiansâsuch as environmental, labour, housing and educational rights,&quot; and says that the issues brought up at the press conference to launch the above report,
&quot;reminded some in the audience of US efforts to impose its own vision of democracy in Egypt as part of the US administration's plan for a Greater Middle East.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

==Palestinians in Egypt==

Palestinians who lived in the [[Gaza Strip]] when Israel came into being were issued with Egyptian travel documents which allowed them to move outside of the Gaza Strip, and [[Egypt]]. Their status as refugees has been deteriorating rapidly since the 1970s. After 1948 they were allowed rights similar to Egyptian nationals, and in 1963 they were allowed to own agricultural land, nor did they have to acquire work visas. In 1964 the government decreed that Palestinian refugees had to obtain an exit visa, an entry visa or a transit visa. In 1976 a law was passed stating that no foreigners could own real property, although Palestinians were later granted the right to own agricultural land. In 1978 the ability of Palestinians to work in the civil service was revoked. Gradually the process of attaining travel documents for Palestinians has become more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Citizenship and the State in the Middle East, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Jordanian Palestinians who hold two year passports are now required to obtain entry and exit visas to travel to Egypt.

President [[Anwar Sadat]] enacted a law which banning Palestinian children from attending public schools.  He enacted Law 48, banning Palestinian workers from employment in the public sector. Palestinians came under surveillance by Egyptian security services after the 1978 assassination Egyptian Minister of Culture [[Yusuf al-Sibai]] by the Palestinian terrorist group [[Abu Nidal]].&lt;ref&gt;Aroub el-Abed, Unprotected: Palestinians in Egypt since 1948 (Washington: Institute for Palestine Studies, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt has been accused of practicing apartheid against Palestinian residents by refusing to grant them the opportunity to become citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abu Toameh, &quot;What About The Arab Apartheid?&quot; March 16, 2010, Hudson Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions for detainees and torture==
According to the [[Egyptian Organization for Human Rights]], 701 cases of torture at Egyptian police stations have been documented since 1985, with 204 victims dying of torture and mistreatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailynewsegypt.com/human-a-civil-rights/eohr-calls-for-investigating-900-torture-cases.html EOHR calls for investigating 900 torture cases], by  Marwa Al-A'sar/Daily News Egypt| 22 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The group contends that crimes of torture `occur in Egyptian streets in broad daylight, at police checkpoints, and in people's homes in flagrant violation of the people's dignity and freedom.` &lt;ref&gt;''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MaacMillan, 2008. p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 report of the [[National Council for Human Rights]], chaired by former UN secretary-general and former Egyptian deputy prime minister [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], cites instances of torture of detainees in Egyptian prisons and describes the deaths while in custody of 9 individuals as, &quot;regrettable violations of the right to life.&quot; The report called for &quot;an end to [a] state of emergency, which has been in force since 1981, saying it provided a loophole by which the authorities prevent some Egyptians enjoying their right to personal security.&quot;

According to an [[Al-Jazeera]] report, the Council asked government departments to respond to complaints, but &quot;The Interior Ministry, which runs the police force and the prisons, ...answered [only] three out of 75 torture allegations.&quot; The council also recommended that President [[Hosni Mubarak]], &quot;issue a decree freeing detainees...in bad health.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A2F224BF-44BE-41C9-A59E-9B66C09373CD.htm|title=Report on Egypt human rights critical|publisher=[[Al-Jazeera]].net|date=10 April 2005|accessdate =1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
