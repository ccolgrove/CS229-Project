The '''Chacoan Mara''', '''''Dolichotis salinicola''''', is a relatively large [[rodent]] from [[South America]] of the [[cavy]] family. They are a close relative of the better known [[Patagonian Mara]].

==Habitat==

The Chacoan Mara lives in the South American [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]], the dry thorny forests and grasslands of [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Bolivia]]. [[Mara (mammal)|Mara]]s dig a [[burrow]] to sleep in at night.

==Food &amp; diet==

The Chacoan Mara eat grasses and other herbage. They will eat nearly any available vegetation

==Social structure==

Chacoan Maras live in small groups of up to four animals. 

==Scientific classfication and relatives==

The Chacoan Mara is from the Family Caviidae, which includes cavies, such as their larger relative the [[capybara]], and [[guinea pigs]]. Chacoan Maras are closely related to the other member of the ''Dolichotis'' Genus, the Patagonian Mara. Maras are the fourth largest rodent in the world after the [[capybara]]s, [[beaver]]s and [[porcupine]]s . Though the Mara may look like a [[rabbit]], the rabbit is not actually a rodent and therefore not as closely related to the Mara as one might expect.
