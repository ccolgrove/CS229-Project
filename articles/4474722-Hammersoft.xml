'''Cefn Mawr''' is a large [[village]] in the [[Community (Wales)|community]] of [[Cefn (community)|Cefn]] within the [[County Borough]] of [[Wrexham (county borough)|Wrexham]], [[Wales]]. Its name translates as &quot;great ridge&quot;. 

The community of Cefn comprises the villages of Cefn Mawr, Cefn-bychan (&quot;little ridge&quot;), [[Acrefair]], Penybryn, Newbridge, Plasmadoc and [[Rhosymedre]] and is situated on the northern slopes of the [[River Dee, Wales|Dee Valley]].

== History ==
Cefn Mawr was part of the ancient parish of [[Ruabon]] and the area was known as ''Cristionydd Cynrig'' (or ''Cristionydd Kenrick'' in English). In 1844, most of Cristionydd Cynrig, together with the neighbouring township of ''Coed Cristionydd'' became part of the new parish of Rhosymedre.&lt;ref name=genuki&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/DEN/Rhosymedre/ Rhosymedre, St John], [[GENUKI]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cefn railway station]] served the village from 1848 to 1960.

== Industry ==

Cefn Mawr was formerly heavily industrialised, with large deposits of [[iron]] and [[coal]] and [[sandstone]], and  heavy industry dominated the area in the 18th and 19th centuries. Iron was worked at several [[blast furnace]]s and [[forge]]s throughout the area and coal was dug at [[coal mining|pits]] in Cefn, Plas Kynaston and Dolydd. Stone was cut at quarries above Cefn Mawr. Much of the mineral wealth of the area was exported by canal over the [[Pontcysyllte]] Aqueduct on the [[Shropshire Union Canal]], until the railway reached Ruabon in 1855.

In 1867 Robert Ferdinand Graesser, an industrial chemist from Obermosel in [[Saxony]], [[Germany]] established a chemical works at Plas Kynaston to extract [[paraffin]] oil and wax from the local [[shale]]. The company later expanded into the production of [[coal tar]], [[carbolic acid]] and [[phenol]]. The site soon became the world's leading phenol producer. In 1919 the US chemical company [[Monsanto Company]] entered into a partnership with Graesser's chemical works to produce [[vanillin]], [[salicylic acid]], [[aspirin]] and later [[rubber]] processing chemicals. The site was later operated by Flexsys, a subsidiary of [[Solutia]], but production ceased in 2010.
With the closure of the nearby [[Air Products]] site at Acrefair, the manufacturing side of the village has almost disappeared. There is still a supermarket in the village although it has changed hands from [[Kwik Save]] to [[Somerfield]] to the [[The Co-operative brand|Co-Op]]. Construction has also begun on a large Tesco Extra store in the village, which is due to open early 2012.
