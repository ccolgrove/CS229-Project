Also during this period 4 patent double shuttered sails were installed. These were struck by rack and pinion via a chain pole and drove 3 pairs of stones. [[Photograph]]s from that period show the windmill had one pair of sails had 7 bays of 3 shutters and the other pair had 8 bays of 3 shutters. The top of the mill was capped with a dome with a [[finial]]. This capping was boarded horizontally and it had a 16 sided petticoat. There was also a gallery and an 8 bladed fan&lt;ref name=&quot;norfolkmills.co.uk&quot;/&gt;
