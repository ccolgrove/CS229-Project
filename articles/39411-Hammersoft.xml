'''XYY syndrome''' is an [[aneuploidy]] (abnormal number) of the [[sex chromosome]]s in which a [[human]] [[male]] receives an extra [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]], giving a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the more usual 46. This produces a '''47,XYY''' [[karyotype]].  This condition is usually asymptomatic and affects 1 in 1000 male births.

Some medical geneticists question whether the term &quot;[[syndrome]]&quot; is appropriate for this condition because its [[phenotype]] is normal{{contradiction-inline|date=December 2011|reason=Below, it is stated to result in lowered IQs (and greater heights)}} and the vast majority (an estimated 97% in the UK) of 47,XYY males do not know their [[karyotype]].&lt;ref name=allanson&gt;{{cite book |author=Graham, Gail E.; Allanson, Judith E.; Gerritsen, Jennifer A. |year=2007 |chapter=Sex chromosome abnormalities |editor=Rimoin, David L.; Connor, J.

==Physical traits==
Most often, the extra Y-chromosome causes no unusual physical features or medical problems. Since XYY is not characterized by distinct physical features, the condition is usually detected only during genetic analysis for another reason.

==Cause==
[[File:XYY syndrome.svg|thumb|right]]47,XYY is not inherited, but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cells. An error in chromosome separation during anaphase II (of [[meiosis#Meiosis II|meiosis II]]) called [[nondisjunction]] can result in sperm cells with an extra copy of the Y-chromosome. If one of these atypical sperm cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra Y-chromosome in each of the body's cells.&lt;ref name=ghr/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson do&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robinson, David O.; Jacobs, Patricia A. |date=November 1, 1999 |title=The origin of the extra Y chromosome in males with a 47,XYY karyotype |journal=[[Human Molecular Genetics|Hum Mol Genet]] |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=2205â2209 |pmid=10545600 |url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/8/12/2205.pdf |doi=10.1093/hmg/8.12.2205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the addition of an extra Y-chromosome results from nondisjunction during cell division during a post-zygotic [[mitosis]] in early embryonic development. This can produce 46,XY/47,XYY [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]s.&lt;ref name=ghr/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson do&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===1960s===
In April 1956, ''[[Hereditas]]'' published the discovery by [[cytogenetics|cytogeneticist]]s [[Joe Hin Tjio]] and [[Albert Levan]] at [[Lund University]] in [[Sweden]] that the normal number of chromosomes in [[ploidy|diploid]] human cells was 46ânot 48 as had been believed for the preceding thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1956.tb03010.x |author=Tjio, Joe Hin; Levan, Albert |date=April 1956 |title=The chromosome number of man |journal=[[Hereditas]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=1â6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the establishment of the normal number of human chromosomes, 47,XYY was the last of the common sex chromosome aneuploidies to be discovered, two years after the discoveries of [[Klinefelter's syndrome#Cause|47,XXY]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacobs, Patricia A.; Strong, John A. |date=January 31, 1959 |title=A case of human intersexuality having a possible XXY sex-determining mechanism |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=183 |issue=4657 |pages=302â3 |doi= 10.1038/183302a0 |pmid=13632697}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turner syndrome#History|45,X]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ford, Charles E.; Jones, Kenneth W.; Polani, Paul E.; de Almeida, JosÃ© Carlos Cabral; Briggs, John H. |date=April 4, 1959 |title=A sex-chromosome anomaly in a case of gonadal dysgenesis (Turner's syndrome) |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=273 |issue=7075 |pages=711â3 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(59)91893-8 |pmid=13642858}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Triple X syndrome#First_case|47,XXX]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jacobs, Patricia A.; Baikie, Albert G.; Court Brown, W.

For some, the urge to violence may be inbornâtraced to something called the Y chromosome...&lt;br /&gt;Once in every 500 male births, for example, the sex chromosome complement is XXY rather than XY, thus erring in the direction of femaleness. The resulting individual, called a Klinefelter male, is usually retarded, unusually tall and sterile.&lt;br /&gt;Erring in the other direction, however, is the XYY complement resulting in the &quot;supermale.&quot; He is also unusually tall and somewhat retarded, but appears to be highly, perhaps too highly, sexually motivated...&lt;br /&gt;We were intrigued by Dr. Jacobs' contention that an extra Y chromosome results in tall stature, mild mental retardation, and severely disordered personality characterized by violent, aggressive behavior. We therefore planned to confirm and extend her studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;''Syndrome Status for the XYY''&lt;br /&gt;The XXY male has long been thought to display a constellation of symptoms that makes him diagnosable; that is, he has achieved syndrome status. It would seem that the XYY male is fast achieving similar status. His symptoms, as we and other laboratories tend to think of them, are: extremely tall stature, long limbs and strikingly long arm span, facial acne, mild mental retardation, severe mental illness (including psychosis) and aggressive, antisocial behavior with a long history of arrests, frequently beginning at an early age.&lt;br /&gt;On reading newspaper accounts of Richard Speck, who murdered eight Chicago student nurses in 1966, we noted all these traits and therefore concluded that Speck was a likely candidate for the XYY disorder. Independently, a cytogenetic laboratory in Chicago confirmed this hunch, reinforcing our inclination to believe that the XYY syndrome is really coming of age. It seems quite possible that in the XYY male, exemplified by Speck, biologists are describing in genetic terms a certain type of defective criminal who has long been explicitly recognized by the forensic psychiatrist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]''âusing Telfer as a main sourceâintroduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Daniel Hugon&quot;&gt;Daniel Hugon, Paris, France

In 1962, Court Brown had been the first to suggestâbased on findings of antisocial behavior in some institutionalized [[Klinefelter's syndrome]] (47,XXY) patients and psychosis in some institutionalized [[Triple X syndrome]] (47,XXX) patientsâthat individuals with sex chromosome abnormalities could be held in law to suffer from diminished responsibility.
