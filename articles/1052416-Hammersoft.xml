'''Claudine Auger''' (born '''Claudine Oger''' on 26 April 1941) is a French actress best known for her role as [[Bond girl]] [[Domino Vitali|Dominique &quot;Domino&quot; Derval]] in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965). She earned the title of [[Miss France Monde]] and was also the first runner-up in the [[Miss World 1958|1958 Miss World]] contest.  

Born in [[Paris]], [[France]], she attended St. Joan of Arc College and later Paris Drama Conservatory, where she performed dramatic roles.  She made her film debut when she was still at school.  [[Jean Cocteau]] cast her in an uncredited role as a tall ballerina in ''The Testament of Orpheus'' (1960).  When she was 18, she married the 41-year-old writer-director Pierre Gaspard-Huit, and he cast her in several films, including ''[[The Iron Mask]]'' (1962) and ''The Vengeance of Kali'' (1963).  

When she was on holiday in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], writer-producer [[Kevin McClory]] who was also on holiday there, saw her and recommended that she audition for his film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).  The role of Domino was originally to be an Italian woman: Dominetta Petacchi. Auger impressed the producers so much that they re-wrote the part to that of a French woman to better suit Auger.  Although she took lessons to perfect her English, her voice was eventually dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]] in this movie.  Auger would claim that she related to her character Domino, as she and Domino were involved with older men.  The most immediate by-product of Claudine's stardom was a semi-nude ''[[Playboy]]'' spread and a guest shot on an American TV special starring [[Danny Thomas]] and [[Bob Hope]]. 

''Thunderball'' launched Auger into a successful European movie career, but did little for her otherwise in the United States.

In 1971, she starred with two other [[Bond girls]], [[Barbara Bach]] and [[Barbara Bouchet]], in ''[[Black Belly of the Tarantula]]'', a [[giallo]] mystery. She had some roles in European films as ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966) (reuniting her with her James Bond director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]) and ''[[The Killing Game (1967 film)|The Killing Game]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/2828/Claudine-Auger/biography |title=Claudine Auger |first=Hal |last=Erickson |publisher=All Movie Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to businessman Peter Brent until his death in August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/11/12/1995-11-12_kiss_of_death.html |title=KISS OF DEATH |first=MICHAEL |last=RIEDEL |work=New York Daily News |date=November 12, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
