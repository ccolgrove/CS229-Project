'''Google Apps''' is a service from [[Google]] providing independently customizable versions of several Google products under a custom [[domain name]]. It features several [[Web application]]s with similar functionality to traditional [[office suite]]s, including: [[Gmail]], [[Google Groups]], [[Google Calendar]], [[Google Talk|Talk]], [[Google Docs|Docs]] and [[Google Sites|Sites]]. It was the vision of Rajen Seth, a Google employee who later on developed Chromebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/10/chromebook-raises-second-child/|title=Article in Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Google Apps is free and offers the same amount of storage as regular Gmail accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;increased_storage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/more-gmail-storage-coming-for-all.html |title= More Gmail storage coming for all |author= Rob Siemborski |publisher=[[Google]] |date= 2007-10-12 |accessdate= 2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Apps for Business, which offers additional e-mail storage, is available for an annual fee per user account. Google Apps for Education, which is free, combines features from the Standard and Premier editions.

In addition to shared apps (calendar, docs, etc.), there is Google Apps Marketplace, which is an App &quot;store&quot; for Google Apps users.  It contains various apps, both free and for a fee, which can be installed to customize the Google Apps experience for the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/|title=Google Apps Marketplace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* '''May 10, 2011''' - The number of free accounts for Google Apps (formerly Google Apps Standard Edition) drops from 50 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helping small businesses start and manage Google Apps for Business|url=http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2011/04/helping-small-businesses-start-and.html|publisher=Google|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mid-End of 2010'''{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2011}} - Google started rejecting registration of [[dot tk]] domains for Google Apps (Google Apps Standard Edition at that time), but it did not affect Google Apps for Business (Google Apps Premiere Edition at the time) and Google Apps for Education (Google Apps Education Edition at the time). All Google Apps accounts using dot tk domains registered before March 2010 became disabled. When affected users try to use Google Apps, they get the following message: &quot;This account has been disabled.&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

*'''August 3, 2010''' - Google Senior Vice President Urs HÃ¶lzle announced that Google will cease development of Google Wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Update on Google Wave|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html|work=The Google Wave Blog|publisher=Google|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''May 24, 2010''' - Google announced that [[Google Wave]] will be available to domains hosted by Google Apps in next generation (only US English).

*'''January 29, 2009''' - Google added Google Apps to the Google Labs suite. This allows users to add gadgets to their inbox such as 'Offline', 'Tasks', and 'Vacation Time!'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://glamizer.blogspot.com/2009/01/gmail-gets-offline-support-finally.html | title=Gmail Gets Offline Support, Finally | publisher=shilpz | accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large implementation of Google Apps is at [[Lakehead University]] in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, where 38,000 users have Gmail and in-browser [[instant messaging|IM]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.ca/news/column/8088b6470a01040800f483b40707b39a/pg1.htm | title=Google Apps: Killer software or killer decision? | author=Lee Rickwood | publisher=PCWorld.ca | date=2007-03-23 | accessdate=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''August 2006''' - Google expanded on this service and developed Google Apps For Your Domain, incorporating more recent Google services, including Google Calendar, Google Talk, and Google Page Creator. Later, Google added a &quot;Start Page&quot; to all accounts, which is based on their [[iGoogle]] service.

*'''February 2006''' - Google created Gmail For Your Domain with an invitation-only beta, which allowed Gmail to be used with a custom domain name. It featured 2&amp;nbsp;GB of [[e-mail]] storage, and many of the standard Gmail features.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Differences between editions==
Google Apps is available in a number of distinct editions.

Each edition has a limit on the number of users that may be active at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zadling.com/google-apps/google-apps-faq-standard-vs-premiere/ | title = Google Apps FAQ: Standard vs. Premiere | publisher = [[Zadling]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google Apps launched with a default user allotment of 200 users, which was shortly changed to 100 users. In addition, users could request to have their user limit increased through a manual process taking (at least) 1â2 weeks for approval. In January 2009, the cap was changed so that all new accounts would receive only 50 users as opposed to 100, and could not request more without payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?answer=113251 | title = Google Help Center: Standard Edition user accounts | publisher = [[Google]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed as relating to the launch of the Google Apps commercial reseller program. Existing Standard Edition users before January 2009 kept their old allocation, in addition to the ability their &quot;request&quot; more users, though these limit requests are now commonly answered with suggestions to &quot;upgrade your subscription&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2009/01/50-user-limit-for-new-standard-edition.html | title = Google Apps Blog - 50 user limit for new Standard Edition customers | publisher = [[Google]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the limit on the free Google Apps product was further reduced to 10 users, effective for new users. 

The subscription level of a Google Apps edition is billed based on the total number of available users in the Apps account, and the edition features apply to all users accounts in that subscription. It is not possible to purchase upgrades for a subset of users: to increase the user limit, subscriptions must be purchased for all accounts. For example, an upgrade from a &quot;Standard&quot; limit of 50 users to allow up to 60 users would involve paying for 60 users, whether they are used or not.

==Critiques==
Analyst firm [[Real Story Group | The Real Story Group]] cited several weaknesses in Google Apps in a comparative review which referenced a lack of administrative, customization, and lifecycle services that might hamper effectiveness in large enterprise environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realstorygroup.com/Reports/Collaboration/ | title=Enterprise Collaboration &amp;amp; Social Software Vendor Evaluations | accessdate=2011-04-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Data security]] issues and [[national interests]] mean that online application platforms can be unsuitable for use by governments or commercial organisations.  Especially so for non-US organisations sharing, editing and storing sensitive or confidential data.

# On March 10, 2009, Google reported that a bug in Google Docs had allowed unintended access to some private documents. It was believed that 0.05% of documents stored via the service were affected by the bug, which Google claimed has been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=CNG.54c3200989573ae4c9282658f91276df.481&amp;show_article=1 Google software bug shared private online documents], AFP, March 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# In the UK, it is not possible to obtain information relating to Google and [[RIPA]] requests &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psni.police.uk/google_ripa.pdf Example FOI request wrt Google and RIPA], PSNI, Date Unknown&lt;/ref&gt; but we know that [[MI5]] and [[MI6]] make frequent use of their information because of quotes like, &quot;but I can say that the '''intelligence agencies''', police forces and other law enforcement agencies are the principal users of communications data&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2008/jul/uk-interception-of-comm-report-2007.pdf Report of the
Interception of
Communications
Commissioner
for 2007], House of Commons, July 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; in the annual RIPA reports.

==Adoption==

It is not known how many people use the Google Apps platform, although a Google blog post in March 2010 claimed that 25 million people had &quot;switched to Google Apps.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/25-million-people-have-gone-google.html Google Blog stating that 25 million people have adopted Apps]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Google is making a concerted effort to increase usage, particularly in the public sector. The most recent example was the announcement in June, 2011 by the [[NOAA]] that 25,000 government employees would be migrated to Google Apps by years end. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/cloud-saas/230500174]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Los Angeles, California awarded Google a five-year contract to provide Google Apps services to 34,000 employees.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; As of early 2011, the City of LA was still in the process of deploying Google Apps after objections from LAPD officials surfaced about privacy.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/google-los-angeles-hit-speed-bumps-on-move-to-cloud/37152?tag=mncol;txt]&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy's [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] shifted 5,000 email accounts to Google Apps.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft Google View To Sell U.S. Cloud Mail|work=Wall Street Journal|first=Amir|last=Efrati|date=July 26, 2010|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 2010, the [[General Services Administration]] certified that Google Apps met its GSA's cybersecurity requirements.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; On October 29, 2010, Google filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Interior, which opened up a bid for software that required that bidders use Microsoft's Business Productivity Online Suite.  Google sued, calling the requirement &quot;unduly restrictive of competition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scribd.com/doc/40513712/Google-v-US-Complaint Google, Inc. vs. the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have pointed out that, beginning in 2005, the prevalence of [[open standards]] and [[open source]] may begin to significantly change way that public entities (which represent some of the worlds' most significant software purchases) choose to select vendors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1656616 Casson and Ryan, Open Standards, Open Source Adoption in the Public Sector, and Their Relationship to Microsoftâs Market Dominance]&lt;/ref&gt;
