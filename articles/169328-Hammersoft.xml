'''Cheech &amp; Chong''' are a [[comedy duo]] consisting of [[Cheech Marin|Richard &quot;Cheech&quot; Marin]] and [[Tommy Chong]], who found a wide audience in the 1970s and 1980s for their films and [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] routines, which were based on the [[hippie]] and [[free love]] era, and especially [[drug culture]] movements, most notably their love for [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].

==Career==
[[File:Cheech and Chong 1972.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Cheech &amp; Chong in 1972.]]
The duo released many successful comedy [[record album|albums]], and starred in a series of low-budget films, becoming a successful comedy team. Some of their best-known comedy routines and songs include &quot;[[Earache My Eye]]&quot;, &quot;[[Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces|Basketball Jones]]&quot;, &quot;Santa Claus and His Old Lady&quot;, and &quot;[[Sister Mary Elephant]]&quot;. Perhaps their all-time most famous line is ''&quot;Dave's not here&quot;,'' from their [[Cheech and Chong (album)|self-titled debut album]].

Their early success culminated with the release of their first feature-length movie, ''[[Up in Smoke]]'', in 1978. Relatively successful, it became something of a [[cult classic]] and was successful enough to warrant a sequel, ''[[Cheech &amp; Chong's Next Movie]]'', in 1980, and  ''[[Nice Dreams]]'' in 1981. The pair attempted to shy away from stoner comedy with 1984's &quot;[[Cheech &amp; Chong's The Corsican Brothers]]&quot; but the film was universally panned by critics and fans alike. 

Tommy Chong directed four of their films, while co-writing and starring in all seven with Cheech Marin.

They also appeared in smaller supporting roles in [[Graham Chapman]]'s ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[After Hours]]''.

In [[1985 in music|1985]] the duo released their album ''Get Out of My Room'', which included the novelty hit song, &quot;[[Born in East L.A.]]&quot; (based on [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s &quot;[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]&quot;).  This song would later serve as the basis for the [[1987 in film|1987]] [[Born in East L.A.|film of the same name]], in which [[Cheech Marin]] played the starring role. Immediately following the release of the album, [[Cheech Marin]] separated himself from the pair's drug-inspired act by working on a solo career. &lt;!-- Marin and Chong have articles describing their solo careers in more detail. --&gt;

Chong also appeared in the hit sitcom &quot;[[That '70s Show]]&quot; as [[Leo (That '70s Show)|Leo]], the owner of the Foto Hut.

===Reunion===
After their contentious parting in the 1980s, the duo had a less-than-stellar friendship. Chong recalled going to Cheech's birthday party in 1994 and seeing Cheech &quot;on the couch with his arm around his wife like we had just met. It wasn't comfortable.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

They somewhat reunited in 2000 to voice characters in the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'' for the episode &quot;[[Cherokee Hair Tampons]]&quot;, though their voices were recorded separately. In 1997, Chong also made an appearance on the show ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', which Cheech co-starred alongside [[Don Johnson]]. He appeared on an episode entitled &quot;Wild Card&quot;, which also featured [[Philip Michael Thomas]], who was Don Johnson's co-star on the popular '80s show ''[[Miami Vice]]''. The episode contained a reference to their iconic &quot;Dave&quot; skit from their 1972 debut album. Both Cheech and Chong indicated in an 2003 episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' that they were willing to reunite.

The duo had plans to reunite for another film when Tommy Chong's California-based company, Chong's Glass, was raided by federal officials on February 25, 2003, as part of a federal crackdown on &quot;drug-related paraphernalia.&quot; Tommy Chong pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to distribute drug paraphernalia in May and on September 11, 2003, was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, fined US$20,000, and forced to forfeit US$120,000 in assets. He served the time between October 8, 2003 and July 7, 2004. Chong agreed to a plea bargain which allowed his son and wife to remain out of jail.

With Chong released, the duo planned to resume production on their latest opus. A variety of titles were rumored, including ''Grumpy Old Stoners''. Cheech and Chong announced on September 8, 2005 that the reunion film had been canceled. In a 2007 interview, Chong hinted that the reunion may be back on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cheechandchong.com/news/ |title=cheechandchong.com |publisher=cheechandchong.com |date=2010 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
