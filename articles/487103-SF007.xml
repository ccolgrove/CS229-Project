'''up2date''', also known as the '''Red Hat Update Agent''', is a tool used by older versions of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]], [[CentOS]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]] that downloads and installs new software and upgrades the operating system. It functions as a front-end to the [[RPM Package Manager]] and adds advanced features such as automatic dependency resolution. The file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/sysconfig/rhn/sources&lt;/tt&gt; specifies where up2date will search for packages.

By default, [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]'s up2date retrieves packages from a [[Red Hat Network]] (RHN) server, though users can add directories full of packages or even [[Debian]] and [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]] repositories if they wish.

up2date on [[Fedora Core]] defaults to  retrieving packages from [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]] repositories. Again, other sources can be added (apart from RHN, which is Red Hat Enterprise Linux Specific).  As of Fedora Core 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, up2date is no longer shipped with the distribution; [[Yellow dog Updater Modified|yum]] is used instead.

[[CentOS]]'s up2date downloads packages from [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]] repositories on the [http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=13 CentOS Mirror Network].
