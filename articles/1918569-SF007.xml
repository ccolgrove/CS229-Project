'''Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie''' is a fictional character on [[UPN]]/[[CW Television Network|The CW]] television series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', portrayed by [[Tina Majorino]]. She was a recurring character during the first two seasons, and was promoted to series regular status for the third season.

Mac uses her [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] and cracking skills to help [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica]] with her cases; the two joke that she is a kind of [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] to Veronica's [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. Whether coincidentally or not, Mac (a common nickname for &quot;Mackenzie&quot;) has also shown a decided preference for [[Apple Macintosh]] computers, which share her nickname.

== Background ==
Mac is 19, a [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] and her hometown is Neptune, [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;myspace&quot;&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/vmarsmac MySpace.com - MAC - 20 - Fille - Neptune, Alabama - www.myspace.com/vmarsmac&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; True to the show's spirit of moral grey areas, in the episode where Mac is introduced, she helps Veronica find out who has stolen her password and has created a false score under her name on a purity test that had become a brief fad at Neptune High. The moral ambiguity of the show is best shown in the fact that Mac, although a friend of Veronica's, is the person who created the test in the first place, thus making it possible for the &quot;sex crazed 09ers&quot; to access other people's purity tests - and thus is also responsible for the chaos which is the focus of this episode. Veronica however harbors no resentment towards Mac for this, only caring about those that took tests for others.

Like Veronica, Mac uses an [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[PowerBook]] and in season three, a [[MacBook Pro]]. Mac vehemently defends the [[Mac OS X]] operating system (in the episode &quot;[[Weapons of Class Destruction]]&quot;) in an argument with an [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] fan. 

Mac has always felt like an outsider in her family, having completely different tastes and views to them. While digging for dirt on Mac's parents, Veronica discovers that Mac was [[babies switched at birth|switched at birth]] with [[Madison Sinclair]]. Since the mistake was uncovered four years after the births, the parents decided to keep the children. Each family received a handsome cash settlement from the hospital. While Madison's family invested and flourished, Mac's started a business and went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. Interestingly, Mac's biological mother shows some longing to know Mac, while Madison's biological family have no interest in her whatsoever.

She formerly dated [[Cassidy Casablancas]], but the relationship ends when Cassidy balks at becoming sexually intimate with Mac. They are back together in time for graduation in &quot;[[Not Pictured]]&quot;; in the same episode, however, Veronica discovers that Cassidy had been responsible for (among other things) the bus crash that occurred in &quot;[[Normal Is the Watchword]]&quot;. Cassidy, intercepting Veronica's message, robs and abandons Mac while she is in the shower, leaving her without clothes. He then attempts to kill Veronica, and, later that night, commits [[suicide]].

Mac attends Hearst College along with Veronica and she initially is uncomfortable with male attention. A series of [[rapes]] on campus bring up bad memories. However, she is eventually able to move on and have successful relationships. Though she at first feels uncomfortable with her new roommate, [[Parker Lee]], Parker's rape helps Mac to see her as vulnerable. When Parker's parents come to take her home, Mac tells her that she should stay, ensuring Parker's presence for the rest of the series. It is thanks to Mac that Parker and Logan get together on the treasure hunt.

At Hearst, Mac falls for and dates an animal-rights activist named Bronson Pope. They date for a few episodes until Mac meets Max, a student who sells copies of exams. After the two connect, Mac breaks up with Bronson and begins dating Max, who she is with at the end of the series.
