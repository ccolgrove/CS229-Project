{{2010 Big Ten football standings}}

The '''2010 Michigan State Spartans football team''' competed on behalf of [[Michigan State University]] in the [[Big Ten Conference]] during the [[2010 NCAA Division I FBS football season]]. [[Head coach]] [[Mark Dantonio]] was in his fourth season with the Spartans. Michigan State played their home games in [[Spartan Stadium (East Lansing)|Spartan Stadium]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]], U.S.

In the hours following the Spartans' September 18, 2010 victory over [[2010 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], Coach Dantonio suffered a [[heart attack]] for which he was hospitalized, and received a [[coronary stent]].  His recovery was complicated by the subsequent development of a blood clot in his leg.  While he recovered, [[offensive coordinator]] Don Treadwell stepped in as acting head coach, leading the Spartans against [[University of Northern Colorado|Northern Colorado]] and [[2010 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]].  Dantonio resumed his head coaching duties for the sixth game of the season against [[2010 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], although he coached that game and the next week's game against [[2010 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] from the press box instead of the head coach's traditional place on the sidelines.  He returned to the sidelines for MSU's road win against [[2010 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].

The Spartans finished the regular season with eleven wins (the most in school history), one loss, and secured their first share of the Big Ten Championship in twenty years.

The Spartans rushing attack was the theme of the day. To open up the scoring, Edwin Baker scampered for 28 yards for a TD. WMU responded with 1-yd TD pass from Alex Carder to Juan Nunez on 4th down. The Spartans would strike early in the 2nd quarter when QB Kirk Cousins hit QB turned WR Keith Nichol on a 20-yd TD pass. 

Both offenses then struggled until late in the 2nd quarter when true freshmen Le'Veon Bell broke a 75-yd run. The drive ended with a 7-yd Edwin Baker TD run and the following Spartan drive ended with a 2-yd TD run by Le'Veon Bell. MSU drove down the field at the beginning of the 3rd quarter which ended with an 18-yd TD run by Le'Veon Bell.

WMU would score once more with 2-yd TD reception Blake Hammond and that would be it offensively for the Broncos. The Spartans would add a field goal by Dan Conroy and walk away with a season opening win.
Le'Veon Bell became the first freshman running back at Michigan State to rush for more than 100 yards in his opening game. He finished with 141 yards on 10 carries and 2 TD's. Edwin Baker also had over 100 yards with 117 yards on 17 carries with 2 TD's.

With Coach Dantonio out for a second week following his heart attack, Michigan State hosted eventual co-champs Wisconsin at Spartan Stadium in the conference opener. MSU rolled up 444 yards of offense on the Badgers in a 34-24 win. The Spartans took the lead for good with 8:11 left in the 2nd quarter when Keshawn Martin returned a punt 74 yards for a TD. A clock-draining 15-play TD drive late in the 4th quarter put MSU up by 10 and set the tone for the rest of the Big Ten season.

In week 6, Michigan hosted their in-state rivals the Michigan State Spartans for the coveted [[Paul Bunyan Trophy]]. This year's meeting marked the 103rd game between the two schools. This was only the second time in the history of the rivalry that both teams enter the game undefeated.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://newsok.com/the-list-michigan-state-michigan-put-unblemished-records-on-the-line/article/3502939#ixzz11tbwOSmW]&quot;. NewsOK October 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The last time was in 1999 when MSU beat Michigan 34â31 in East Lansing. The only score of the first quarter was Michigan's 34 yard field goal. In the second quarter Michigan State responded with a 61 yard rushing touchdown by [[Edwin Baker]]. Michigan took the lead minutes later with a 12 yard catch by Martell Webb. The Spartans responded with a 41 yard run by [[Le'Veon Bell]]. They added to their lead with a 38 yard field goal by [[Dan Conroy]] just before halftime. MSU built on their lead in the third quarter with 2 touchdowns: first a 41 yard catch by [[Mark Dell]], and an 8 yard rush by [[Larry Caper]]. Michigan's only points of the second half came on a 4 yard rushing TD by Denard Robinson. Michigan State sealed their win with a 28 yard field goal midway through the fourth. Denard Robinson had perhaps his worst game throwing three interceptions and being held to only 84 yards rushing.  

With this win, Michigan State has defeated Michigan three years in a row, the first time that Michigan State has accomplished that since 1965â67.

The Spartans found themselves down 17â0 late in the first half, before Kirk Cousins found Mark Dell for a touchdown with 2:34 to go in the second quarter to make it a 17â7 game at halftime.  With a ten point deficit early in the fourth quarter, the Spartans were situated with a 4th and 6 at the Northwestern 30 yd line, but out of field goal range because of a heavy wind.  After calling a timeout and taking a delay of game, MSU went out in punt formation.  After punter Aaron Bates received the snap, he faked the punt and threw a 15 yd pass to Bennie Fowler for a first down.  During the post game interview, Coach Dantonio was asked about the play, when he replied &quot;That's called Mousetrap, and we let 'em take the cheese.&quot; The Spartans scored on a Kirk Cousins pass on the next play to make it 24â21. After a Northwestern field goal, the Spartans drove 88 yards in five minutes to take the lead 28â27.  The Wildcats went four and out on their next possession, but had another chance to tie the game after Edwin Baker ran for a 25 yd touchdown with a minute left to make it 35â27.  However, Michigan State's  Eric Gordon intercepted the ball two plays later to ice the game.
