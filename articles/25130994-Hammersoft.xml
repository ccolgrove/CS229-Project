The '''College of Science''' (abbreviated to '''KUCS''') is a division of [[Korea University]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. It was established in December 1952 as the Division of Science within the [[Korea University College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]]. The college offers various bachelor, master, and doctorate programs through affiliation with the [[Korea University Graduate School|Graduate School]]. Its major academic buildings are located on the university's Hana Square, which it shares with the [[Korea University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], the [[Korea University College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology|College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology]], and other colleges. It is widely regarded as one of the finest colleges of science in the country.

==History==
The College of Science at [[Korea University]], which was founded in 1905, rose in December 1952 from the College of Arts and Sciences, which included the Departments of Math/Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. Since then it has gone through several expansions to reach its current formation of four major departments in the [[Physical science|physical sciences]], while the Biology Department has been separated to form its own college.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.korea.ac.kr/new_home/e_new/e_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the college teaches 800 [[Undergraduate education|undergraduates]], with 63 full-time faculty members.

==Facilities==
There are nine research institutes within the college. The Korea Basic Science Institute in Seoul was also built on the campus in 1993. In 1996, [[Chung Ju-yung]], former Honorary Chairman of the [[Hyundai|Hyundai Group]], generously donated a building for the College of Science.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.korea.edu/aboutus/img/bulletin/02.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The Asan Science Building has six floors and a basement with an area of about 20,000 square meters. This building accommodates all four Departments in the College, as well as research laboratories, networked computer systems, multimedia lecture rooms, and other supporting facilities.
