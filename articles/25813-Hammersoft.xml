'''William Marsh Rice University''', commonly referred to as '''Rice University''' or '''Rice''', is a [[private university|private research university]] located on a heavily wooded {{convert|295|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].  The university is situated near the [[Houston Museum District]] and adjacent to the [[Texas Medical Center]].

Opened in 1912 after the murder of its namesake [[William Marsh Rice]], Rice has grown into a preeminent research university with an undergraduate focus.  Its emphasis on undergraduate education is demonstrated by a 5:1 student-faculty ratio, among the lowest in the [[College and university rankings|top American universities]] including the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rankingsandreviews2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings |title=National Universities Rankings - Best College |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of Rice University people|Rice alumni]] are prominent in every sector of society today.

Rice competes in 14 [[NCAA Division I]] varsity sports and is a part of [[Conference USA]], often competing with its cross-town rival the [[HoustonâRice rivalry|University of Houston]].  Intramural and club sports are offered in a wide variety of activities such as [[Jiu Jitsu]], [[water polo]], and [[Rowing (sport)|crew]].  Rice athletes include [[Lance Berkman]], [[Harold Solomon]], [[Bubba Crosby]], [[Arsalan Kazemi]], along with three Olympians.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Willy2.gif|thumb|left|150px|William Marsh Rice's estate funded the establishment of the Rice Institute]]
The history of Rice University began with the untimely demise of Massachusetts businessman [[William Marsh Rice]]. Rice made his fortune in real estate, railroad development and cotton trading in the state of [[Texas]]. In 1891, Rice decided to charter a free-tuition educational institute in Houston, bearing his name, to be created upon his death, earmarking most of his estate towards funding the project. On the morning of September 23, 1900, Rice was found dead by his valet, and presumed to have died in his sleep. Shortly thereafter, a suspiciously large check made out to Rice's New York City lawyer, signed by the late Rice, was noticed by a bank teller due to a misspelling in the recipient's name. The lawyer, [[Albert T. Patrick]], then announced that Rice had changed his will to leave the bulk of his fortune to Patrick, rather than to the creation of Rice's educational institute. A subsequent investigation led by the District Attorney of New York resulted in the arrests of Patrick and of Rice's butler and valet Charles F. Jones, who had been persuaded to administer [[chloroform]] to Rice while he slept. Rice's friend and personal lawyer in Houston, [[James A. Baker, Sr.]], aided in the discovery of what turned out to be a fake will with a forged signature. Jones was not prosecuted since he cooperated with the district attorney, and testified against Patrick. Patrick was found guilty of conspiring to steal Rice's fortune and convicted of murder in 1901, although he was pardoned in 1912 due to conflicting medical testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Blum |first= Deborah |title= [[The Poisoner's Handbook: Murder and the Birth of Forensic Medicie in Jazz Age New York]] |publisher= [[Penguin Books]] |year= 2010 |pages= 14â6 |isbn= 978-0-14-311882-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker helped Rice's estate direct the fortune, worth $4.6 million in 1904 (${{inflation|US|4.6|1904}} million today), towards the founding of what was to be called the Rice Institute. The Board took control of the assets on April 29 of that year.
In 1907, the Board of Trustees selected the head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at [[Princeton University]], [[Edgar Odell Lovett]], to head the Institute, which was still in the planning stages. He came recommended by Princeton's president, [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In 1908, Lovett accepted the challenge, and was formally inaugurated as the Institute's first president on October 12, 1912. Lovett undertook extensive research before formalizing plans for the new Institute, including visits to 78 institutions of higher learning across the world on a long tour between 1908 and 1909. Lovett was impressed by such things as the aesthetic beauty of the uniformity of the architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], a theme which was adopted by the Institute, as well as the [[residential college]] system at [[Cambridge University]] in [[England]], which was added to the Institute several decades later. Lovett called for the establishment of a university &quot;of the highest grade,&quot; &quot;an institution of liberal and technical learning&quot; devoted &quot;quite as much investigation as to instruction.&quot; [We must] &quot;keep the standards up and the numbers down,&quot; declared Lovett. &quot;The most distinguished teachers must take their part in undergraduate teaching, and their spirit should dominate it all.&quot; [[File:Rice University Texas.jpg|thumb|Rice University]]

===Establishment and growth===
[[File:RiceInstitute1913.png|thumb|An illustration of the Administration Building of Rice University in 1913]]

In 1911 the cornerstone was laid for the Institute's first building, the Administration Building, now known as Lovett Hall in honor of the founding president. On September 23, 1912, the anniversary of William Marsh Rice's murder, the ''William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art'' began course work. 48 male and 29 female students were enrolled, paying no tuition, with classes taught by a dozen faculty. Unusually for the time, Rice accepted coeducational admissions. 

Three weeks after opening, a spectacular international academic festival was held in celebration, bringing Rice to the attention of the entire academic world. Four years later, at the first commencement ceremony, 35 bachelor's degrees and one master's degree were awarded. That year, the student body voted to adopt the Honor System, which still exists today. The first doctorate was conferred in 1918.

During [[World War II]], Rice Institute was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;list-of-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II |publisher=HyperWar Foundation |last= |first=  |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Founder's Memorial Statue, a bronze statue of a seated William Marsh Rice, holding the original plans for the campus, was dedicated in 1930, and installed in the central academic quad, facing Lovett Hall. The [[residential college]] system proposed by President Lovett was adopted in 1958, with the East Hall residence becoming [[Baker College]], South Hall residence becoming [[Will Rice College]], West Hall becoming [[Hanszen College]], and the temporary Wiess Hall becoming [[Wiess College]].

[[Image:JFK at Rice University.jpg|thumb|left|200px|John F. Kennedy speaking at [[Rice Stadium]] in 1962]]
In 1959, the [[Rice Institute Computer]] went online. 1960 saw Rice Institute formally renamed William Marsh Rice University. Rice acted as a temporary intermediary in the transfer of land between Humble Oil and Refining Company and [[NASA]],&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;[http://www.rice.edu/sallyport/2006/winter/features/Fact_Fiction2.html Rice.edu], Sallyport Online&lt;/ref&gt; for the creation of [[NASA]]'s Manned Spacecraft Center (now called [[Johnson Space Center]]) in 1962. [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] then made a speech&lt;ref&gt;[http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm John F. Kennedy, &quot;Moon&quot; Speech - Rice Stadium, Houston, Texas, September 12, 1962]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Rice Stadium]] reiterating that the United States intended to reach the moon before the end of the decade of the 1960s, and &quot;to become the world's leading space-faring nation&quot;. The relationship of [[NASA]] with Rice University and the city of Houston has remained strong {{as of | 2011 | alt = to the present day}}.

The original charter of Rice Institute dictated that the university admit and educate, tuition-free, &quot;the white inhabitants of Houston, and the state of Texas&quot;. In 1963, the governing board of Rice University filed a lawsuit to allow the university to modify its charter to admit students of all races and to charge tuition. In 1964, Rice officially amended the university charter to desegregate its graduate and undergraduate divisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rice.edu/sallyport/2007/Summer/features/Diversity.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Trustees of Rice University prevailed in a lawsuit to void the racial language in the trust in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Coffee v. William Marsh Rice University, 408 S.W.2d 269&lt;/ref&gt;. Rice began charging tuition for the first time in 1965. In the same year, Rice launched a $33 million (${{inflation|US|33|1965}} million) development campaign. $43 million (${{inflation|US|43|1970}} million) was raised by its conclusion in 1970. In 1974, two new schools were founded at Rice, the [[Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management]] and the [[Shepherd School of Music]]. The Brown Foundation Challenge, a fund-raising program designed to encourage annual gifts, was launched in 1976 and ended in 1996 having raised $185 million (${{inflation|US|185|1996}} million). The [[Rice School of Social Sciences]] was founded in 1979.

On-campus housing was exclusively for men for the first forty years. [[Jones College (Rice University)|Jones College]] was the first women's residence on the Rice campus, followed by [[Brown College (Rice University)#Brown College|Brown College]]. According to legend, the women's colleges were purposefully situated at the opposite end of campus from the existing men's colleges as a way of preserving campus propriety, which was greatly valued by Edgar Odell Lovett, who did not even allow benches to be installed on campus, fearing that they &quot;might lead to co-fraternization of the sexes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rice.edu/sallyport/2006/winter/features/Fact_Fiction2.html Rice Fact vs. Fiction #20]&lt;/ref&gt; The path linking the north colleges to the center of campus was given the tongue-in-cheek name of &quot;Virgin's Walk&quot;. Individual colleges became coeducational between 1973 and 1987, with the single-sex floors of colleges that had them becoming co-ed in 2006. By then, several new residential colleges had been built on campus to handle the university's growth, including [[Lovett College]], [[Sid Richardson College]], and [[Martel College]].

===Recent history===
[[File:Vladimir Putin in the United States 13-16 November 2001-25.jpg|thumb|right|[[George H.W. Bush]] meeting [[Vladimir Putin]] at Rice in 2001]]
The [[G8|Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations]] was held at Rice in 1990. In 1993, the [[James Baker Institute|James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy]] was created. In 1997, the Edythe Bates Old Grand Organ and Recital Hall and the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, renamed in 2005 for the late Nobel Prize winner and Rice professor [[Richard E. Smalley]], were dedicated at Rice. In 1999, the Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology was created. The [[Rice Owls baseball]] team was ranked #1 in the nation for the first time in that year (1999), holding the top spot for eight weeks. 

In 2003, the Owls won their first national championship in baseball, which was the first for the university in any team sport, beating Southwest Missouri State in the opening game and then the University of Texas and Stanford University twice each en route to the title. In 2008, President [[David Leebron]] issued a ten point plan titled &quot;Vision for the Second Century&quot; outlining plans to increase research funding, strengthen existing programs, and increase collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professor.rice.edu/professor/10_Points.asp | title=Vision for the Second Century - Ten Points |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has brought about another wave of campus constructions, including the erection the newly renamed [[Bioscience Research Collaborative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=12460 |title=Rice University &amp;#124; News &amp; Media |publisher=Media.rice.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; building (intended to foster collaboration with the adjacent [[Texas Medical Center]]), a new recreational center and renovated [[Autry Court|basketball stadium]], and the addition of two new residential colleges, [[Duncan College]] and [[McMurtry College]]. 

Beginning in late 2008, the university considered a merger with [[Baylor College of Medicine]], though the merger was ultimately rejected in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.ricethresher.org/media/storage/paper1290/news/2008/10/31/News/Rice-To.Consider.Merger.With.Baylor.College.Of.Medicine-3516841.shtml Rice to consider merger with Baylor College of Medicine - The Rice Thresher]&lt;/ref&gt; Select Rice undergraduates are currently guaranteed admission to Baylor College of Medicine upon graduation as part of the Rice/Baylor Medical Scholars program. According to History Professor John Boles' recent book ''University Builder: Edgar Odell Lovett and the Founding of the Rice Institute,'' the first president's original vision for the university included hopes for future medical and law schools.

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of Rice University}}
[[Image:Rice University - detail.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Herzstein Hall, in the Academic Quad]]

Rice's campus is a heavily-wooded {{convert|285|acre|km2|sing=on}} tract of land located close to the city of [[West University Place, Texas|West University Place]], in the museum district of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. 

Five streets demarcate the campus: Greenbriar Street, Rice Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Main Street, and University Boulevard. For most of its history, all of Rice's buildings have been contained within this &quot;outer loop&quot;. In recent years, new facilities have been built close to campus, but the bulk of administrative, academic, and residential buildings are still located within the original pentagonal plot of land. The new Collaborative Research Center, all graduate student housing, the Greenbriar building, and the Wiess President's House are located off-campus.

Rice prides itself on the amount of green space available on campus; there are only about 50 buildings spread between the main entrance at its easternmost corner, and the parking lots and [[Rice Stadium]] at the West end. The [[Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum]], consisting of more than 4000 trees and shrubs (giving birth to the legend that Rice has a tree for every student), is spread throughout the campus. 

The university's first president, [[Edgar Odell Lovett]], intended for the campus to have a uniform architecture style to improve its aesthetic appeal. To that end, nearly every building on campus is noticeably [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] in style, with sand and pink-colored bricks, large archways and columns being a common theme among many campus buildings. Noteworthy exceptions include the glass-walled Brochstein Pavilion, [[Lovett College]] with its [[Brutalism|Brutalist]]-style concrete gratings, and the eclectic-Mediterranean Duncan Hall. 

Lovett Hall, named for Riceâs visionary first president, is the universityâs most iconic campus building. Through its Sallyport arch, new students symbolically enter the university during matriculation and depart as graduates at commencement. Duncan Hall, Riceâs computational engineering building, was designed to encourage collaboration between the four different departments situated there. The buildingâs colorful Martel Foyer, drawn from many world cultures, was designed by the architect to symbolically express this collaborative purpose. 

The campus is organized in a number of [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]s. The Academic Quad, anchored by a statue of founder [[William Marsh Rice]], includes [[Ralph Adams Cram]]'s masterpiece, the asymmetrical Lovett Hall, the original administrative building; Fondren Library; Herzstein Hall, the physics building and home to the largest [[amphitheater]] on campus; Sewall Hall for the social sciences and arts; Rayzor Hall for the languages; and Anderson Hall of the Architecture department. The Humanities Building, winner of several architectural awards, is immediately adjacent to the main quad. Further west lies a quad surrounded by McNair Hall of the [[Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business|Jones Business School]], the [[James Baker Institute|Baker Institute]], and Alice Pratt Brown Hall of the [[Shepherd School of Music]]. These two quads are surrounded by the university's main access road, a one-way loop referred to as the &quot;inner loop&quot;. In the Engineering Quad, a trinity of sculptures by [[Michael Heizer]], collectively entitled ''45 Degrees, 90 Degrees, 180 Degrees'', are flanked by Abercrombie Laboratory, the Cox Building, and the Mechanical Laboratory, housing the Electrical, Mechanical, and Earth Science/Civil Engineering departments, respectively. Duncan Hall is the latest addition to this quad, providing new offices for the Computer Science, Computational and Applied Math, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Statistics departments. 
[[Image:Founders bench.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A stone bench in the Academic Quad]]

Roughly three-quarters of Rice's undergraduate population lives on campus. Housing is divided among eleven [[residential colleges]], which form an integral part of student life at the University (see [[Residential colleges of Rice University]].)  The colleges are named for university historical figures and benefactors, and while there is wide variation in their appearance, facilities, and dates of founding, are an important source of identity for Rice students, functioning as dining halls, residence halls, sports teams, among other roles. Rice does not have or endorse a [[Greek system]], with the residential college system taking its place. Five colleges, McMurtry, Duncan, Martel, Jones, and Brown are located on the north side of campus, across from the &quot;South Colleges&quot;, Baker, Will Rice, Lovett, Hanszen, Sid Richardson, and Wiess, on the other side of the Academic Quadrangle. Of the eleven colleges, Baker is the oldest, originally built in 1912, and the twin Duncan and McMurtry colleges are the newest, and opened for the first time for the 2009-10 school year. Will Rice, Baker, and Lovett colleges are undergoing renovation to expand their dining facilities as well as the number of rooms available for students.

[[Image:McNairHall 1.jpg|right|275px|thumb|McNair Hall, home to the Jones School of Business]]

The on-campus football facility, [[Rice Stadium]], opened in 1950 with a capacity of 70,000 seats. After improvements in 2006, the stadium is currently configured to seat 47,000 for football but can readily be reconfigured to its original capacity of 70,000, more than the total number of Rice alumni, living and deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riceowls.cstv.com/facilities/rice-stadium.html |title=Rice Official Athletic Site - Facilities |publisher=Riceowls.cstv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stadium was the site of [[Super Bowl VIII]] and a speech by [[John F. Kennedy]] on September 12, 1962 in which he challenged the nation to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;The speech, &quot;Why the Moon&quot; is available on the [http://webcast.rice.edu/webcast.php?action=details&amp;event=1166 Rice Webcast Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The recently renovated [[Tudor Fieldhouse]], formerly known as Autry Court, is home to the basketball and volleyball teams. Other stadia include the [[Rice Track/Soccer Stadium]] and the [[Jake Hess Tennis Stadium]]. A new Rec Center is being built on campus, which will house the intramural sports offices and provide an outdoor pool, training and exercise facilities for all Rice students, while athletics training will solely be held at Tudor Fieldhouse and the Rice Football Stadium.

The university and [[Houston Independent School District]] jointly established [[The Rice School]], a [[kindergarten]] through 8th grade public magnet school in Houston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.houstonisd.org/rice/j_history_of_trs.html Es.Houstonisd.org]{{dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school opened in August 1994.  Through Cy-Fair ISD Rice University offers a credit course based summer school for grades 8 through 12. They also have skills based classes during the summer in the Rice Summer School.

==Organization==
[[Image:Sallyport.JPG|thumb|left|Students walk through the Sallyport upon matriculation and commencement]]
Rice University is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed [[board of trustees]]. The board consists of a maximum of 25 voting members who serve four year terms and is currently chaired by [[James W. Crownover]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Governance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professor.rice.edu/professor/Governance1.asp |title=Rice Facts - University Governance |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees serve without compensation and a simple majority of trustees must reside in Texas, including at least 4 within the greater Houston area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohesion.rice.edu/Publications/FacultyHandbook/emplibrary/ACF1C8.pdf |format=PDF|title=Faculty Handbook |publisher=Rice University |month=August | year=2005 |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board of trustees delegates its power by appointing a President to serve as the chief executive of the university. [[David W. Leebron]] was appointed President in 2004 and succeeded [[Malcom Gillis]] who served since 1993. The provost, six vice presidents, and other university officials report to the President. The President is advised by a University Council composed of the Provost, eight members of the Faculty Council, two staff members, one graduate student, and two undergraduate students. The President presides over a Faculty Council which has the authority to alter curricular requirements, establish new degree programs, and approve candidates for degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt; Rice University possesses an [[financial endowment|endowment]] of $4.1 billion (as of 2011).

Rice's undergraduate students benefit from a centralized admissions process, which admits new students to the university as a whole, rather than a specific school (the schools of Music and Architecture are decentralized). Students are encouraged to select the major path that best suits their desires; a student can later decide that they would rather pursue study in another field, or continue their current coursework and add a second or third major. These transitions are designed to be simple at Rice, with students not required to decide on a specific major until their sophomore year of study.

Rice's academics are organized into six schools which offer courses of study at the graduate and undergraduate level, with two more being primarily focused on graduate education, while offering select opportunities for undergraduate students. Rice offers 360 degrees in over 60 departments. There are 40 undergraduate degree programs, 51 masters programs, and 29 doctoral programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Majors&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Degrees&quot;/&gt; 

Undergraduate tuition for the 2011-2012 school year is $34,900. $651 is charged for fees, and Rice projects an $800 budget for books and $1550 for personal expenses. Rice students are charged $12,270 for room and board. Per year, the total cost of a Rice University education is $50,171.&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Students&quot;/&gt;

Faculty members of each of the departments elect chairs to represent the department to each School's dean and the deans report to the Provost who serves as the chief officer for academic affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handbook&quot;/&gt;

==Academics==
[[Image:Lovett Hall.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Lovett Hall, formerly known as the Administration Building, was the first building on campus]]
Rice is a medium-sized, highly residential research university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&amp;subkey=16396&amp;start=782 |title=Carnegie Classifications - Rice University |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of enrollments are in the full-time, four-year undergraduate program emphasizing arts &amp; sciences and professions. There is a high graduate coexistence with the comprehensive graduate program and a very high level of research activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt; It is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] as well as the professional accreditation agencies for engineering, management, and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professor.rice.edu/professor/Accreditation.asp |title=Rice Facts - University Accreditation |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of Rice's departments is organized into one of three distribution groups, and students whose major lies within the scope of one group must take at least 12 credit hours of approved distribution classes in each of the other two groups, as well as completing two physical education courses as part of the LPAP (Lifetime Physical Activity Program) requirement. For students who do not pass the university's writing test (administered during the summer before matriculation), a writing class, COMM 103, becomes a requirement.

The majority of Rice's undergraduate degree programs grant B.S. or B.A. degrees. Rice has recently begun to offer minors in areas such as [[Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management|business]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonesgsm.rice.edu/jonesgsm/Rice_Undergraduate_Business_Minor_Program1.asp?SnID=2 JonesGSM.Rice.edu]{{dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; energy and water sustainability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~soci/undergrad/degree_reqs.html |title=Rice University Department of Sociology |publisher=Ruf.rice.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and global health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beyondtraditionalborders.rice.edu/programs.cfm?doc_id=9254 |title=Beyond Traditional Borders |publisher=Beyondtraditionalborders.rice.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice enrolled 3,001 undergraduates, 897 post-graduate, and 1,247 doctoral students and awarded 1,448 degrees in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Students&quot;/&gt; Women make up 48% of the undergraduate body and 35% of the professional and post-graduate student body. 51% of undergraduates and 49% of post-graduates hail from Texas but the student body also represented all 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], two [[Incorporated territory#Classification of current U.S. territories|U.S. Territories]], and 83 foreign countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Students&quot;/&gt; 

12,393 applications for undergraduate admission were received for the class of 2014 (Fall 2010), 2,639 were admitted (21%), and 949 enrolled (36%).&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Students&quot;/&gt; In the class of 2014, 72% of ranked freshmen graduated in the top 5% of their high school class, and the inter-quartile range for [[SAT]] was 650-750 for reading and 690-790 for math.&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Students&quot;/&gt; 97% of freshmen re-enrolled the subsequent year and 77% of students graduate in 4 years and 90% graduate in 6 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=Rice+University&amp;s=all&amp;id=227757 |title=College Navigator - Rice University |publisher=National Center for Educational Statistics, U.S. Department of Education |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With tuition of $33,120 for the 2010-2011 school year, Rice awarded $55.8 million in financial aid and 2,139 (71.2%) of undergraduates received some sort of aid.&lt;ref name=&quot;RF-Students&quot;/&gt;

===Honor Code===
&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 16.5em; text-align: right; font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; background:#fff; text-align:left; padding:1em; text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;'''HONOR PLEDGE'''&lt;/div&gt;
On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this (examination, quiz or paper).
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The Rice Honor Code plays a central role in academic affairs. All Rice exams are unproctored and professors give timed, closed-book exams that students take home and complete at their own convenience. Potential infractions are reported to the student Honor Council, elected by popular vote. The penalty structure is established every year by Council consensus; typically, penalties have ranged from a letter of reprimand to an 'F' in the course and a two semester suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://honor.rice.edu | title=Rice Honor Council |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Orientation Week, students must take and pass a test demonstrating that they understand the Honor System's requirements and sign a Matriculation Pledge. On assignments, students affirm their commitment to the Honor Code by writing ''On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this (examination, quiz or paper).''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

==Student life==
[[Image:Rice University - Arboretum.JPG|thumb|left|250px|A view along the inner loop, with three of the university service personnel's traditional golf carts in view (service personnel are colloquially referred to on campus as &quot;gnomes,&quot; pronounced as &quot;ga-no-mees&quot;)]]
Situated on nearly {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in the heart of Houstonâs Museum District and across the street from the cityâs Hermann Park, Rice is a green and leafy refuge â an oasis of learning convenient to the amenities of the nationâs fourth-largest city. Rice's campus adjoins [[Hermann Park]], the [[Texas Medical Center]], and a neighborhood commercial center called [[Rice Village]]. Hermann Park includes the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], the [[Houston Zoo]], [[Miller Outdoor Theatre]] and an 18-hole municipal golf course. [[Reliant Park]], home of [[Reliant Stadium]] and the [[Astrodome]], is two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) south of the campus. Among the dozen or so museums in the [[Houston Museum District|Museum District]] is the [[Rice University Art Gallery]], open during the school year. Easy access to downtown's theater and nightlife district and to Reliant Park is provided by the Houston [[METRORail]] system, with a station adjacent to the campus's main gate.  The campus recently joined the [[Zipcar]] program with two vehicles to increase the transportation options for students and staff that need that currently don't utilize a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=11382 Zipcars offer campus a new transportation option]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residential colleges===
{{Main|Residential Colleges of Rice University}}
In 1957, Rice University implemented a [[residential college]] system, as proposed by the university's first president, [[Edgar Odell Lovett]]. The system was inspired by existing systems in place at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in England. The existing residences known as East, South, West, and Wiess Halls became Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess Colleges, respectively.

Although each college is composed of a full cross-section of students at Rice, they have over time developed their own traditions and &quot;personalities&quot;. When students [[matriculation|matriculate]] they are randomly assigned to one of the eleven colleges, although &quot;legacy&quot; exceptions are made for students whose siblings or other close relatives have attended Rice. Students generally remain members of the college that they are assigned to for the duration of their undergraduate careers, even if they move off-campus at any point. Students are guaranteed on-campus housing for freshman year and two of the next three years; each college has its own system for determining allocation of the remaining spaces, collectively known as &quot;Room Jacking&quot;. Students develop strong loyalties to their college and maintain friendly rivalry with other colleges, especially during events such as [[#Beer Bike Race|Beer Bike Race]] and [[Orientation week|O-Week]]. Colleges keep their rivalries alive by performing &quot;jacks,&quot; or pranks, on each other, especially during O-Week and [[#Beer Bike Race|Willy Week]]. During Matriculation, Commencement, and other formal academic ceremonies, the colleges process in the order in which they were established.

===Traditions===
====Baker 13====

The Baker 13 is a tradition in which students run around campus wearing nothing but shoes and [[shaving cream]] at 10 p.m. on the 13th and the 31st of every month (the 26th on months with fewer than 31 days). The event, long sponsored by [[Baker College (Rice University)|Baker College]], usually attracts a small number of students, but on [[Halloween]] night and the first and last relevant days of the school year both attract large numbers of revelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rice undergrads share a sense of community |publisher=Houston Chronicle |last=Garza |first=Cynthia Leonor |date=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beer Bike Race====
According to the official website, http://rpc.rice.edu/beerbike/:
&quot;Beer Bike is a combination intramural bicycle race and drinking competition dating back to 1957. Ten riders and ten chuggers make up a team.  Elaborate rules include details such as a prohibition of &quot;bulky or wet clothing articles designed to absorb beer/water or prevent spilled beer/water from being seen&quot; and regulations for chug can design. Each residential college as well as the Graduate Student Association participates with a men's team, a women's team, and alumni (co-ed) team. Each leg of the race is a relay in which a team's &quot;chugger&quot; must chug {{convert|24|USfloz|ml}} of beer or water for the men's division and {{convert|12|USfloz|ml}} for women before the team's &quot;rider&quot; may begin to ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beer Bike's 50th bash lets good time roll at Rice: tradition that began in 1957 now integral part of school's social scene |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=April 14, 2007 |last=Viren |first=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who both ride and chug are referred to as &quot;Ironmen&quot;.  Willy Week is a term coined in the 1990s to refer to the week preceding Beer-Bike, a time of general energy and excitement on campus. Jacks (pranks) are especially common during Willy Week; some examples in the past include removing showerheads and encasing the Hanszen guardian.&quot;
The morning of the Beer Bike race itself begins with what is by some estimations the largest annual water balloon fight in the world.  Beer-Bike is Rice's most prominent student event, and for younger alumni it serves as an unofficial reunion weekend on par with Homecoming.  The 2009 Beer Bike race was dedicated to the memory of [[William L. Wilson (Rice University)|Dr. Bill Wilson]], a popular professor and long-time resident associate who died earlier that year.

One of the goals of the Residential colleges is to &quot;Sweep&quot; Beer Bike (To win all three races). This has been achieved by one of the eleven colleges. Will Rice College first swept in 1983, then again in 1986, then in 1999, and most recently in 2009. No other college has managed the feat thus far.

===Campus institutions===
A number of on-campus institutions form an integral part of student life at Rice. Many of these organizations have been operating for several decades.

====Rice Coffeehouse====
Rice Coffeehouse finds its beginnings in Hanszen College, where students would serve coffee in the Weenie Loft - a study room in the old section's fourth floor. Later, the coffee house moved to the Hanszen basement to accommodate more student patrons. That coffeehouse became known as Breadsticks and Pomegranates. Due to flooding, an unfortunate effect of 1) its location in the basement and 2) the Houston climate, this coffee house closed. Demand for an on-campus Coffeehouse grew and in 1990, the Rice Coffeehouse was founded.

The Rice Coffeehouse is a not-for-profit student-run organization serving Rice University and the greater Houston community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Rice Thresher |title=Coffeehouse: 16 Years of Providing Rice with Society's Most Acceptable Drug |date=November 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past few years,{{when|date=October 2010}} it has introduced fair-trade and organic coffee and loose-leaf teas.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Coffeehouse baristas are referred to as K.O.C.'s, or Keepers of the Coffee. Rice Coffeehouse has also adopted an unofficial mascot, the squirrel, which can be found on t-shirts, mugs, and bumper stickers stuck on laptops across campus. The logo pays tribute to Rice's unusually plump and frighteningly tame squirrel population.

====Valhalla====
Valhalla is a non-profit graduate student pub located under Keck Hall which serves as the social nexus for graduate student life at Rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=4477 |title=Valhalla: Mythical Beings and Cheap Beer  |publisher=Rice News &amp; Media |last=Kaplan |first=David |date=January 23, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides the graduate student community and the Rice community as a whole with a family-friendly place to unwind and relax after a long work day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-09-26/best-of-houston/best-bar-for-kids/ |title=Houston - Best Of - Best Bar for Kids - (2002) |publisher=The Houston Press |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comfortable place for graduate students to relax and relate on the woes of graduate research.  Additionally, Valhalla plays a pivotal role in many campus traditions including the Baker 13 and Beer Bike.

It was founded in 1970, but did not get an alcohol license until 1971. The management and all shifts are staffed by graduate students, faculty, staff, and other volunteers, which helps keep prices affordable for the target graduate student clientele. The pub's patrons have expanded beyond graduate students and other members of the local community in recent years, and the pub has become a regular on the annual &quot;Best of Houston&quot; published by the ''[[Houston Press]]'', being named the &quot;Best Place to Meet Single Women&quot; in 2004 due to the frequency of intelligent conversation and smart, single women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/bestof/2004/award/best-place-to-meet-single-women-31641/ |title=Houston - Best Of - Best Place to Meet Single Women - (2004) |publisher=The Houston Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Willy's Pub====
Willy's Pub is Rice's undergraduate pub run by students located in the basement of the Rice Memorial Center.  It opened on April 11, 1975, with Rice President Norman Hackerman pouring the first beer.  The name was chosen by students in tribute to the university's founder, [[William Marsh Rice]]. After the drinking age in Texas was raised in 1986, the pub entered a period of financial difficulties and in April 1995, was destroyed in a fire. The space was gutted but renovated and remains open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~willypub/ |title=Willy's Pub |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rice.edu/projects/thresher/issues/82/950421/News/Story12.html |title=Willy's Pub, 1975 - 1995 |publisher=The Thresher Online |date=April 21, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student-run media====
Rice has a weekly [[student newspaper]] (''[[Rice Thresher|The Rice Thresher]]''), [[college radio]] station ([[Rice Radio]]), and campus-wide [[student television station]] (RTV5). All three are based out of the RMC student center. In addition, Rice hosts several student magazines dedicated to a range of different topics; in fact, the spring semester of 2008 saw the birth of two such magazines, a literary sex journal called ''Open'' and an undergraduate science research magazine entitled ''Catalyst''.

[[Rice Thresher|The Rice Thresher]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ricethresher.org The Rice Thresher]&lt;/ref&gt; is published every Friday and is ranked by Princeton Review as one of the top campus newspapers nationally for student readership. It is distributed around campus, and at a few other local businesses and has a website on the [[College Publisher]] network. The Thresher has a small, dedicated staff and is known for its coverage of campus news, open submission opinion page, and the satirical Backpage, which has often been the center of controversy. The newspaper has won several awards at Associated Collegiate Press conferences.

[[Rice Radio]] is the student-run radio station. Though most DJs are Rice students, anyone is allowed to apply. It is known for playing genres and artists of music and sound unavailable on other radio stations in Houston, and often, the US.  The station takes requests over the phone or online. In 2000 and 2006, Rice Radio won Houston Press' Best Radio Station in Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houston-press.com/2000-09-21/best-of-houston/best-radio-station/ |title=Houston Best of Houston - Best Radio Station - page 1 |publisher=Houston-press.com |date=2000-09-21 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestof.houstonpress.com/bestof/section.php?section=oid:28912&amp;year=2006 |title=Houston - Best of Houston - Houston |publisher=Bestof.houstonpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Rice alum and active Rice Radio DJ DL's hip-hip show won Houston Press' Best Hip-hop Radio Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houston-press.com/2003-09-25/best-of-houston/best-hip-hop-radio-show/ |title=Houston Best of Houston - Best Hip-hop Radio Show - page 1 |publisher=Houston-press.com |date=2003-09-25 |accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Rice University had been in negotiations to sell the station's broadcast tower, FM frequency and license to the [[University of Houston System]] to become a full-time [[classical music]] and fine arts programming station. The new station, [[KUHA]], would be operated as a not-for-profit outlet with listener supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;sale1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeannie |last=Kever |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |title=UH System board considers plan to buy Rice radio station |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7156105.html |date=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCC approved the sale and granted the transfer of license to the University of Houston System on April 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FCC|title=Correspondence for KTRU|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=25488|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

RTV5 is a student run television network available as channel 5 on campus. RTV5 was created initially as Rice Broadcast Television in 1997; RBT began to broadcast the following year in 1998, and aired its first live show across campus in 1999. It experienced much growth and exposure over the years with successful programs like &quot;Drinking with Phil,&quot; a weekly news show, and extensive live coverage in December 2000 of the shut down of Rice Radio by the administration. In spring 2001, the Rice undergraduate community voted in the general elections to support RBT as a blanket tax organization, effectively providing a yearly income of $10,000 to purchase new equipment and provide the campus with a variety of new programming. In the spring of 2005, RBT members decided the station needed a new image and a new name: Rice Television 5. The station has recently set about revitalizing its staff roster and campus image; one of RTV5's most popular shows is the 24 hour show, where a camera and couch placed in the RMC stay on air for 24 hours. One such show is held in fall and another in spring, usually during a weekend allocated for visits by prospective students. RTV5 has a video on demand site at rtv5.rice.edu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtv5.rice.edu/watch RTV5 - Rice Student Television&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], rtv5.rice.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rice Review'', also known as R2, is a yearly student-run literary journal at Rice University that publishes prose, poetry, and creative nonfiction written by undergraduate students, as well as interviews. The journal was founded in 2004 by creative writing professor and author [[Justin Cronin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://r2mag.rice.edu/r2.cfm R2 The Rice Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], r2mag.rice.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Rice Standard'' is an independent, student-run variety magazine modeled after such publications as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Harper's''. Prior to fall 2009, it was regularly published three times a semester with a wide array of content, running from analyses of current events and philosophical pieces to personal essays, short fiction and poetry. In August 2009, the ''Standard'' transitioned to a completely online format with the launch of their redesigned website, ricestandard.org. The first website of its kind on Rice's campus, the ''Standard'' now features blog-style content written by and for Rice students. ''The Rice Standard'' has around 20 regular contributors, and the site features new content every day (including holidays). 

''Open'', a magazine dedicated to &quot;literary sex content,&quot; predictably caused a stir on campus with its initial publication in spring 2008. A mixture of essays, editorials, stories and artistic photography brought Open attention both on campus and in the [[Houston Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/5740119.html Rice sex magazine makes its virgin launch], chron.com&lt;/ref&gt; The third annual edition of ''Open'' was released in spring of 2010.

==Athletics==
{{Main|Rice Owls}}
[[Image:Rice University Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rice Stadium]]
Rice participates in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics and is part of [[Conference USA]]. Rice was a member of the [[Western Athletic Conference]] before joining Conference USA in 2005. Rice is the second-smallest school, measured by undergraduate enrollment, competing in NCAA [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] [[American football|football]], only slightly ahead of [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]].

The [[Rice Owls baseball|Rice baseball team]] won the [[2003 College World Series]], defeating [[Stanford University|Stanford]], giving Rice its only national championship in a team sport. The victory made Rice University the smallest school in 51 years to win a national championship at the highest collegiate level of the sport.  The Rice baseball team has played on campus at [[Reckling Park]] since the 2000 season. As of 2010, the baseball team has won 14 consecutive conference championships in three different conferences: the final championship of the defunct [[Southwest Conference]], all nine championships while a member of the [[Western Athletic Conference]], and five more championships in its first five years as a member of [[Conference USA]]. Additionally, Rice's baseball team has finished third in both the [[2006 College World Series|2006]] and [[2007 College World Series]] tournaments. Rice now has made six trips to Omaha for the CWS. In 2004, Rice became the first school ever to have three players selected in the first eight picks of the [[MLB draft]] when [[Philip Humber]], [[Jeff Niemann]], and [[Wade Townsend]] were selected third, fourth, and eighth, respectively. In 2007, [[Joe Savery]] was selected as the 19th overall pick.

In 2006, the football team qualified for its first bowl game since 1961, ending the second-longest bowl drought in the country at the time.  On December 22, 2006, Rice played in the [[New Orleans Bowl]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] against the [[Sun Belt Conference]] champion, Troy. The Owls lost 41-17. The bowl appearance came after Rice had a 14-game losing streak from 2004â05 and went 1-10 in 2005. The streak followed an internally authorized 2003 McKinsey report that stated football alone was responsible for a $4 million deficit in 2002. Tensions remain high between the athletic department and faculty, as a few professors who chose to voice their opinion were in favor of abandoning the football program. Hired in January 2006, new head coach Todd Graham sparked the &quot;Rice Renaissance,&quot; the revival of the Owl football program. [[David Bailiff]] replaced Graham and inherits a team poised to continue the success enjoyed in 2006. Sophomore wide receiver [[Jarett Dillard]] set an NCAA record in 2006 by catching a touchdown pass in 13 consecutive games and took a 15-game overall streak into the 2007 season. Rice Stadium also serves as the performance venue for the university's [[Marching Owl Band]], or &quot;MOB.&quot; Despite its name, the MOB is a [[scatter band]] that focuses on performing humorous skits and routines rather than traditional formation marching.

In 2008, the football team posted a 9-3 regular season, capping off the year with a 38-14 victory over Western Michigan University in the Texas Bowl.  The win over Western Michigan marked the Owls' first bowl win in 45 years.

[[Rice Owls men's basketball]] won 10 conference titles in the former Southwest Conference (1918, 1935*, 1940, 1942*, 1943*, 1944*, 1945, 1949*, 1954*, 1970; * denotes shared title). Most recently, guard Morris Almond was drafted in the first round of the [[2007 NBA Draft]] by the [[Utah Jazz]].  Rice recently named former [[Cal Bears]] head coach [[Ben Braun]] as head basketball coach to succeed Willis Wilson, fired after Rice finished the 2007-2008 season with a winless (0-16) conference record and overall record of 3-27.

Rice has been very successful in women's sports in recent years. In 2004-05, Rice sent its women's volleyball, soccer, and basketball teams to their respective NCAA tournaments. In 2005-06, the women's soccer, basketball, and tennis teams advanced, with five individuals competing in track and field.  In 2006-07, the Rice women's basketball team made the NCAA tournament, while again five Rice track and field athletes received individual NCAA berths. In 2008, the women's volleyball team again made the NCAA tournament. In 2011 the Women's Swim team won their first conference championship in the history of the university. This was an impressive feat considering they won without having a diving team.

Rice's mascot is [[Sammy the Owl]].  In previous decades, the university kept several live owls on campus in front of [[Lovett College]], but this practice has been discontinued.

Rice also has a 12-member coed cheerleading squad and an all-female dance team, both of which perform at football and basketball games throughout the year.
