'''Coming out''' (of the [[Closeted|closet]]) is a [[figure of speech]] for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people's disclosure of their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]].

Framed and debated as a [[privacy]] issue, coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coming Out: A Journey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[decision-making]] or [[Risk|risk-taking]]; a strategy or plan; a mass or public event; a [[speech act]] and a matter of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]; a [[rite of passage]]; [[liberty|liberation]] or [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]]; an [[ordeal]];&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/gaa-star-donal-og-cusack-teammates-helped-me-through-ordeal-of-revealing-i-am-gay-14536491.html&lt;/ref&gt; a means toward feeling [[gay pride]] instead of [[shame]] and [[social stigma]]; or even career suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/&lt;/ref&gt; Author Steven Seidman writes that &quot;it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal, social, and political drama in twentieth-century America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Steven (2003). Beyond the Closet; The Transformation of Gay and Lesbian Life. Page 25. ISBN 0-415-93207-6&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coming out of the closet'' is the source of other [[gay slang]] expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. [[Outing]] is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT personâs sexual orientation or gender identity, without his or her consent. By extension, outing ''oneself'' is unintentional LGBT ''self''-disclosure. Lastly, LGBT people labelled as [[closeted]] have yet to come out or have opted not to do so.

== History ==
{{See|Timeline of LGBT history}}
[[Image:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs.jpg|thumb|19th century LGBT rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of coming out as a means of emancipation]]

In 1869, one hundred years before the [[Stonewall Riots]], the German homosexual rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of self-disclosure as a means of [[emancipation]]. Claiming that invisibility was a major obstacle toward changing [[public opinion]], he urged homosexual people to reveal their same-sex attractions. In his 1906 work, ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'' (''The Sexual Life of Our Time in its Relation to Modern Civilization''),&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Ivan. ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur, 1906. English translation: ''The Sexual Life of Our Time in Its Relations to Modern Civilization'', 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iwan Bloch]], a German-Jewish physician, entreated elderly homosexuals to self-disclose to their family members and acquaintances. Years later, [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] revisited the topic in his major work ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'' (1914), discussing the social and legal potentials of several thousand homosexual men and women of rank revealing their sexual orientation to the police in order to influence legislators and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson&amp;Percy, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality was the poet [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine ''Politics'', he claimed that homosexuals were an oppressed minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 &quot;Robert Duncan and Romantic Synthesis: A Few Notes&quot;]. This article also republished as &quot;On Robert Duncan&quot; at Modern American Poetry website&lt;/ref&gt; The decidedly clandestine [[Mattachine Society]], founded by [[Harry Hay]] and other veterans of the [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace for President]] campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953, with many gays emerging from the closet.

In the 1960s, [[Frank Kameny]] came to the forefront of the struggle. Having been fired from his job as an astronomer for the Army Map service for homosexual behavior, Kameny refused to go quietly. He openly fought his dismissal, eventually appealing it all the way to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. As a vocal leader of the growing movement, Kameny argued for unapologetic public actions. The cornerstone of his conviction was that, &quot;we must instill in the [[LGBT community|homosexual community]] a sense of worth to the individual homosexual,&quot; which could only be achieved through campaigns openly led by homosexuals themselves. His motto was &quot;Gay is good.&quot; In 1961, [[Donald Webster Cory]]&lt;ref name=sagarin&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html Donald Webster Cory] on [[glbtq.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |title=Sagarin bio |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=1913-09-18 |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; published his landmark ''The Homosexual in America'', exclaiming, &quot;Society has handed me a mask to wear...Everywhere I go, at all times and before all sections of society, I pretend.&quot; Cory was a pseudonym, but his frank and openly subjective descriptions served as a stimulus to the emerging homosexual self-awareness and the nascent [[homophile]] movement. With the spread of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the [[gay liberation]] movement to raise [[political consciousness]] to counter heterosexism and homophobia. At the same time and continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian [[social support]] discussion groups, some of which were called âcoming-out groups,â focused on sharing coming-out âstoriesâ (experiences) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBT visibility and [[Gay pride|pride]].

== Sociolinguistic origin ==
The present-day expression &quot;coming out&quot; is understood to have originated in the early 20th century from an [[analogy]] that likens homosexualsâ introduction into [[gay subculture]] to a [[dÃ©butante]]âs ''coming-out party.'' This is a celebration for a young [[upper-class]] woman who is making her dÃ©but&amp;nbsp;â her formal presentation to society&amp;nbsp;â because she has reached adult age or has become eligible for marriage. As historian [[George Chauncey]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Gay people in the pre-war years [pre-WWI]... did not speak of coming out of what we call the gay closet but rather of coming out ''into'' what they called homosexual society or the gay world, a world neither so small, nor so isolated, nor... so hidden as closet implies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chauncey, George (1994). ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890â1940''. New York: Basic Books, emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In fact, as Elizabeth Kennedy observes, &quot;using the term 'closet' to refer to&quot; previous times such as &quot;the 1920s and 1930s might be [[anachronism|anachronistic]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Elizabeth. &quot;'But We Would Never Talk about It': The Structure of Lesbian Discretion in South Dakota, 1928â1933&quot; in ''Inventing Lesbian Cultures in America'', ed. Ellen Lewin (1996). Boston: Beacon Press. p.25 and 214&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on coming out&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html Coming Out, accessed on Aug 31, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; in the online encyclopedia [[glbtq.com]] states that [[sexologist]] Dr. [[Evelyn Hooker]]âs observations introduced the use of &quot;coming out&quot; to the academic community in the 1950s. The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent shift in [[connotation]] occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on ''entrance'' into &quot;a new world of hope and communal solidarity&quot; whereas the post-[[Stonewall Riots]] overtone was an ''exit'' from the oppression of the closet.&lt;ref name=&quot;glbtq.com&quot;/&gt; This change in focus suggests that &quot;coming out ''of the closet''&quot; is a [[mixed metaphor]] that joins &quot;coming out&quot; with the [[Closeted|closet]] metaphor: an evolution of &quot;[[wikt:skeleton in the closet|skeleton in the closet]]&quot; specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing oneâs homosexual or bisexual [[Sexual orientation|orientation]]. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.

== Identity issues ==
{{See also|Identity (social science)| Personal identity (philosophy)}}

When coming out is described as a gradual process or a journey,&lt;ref name=&quot;Coming Out: A Journey&quot;/&gt; it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging oneâs same-sex desires or gender identity. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imfromdriftwood.com/2010/04/07/im-from-new-york-ny-5/ Gay Epiphany]&lt;/ref&gt; is often called âcoming out to oneselfâ and constitutes the start of [[self-acceptance]]. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during [[adolescence]] or [[childhood]], when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are [[Heterosexism|assumed to be heterosexual]] or [[cisgender]], such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, &quot;the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time.&quot;

=== LGBT identity development ===

Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the [[Cass identity model]] established by Vivienne Cass. This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/09/24/gay_teens/print.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/magazine/27out-t.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Coming Out in Middle School | first=Benoit | last=Denizet-Lewis | date=2009-09-27 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transgender, transsexual, and intersex communities ===

LGBT people tend to share a feeling of relief that coming out can provide. However, the act of coming out differs for [[transgender]], [[transsexual]], and [[intersex]] people in some fundamental ways:

# By coming out, trans and intersex people disclose their [[gender identity]] and, if applicable, their decision to [[Transition (transgender)|transition]] to the [[gender role]] with which they more closely identify. For trans people, the transition is to the gender opposite their biological sex and for intersex people, to the gender opposite to the one they were assigned at birth or raised as.
# Coming out is a pre-requisite to transitioning particularly if the transition later includes undergoing [[sex-reassignment surgery]].
# For some trans people who [[Passing (gender)|pass]] and are mistaken for being [[cisgender]], coming out occults important parts of their full sense of identity or their complete gender history.
# Conversely, coming out can be viewed as inauthentic or as a self-betrayal for some trans and intersex people who have chosen to [[Passing#Stealth|live in stealth]] because the disclosure is at odds with their true gender.
# When trans or intersex people come out, it impacts how they [[Labelling|label]] their [[sexual orientation]] and how they interact with communities to which they feel they belong.
# Backlashes or other negative reactions to a transpersonâs coming out are caused by [[transphobia]] and [[sexism]], with additional [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]] in some cases.

== Legal issues ==
{{See|LGBT rights by country or territory}}

In areas of the world where homosexual acts are penalized or prohibited, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people can suffer negative legal consequences for coming out. In particular, where homosexuality is a crime, coming out may constitute [[self-incrimination|self-incriminating evidence]]. Mandated by federal law {{USPL|103|160}} ({{usc|10|654}}), the [[Military of the United States|U.S. armed forces]]â policy on homosexuality in the military, commonly known as [[Donât ask, donât tell]], prohibited coming out (&quot;a statement that a member is homosexual or bisexual&quot;) because it was considered tantamount to &quot;a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts&quot;. However, the policy was repealed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, where it was passed by a majority of 63â33, including 6 Republicans voting in favour of gays serving openly in the military. More than 13,500 service members have been discharged from the military under the 1993 law.  The repeal was enacted on September 20th, 2011, ending a nine-month period where gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members had to remain cautiously closeted after the passage of the repeal but prior to its enactment.

== Effects ==
Because LGBT people have historically been marginalized as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], coming out of the closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] of [[heterosexist]] [[discrimination]] and [[homophobic]] [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].

On the personal and relationship levels, effects of not coming out have been the subject of studies. For example, it has been found that same-sex couples who have not come out are not as satisfied in their relationships as same-sex couples who have.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2392712 Passing: impact on the quality of same-sex couple relationships.] Berger (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
Findings from another study indicate that the less people know about a lesbianâs sexual orientation, the more anxiety, less positive affectivity, and lower self-esteem she has.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9524921 Coming out for lesbian women: its relation to anxiety, positive affectivity, self-esteem, and social support] Jordan and Deluty (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, Gay.com states that closeted individuals are reported to be at increased risk for [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/05/04/1 Gay.com News], [http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache%3AEEZU_q-zA0EJ%3Awww.smartsextalk.com%2FPDF%2F0706_suicide.pdf+%22Closeted+men+at+suicide+risk%22+%22A+recent+Australian+survey+revealed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us Study: Closeted men at suicide risk] Cath Pope, ''Gay.com Australia'', May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In/out dichotomy and analysis ==
There is a social, political, personal, and linguistic opposition between being &quot;'''out'''&quot;, meaning &quot;openly gay&quot; or &quot;having come out&quot;, and being &quot;'''closeted'''&quot;, meaning having yet to come out, having decided not to do so, or not identifying as LGBT.

The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being &quot;in&quot; or being &quot;out&quot; wherein those who are &quot;in&quot; are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, philosopher and critical analyst [[Judith Butler]] (1991) states that the ''in/out'' metaphor creates a binary opposition which pretends that the closet is dark, marginal, and false and that being out in the &quot;light of illumination&quot; reveals a true (or essential) identity. Nonetheless, Butler is willing to appear at events as a lesbian and maintains that, &quot;it is possible to argue that...there remains a political imperative to use these necessary errors or [[category mistake]]s...to rally and represent an oppressed political constituency.&quot;

In addition Diana Fuss (1991) explains, &quot;the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time.&quot; Further, &quot;To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in--inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible.&quot; In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, &quot;the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance--into the closet.&quot;

== National Coming Out Day ==
{{Main|National Coming Out Day}}
[[File:Logo ncod lg.png|thumb|National Coming Out Day logo, designed by artist [[Keith Haring]].]]

Observed annually on October 11,&lt;ref name=&quot;HRC_NCOD&quot;&gt;{{cite web   | title = History of National Coming Out Day   | publisher = Human Rights Campaign   | date =   | url = http://www.hrc.org/issues/3338.htm   | doi =   | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; by members of the [[LGBT community|LGBT communities]] and their [[Straight ally|straight allies]], National Coming Out Day is a civil [[Raising awareness|awareness]] day for coming out and discussing LGBT issues among the general populace in an effort to give a familiar face to the [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights movement]]. This day was the inspiration for holding [[LGBT History Month]] in the United States in October. The day was founded in 1988, by Dr. Robert Eichberg, his partner William Gamble, and [[Jean O'Leary]] to celebrate the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] one year earlier, in which 500,000 people marched on [[Washington, DC]], United States, for gay and lesbian equality. In the United States, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of [[LGBT parenting|LGBT families]] living honest and open lives. [[Candace Gingrich]] became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. Although still named &quot;''National'' Coming Out Day&quot;, it is observed in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland also on October 11, and in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] on 12 October. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on October 11, 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: ''[[Being Out Rocks]]''. Participating artists include [[Kevin Aviance]], [[Janis Ian]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

==== Artists and entertainers ====
In 1997 on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], actress [[Ellen DeGeneres]] came out as a lesbian.

In 1996 the acclaimed British film ''[[Beautiful Thing]]'' had a more positive take in its depiction of two teenage boys coming to terms with their sexual identity. An episode of a popular [[Quebec]] television series ''[[L'Amour avec un Grand A]]'' called ''[[Lise, Pierre et Marcel]]'' focuses on the life of a homosexual man who is married and reveals to his wife and kids that he is attracted to another man. In the [[Emmy Award]]-nominated episode &quot;[[Gay Witch Hunt]]&quot; of ''[[The Office (U.S.)|The Office]]'', Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the whole office.

In 1999, [[Russell T Davies]]'s [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|''Queer as Folk'']], a popular TV series shown on Channel 4 (UK) debuted and focused primarily on the lives of young gay men; in particular on a 15-year-old going through the processes of revealing his sexuality to those around him. This storyline was also featured prominently in the U.S. version of ''Queer As Folk'', which debuted in 2000.

The television show ''[[The L Word]]'', which debuted in 2004, focuses on the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women, and the theme of coming out is prominently featured in the storylines of multiple characters.

== &quot;Coming out&quot; applied to non-LGBT contexts ==
In political, casual, or even humorous contexts, &quot;coming out&quot; means by extension the self-disclosure of a person's secret behaviors, beliefs, affiliations, tastes, and interests that may cause astonishment or bring [[shame]]. Some examples include: &quot;coming out as an alcoholic&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |title=The show must go on |publisher=Guardian |date= 2001-11-03|accessdate=2009-06-24 | location=London | first=Louis | last=Theroux}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;coming out as a conservative&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm Coming-out day for conservatives]{{Dead link|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;coming out as [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2multiples.com/compd/ |title=COMPD&amp;nbsp;â Introduction |publisher=2multiples.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;coming out of the broom closet&quot; (as a [[witchcraft|witch]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=How do I tell my family I'm a Wiccan? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2003-12-04 |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;coming out about plastic surgery&quot;.

With its associated metaphors, the figure of speech has also been extended to [[atheism]], e.g., &quot;coming out as an atheist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2007/09/27/News/U.s-Rep.Pete.Stark.comes.Out.As.An.Atheist-3000553.shtml |title=U.S. Rep. Pete Stark &quot;Comes Out&quot; as an Atheist |publisher=''[[Harvard Law Record]]'' |date= |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A public awareness initiative for [[freethought]] and [[atheism]], entitled the &quot;[[Out Campaign]]&quot;, makes ample use of the &quot;out&quot; metaphor.&lt;ref name=&quot;rd-out-annouce&quot;&gt;{{cite web
