'''Kim Hee-chul''' (born July 10, 1983), sometimes [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] credited as '''Heechul''', is a [[Korean people|Korean]] [[pop singer]], [[actor]], [[presenter]], [[disc jockey]] and a member of [[boy band]] [[Super Junior]].

==Career==
===Pre debut===
Kim was discovered at Starlight Casting System October 2002 where he auditioned with his friends. Initially, Kim was placed in a four-member project group called, &quot;Four Seasons&quot;. This group included members [[Jaejoong]], [[Yunho]], and [[Kangin]]. The prospective group never debuted as Jaejoong and Yunho joined boy band [[TVXQ]], which debuted in December 2003. Kim and [[Kangin]] were then placed in Super Junior along with ten other trainees under the same company. This group debuted two years later on November 6, 2005 under the name ''Super Junior 05'', the first generation of Super Junior. The initial plan for this group was to continuously cycle members in and then fazed them out into other projects. 

Other activities before his debut include modeling, acting, and VJing. He made his first appearance on TV starring in the teen drama âBanolim 2â. Like bandmate [[Kibum]], Kim made his first television appearance as an actor before the debut of Super Junior. He starred in the 2005 [[teen drama]], ''[[Sharp 2]],'' in which he acted alongside Kibum. Not long afterwards, Kim appeared in an episode of ''[[Loveholic (TV series)|Loveholic]]'' as a chef trainee.

===2005-2006: Super Junior and acting===
On November 6, 2005, Kim officially debuted as part of Super Junior 05 on SBS' ''[[Inkigayo]]'', performing the group's first single âTWINS (Knock Out)â. The group was supposed to comprise the first generation of Super Junior. In early 2006, SM Entertainment was beginning to recruit new members for the next Super Junior generation, Super Junior 06, where Kim would still be an undergraduate member. However, plans changed. The company decided to add a thirteenth member, [[Kyuhyun]], and declared a halt in forming future Super Junior generations. The group dropped the suffix â05â³ and became officially credited as Super Junior. 

The re-polished group hit it big after it released the first CD single âUâ the following summer in 2006. &quot;U&quot; became Super Juniorâs most successful single in the music charts until the release of âSorry, Sorryâ in March 2009. However, setbacks occurred for the promotions of âUâ in the later half of the year when Kim suffered a major injury from a car accident that occurred on August 10, 2006.

After the debut of Super Junior, he teamed with Kibum again to star in the sixth season of ''[[Nonstop (TV series)|Nonstop]]'', alternatively known as ''Rainbow Romance''. In 2006, he starred as the supporting character Gong Min in ''[[Bad Family (TV series)|Bad Family]]''. In 2007, he starred in the popular family drama ''[[Golden Bride]]'' as Kim Young-soo. Kim also appeared on variety shows such as ''Vitamin'', ''Sponge'', ''Xman'' and ''Love Letter''.

He hosted his own radio show, ''SBS Power FM Youngstreet'' along with Park Heebon, but the program ended in mid-2006.

===2007-2009: Super Junior-T and Sorry, Sorry===
In 2007, Kim became part of a Super Junior sub-group, [[Super Junior-T]], which debuted on February 23, 2007 with the [[Trot]] &quot;Teuroteu&quot; single &quot;[[Rokuko]]!!!&quot; (65 ë¡ê¾¸ê±°; [RoKuGo (backwards) spelled backwards]).  Kim participated in Super Junior's second album ''[[Don't Don]]'', the band's âSuper Showâ tour, and filmed Super Junior's first movie ''[[Attack on the Pin-Up Boys]]''. 

Kim began hosting before his music debut. He was a regular [[MC]] for the cable music show ''Show! Music Tank''. He was also a substitute MC for Andy of [[Shinhwa]] on SBS ''Inki Gayo'' on numerous occasions. Heechul also became a permanent host for SBS ''Inki Gayo'' with Korean actor Jang Geun Suk on February 25, 2007. 

In 2008, he was active in Super Junior's activities: the visit to Japan, their second photobook ''Boys at City Season 2'' (shot in Tokyo) and the ''Super Show Encore'' concert. From September 9 to November 9, 2008, Kim and Kangin starred in the Korean version of the musical ''[[Xanadu]]'', sharing the lead role of Sonny. Auditions and casting picks were done via a  [[reality television]] (''To Be Kangin and Heechul''), which also served to promote the musical.&lt;ref name=&quot;musical&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Lee Hyunwoo | title=SuJu Kim Heechul-Kangin preparing to transform into musical actors in &quot;Xanadu&quot; | date=2008-05-12 | work=Newsen | pages=1 | url=http://media.paran.com/snews/newsview2.php?dirnews=1155314&amp;year=2008 | accessdate=2008-06-18 | language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car accident==
On August 10, 2006, Heechul was involved in a car accident while heading back to Seoul from [[Mokpo]] after attending the funeral of fellow Super Junior member [[Lee Donghae|Donghae]]âs father. The tires malfunctioned while his car attempted to switch lanes. Heechul fractured his left leg in five places, including his femur, knee, and ankle, requiring him to be in surgery for six hours. He also sustained other injuries, including a tear in his tongue which required stitches.  

Heechul was advised to stop all activities for a period of twelve weeks. He was released from the hospital on September 13, 2006 but he continued to receive out-patient care. He returned to the hospital to have a second surgery to remove some of the iron rods in his leg on October 10 and briefly returned to work in late October to film the final three episodes of an MBC youth sitcom while still in a cast and on a wheelchair. He made his comeback on November 25 of the same year during the Mnet KM Music Festival (MKMF) Awards but it was only in late December that Heechul officially returned to individual activities such as variety show appearances and hosting appearances.

In 2007, Heechul started to perform regularly despite still having a few rods that the doctors had attached to his leg. In late April and May 2007, he had recovered enough to be able to take part in Super Junior's strenuous dance routines. The remaining rods in his leg were removed in 2008.
